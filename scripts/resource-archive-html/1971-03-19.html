<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is of the

opinion  that  our present effort in building  more

and  better facilities for pedestrians crossing the

roads   is  a  more  positive  approach  than   the

legislation    against   jaywalking    pedestrians.

Overhead  bridges, zebra crossings and underpasses,

for  example,  go  a long way to  help  pedestrians

cross  the road safely and, in most cases, it would

appear  that  they  do make use of  the  facilities

provided. However, the Ministry is keeping a  close

watch  on  the  situation to ensure  that  overhead

bridges,  zebra crossings, etc., are not  built  in

vain.  If subsequent reports indicate that  we  are

not  successful  in persuading the  pedestrians  to

make  the  best use of the facilities provided  for

crossing the roads. Consideration will be given  to

introduce  legislation to compel the  use  of  such

facilities by pedestrians.

Education  what are the criteria for the allocation

of places to stallholders in school tuckshops.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  basic principle  is  that  the

school children should get the best nourishment and

value  for  the money they spend. The criteria  for

the  allocation of places to stallholders in school

tuckshops   are   contained  in   the   regulations

governing the management of school tuckshops.  They

are  based roughly on the following considerations.

First,  they  must  be Singapore citizens.  Second,

ability  to prepare well the food to be sold,  give

good  service, observe high hygienic standards  and

conduct  business in person. Third,  the  financial

position.  We  usually  give  preference  to  those

receiving  social aid. Fourth, preference  will  be

given to those residing nearest to the school.

can  the Minister of State tell us how his Ministry

manage  to do all the things that he has mentioned?

Do they have people who are connoisseurs of food to

ensure  that  the  best food  is  provided  at  the

cheapest  cost,  or  is the work  undertaken  by  a

committee  consisting  of  people  who  have   been

principal  and teachers and the standing  committee

if it is appointed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for

Finance if he will take steps to curb increases  in

the prices of daily necessities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  question of the increase in  prices  was

thoroughly aired by Members and adequately answered

by  the  Minister  for Finance  during  the  budget

debate two days ago, on the 17th of this month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is keenly interested in stable

prices  and will do everything within its power  to

see  that there is no unwarranted increase  in  the

price   of   any   goods,   especially   of   daily

necessities. But there are limitations to  what  we

can  do. This is because we are an open economy and

we  import  most of our goods which are, therefore,

subject to fluctuations in world prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that daily necessities mean food,

housing  and  clothing. Let us examine these  three

broad groups to find out whether there is any  rise

in their prices and the reasons for such rise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On food, we are self-sufficient only in pork,

poultry  and eggs; the rest of our foodstuffs  like

rice,  sugar, fish, fresh vegetables, are imported.

The  price of sugar was recently increased by three

cents  per  kati,  but this was because  the  world

price  of  raw sugar went up sharply ---  something

over  which we have no control. There has, however,

been  a fall in the price of rice recently by  some

five  cents a kati. The statistics gathered by  the

Statistics  Department indicate that 100  per  cent

Siam  rice was, on the average, 41 cents a kati  in

January  1970  and  was only 36  cents  a  kati  in

January this year. Because rice forms a large  part

of  Our budget on foodstuffs, the fall in the price

of  rice should more than outweigh the rise in  the

price of sugar and some other items like bread.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, foodstuffs are also subject to

seasonal  fluctuations, especially items like  fish

and  fresh  vegetables.  The  statistics  seem   to

indicate  that there is always a rise in the  price

of foodstuffs at the beginning of the year but that

the price will go back to normal towards the middle

of  the  year.  This  may  be  because  of  festive

seasons,  like the Chinese New Year and  Han  Raya,

which normally occur at the beginning of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On housing, the statistics collected by the

Statistics  Department  show  an  increase  of  1.4

points   in  1970  over  1969.  This  increase   is

attributed  to  increases in the  Public  Utilities

Board  charges and the tax on P.U.B, bills.  There

is,  of  course, a very sharp rise in  rentals  for

middle-class property. But this should  not  affect

the  working class who are well looked after by the

Housing and Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the clothing group, the increase is really

very  slight  and has occurred in  the  sectors  of

clothing  material  and made-up garments.  A  large

portion of these two items is still imported and as

long as the sophisticated consumers here still have

a  preference  for imported materials  and  made-up

garments  over the locally-manufactured ones,  then

they must be ready to pay more for them in view  of

the customs duty imposed on them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that if we continue to run an

efficient  port  and  the  ancillary  services  and

maintain  a  highly  competitive  market  with  the

absence of monopolies, we will continue to buy  the

best goods at the cheapest possible price from  any

part of the world and thus keep to the very minimum

any possible increase in the cost of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, we have been able, in spite of our open

economy, and in spite of the rising trend in  world

prices,  to  keep  our  cost of  living  relatively

stable. Our Consumer Price Index showed that  there

was only a 0.4 point increase in 1970 over 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For comparative purposes, I have handed out a

table* containing a cost-of-living index  compiled

by the United Nations on eight countries. It may be

interesting  for Members to note that the  cost  of

living  in  Singapore has risen only 8.5 points  in

seven  years, from 100 points in 1963, as the  base

year,  to  108.5  in July 1970. And  of  the  eight

countries shown, Singapore has the lowest  rate  of

increase.  The next lowest increase, for Australia,

is 23.5 points.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  can  the Minister of State inform this  House

what  steps did his Ministry take when the  Bakers'

Association recently decided to increase the  price

of  bread when the price of the basic commodity for

bread, that is, flour, did not go up?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I can inform the Member that

the Trade Division of the Ministry of Finance had a

discussion with the Association of Bakers, and from

information supplied to the Trade Division. It  was

shown  that there had been a rise in the  price  of

flour  in the sense that the rebate for wholesalers

was  withdrawn  with effect from the  beginning  of

this month.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,

the Minister of State for Finance has mentioned the

increase  in  the  cost  of  living  in  Australia,

Canada, France, Hong Kong and some other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



places.  However, can he tell us how  much  is  the

increase in the salaries in those countries?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I have no idea about that,

Sir. Perhaps the Member could quote some statistics

on  this point and then we could have a comparison.

But  if  the Member wants statistics, I am prepared

to collect them and send them to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is

not  the  question.  When  the  Minister  of  State

received   the   information  from  these   foreign

countries,  he  would have received information  on

the increase of salaries at the same time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is this a supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  were  told by the Minister of  State  for

Finance   that   the   Bakers'   Association    had

discussions  with his Ministry and,  as  a  result,

approval was granted for the increase in the  price

of  bread.  It  seems that the  approval  was  very

easily  given. I hope if the N.T.U.C, or the unions

approach the Ministry of Finance for a high cost-of-living  allowance, perhaps that can be  granted  as

well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is that your supplementary question,

Mr Seah? Can the Minister answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> No approval was given. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  two  supplementary questions. First,  is  the

Minister  of  State  aware that the  imposition  of

customs  duties, in addition to raising the  prices

of  imported  goods, also leads  to  rises  in  the

prices  of domestically produced goods even  though

they may not rise to the same extent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, has the Minister forgotten the debate

we  had  in  the  last two or  three  days  on  the

question  of the use of weights in the construction

of the cost-of-living index?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> What the Member for Whampoa

said - that if we put a tax on imported goods,  the

prices  of  locally-manufactured goods  could  also

rise  -  that could be true, yes. But with locally-made  goods, we are in a better position to control

the price level, whereas with imported goods we are

not so able.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, the Minister for Finance,

in  replying  to Members on the budget debate,  did

say that he would consider a survey and see whether

the weighting for the present price index should be

adjusted.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, is the Minister of State

for  Finance aware that he has not really  answered

both my questions?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I think I have answered

adequately.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister of State has mentioned that where locally-produced goods are concerned, his Ministry is  able

to  control  prices. Can he give  me  one  instance

where his Ministry is able to control the price  of

any commodity at all in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, the prices of sugar and

petroleum are controlled, for example. Perhaps  the

Member  can  tell me what are the goods  for  which

there has been an unwarranted rise in their prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0705 (contd.) -.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We were on the first amendment to



Head  0705  - Postal Services - when the  Committee

rose last night. The Question is,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 0705 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications was about to reply to

the points raised by Members under  this subhead when the

debate was interrupted. Mr Yong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Members for Sembawang,

Anson  and  Telok  Blangah  have  raised  questions

pertaining  to mail delivery and staffing  problems

in  our  Postal  Department. The Member  for  Anson

spoke  about  postmen being overloaded  with  work,

insufficiency of bicycles and motorcycles, and  the

prolonged acting appointment of the Chief Inspector

of  Postmen.  The  Member  for  Telok  Blangah  was

worried about the high turnover of postal staff and

the closed service in the Postal Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a previous session of Parliament, Members will

recall  that  the Member for Anson  raised  similar

complaints and, in fact, went so far as to  suggest

that  the  Minister should make surprise visits  to

the  Postal  Department. It  is  not  usual  for  a

Minister  to accept such an invitation, because  it

is  very demoralising to the staff for the Minister

to  make surprise checks. It is normal courtesy for

the  Minister to advise the head of the  department

concerned  that  he will be at  such  and  such  an

office  at  a certain time and to be aware  of  his

presence. But knowing full well that the Member  is

a  most  respected  retired member  of  the  Postal

Department  staff, that he has the welfare  of  the

Postal  Department  staff at heart  and  felt  very

strongly that certain things have got to be done, I

accepted  therefore  his  kind  invitation  to   do

something. But I must confess today in this House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



that  I  was not able to follow up that suggestion,

although I accepted it, because of a certain change

in circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July last year, the former Postmaster-General

submitted   his  application  for  retirement.   He

proceeded  on leave prior to retirement in  October

last  year  and  he was succeeded  by  the  present

acting Postmaster-General at a time when the latter

was  still  on  secondment  as  the  Controller  of

Immigration  in  the Ministry of Home  Affairs.  In

view  of  this change in the incumbent for the  top

post  in  the  Postal Department, it would  not  be

prudent for me to have conducted surprise visits to

the Postal Department, and also when the new acting

Postmaster-General  had  still  to  carry   on   as

Controller  of  Immigration for  two  solid  months

before he could officially take full charge of  the

Postal Department in December last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even before the former Postmaster-General went on leave prior to retirement, my

Ministry  had  decided officially  to  request  the

National Productivity Centre to undertake  a  study

of  the mail system. The request was made in August

last   year   but,  unfortunately,   the   National

Productivity  Centre was already heavily  committed

to  other  duties  and  they  could  only  begin  a

preliminary study in February this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House may be interested in a

brief  summary  of the findings and recommendations

of  this preliminary study. I happen to have a copy

of  the preliminary study in my hands. The N. P. C.

team  found  that  the structure  of  the  existing

organisation   should   be   fully   examined   and

streamlined,  and  that the  mail  delivery  system

should  be  examined  in view of  mechanisation  in

place  of the present manual system, and many other

improvements.  Other  procedures  should  also   be

examined  and streamlined. Jobs should be evaluated

to eliminate inequalities. The practice and quality

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



communication  and co-ordination are inadequate  to

the present scale of Postal Department's operations

and  should  be  improved.  Finally,  the  training

facilities  were also considered inadequate  for  a

department as large as our Postal Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preliminary report next recommended that

there  should  be a full study and that  the  areas

that  should be covered are as follows:  management

and   organisation   structure,  procedures,   mail

handling, parcel branch, inventory control,  filing

systems  and  record retention,  sub-post  offices,

training  school, transportation,  job  evaluation,

regional centres and other development plans.  This

full  study is expected to take a year and will  be

conducted  in stages with a report being  submitted

at   the  end  of  each  stage  for  approval   and

implementation. At the end of the  whole  study,  a

master  report  will  be  submitted.  The  National

Productivity Centre has indicated that  they  would

charge  a  retaining  fee of  $5,000  a  month.  My

Ministry  has  been in touch with the  Ministry  of

Finance for the necessary financial provision to be

made.  When it is approved, it is our intention  to

ask  the N. P. C, to commence the study on the  1st

of April this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the N. P. C, is already conducting a

three-week  course  on  method  study,  layout  and

material   handling,  and  office  management   and

methods   for  21  senior  and  middle   management

officers of the Postal Department. The course began

on  the 8th of this month, which is 10 days ago.  A

few  of the officers who attended this course  will

be   attached  to  the  N.  P.  C, study  team  as

counterpart staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, two senior postal officers were

nominated  to  attend  an  appreciation  course  on

industrial engineering organised by the N. P. C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will note that the terms of

reference   of  the  N.  P.  C, study   are   very

comprehensive and cover both immediate as  well  as

long-term requirements. I would be less than candid

if I were to deny that the study is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



long  overdue.  For  it  is true  that  the  Postal

Department  has  unfortunately  remained  basically

unchanged  for  many decades. I can assure  Members

that the forthcoming N. P. C, study is intended  to

remedy the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Sembawang, Anson and Telok

Blangah will therefore note that we are fully aware

of  the problems and have not been idle about these

matters.  In  fact, the new Postmaster-General  has

taken   immediate   action   to   correct   certain

inadequacies wherever feasible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to return to the specific complaints

raised  by  Members of Parliament  concerning  late

delivery and mis-delivery of mail, these things can

happen  in any postal service. The volume  of  mail

traffic  has increased greatly over the  years.  In

1969, 219 million items of mail were handled by the

department  and this has increased to  239  million

items last year. Although late deliveries and  mis-deliveries  do happen from time to time,  this,  of

course,  is  not  to be taken as  an  excuse.  Mail

delivery,  as the Member for Anson is aware,  is  a

complex process. It is not just taking it from here

and  handing  it  over to the other  person.  Where

possible,  the Postmaster-General has taken  action

to   remove   any   shortcomings   with   available

resources. However, this is one area which  the  N.

P.  C, will look into, and I have no doubt that the

system  will be considerably improved in  the  near

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson complained that the postmen

have  been overloaded with work and that there  are

not  enough  bicycles and motor-cycles  for  speedy

mail    delivery.   Furthermore,   these   machines

frequently  break  down and take  a  long  time  to

repair. With regard to the complaint about bicycles

and  motor-cycles, the department had 328  bicycles

at  the  close of 1970. Since then 39 new  bicycles

have  been purchased, 19 for replacement.  For  the

next financial year, a further 56 new bicycles will

be  purchased. 42 of which will be for replacement.

Minor  repairs are now undertaken at nearby bicycle

repair



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



shops instead of being sent as hitherto to the post

office  garage. Every little small item  of  repair

had  previously to be referred to the  post  office

garage instead of being attended to immediately  at

the  nearest  bicycle repair shop. This  ensures  a

quicker return to service.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, locally-made bicycles have been

found  to  be of very poor quality and  there  were

frequent  breakdowns. That is why even the  factory

has  closed down! Better quality bicycles  are  now

being  purchased.  I notice that my  colleague  the

Minister  for Home Affairs is having  a  good  time

over this subject. He probably has the same problem

-  too  much  dependence  on poor  locally-produced

products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for motor-cycles, the department has 10

machines,  one  bought  in October  1970,  for  the

Punggol/Tampines area. For the coming  year,  eight

new   motor-cycles  will  be  purchased,  five  for

replacement and three for new beats for the General

Post  Office  Express Delivery,  Taman  Jurong  and

Bukit  Panjang.  I wish to assure  Members  of  the

House  that  a  review is being undertaken  by  the

Postmaster-General  with the object  of  increasing

motorisation for speedier mail delivery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the query of the Member for

Telok  Blangah that there are 29 postmen  vacancies

as  at  15th March this year, action is in hand  to

fill  them. As regards the high turnover of  staff,

may I provide some statistics that the position  is

not  as  alarming  as put by the Member  for  Telok

Blangah? The number of postmen who resigned not for

last year but over a period of years, was: for 1967

- three, for 1968 10, 1969 six, and 1970 - 20. Most

of  those  who  resigned in 1970 had  less  than  a

year's   service  and  they  left  for  alternative

employment elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Members of the House may recall that

legislation was enacted on the first of this  month

requiring the installation of letter boxes in high-rise  buildings. This major step will make for more

efficient delivery of mails.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few other questions raised by the

Member  for Anson upon which I would like to touch.

He  mentioned  that the post of Chief Inspector  of

Postmen has been vacant and left unfilled, and  the

present  incumbent has been acting one  year  after

another.  This question of filling the post  is  an

establishment matter and the procedure  rests  with

the  Public Service Commission. If it is  found  by

the  Public  Service Commission that  there  is  no

suitable  candidate, then there is no  confirmation

of  the appointment. This is as far as I can go.  I

do  not decide who should be the Chief Inspector of

Postmen.   The  creation  of  more  Postal   Higher

Clerical   Officer   posts  to  enhance   promotion

prospects for Postal Clerical Assistants is also an

establishment matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has supplied

information to the effect that he understands  that

39  officers  from  the Post Office  Savings  Bank,

which  will  be converted into a corporation  soon,

will  be reverted to the postal services. He  wants

me  to confirm whether this is true or false. I  am

afraid I am not aware of this information. I do not

know  where he got his grapevine information  from,

but  even  then  this  would  be  an  establishment

matter.  Would postal clerks be allowed to transfer

to  other  departments?  Since  this  is  a  closed

service,  again it is an establishment  matter.  My

colleague  the Minister for Finance will  be  in  a

position  to  answer  this at a  later  stage.  Can

senior  civil  servants from other  departments  be

transferred  to  the  Postal  Department?  If   the

department  is a closed service, I cannot  see  how

senior  officers  from other  Ministries  could  be

transferred  to the Postal Department.  Can  it  be

this  -this  is  an assumption -  perhaps  the  new

Postmaster-General is assumed to be someone who was

not   in  the  Postal  Department,  but  from   the

Immigration  Department being  transferred  to  the

Postal  Department?  This  new  acting  Postmaster-General  has  always been a Postal Department  man,

but a request was made for him to be transferred



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



out  to be the Controller of Immigration at a  time

when it was difficult to find a suitable officer to

head this important and strategic post. I must  say

that  the senior officers in the Postal Department,

including  the  Ministry  of  Communications,  were

strongly opposed to his transfer out. I had to over-ride official objection and say, "We must allow our

senior  official  in the Postal  Department  to  be

given  this  opportunity to  head  the  Immigration

Department." I think it reflected great  credit  on

the  Postal  Department that  an  officer  in  that

department was found worthy to head the Immigration

Department  in another Ministry, and he had  served

at   least   one  full  year  in  the   Immigration

Department. It was only when the substantive holder

of  the post of Postmaster-General decided that  he

wanted  to  retire  that  we  had  to  recall  this

particular   officer  to  look  after  the   Postal

Department.  I hope, Sir, that I have answered  the

questions of the Members to their satisfaction.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

one or two issues raised by the Minister to which I

would like to make further reference. The first  is

the  question  of  the  39  officers  who  will  be

transferred from the Post Office Savings Bank  back

to  the  Post  Office when the Post Office  Savings

Bank  becomes  a  corporation. This information  is

gathered  from the Memorandum on the  Estimates  of

Revenue and Expenditure of Singapore on page 28. On

the  question of the Post Office Savings Bank being

a  closed  department, the point I raised  was,  is

there  an  absolute necessity to  keep  the  Postal

Department  a  closed department? The Minister  has

mentioned  just now that a senior official  in  the

Postal  Department was found suitable to  head  the

Immigration  Department and so a request  was  made

for him to be transferred there. A similar occasion

may  arise  where  junior officers  in  the  Postal

Department  would like to be transferred  to  other

departments.  If such requests are  made,  can  the

Postal Department entertain them? Could the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



Postal   Clerical  Officers  and  Postal   Clerical

Assistants  be  transferred  out  from  the  Postal

Department, and the General Clerical Officers go to

the Postal Department, making it an open department

instead of a closed one?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

grateful  to  the  Member  for  Telok  Blangah  for

pointing  out  where  he  got  the  mysterious   39

officers. It is true that the information is  found

in  the Memorandum on the Estimates of Revenue  and

Expenditure  of  Singapore. Had he  quoted  it,  it

would  have  been  easier to  follow  his  line  of

thinking.  This refers to temporary  staff  because

the  Postal Savings Bank is now part of the  Postal

Department. If and when the Savings Bank becomes  a

corporation,  those temporary staff who  have  been

employed  to  cope  with the  increased  number  of

accounts in the Post Office Savings Bank will  then

become  part  of the staff of the corporation,  but

later on they will be given the opportunity to  opt

either  to  remain  with  the  Savings  Bank  as  a

statutory  organisation or  revert  to  the  Postal

Department. This is just like in accounts where you

have  a debit and a credit entry. It is only a book

entry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether the staff in the Postal Department

may be given the opportunity to get out of a closed

service,  this is a very big issue  and  I  do  not

think  the Member really expects me to give him  an

answer.  It should really be the privilege  of  the

Minister  for  Finance, who is  in  charge  of  the

Establishment and the Treasury, to give an  answer.

May  I just say that I will send the Member's query

across to my colleague.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must

thank  the  Minister  for his  reply  to  my  query

regarding  the Postal Department. He has said  that

the Postmaster-General is newly promoted. There are

many  Controllers  and  Assistant  Controllers   of

Posts. What have they been doing in the past? Every

Controller  of Posts knows the work of his  branch.

They should make recommendations on this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also explained to the House about the National Productivity Centre. What I want to ask him is whether the Centre is theoretical or practical. I want to know whether this Centre will go through every loophole and find where the trouble comes from. If we know where the trouble

comes from probably the report will be correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was working in the Postal Department when one

day the Postmaster-General from Kuala Lumpur wanted

to   come  and  inspect  the  work  of  our  Postal

Department.  What  did  the  department  do?   They

brought  manpower to the godown by truck.  The  van

was  put  inside the godown. He asked an  assistant

postman  to carry his bag and put it inside.  "Very

nice, there is no hot sun. It is very warm and very

slow.  You  can go." That was how he was to  inform

the higher authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says that it is not his duty and he cannot interfere with the administration of the department. I quite understand what he means, but he must get some information from the department which is under his control. I understand the functions of the Postal Department because I worked

there  for  the last 34 years. The senior  officers

are  always  pressing  the  junior  officers.  They

always  sit  peacefully in the office,  putting  on

records  and listening to the music. The worst  hit

are  the men who go out. May I ask the Minister  to

let  one  Assistant  Controller follow  a  delivery

postman  on one of his bicycle rounds and  see  his

difficulties? The Postman's job is a manual one. He

must  look after his bicycle, the letters,  parcels

and  registered articles. All this makes his job  a

heavy responsibility. Further, if it is raining, he

must make sure that his bag -



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Is not run over by

a motorcar!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> -- is not wet. But he

cannot  stop his delivery. He must carry on in  the

rain  -  the  mail must be delivered!  It  is  most

probable  that the Minister is aware of  all  these

difficulties, and as I do not wish to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



bring this matter up again and again, all I want to

ask  is  this:  can  the  Minister  look  into  the

postmen's  difficulties in a  more  practical  way,

instead of being only theoretical about it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since we

have  decided  to  ask  the  National  Productivity

Centre to proceed with this one-year study, I shall

convey to it the advice tendered by the Member  for

Anson - that what is needed is practical advice and

not theoretical advice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  in view of the detailed explanation given  by

the Minister, I beg to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

P. Govindaswamy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0705 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1027.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindaswamy, Amendment (2) .

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0705 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this $100 vote for "Awards for Staff Suggestions" is an extremely interesting item, one which I do not seem to have come across elsewhere in the Ordinary Estimates. Can the Minister tell the House how this scheme is administered, how and what are the suggestions

made,  and  from  whom do they  come?  And  if  the

suggestions  are  considered  valuable,   can   the

Minister   tell   us  to  what  extent   they   are

implemented?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he not think that it will be a good idea to

encourage  this scheme further, or am  I  right  in

saying  that  the reduction of the vote  from  $200

last year to $100 this year is the result of a lack

of these suggestions?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, in reply to the Member

for  Katong, the procedure governing the awards for

staff suggestions in the Postal Services Department

is   as  follows.  An  officer  will  describe  his

suggestion for improvement on a form which is  sent

to  the  Branch Head for evaluation. This  is  then

further  assessed by the Controller of  Posts,  and

finally  passed  on  to the Postmaster-General  who

then makes the decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year a total of $55 was spent on awards

ranging from $5 to $15 in value. They were paid for

six    suggestions   which   dealt   mainly    with

improvements  to Postal and Savings Bank  documents

and forms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut in provision from $200 to $100 is due to

the  very sharp eyes of the Treasury officials  who

saw  that  since only $55 was paid out  last  year,

therefore,  the  provision  for  1971-72  could  be

brought  down  to $100, instead of  keeping  it  at

$200.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0705 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item (2) of  subhead

2011.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subhead deals with commission to stamp

vendors. I merely wish to seek information  on  the

rate of commission paid, and what encouragement  is

being  given to get more vendors to come  into  the

scheme. If there are more such vendors, perhaps  it

will  enable people to get their stamps just  round

the  corner, so to speak, if they wish to get  them

in a hurry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, there are two types of

licensed stamp vendors. One type operates in remote

areas  where facilities for the purchase of  stamps

are   not  readily  available.  They  are  paid   a

commission  of  two per cent of  the  stamp  value,

subject  to a maximum commission of $5 in  any  one

month. The other type undertakes the sale of stamps

in their premises as an added service or attraction

to their customers. No



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



commission is paid to this type of licensee.  There

are  at  present  57  licensed  stamp  vendors   in

operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take the opportunity under this

amendment  to suggest to the Minister  concerned  a

change  of  uniform  of  the postmen.  The  present

uniform  was inherited from colonial times  and  is

still in use today. The material is very thick  and

unsuitable  for the tropical climate of  Singapore.

Sir,  it  is  my view that the present  uniform  is

obsolete and not in keeping with modern Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, Sir, several Government

departments  have  changed the  uniforms  of  their

staff.  For  example, the Police, Immigration,  and

Customs  Departments have already adopted  new  and

modern uniforms for their staff, but not the Postal

Services Department. The postmen are still  wearing

the  same old kind of uniform which has been in use

for the past few decades. Therefore, I suggest that

the  Minister should give consideration to changing

the  uniform  of  our postal workers.  If  the  new

uniform  is  of  better material, it will  heighten

their  morale  and  efficiency.  I  wonder  if  the

Minister will accept this proposal. Sir, I  beg  to

move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

grateful   to   the  Member  for  Mountbatten   for

highlighting this point of uniforms for the  Postal

Department  and  I can say that the department  has

anticipated his query. There is, in fact, a  review

now  being made to ascertain what improvements  can

be  made to the design and material of the uniforms

for the Postal Department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that the Anti-Pollution Unit has been

set up to combat air pollution and noise pollution.

I  wish to bring to the attention of the House  one

offender,  the  Telecommunications Department.  The

old  Cable  and Wireless building at Robinson  Road

has  four  flimsy chimneys made of zinc, a material

used  for  gutters. For two or three days  a  week,

these chimneys belch out smoke. This has been going

on regularly, and there are no signs that this will

stop.  Along  with the smoke from  these  chimneys,

this  building  also  makes a loud  rumbling  noise

which  pervades the whole area. This noise goes  on

as  long  as smoke is puffing out of the  chimneys.

This  is noise pollution and air pollution in every

sense of the word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people working in the vicinity have already

accepted  the noise made by the piling machines  at

building   sites  in  this  area  as  a  price   of

development and progress. But the smoke  and  noise

coming  from  the  Telecoms  building  are  not   a

temporary nuisance. This is a permanent feature  of

the building, and is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



unwelcome to the occupants of the Telecoms building

as well as those in all adjoining buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be grateful if the Minister will look

into  the  source of the noise and smoke pollution,

especially   since  his  Ministry   is   conducting

campaigns  to  persuade taxi and  bus  owners,  and

factories  and  sawmills  to  eliminate  smoke  and

noise.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Expenditure   Estimates   for   Telecommunications,

appearing  in  the Memorandum on the  Estimates  of

Revenue and Expenditure of Singapore, state:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The increase for P.E. [Personal Emoluments] is

$781,000.   Six   additional  posts   of   Engineer

.Thirteen  operational and engineering Division  II

posts.At   the  junior  level,  52  new  posts   of

Technician are created to cope with the  growth  of

telecommunications  particularly   in   telex   and

landshore   radio   communications.   Seventy-eight

additional  posts of Clerical Officer and  Clerical

Assistant   are  provided,  again  to   cope   with

expansion.'



<br><br>The  Memorandum goes on to stress the  shortage  of

staff  built up over the years and the increase  in

workload.  A  total  of  67 additional  posts  were

provided for in the 1970-71 Estimates, but in spite

of  this, we have a very serious shortage of  staff

in the Telecommunications Department. The employees

in  the operational side of the department work day

in  and day out without obtaining any time off  for

rest  days  and public holidays. The  provision  of

rest  days is to grant respite to a worker so  that

he  could  be given the opportunity for recreation.

If the employees are not given their weekly day off

as  a  rest  day  for a long period, then,  however

responsible the union or the employee may be, it is

bound  to  lead  to  a deterioration  of  employer-employee relationship, and a demoralisation of  the

employee concerned.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsible workers of Telecommunications

understand  the  plight of the  department  in  not

being  able  to  give them time off for  rest  days

because of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



the   present   staff   shortage.   Although   they

understand  the  difficulty of the department,  how

long  can  they go on without doing anything  about

it?  I  understand that the International Telegraph

Section of the Telecommunications Department  alone

owes  the staff a total of 30,000 hours for working

on  rest days and public holidays from June 1969 to

January  1971.  The department owes the  messengers

11,500 hours, clerical assistants 5,600 hours,  and

counter clerks 1,500 hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messengers have been put on duty without a single

day  of  rest for several weeks at a stretch.  They

have  worked for half a year without any rest  days

or public holidays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the problem of recruiting sufficient

messengers, clerical assistants and counter  clerks

to  cope  with the shortage? These are  not  highly

skilled personnel. Why have a sufficient number  of

messengers,  clerks  and counter  clerks  not  been

recruited?  The  employees in the  department  have

shown  great  patience and understanding  and  have

been hoping that steps will be taken to remedy this

state  of affairs. Will the department be  able  to

meet  this shortage this year? I doubt it. Although

about  100 more clerks and clerical assistants  are

to  be  recruited, some of these will be  replacing

staff  who  will  be retiring this year.  From  the

Estimates,  I notice that no additional  messengers

are  to be recruited. How are the messengers  going

to collect their debt?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister assure me that the

Telecommunications Department will repay  the  debt

it  owes  its  employees, in the form  of  holidays

earned,  if  not  for the past two years,  then  at

least this year?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if time off cannot be granted within a

reasonable  period, the workers must be financially

compensated,  as is being done in the non-essential

services.  I understand the limitations  placed  on

the  department by sections 37 (4) and 41(4) of the

Employment Act. Clearly, in the past two years, the

department   has   encountered   difficulties    in

justifiably enforcing these two sections of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



Employment Act by granting days off in substitution

for   rest   days   and  public  holidays.   Having

encountered difficulties, it is up to the  Minister

to persuade his Cabinet colleagues to amend the two

sections  of  the  Act  instead  of  continuing  to

perpetuate an injustice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first

reply  to the remarks made by the Member for  Telok

Blangah  before  I reply to the Member  for  Potong

Pasir.  I  appreciate his concern over the staffing

position in the Telecommunications Department.  May

I  first  explain why there was such an unfortunate

accumulation  of time off last year?  Firstly,  the

Department  has experienced a vacancy  position  of

about nine per cent during the year. This was at  a

time   when  the  work  of  the  Telecommunications

Department was expanding at an unusually high rate.

It  is  all  right if there has been  no  increased

tempo in business. But the activity was as high  as

22  per  cent in terms of the overall gross revenue

income.  This  is a fair yardstick to  measure  the

progress   of   a   department.   The   growth   in

international traffic has in fact been spectacular.

For  example,  the international telephone  traffic

increased by 38 per cent. The medium-range maritime

telephone service, which includes the offshore  oil

industry requirements, went up by 64 per cent,  and

the international telex traffic increased by 66 per

cent.  This is a galloping rate of development.  It

is  most unusual. In order to satisfy public demand

to  the  best  of  its  ability  and  with  certain

reasonably acceptable standards, the department had

no  alternative  but to cover all vacant  positions

through overtime from the existing staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the provision in the current Estimates

before  the  House and the steps that have  already

been  taken  to increase the staff by  recruitment,

there  are good expectations that during the coming

year  we should have adequate staff. I did not  use

the  word  "shall"; I said "should".  I  am  always

hopeful, but things may not happen as we wish.  The

staff  will  cover not only all normal requirements

but also the expected high



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



growth  rate. This will also help to wipe  out  the

accumulation  of time off mentioned by  the  Member

for Telok Blangah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the provision for 1,688 posts in this

year's vote represents an increase of 159 posts  or

ten  per  cent over that authorised for the current

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, 104 out of these 159 posts are in

respect  of  the grade affected by the accumulation

in  time off, which represents approximately 42,000

man-hours.  The  total overtime  hours  worked  per

month   is   over  1l,000  and  the   net   average

accumulation of time off per month is around  1,800

hours.  The  additional complement  of  staff  will

enable  present overtime duties to be well  covered

and  enable time off to be granted while leaving  a

sufficient  margin for anticipated  traffic  growth

over the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I am very pleased to say that for the

first   time  the  department  is  well  ahead   on

recruitment. The Public Service Commission has just

completed   an   exercise  to  recruit   over   250

Telecommunications    clerical    assistants    and

technicians. This will wipe out the present vacancy

position  as  well as fill the 159  new  posts  now

coming  up  for  approval  before  the  House.  The

department should be able to have a full complement

of  staff  by  May  this  year.  A  crash  training

programme  is being arranged which will enable  the

new  staff  to  be trained and put  into  operating

position  some  time in August. It  is  anticipated

that  the  long  overdue time off  can  be  granted

thereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, it is likely that the 24 vacancies in

the vote for telegraph messengers will be filled by

June,  by which period time off for messengers  can

be granted thereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, should our present staffing position

still  prove  to be inadequate, it may well  happen

that the rate of development will again double what

it  was last year. We cannot say. It depends on the

requirements needed by the commercial  sector.  But

should  our  staffing position again  prove  to  be

inadequate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



despite  all  these efforts to keep pace  with  the

terrific demand for our services, here again  I  am

pleased  to disclose that there is an understanding

with  the Ministry of Finance that we may make  our

applications  and  that  they  will  be  favourably

considered.  I cannot ask better than that.  It  is

almost  like a blank cheque where you just fill  in

your  requirements. Of course, this is by means  of

the  establishment warrant procedure. This was done

in  August  last  year when we  were  able  to  get

approval for an additional 68 posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Member for Telok Blangah has

expressed  doubts  that things  will  improve  next

year,  I  can assure him that his doubts can,  like

the  mist in the hills, disappear as the sun  rises

high up in the sky. Of course, I would like to  say

that  I want to express my thanks and gratitude  to

the  staff of the Telecommunications Department for

their  loyalty  and  dedicated service  under  such

trying conditions. If Singapore is to have a rugged

society,    I    think    the    staff    of    the

Telecommunications Department have proved that they

are  very  rugged to be able to withstand all  that

pressure and stress at the cost of very heavy  time

off accumulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the Member for Potong Pasir? He

has   mentioned  that  there  is  smoke  and  noise

pollution   coming   from  the   Telecommunications

Department.  At the rate that they  are  trying  to

provide  a  service to the public,  can  you  blame

them? The rate of development is not five per cent,

which  we normally see in advanced countries  which

are  very prosperous, it is an overall 22 per cent,

which  is  four  times higher than  that  of  other

advanced  countries. Tens of thousands of hours  of

time  off are being accumulated and they are  still

hanging  on  to  their jobs to make  Singapore  the

telecommunications centre of South-east Asia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, a complaint was received by our

Ministry in 1970. I think it was due to a number of

factors. We have diesel generators. The head of the

Anti-Pollution Unit in the Prime Minister's  Office

has  replied  to  the complainant  who  is  closely

associated  with  the Member for Potong  Pasir.  In

this reply, they have said that investigations have

been  made  and  it has been ascertained  that  the

smoke  and noise are due to the emergency  stand-by

diesel  generators which are being test-run weekly.

This  means  that  in case of a general  breakdown,

this  generator will carry on in the  meantime.  To

avoid    noise    nuisance,   the    Director    of

Telecommunications has agreed to  suspend  for  the

time  being the test-run of these engines  on  week

days  and is trying to reschedule the test runs  on

Sundays. It looks as if the Member for Potong Pasir

is  working overtime on Saturdays and Sundays  when

the  Telecommunications Department are test-running

and,   therefore,  causing  the  noise   pollution.

Further,  the  Senior Mechanical  Engineer,  Public

Works  Department, is taking action  to  abate  the

smoke  nuisance  and to dampen the noise  from  the

engines. So every effort is being made. But  should

all  these efforts be in vain, it may well be  that

the  Member for Potong Pasir will be helping me  to

persuade the Ministry of Finance to give us  modern

diesel engines that will be noiseless and pollution

free, for which I will then be most grateful to him

for having lodged this complaint in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the present reorganisation of our

motor  transport service, the Registry of  Vehicles

will  be  expanding its activities. We can  imagine

the  amount of work that has to be done.  From  the

budget  estimates, we know that the R.O.V, will  be

setting up an Enforcement Unit to be manned  by  80

police   personnel.  In  addition,   the   existing

Investigation  Unit  will  be  strengthened  by  11

additional posts of Investigating Officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid that the Registry of Vehicles at

Middle  Road  will be overcrowded.  No  wonder  our

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Communications has to make way and has  his  office

moved to City Hall. In order to carry out its  work

efficiently,  it is important that  the  Government

building   at  another  site.  In  the  Development

Estimates  for  1971-72,  there  is  provision  for

building a Motor Vehicle Inspection Centre,  but  I

cannot   find   any  provision  therein   for   the

construction of a new building for the Registry  of

Vehicles.  In my view, the Registry should  improve

its  working  efficiency especially  following  the

reorganisation of our motor transport service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, I would like the Minister to consider another suggestion. This is in reference to the memorandum I sent him on the 8th of March with regard to season tickets for bus commuters. This scheme, if accepted by the bus companies, will be appreciated by bus commuters as in the long run,

it  is  more economical. Furthermore, the work-load

of  the  bus conductors will be reduced, and  their

efficiency  will be increased. This  is  the  first

advantage.  The second advantage of  having  season

tickets  is  that  bus  commuters  will  not  throw

tickets about indiscriminately.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



The  third  advantage is that it is more economical

especially  for school children. They  can  save  a

considerable  sum  of  money  if  they  buy  season

tickets.   The  fourth  advantage   is   that   bus

conductors  will have more time to move  around  to

check  and collect fares from other passengers  and

therefore increase the revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister concerned will reply to my

proposals.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

take  this opportunity briefly to express my dismay

over the poor standard of driving and attention  to

road  courtesy  of  bus drivers.  It  is  quite  an

ordinary event to watch bus drivers speeding  along

their  routes, and timid drivers like  myself  feel

somewhat  despondent when they see the  juggernauts

that bus drivers drive exceeding the speed limit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect besides speeding is the way the

bus  drivers  frequently do not attend  to  parking

their  buses  by  the bays when they  come  to  bus

stops.  There have been many occasions when I  have

seen  buses parked at a distance of one  lane  away

from the kerb to allow passengers to alight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Have a campaign for this! [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> We will come to that later on.

These are just incidental references to the kind of

offences  that  one  sees bus  drivers  committing.

Before  I  come to the end of this address.  May  I

mention  another offence, and that is inconsiderate

driving - bus drivers moving out of their stops  as

soon as they stick their hands out, or give signals

and  move  without paying any attention to  traffic

coming  from  behind. I hope that the  Ministry  of

Communications will start an education campaign  so

that  bus  drivers  may be able  to  improve  their

standard  of  driving and pay  attention  to  these

matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Member for Mount-batten, has

referred to the reform of the transport service and

I  hope  that that will result in a reform  of  bus

drivers too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  Member for Mount-batten, I wish to assure  him

that with the reorganisation of our motor transport

service,  there  will  also  be  expansion  of  the

administrative set-up of the Registrar of Vehicles,

both  in  staff  and  in  the building  facilities.

Although  the  Member says that  he  does  not  see

anything  in the Development Estimates, which  will

be discussed at a subsequent session of Parliament,

I  would  like to assure him that it is already  in

this  year's  estimates. Tenders have already  been

awarded   for   the   sum  of  $481,150   for   the

construction of the Motor Vehicle Inspection Centre

at  Sin  Ming Road, off Upper Thomson Road, and  we

expect it to be completed within five months.  Once

the Inspection Centre site has been established, it

is  our  intention to move out from Middle Road  to

Sin  Ming Road because the Urban Renewal Department

is  keeping a very watchful eye on where we are  at

present,  because  it  is  a  very  valuable  site.

Negotiations are going on to decide who  is  to  be

responsible for the building of the office  at  Sin

Ming Road, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten also referred to a

letter  which  he kindly addressed  to  me  on  the

subject  of  the possibility of introducing  season

tickets  for our bus commuters. What he has  listed

as  the advantages of season tickets is accepted by

us. We think it is a very good idea and this matter

will  be  tabled  for  consideration  by  the   bus

companies   and  the  new  Bus  Services  Licensing

Authority which will have its first meeting on  the

26th  instant. We will have this on the agenda  for

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the remarks made by the Member for

Katong, he is not the only one to be dismayed  over

the  poor  standard of driving and lack of courtesy

by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



bus  drivers. It is our hope that after the massive

reorganisation of bus routes has taken  place  next

month and when there is an adequate number of buses

on the roads to meet the needs of the bus commuting

public,  we will proceed to educate the drivers  to

be more courteous on the road. At the moment, we do

have  a  Public Service Vehicle Training Centre  at

Queenstown  where the question of courtesy  on  the

road,  first aid, etc, instructions are being given

to  new  bus  drivers  before they  can  get  their

vocational driving licences. But, of course,  there

is  this  hard core of drivers now in  service  who

need  some education. As everybody who is  involved

in   education  knows,  we  do  not  get  successes

overnight. We have to be a bit patient. We have  to

talk,  persuade and to instruct over  a  period  of

time before old habits disappear and new habits are

cultivated.  I do hope that the Member for  Katong,

being  an  educationist  of  high  calibre  in  the

University   of  Singapore,  can  appreciate   this

situation. Otherwise, there would not be  an  Adult

Education Department in the University of Singapore

of which the Member is in charge.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  think  the  Minister  has  overlooked   my

suggestion that the Registry of Vehicles at  Middle

Road  should be reconstructed or expanded.  I  know

that  there is a provision in the estimates  for  a

new  Testing Centre and for the Vehicle  Inspection

Centre at Sin Ming Road. My suggestion is that  the

building at Middle Road should be expanded or a new

administrative block should be constructed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought I

had  answered that point when I said that we  shall

be moving out from Middle Road to the Sin Ming site



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



off  Upper Thomson Road. For a start, we will begin

with  the Vehicle Inspection Centre. Later on,  the

administrative  staff will also move  out  once  we

have  decided that we can get extra money to  build

the   administrative  building   which   is   under

discussion at the moment. So I am in no position to

say,  "Yes, we have got the money to move out."  We

are thinking of moving out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the estimates for Education were $174

million.   This  year  the  estimates   have   been

increased  to  $191  million. This  represents  the

second largest item in our total expenditure.  From

this we can see that the Government has undoubtedly

paid  a  great deal of attention to the development

of  our  education.  There is  no  doubt  that  the

educational system is vital to our nation building.

Whether a country is strong or weak depends on  how

strong  the  educational system in the country  is.

Education will train people in a country to be well

educated,   highly  cultivated,  and   to   acquire

knowledge, especially in this era of technology. We

have  to  train  a  large  number  of  people  with

specialised knowledge so that they can take up  the

task  of nation building. Therefore we can see that

the  task  of the Ministry of Education  is  indeed

very  heavy.  The  Ministry  of  Education  in  its

implementation  of policies will have  to  be  very

cautious.  The  compilation of the syllabuses  will

have to be very sound and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



comprehensive.  The contents of the textbooks  must

be  realistic and tailored especially to the  needs

of  a  developing country. It is only in  this  way

that we can have people well trained for their jobs

so  that  we  will  not produce a large  number  of

people who cannot apply what they have learnt. As a

matter  of principle, we are trying to implement  a

multilingual  education. We emphasise the  teaching

of   science   and   technology.   This   is   very

appropriate.  However,  in  the  implementation  of

policies, there have been some anomalies.  This  is

because many principals and teachers are faced with

a  great  number of difficulties. I would  like  to

take  this  opportunity to  ask  the  Minister  for

Education  four  oft- recurring questions.  I  hope

that  he will investigate and perhaps remedy  them.

The first point is about the changing of textbooks.

We  find that there has been some delay. Last  year

the Ministry of Education directed that all primary

schools should use the textbooks published  by  the

Educational  Publications  Bureau.  They  were  the

Primary  One  and  Primary Three  civic  textbooks.

Perhaps  the  Minister of State does not  know  the

ones  I  am  referring to. All the primary  schools

naturally  followed the directive of the  Ministry,

but  when  the schools reopened this year  for  the

first   term,  the  textbooks  published   by   the

Educational Publications Bureau were not enough for

all primary schools. Some primary schools could not

use  textbooks published by other companies.  As  a

result,  the  teachers  have  had  difficulties  in

teaching. Moreover, the pupils have had unnecessary

difficulties in learning the lessons.  I  hope  the

Minister will investigate this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about the Mathematics

textbooks in primary schools. A few years  ago  the

Ministry  of  Education directed that  all  primary

school  textbooks  in  Mathematics  should  be   in

English.  At  that  time  we  had  a  shortage   of

teachers.  Now  we  find that the  students  cannot

understand these textbooks. Therefore, the Ministry

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



decided  to  reverse its decision  on  the  use  of

English  Mathematics textbooks.  The  question  now

whether  to  use  Chinese  or  English  Mathematics

textbooks in primary schools is up to the principal

of  the school concerned to decide. This has caused

some  surprise to the principals. I think  this  is

not an appropriate thing to do. The Ministry is the

highest  authority for making decisions. There  are

many  educational experts in the Ministry  who  can

find   ways   and   means  of  implementing   these

decisions. They must find a solution, practical and

feasible,  so  that  all schools  can  follow  this

decision.  We  should  not adopt  the  practice  of

asking the principal to do as he sees fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is whether relief teachers can be

considered for confirmation and absorption into the

permanent  establishment. We know that many  relief

teachers are fully qualified and some of them  have

had many years of experience in practical teaching.

I  think  they are fully qualified to  be  absorbed

into  the permanent establishment. What is more,  I

understand  that  at the moment  we  are  short  of

teachers.  If  so,  why do we not  consider  giving

these relief teachers normal and permanent status?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to raise is how to

use  the  revised  syllabus  for  primary  one  and

primary two pupils. According to the policy of  the

Ministry  of Education, they are going to start  in

the second term of this year a revised syllabus for

primary  one  and primary two. However,  there  has

been  no  comprehensive plan on  how  to  implement

this.  I understand that when some inspectors  went

to  the  schools  they  asked  the  principals  and

teachers   when  they  could  implement   the   new

syllabus, and sometimes they asked whether they had

already  implemented  the new  syllabus.  When  the

principals and teachers mentioned the difficulties,

the  inspectors  did not know  what  to  say.  They

merely said. "Whatever you can do, you do now. What

you cannot do, you may do as you please." What will

the Minister say about this?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Education Minister on 16th March remarked  in  this

House that he would hate to think that teachers  in

the  education service are attracted  only  by  the

salary  scales.  I am sure that the  Minister  said

this more in jest than in seriousness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of our present situation, the

question  of  monetary  incentives  should  not  be

dismissed in such a lighthearted fashion by a  mere

statement  of a pious platitude. There  is  nothing

more  or nothing less human in the teacher than  in

any  individual in our society. Teachers,  just  as

other   individuals  in  our  society,  also   have

personal   commitments  and   responsibilities   to

fulfil. They have families to raise, mouths to feed

and  homes to look after. All these require  money.

Why  should the question of money become "unchaste"

with teachers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said on 16th March, 1971, in this House, the

teachers  are beginning to wonder what is happening

to  the  current negotiations between the Teachers'

Unions   and  the  Education  Ministry.  The   then

Education Minister invited the Teachers' Unions  to

negotiate on 1st September, 1970. The first meeting

between the representatives of the Teachers' Unions

and  officials of the Education Ministry took place

on  10th  October, 1970. Today is the  19th  March,

1971. The Teachers' Unions have yet to receive  any

response  from  the  Education  Ministry   to   the

proposals  they  put  up  to  them.  The  Education

Minister  informed this House on 16th March,  1971,

that  his Ministry had made its recommendations  to

the  Ministry  of Finance. I would  like  to  serve

notice  on the Finance Minister, who is not present

here,  that I will take issue with him on the delay

that  his  Ministry  is causing  in  the  teachers'

negotiations   when   this  House   considers   the

estimates  of  his  Ministry in  the  Committee  of

Supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to inform the Members in this House that

the  current  negotiations  between  the  Teachers'

Unions and the Education Ministry do not deal only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



with salary matters. They also deal with a host  of

other  problems such as the questions of  teachers'

quota in schools, the relationship between teachers

and   Ministry   officials   as   well   as   other

professional  problems. Some of the problems  arise

because   of   the   lack  of   communication   and

consultation   between   Ministry   officials   and

teachers.  I  would  therefore  like  to  ask   the

Education Minister whether steps will be  taken  to

ensure  that  his  Ministry officials  become  more

communicative  and more amenable  to  the  idea  of

consultation with teachers, particularly  with  the

Teachers'   Unions,  on  matters  of   professional

interest and importance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I share the sentiments of the  Member

for Moulmein. As the Minister for Education said on

the  16th  of  March in this House, a good  teacher

does   not   take   his  salary   too   much   into

consideration. I agree with what he  said,  but  we

should  not  forget that teachers  are  also  human

beings. Today when the prices of so many goods  are

increasing,  the  meagre salaries of  the  teachers

cannot  catch  up  with such increases.  Therefore,

their  salaries  should be readjusted.  Because  of

their poor working conditions, their morale is low.

This  is  also  the cause of some teachers  leaving

their  posts. The Teachers' Unions in  the  various

language streams submitted their representations to

the  Ministry of Education some five months ago.  I

hope the Minister can give an early reply.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vote for Education is quite a

considerable sum in our budget. Of course, the  aim

is to educate the 25 per cent of our population who

are students to become useful citizens. In order to

achieve  effectively the purpose of  education,  we

must  have a correct and definite education policy.

But  our  Education Ministry has been  hesitant  on

many issues. Perhaps this is because they have  too

much confidence in the so-called "experts". I would

like to advise the Minister that when he formulates

his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



policy  he should not just pay heed to the opinions

of  only a handful of experts, but also give regard

to   the   opinions  of  those  in   the   teaching

profession,  especially the teachers, because  they

are  the  implementers of education  policies  and,

being closest to the students, they understand  the

needs of the students best. But in formulating  its

policies  or before carrying out any major reforms,

the  Ministry  has  never  consulted  the  teaching

profession. It is only when the policies cannot  be

carried  through that the Ministry  gets  in  touch

with  the teachers to seek solutions. This attitude

should be corrected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we recognise the fact that teachers are

communicators of knowledge and that they  have  the

necessary  professional  qualifications,  we   must

allow  them  to  carry  out  their  duties  and  he

responsible for them only within the scope of their

duties.  We should not give them too heavy a  work-load. They should be allowed time to carry on  with

their  own studies. We should not give them chores,

such  as  the  collection of fees  and  filling  up

endless  forms.  We  should  give  them  reasonable

working  conditions and a proper scope of work.  At

the moment the allocation of the number of teachers

to  a  classroom is based on a quota formula -  for

every   primary  class  1.1  teachers,  for   every

secondary  class 1.25 teachers, and for every  Pre-University  class  1  33 teachers.  This  quota  is

allocated  according to the school time-table,  and

results  in  a  heavy burden on  the  teachers.  In

addition to this, teachers have homework to correct

and they are allotted various other duties, such as

extra-curricular  activities.  All  this  increases

their  workload  beyond the quota  provided.  Thus,

many  teachers have to be in school one or two days

more    per   week   for   these   extra-curricular

activities. This is not in accordance with the time-table,  and  thus  invalidates  the  quota  system.

Moreover,  school  principals  allot  teachers  the

responsibility for various other matters  of  which

they  have  to  take  charge. From  these  numerous

additional duties, it is clear that the teacher's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



workload has gone beyond the staff quota stipulated

by  the  Ministry. This shift system also increases

the  work-load  of other teachers, and  it  is  not

entered   in   the  records  of  the  Ministry   of

Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the scope of work of the teachers

should  be  properly  defined and  enumerated,  and

measures  taken  to  reduce  the  workload  of  the

teachers. During the last budget debate I suggested

that we should not ask the teachers to complete the

same  particulars  of  the students  in  attendance

register  every year, and to match these  with  the

certificates  or other evidence which  parents  are

required to produce. This wastes too much time  and

causes  too  much inconvenience to  all  concerned.

Since  there  are  12,000 class teachers  involved,

each  having to spend about six hours on this  job,

it  will  result in 3,000 working days  in  a  year

being   wasted.  One  year  has  lapsed  since   my

suggestion was made, and I would like to know  what

steps  the  Minister has taken to  deal  with  this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only one last matter to bring up, and that

is,  the  Government has at long  last  decided  to

extend medical benefits as from 1st September  last

year  to  the  teachers  and  staff  in  the  aided

schools.  But  members of their families  have  not

been  included yet. I hope the Minister can  extend

these medical benefits to them soon.

so  that  I  need not speak on the next  amendment*

later.  Sir,  I am a serving teacher in  a  Chinese

school. At the same time I am also the President of

the  Singapore  Chinese School Teachers'  Union.  I

have  come  into close contact with  those  in  the

teaching  profession,  and  therefore  it   is   my

responsibility to take this opportunity to bring up

their grievances before this House.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Amendment No. (2) , standing in the names of Messrs. P. Govindaswamy, Yeo Choo Kok, Ho Kah Leong and Tay Boon Too, Reas as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum be allocated for Head 0801 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1005.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to raise a matter which has existed for more than a decade, and that is the age of retirement of teachers. I would like the Minister for Education to reconsider the question of standardising the age of retirement. Over the past decade there have been a

lot  of  grievances among teachers  in  Government-aided   schools,  particularly  those  in   Chinese

schools,  against the difference  in  the  retiring

age.  Some  teachers are retired at 60 years  while

others are retired at 55. Why should there he  this

difference?  It  is admitted that  when  a  teacher

reaches  the age of 55 years, he can apply  for  an

extension  of  service.  But,  in  spite  of   this

privilege, he will still harbour a grievance and  a

feeling of injustice, which is understandable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Editorials in the Chinese newspapers have given

publicity  to this matter and they have spoken  for

the Chinese school teachers since the early days of

the  implementation of this policy on retiring age.

The  Chinese School Teachers' Union has also spoken

on it. In fact, the Executive Council of this union

has  repeatedly requested the Ministry of Education

to  reconsider this matter. In order to give  equal

treatment  to all the language streams of teachers,

the   Ministry  should  standardise  the   age   of

retirement at 60, instead of leaving it at  55  and

60  years  respectively. Over the past  decade  the

Chinese School Teachers' Union has done its best to

fight against this difference, but the Ministry has

continued  to allow this unreasonable  practice  to

carry on. This is beyond my comprehension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the regulations and practice

of  education  handed down from the  past  are  not

necessarily  good or practical for  all  time.  The

Minister  himself said, on the 16th  of  March,  in

this  House  in reply to a question  raised  by  my

colleague,  that  the  salary structure  of  school

principals  and  teachers is a very complex  matter

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



should be simplified. I am in full agreement  with

him on this. But at the same time I would like  to

appeal to him to standardise the age of retirement

of  teachers  at  60  years, because  the  present

practice is a very unreasonable one and should  be

removed as early as possible. If it is allowed  to

carry  on,  it will create further discontent  and

will not benefit our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next topic I wish to raise is the matter of school holidays. Teachers during the school vacation rest, study, or go on a tour in order to enrich themselves mentally. But school principals do not have the good fortune of enjoying a vacation. They have to report for duty

in  school  even during the school  holidays,  and

this amounts to working throughout the whole year,

and  even  throughout  his  school  working  life.

Although  school principals are allowed  to  apply

for  vacation  leave, I would  like  to  ask  this

question: why should it be necessary for  them  to

apply  at all? It is my view that the Ministry  of

Education should grant school principals a certain

number  of  days for an annual holiday during  the

school  vacation, so that they can  have  time  to

relax.  I  do  not think this matter requires  any

legislation  or  has to go through any  cumbersome

procedure,  nor  does it entail  any  negotiations

across  the  table. It is purely an administrative

matter  for the Minister for Education to  decide.

He  can,  in fact, even announce at any time  what

procedure  is  to be adopted in granting  vacation

leave to school principals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I wish to raise is this. Our

school teachers have a very crammed timetable,  as

the  Member for Jurong has pointed out. They  work

very  hard  during school hours, and even  outside

school  hours,  such  as engaging  in  extra-mural

activities. Therefore, during the school  holidays

they  do want to go somewhere for recreation,  but

there  is no place in the school for them to carry

out   legitimate  activities.  Teachers  are   not

allowed  to  go  to certain places and  there  are

other places which the teachers themselves ought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



not  to go. There are moral instructions like  the

Ten  Commandments of Moses in the Holy Bible which

say  that  thou shalt not do this, and thou  shalt

not  do that! Of course, all these rules are  well

intended. But it is too much to expect everyone to

be  a saint. This is attempting the impossible! No

doubt  education  is  a  great  enterprise  and  a

responsibility for the teachers. At this time when

civilisation  has  entered  the  space  age,  with

progress  and  advancement  constantly   made   in

various  fields,  the  teachers  must  also   keep

abreast of the times. They need time to learn  new

things  in  order  to  be  able  to  teach   their

students.  But,  as  I have pointed  out  earlier,

there  is a lack of places for teachers to go  to,

either  to learn or to relax. When a person  works

in  a very pleasant and favourable environment, he

will be able to make a greater contribution to his

work. Therefore, I would like to propose that  the

Government  build a Teachers Activity Centre  with

facilities, such as a library, a sports stadium, a

conference  hall, a swimming pool, etc.,  for  the

teachers  to  enjoy during the school holidays  or

outside  school  hours. With these facilities  the

teachers  will  be  able to  indulge  in  physical

exercise or study. This proposed centre will  also

provide a forum for discussion among teachers from

the various language streams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while we are encouraging our students to meet one another and to live in a common environment, we should also provide similar facilities for the teachers to do so. This is particularly necessary because in the present circumstances teachers from the various language

streams  have hardly any opportunity to  meet  one

another.  This  is  a  great disadvantage  in  our

present education system.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, you have one minute more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you. Sir.

If  the  Government builds an Activity Centre  for

teachers from all the various streams to meet,  to

get in touch with one another, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



play  games, or to discuss matters in common, I  am

sure  they will be able to learn a lot more on  how

to  teach.  This is better than taking  part  in  a

seminar. I do not know if the Minister agrees  with

me  on  this point. But I would, however,  like  to

point   this  out  -that  education  is   a   great

investment and the expenditure on it should only be

next  to  defence. Therefore, it is worth while  to

consider  building  an  Activity  Centre  for   the

teachers.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I have an amendment* here. I

think I had better not move it. I will continue  to

speak  under this subhead and give the  Minister  a

chance to answer.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The same amendment standing in the name of

Messrs. P. Govindaswamy, Yeo Choo Kok, Ho Kah Leong

and Tay Boon Too reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1005.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is therefore not

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> No. If the Minister were to

answer,  he  might miss some points. With  so  many

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am afraid they will be

"guillotined"!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

education  policy of the republic should  be  on  a

multilingual basis. I observed a statement  in  the

Straits  Times  of  6th  March,  1971,  by  Mr  K.

Govindasamy,  a  Colombo  Plan  expert,  where   he

mentioned  the  need to improve the Tamil  language

education  in  Singapore. I  am  pleased  that  our

Ministry  has replied to his questions. What  I  am

trying to bring up for our Minister's consideration

is   the  Tamil  language  textbooks  used  in  our

schools.  In spite of the fact that we have  gained

independence for five years, I wonder why the Tamil

language text-books



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



used here contain only facts regarding India

and  Malaysia. The teachings inside the texts  have

nothing  to  do  with the history of our  republic.

Personally,  I feel that the pupils  in  the  Tamil

stream must also be well informed of the happenings

in  their  country. Though I have no  objection  to

their learning the history of other countries.  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   these   are   two   Tamil   books

[indicating]  printed  by Manomoney  Villas,  Kuala

Lumpur.  Suppose we have such books  printed  here,

can  they  cross the causeway? I wish  to  ask  the

Minister that question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I hope our Minister will

consider is whether he can standardise the uniforms

used  by  our school children. School badges  alone

may  solve the identification problem, if there  is

any.  I  wish  to  bring  forward  this  suggestion

because   I  notice  that  whenever  a   pupil   is

transferred  from  one school to another,  in  most

cases   he   or  she  has  to  get  new   uniforms.

Personally, I feel this is a burden on  the  budget

of some poor families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also mention that there are teachers who

are  asked  to  do  jobs which  are  outside  their

teaching profession such as clerical duties and  so

forth. In doing so, I feel that the teachers cannot

do  their  best  in  carrying  out  their  teaching

profession, as their minds are filled with problems

to solve. This in turn will result in a poor output

of the students. I wish to ask the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What has the Ministry done to ensure that

integration  in  Government schools  is  taking

place true to the letter of the word? Does  the

Minister realize that integration is not  being

carried  out  in  many schools and  that  quite

often    principals   of   integrated   schools

themselves are not interested in integration?





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What does the Ministry of Education intend

to do to ease the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



load of extra-curricular activities particularly

on  the  Secondary I and II pupils? These pupils

have   to  attend  workshop  practice  sessions,

domestic  science  classes,  sports  activities,

uniformed group activities, and participation in

societies. As a result, expenses are incurred on

bus  fares, food etc, and the children are  also

being  over-strained. I would,  therefore,  urge

that  the  Ministry reconsider  the  matter  and

arrange  these  activities  within  the   normal

schooling hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can the load on extracurricular activities,

particularly in connection with watering of plants

or  gardening (the work of the gardener) be taken

off the shoulders of the teachers? Or if a teacher

is appointed to do that job, he should not be asked

to  take charge of other activities, such as  the

supervision of servants (which is the work of the

principals);   the  cleaning  up,  painting   and

attending to the repairs and maintenance  of  the

school building. How are the students to learn from

the teachers if the latter are so hard pressed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Has the Ministry any intention of sending

principals  and senior assistants  of  Government

schools in particular for refresher courses in good

manners,  politeness, etiquette, and professional

ethics,  so  that they would not take a  bullying

attitude  towards their staff, as is  the  common

practice now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) When the Prime Minister and the Education Minister visited the schools, there was a hive of

activities all of a sudden. Can the Minister,  or

the  Parliamentary Secretary or the  Director  of

Education make occasional spot checks on schools to

see that everything is going on smoothly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the above, there are inspectors of

schools  who are junior in rank to the Secondary

School Principals, and yet they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



are  detailed  to  check  on  the  schools.  It

appears  that  the inspectorate  has  become  a

joke. Inspectors are on a lower grade than  the

principals.  How can they control people  on  a

higher grade?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) It is a common sight to see overloaded

buses  for  school children. The Minister  must

listen to this. Have the police made any checks

on  these bus operators to ensure the safety of

the  children? These overloaded buses  carrying

school children are a common sight daily in the

Bukit Timah and Dunearn Road areas. I hope  the

Minister will have time to answer this point.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr L. P. Rodrigo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  refer  to  the  speech made by  the  Member  for

Moulmein.  He  has  made the point  that  there  is

nothing  unchaste about the question of money  with

teachers.   This  over-concern  has  succeeded   in

persuading even me to believe that there might be a

certain  unchastity  in  the teaching  profession's

preoccupation with monetary incentives. I think the

most  effective argument in the profession's  claim

for  monetary  award is not a relentless  complaint

against  official  inattention,  but  a  relentless

demonstration  of  professional expertise.  If  the

Member  for  Moulmein  and  the  Member  for  Telok

Blangah  can assist in moving the entire profession

to  achieve  distinctive standards  of  performance

without   allowing  an  over-concern   for   prompt

attention to monetary claims to cool their  ardour,

I  am  sure that the awards, if deserving  will  be

forthcoming.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> In the next world!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> In convincing the public and the

authorities  that teachers should  receive  greater

monetary awards, I think that nothing can  be  more

articulate  than  the achievement  of  professional

expertise  which is consonant with the  aspirations

of the nation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree

with  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for  Home  Affairs that the best selling point  for

teachers  is  for them to demonstrate  a  sense  of

professionalism.   This  was   amply   demonstrated

recently at the teachers' seminar sponsored by  the

Singapore Teachers' Union from the 27th of February

to  the 1st of March. The discussions were serious,

responsible  and intelligent. I do not dispute  the

question  of  whether  or  not  the  teachers   are

demonstrating  themselves  in  the  right  way.  My

grouse is that the teachers' claims are allowed  to

be forgotten because of some inefficient officials,

particularly  the  Treasury  officials,   who   are

holding up the matter. This is the point I wish  to

raise.  I do not think it is over the rationale  of

whether the teachers deserve the claims or  not.  I

am  afraid  this  issue  is  not  receiving  enough

attention   from  the  people  at  the   top,   and

everything is being left to the inefficiency,  very

narrow,  one-track mind of the Treasury  officials.

Before  I sit down, I just want to remark that  the

tone adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister  for  Home Affairs seems to  be  a  little

different  from  that  of last  year  when  he  was

sitting next to me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> With your indulgence, Sir, I wish to

make  one  comment on what the Member for  Moulmein

has  just said. I think the entire seminar that was

recently  held  merely demonstrated that  there  is

something lacking in the expertise of the  teaching

profession.  What  is  necessary  hereafter  is  to

remedy  the  shortcomings or the defects  that  are

current in the teaching profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards my position, Sir, when I was with the

Members  on  the  Back-benches  opposite,   I   had

consistently    maintained   that   the    foremost

consideration, in so far as teaching was concerned,

was  the  need  at  all  times  to  demonstrate   a

faultless  expertise in the profession. I  maintain

that such demonstration will continually serve as a

convincing  argument  for  any  claim  of  monetary

awards by the profession.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister for Education has only

ten minutes to reply to all the speeches.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister of Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Education (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, after listening to the speeches today

in  regard  to  education,  I  am  more  than  ever

convinced  that everyone here considers himself  to

be  an  expert on education. We have today listened

to  three  Members who are presidents of their  own

Teachers'  Unions and to an adviser of  a  workshop

committee. As far as I can see, they do not seem to

agree on anything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has complained that the

Ministry  of  Education does not know  what  it  is

doing   in  implementing  the  new  syllabus   and,

therefore, has to tell the principals, "Do what you

can."  On  the other hand, we have the  Member  for

Moulmein  saying that the officials in the Ministry

of  Education do not make use of the expertise  and

the professionalism of the teachers. There you are.

You  have  two of them differing! Who is  right?  I

will  go on now and try to answer within the  short

space  of  ten  minutes all the queries  raised  by

Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I will take the queries raised by the

Member  for  Sembawang. He asked why  there  was  a

delay in the implementation of the syllabus and the

distribution  of school textbooks. With  regard  to

the textbooks used in former years, I have received

no  complaints about delay in the implementation of

the new syllabus in the primary schools. To use his

own  words,  he  has  said  that  education  is  an

important  factor  in  our  national  life,   since

through education we should be able to educate  our

young  citizens in the skills which we  require  of

them in later life.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to give very careful consideration to

the  syllabus and the curriculum. And the delay  is

caused  by the fact that when I assumed the  duties

of   the  Minister  for  Education  some  time   in

September, I asked for a review of the syllabus and

during that period we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



put up a new one. I would say that we gave it every

consideration and were able to bring  out  the  new

syllabus  and  new textbooks to be  implemented  in

January in some instances in a few schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member was not here when the Minister of

State  for  Education replied to  the  question  on

relief  teachers.  Since I have  very  little  time

left,  I  will  have  to refer the  Member  to  the

Hansard, [Vol. 30, No. 9, cols. 537-41] and  if  he

will  read  carefully the reply given  therein,  he

will  know why it is not possible to employ  relief

teachers  on  a  permanent  basis.  I  think   that

disposes of the questions which the Member raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next come to the Member for Moulmein. 1 was

really serious when I said that I hoped that it was

not only the salary that motivates our teachers.  I

am  sure  it is not, because if it were only  money

that  motivates our teachers, we would not be  able

to  expand the educational service as we have done,

nor  would we be able to have such quality  in  the

educational service as we are having now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am most grateful to another ex-teacher in

joining  in  the  debate and  defending  the  stand

taken.  Let me repeat that in December we sent  our

recommendations with regard to the  discussions  we

had  with the Teachers' Unions on salary scales and

the terms and conditions of the teaching service to

the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the Member for Jurong, he said that we

should  not listen to experts. Well, I am listening

to  experts  and  I am listening to principals  and

teachers who are implementing the policy. There  is

dialogue  now.  There is dialogue between  Ministry

officials  and  members  of the  Teachers'  Unions,

principals and teachers. I am myself sitting on the

committee which is reviewing the objectives of  our

educational policy from time to time. So  there  is

this  discussion going on and we are trying to  get

right down to the root of the matter and hope  that

by doing so the teaching profession will be able to

display professional excellence in education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Was that the term the

Parliamentary Secretary used?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Professional expertise!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes, professional expertise.

Through  the `officials of the Teachers' Unions,  I

would  ask  the teachers to speak up  and  give  us

their professional expertise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of reviewing the

present  staffing quota raised by  the  Member  for

Jurong,  I would like it to be made known that,  on

the average, the teachers in Singapore are asked to

do about 18 hours of work per week compared with 22

hours elsewhere. So in no way can we say that  they

are overworked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as extra-curricular activities are

concerned,  the Member for Anson made a  suggestion

that  teachers  should not be  asked  to  undertake

these activities. I wonder whether the Member would

like  people from outside the schools to  take  the

schoolboys in football, cricket or scouting.  These

activities,   I  would  think,  go  together   with

teaching, and as far as extra-curricular activities

are  concerned,  like gardening  and  watering  the

plants,  we  have  no end of volunteers  among  the

teachers themselves to lead our boys.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to make is that

in  spite  of  the  fact that our teachers  on  the

average  are  given only 18 hours of  work  a  week

compared with 22 hours elsewhere, they are, on  the

whole, paid very well compared with the salaries of

teachers elsewhere. If I am not mistaken, they  are

the  best-paid teachers in Southeast Asia. In spite

of that, we are reviewing the conditions of service

and  the salary structure to see in what way we can

give  them that little bit of incentive by bringing

in  what  the Member for Moulmein has described  as

being  "unchaste",  namely, the question  of  money

incentives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of medical benefits for aided-school staff, they are enjoying the same benefits.

The  only  thing now is that there are  not  enough

wards in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



the  General  Hospital. The benefits  which  should

have  been  extended  to  the  families  are  being

withheld  until  my  colleague,  the  Minister  for

Health, has sufficient ward space.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> The

Association has agreed on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, to come to the Member for

Paya  Lebar, the question of the retirement age  is

governed by the Pensions Ordinance and the Pensions

Regulations  and they are the same for officers  in

the  educational  service as for  officers  in  the

administrative  service. They have  all  been  made

common.  They  retire at the age of 55.  There  are

certain  instances under certain regulations  which

allow  officers to retire at the age of 60. I think

we  have  done everything we can to regularise  the

position   as  far  as  the  teaching  service   is

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also proposed that Government should

build  a  centre where teachers can  go  and  enjoy

themselves. One of the reasons he gave was that  in

this  way there would be a place for teachers  from

all  the language streams to get together and  know

one  another.  I think there are enough  places  in

Singapore  for people of every walk of life  to  go

and  enjoy themselves. I was very surprised  indeed

to  hear  from  him  that there  is  a  prohibition

against teachers going to certain places. I am  not

aware that the Ministry of Education -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Bars!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I would not like to see a

teacher frequenting a bar. But there is nothing  to

stop  a  teacher  from going to  a  bar  if  he  so

desires. I can assure Members that I will not  take

action.  But if he goes there every day and becomes

a drunkard, then action will be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member mentioned that there are certain

places  where the teachers themselves would not  go

and  I would think that a bar is a place where  the

teachers themselves would not go. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



far  as I am aware, there is nothing to prohibit  a

teacher from enjoying himself in any way he  likes.

The only thing is that he must know that he holds a

responsible  position as a teacher and is  expected

to  set  a  good example. Beyond that there  is  no

prohibition from the Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have answered most of the questions raised by Backbenchers. As the Member for Anson has said, since four or five Members have raised so many questions, perhaps there may be one or two which I have missed out. If I have and if there is time and if the Member can repeat the

question or point for clarification, I do not  mind

answering.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister has not answered the important question on

Tamil textbooks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> With regard to the question of

Tamil textbooks from India and Malaysia, I think it

is  right  that  we should teach our  people  about

Singapore.   But   do  we  have  the   professional

expertise  to write a book on this subject?  If  we

have, then by all means use it. Otherwise, use  the

best   books  that  are  available.  And  the  best

available  at  the moment are Tamil textbooks  from

Malaysia  and India. We are doing the revision.  In

the  meanwhile, in the civics course, we will  tell

them more about Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, that is not the point.

The  books are printed in Kuala Lumpur. But suppose

a  book  is  printed in Singapore, can  we  get  it

across the causeway?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, it is not within my power

to say yes or no.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> But why cannot the textbooks

be printed in Singapore? What is the difficulty?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was saving

that with a population of two million people, if we

think we have experts on every subject, then we are

going  to  be very disappointed indeed. I think  we

should cull the best from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



all over the world. As far as textbooks, syllabuses

and  curricula are concerned, we will  do  what  we

can. But we must also be aware of the fact that  it

is  not  possible for us or for any nation  of  two

million  or even 20 million people to do everything

themselves  and  to  find  the  best  possible   of

everything in their own country.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> It is only a matter of

translating from English to Tamil. That is all  and

that is not difficult.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> If it were that simple, I am

sure  my experts would have told me. But they  say,

"Let us use the best books available." And the best

available books at the moment, as far as the  Tamil

language  is  concerned,  come  from  Malaysia  and

India. Therefore, we make use of the best available

books.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I think

the  Minister has misunderstood what the Member for

Anson   was   trying   to  say   about   extramural

activities. It is not a question of teachers taking

charge of football, scouting or netball. These  are

the  normal extramural activities which  they  must

perform.  That is accepted. What they are  grousing

about  is that they have to do things outside their

normal  scope of duties; like the savings  campaign

where they have to become postmasters or what  have

you.  This  definitely is not within  their  normal

function  even  if they have to take up  extramural

activities. Other examples are the health campaign,

the  gardening  campaign, and  some  time  ago  the

Ministry  informed the schools to set  up  advisory

committees where principals must become secretaries

of committees, and overnight everybody had to start

looking  around for about 10 to 12 persons who  are

education-conscious  citizens  to  look  after  the

interest  of each school. These advisory committees

have  to be set up everywhere and the teachers have

to  serve tea during meetings and things like that.

The   point  is  not  extra-mural  activities  that

normally should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



done   by  teachers.  It  is  this  sort  of   non-professional   extramural   activities   that   the

teachers are grousing about.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the Member for Moulmein has

clarified what is in the minds of the teachers with

regard  to  extra-curricular activities, that  they

are  being asked to perform duties above and beyond

what  is  required  of them. Among  the  activities

mentioned  there are some which are  desirable  for

the   teachers   as  well  as  for   the   students

themselves, for instance, the habit of  saving  and

maintaining a beautiful garden. I myself appreciate

gardens but, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a point  to

be  made here, that we do become engrossed in  some

of  the national campaigns in which we are engaged.

Here,  I  blame  not so much the enthusiasm  of  my

colleagues  in pushing these campaigns and  getting

the  teachers to help, but the professional experts

that we have in the Ministry of Education, because,

in  trying  to  keep  in  line  with  the  national

campaigns,  they  are apt to forget  what  are  the

priorities  in the Ministry of Education.  If  they

are  very clear in their minds that those  are  the

priorities,  that  those are the things  which  the

Ministry of Education should be engaged in and they

give their professional or expert advice, then  the

Minister for Education would be able to say,  "Yes,

but do we have the time or is it desirable that  we

do this and that?" Once the objective has been set,

and   the   priorities  have  been  defined,   this

complaint  will  stop. I am going  down  among  the

teachers,  the  specialists, inspectors  and  trade

unionists  to find out their views, and  what  they

think  should be the objective of the  Ministry  of

Education, and what are the priorities; what we can

do and what we cannot do. This is where I want them

to  speak  up  because once I have  got  all  these

opinions, we will be able to sit down and  discuss,

and  we  will  put  right  what  the  Ministry   of

Education  is expected to do; what it can  do,  and

cannot do, and in what way we can help the national

effort wherever it is required.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am very glad that the Minister for Education  is

sincere  in  having a dialogue with  the  Teachers'

Unions and in hearing from them. It is a good thing

that  our  Minister for Education does not  believe

too  much in experts. I raised the point last  year

that  the  Minister should simplify the  attendance

registers, a job which actually wastes a lot of the

teachers'  time.  This  is  the  point  which   the

Minister has not answered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I have looked into the

particulars required of the register. I cannot  see

how  we  can  make  it simpler, because  all  those

particulars are important and are necessary for the

purposes   of  awarding  scholarships  or   knowing

whether  the  student qualifies  for  remission  of

school  fees;  whether or not  he  is  a  Singapore

citizen;  when  he was born, etc.  The  Member  for

Jurong  is a teacher himself. Can he tell  me  what

items  should have been left Out from the  register

of students?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

discussed  this matter with the Member for  Jurong.

Can  I take this opportunity to reply on his behalf

and  clarify  to the Minister what is  meant  by  a

simplification  of the register?  It  is  not  that

these  particulars  are  not  important.  They  are

important  and  they  must be  kept.  I  think  the

complaint  is,  why  should  these  particulars  be

filled  year  in  and year out? A  child  is  in  a

primary  school for six years, and every  year  the

parent has to fill in the same particulars. I think

some  parents  are greatly annoyed  when  they  are

asked to bring their identity cards and citizenship

papers every year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I have been informed by my

Minister of State that the parents are not required

to fill those particulars every year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> As regards filling those

particulars, there can be a more efficient  way  of

doing  it.  There can be a kind of index where  you

fill

in the child's particulars only once and not six

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the matter I am going to raise is not a new one, and I hope the Minister will not refer me to the Hansard. This matter has been raised and answered from time to time in this House, but has remained unsettled outside it. This is the problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



of  posting  primary  school leavers  to  secondary

schools.  My  constituency is not  one  where  many

parents  have chauffeur-driven cars to  take  their

children  to  and from school. I notice  that  many

primary school leavers in my constituency have been

posted  to  secondary schools far away  from  their

homes  because  of  their poor performance  in  the

Primary School Leaving Examination. In many  cases,

these  children fared badly because  their  parents

could  not provide them with capable private tutors

to  help  them. Furthermore, they have to  work  to

help  their parents make a living, or they have  to

work  in  the  house, such as taking  care  of  the

younger  brothers and sisters. As a  result,  their

studies  are  not  up  to  the  standard  of  those

children  of  the rich. As such, if we  post  these

poor  children with poor performance  to  secondary

schools which are far away from their homes, we are

in  fact  penalising them for  being  poor.  It  is

unfair  for the receiving secondary schools,  which

are  mostly  in  rural  areas,  to  take  in  these

unfortunate students unless these schools have been

designed   by   the   Ministry  of   Education   as

substandard   schools  to  accommodate   the   weak

students  who are in many cases victims of  poverty

and  circumstances. If that is the case, we are not

educating  our  young  ones  but  are,   in   fact,

classifying and discriminating against them. I hope

this   is  not  the  policy  of  the  Ministry   of

Education.  By  posting  these  poor  children   to

schools far away from their homes, we are, in fact,

imposing  psychological and financial  pressure  on

many  students  and their parents. This  matter  of

posting  has become more serious and acute  in  the

light  of  the Government's intention to allow  the

bus  fares to go up from the minimum of five  cents

to ten cents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would request the Minister to tell the

House  what steps he is planning to take to  ensure

that  no  unnecessary hardships on both the parents

and  the  students are created by  this  policy  of

posting students to secondary schools far away from

their homes in the future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,

the purpose of education is to bring up a person to

be  a  useful citizen who can contribute to society

and  the nation. Of course, we should not disregard

the  requirements of our realities and bring  up  a

lot  of people who are of no use to the country  or

society.  Old concepts have already given place  to

new concepts. At the moment, we are implementing bi-

or  tri-lateral education systems. That is to  say,

we  have an Arts stream as well as a Science stream

in   the  academic  system  of  education.  In  the

technical  system of education, we have  vocational

and  technical streams. This, of course, is of  use

at  the  present juncture, but if we  classify  the

systems  of education too early, that is, make  the

students specialise in certain subjects too  early,

it  may not be of long-term benefit to them  or  to

our  country, because we may produce arts  scholars

without  any  knowledge  of science  or  scientists

without any taste for art, or craftsmen without any

literary  taste.  We  may produce  some  scientific

"Frankensteins"! So I hope the Ministry will ponder

over this in their plans at this juncture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years we have been struggling for a

rugged society. Therefore, physical education is  a

very important subject in schools. Though there are

about  15  weeks in a term and every week there  is

one period for physical education, if there are now

and   then   conferences  on  physical   education,

tournaments and sports meets and so on  and  P.  E.

teachers are required to attend to them, how can we

give  the students any time for physical education?

For  smaller  schools, the students  will  have  no

proper P.E, lessons throughout the year. How can we

train  our  students  and  bring  out  their   good

physical qualities at all? I hope the Minister  can

remedy this situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the compilation of textbooks, since

they  are used as a means of teaching, the contents

and  the form are important, and progressive  steps

of  learning and other cogent considerations should

also be borne in mind. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



should   meet  the  requirements  of  students   of

different  ages  and  of  different  standards   to

achieve definite effects. The contents should be of

a realistic nature, meeting the requirements of the

time  so as to attain the ends of education.  Also,

the  textbooks should be reasonable  in  price  and

should  not  be  changed every year or  allowed  to

increase  in  price freely, because that  would  be

giving parents an additional financial burden.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member  for Delta is aware of the criteria  we  use

for posting children to secondary schools, since he

says  that although the matter has been raised time

and time again in this House, nothing has happened.

I  would  like to ask him what sort of criteria  he

would  use  and,  by using them, whether  he  could

guarantee  that  there would  be  no  hardship.  No

matter  what criteria we use, there would  be  some

hardship. The only way we can resolve this hardship

is  to  build a secondary school in every  area  in

Singapore,  let us say about a quarter  of  a  mile

from  each  other. Then we can solve that  problem.

But  is this desirable? Is it possible to do  that?

Can we do that? Therefore, since we cannot do that,

the  best  we  can do is to select the criteria  by

which  we  post the students to secondary  schools.

One  of  the criteria is that we try to avoid  this

difficulty of transport as far as possible so that,

everything being equal, we would give the  students

a  place  nearest his home. So I will say this:  no

matter  what  criteria  we  use,  there  would   be

hardship among the poor.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not the

Minister  for Education and, therefore,  I  do  not

have experts to help me. If I were the Minister for

Education, I would give the criteria.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, let me tell the Member

that, as Minister for Education, any criteria  that

we  use,  there  will  be  this  problem.  And  the

criteria  that  we  use  now  do  not  discriminate

against the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



poor.  I think the Member for Delta must have  read

somewhere that the Minister of Defence has  made  a

rough  analysis and found that most of  the  bright

students  who have won scholarships have come  from

poor  families. So the criteria that we use do  not

discriminate  against the poor at all.  The  Member

will find that most of the poor children are posted

to the school of their first choice. So the problem

would   arise  among  those  who  can  afford   the

transport.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think  that is true, because in one of my meet-the-people  sessions the people who came to see  me  to

ask  for  transfers for their children  were  poor.

They  did not want their children to be transferred

to  schools such as the Toh Tuck School  at  Jurong

Road, as it is too far away.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, if I remember rightly,

about  98  per  cent of these children  were  given

places  of  their first choice. So the  Member  has

only heard from the two per cent, and not from  the

98  per cent who were satisfied. This is the  usual

case in meet-the-people sessions. So unless we have

a set of criteria by which we can reduce the number

of  disappointed people to below two  per  cent,  I

think we will stick to the present criteria.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong was afraid that we might

ask  the students - correct me if I am wrong  -  to

specialise  too early. I am not aware of  this.  On

the  other  hand, he said that we  could  not  have

rugged citizens if we gave them only one period  of

physical exercise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, perhaps due

to   the   interpretation,  there  has  been   some

misunderstanding. What I meant was that because the

teachers in charge of physical education very often

are  called  away for meetings or to take  part  in

certain  activities, the time  they  have  left  to

teach   physical   education   is   very   limited.

Therefore, the students do not have enough time for

physical education. In this way, how can we  expect

them to become rugged?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, this is more an exception

than  the rule. Probably he has one or two isolated

cases in mind. It is not the policy of the Ministry

to  interfere  with the school time-table  that  is

already  set  out,  or  to  call  up  teachers  for

meetings  when  they  should be  teaching  physical

education. But if any principal does such a  thing,

he will not remain a principal for long.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, extra-curricular activities have been

implemented  in  our schools for  many  years,  but

there   are   certain   aspects   which   are   not

satisfactory. I would like to avail myself of  this

opportunity   to  raise  this  question   for   the

consideration of the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, concerning the allocation of marks

for  extra-curricular  activities,  the  system  of

marking was originally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



not   quite  reasonable.  Later,  because  of   the

opinions   advanced   by   the   various   teaching

professions and organisations, this system has been

improved  and been found to be more reasonable.  As

marks   earned  by  students  for  extra-curricular

activities  may  be  taken into consideration  when

they apply for admission to Pre-University classes,

they  therefore  pay very great attention  to  this

system   of  marking,  although  the  Ministry   of

Education does not pay too much attention to it.  I

say  this because the Ministry has not sent anybody

to  the  various  schools to see how  these  extra-curricular  activities are carried out or  how  the

marking  is  done.  This  invariably  leads  to   a

situation  where some schools, in order  to  enable

their  students  to  join  Pre-University  classes,

award  more  marks to them. This is very  dangerous

because it will lead to anomalies and unfairness. I

hope  the  Minister  will  pay  attention  to  this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in many schools there are extra-curricular activities of an academic nature. In

almost  every  school there is  a  certain  set  of

characteristics  or features and  these  vary  from

school to school. So the students do not know which

one  to choose. And finally when it comes to extra-curricular  periods, you will  find  that  actually

they  are  not  being made full  use  of.  This  is

because there is no definite scheme or standard set

by  the Ministry. I hope there can be some guidance

to  enable  the teachers to know how  these  extra-mural activities should be conducted, and how  they

could help them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is about the distribution of work-load in respect of extra-curricular activities.

There  are  some teachers who need not have  to  be

burdened   with   this,  while  others   arc   made

responsible  for many such activities. They  cannot

complain to anybody because the right to assign the

work  is  in the hands of the principal.  They  can

only  stomach this complaint because there  is  the

confidential  report on them by  the  principal.  I

hope  the  Minister  will take measures  to  remedy

this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  standard  of athletics of any country  depends

mainly on the students' efforts. Whether or not  it

reaches international standard again depends on the

students themselves. At the present moment,  sports

and   athletic  activities  in  the   primary   and

secondary  schools  are  directed  by  the   Extra-curricular  Activities Centre of  the  Ministry  of

Education.   But  from  the  athletic   meets   and

competitions  held  every  year  in   primary   and

secondary  schools, we find that  the  interest  of

students in physical education and sports seems  to

have  declined,  and their performance  is  not  so

ideal  as we would expect it to be. This is because

the  officers in charge of implementing the  extra-curricular  activities have not adopted a  positive

attitude.  They  think that as long  as  they  have

organised some sports or games for some schools  to

take  part  they have discharged their duties,  and

are  not  worried about the standard of performance

or results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, the inspectorate in charge

of  physical  education has divided  the  whole  of

Singapore  into districts, each district  with  one

sports  council and with the school  principals  in

the  district  as ex-officio members. Whenever  the

council meets, these school principals wou1d do all

the  talking and planning, leaving out  the  sports

teachers, who are in actual charge of sports.  They

could only sit behind the principals to observe and

listen  to  what  their  principals  have  to  say,

instead of speaking their minds on the subject with

which  they are more conversant. There is no  doubt

that  some principals have some knowledge of sports

and  physical education, but by and large  most  of

them  know  very little about it. So if sports  and

physical  education is to be left in the  hands  of

such  principals, it is like trying to catch a fish

up  a tree, i.e., attempting the impossible. Sports

activities,  as laid down by the council,  normally

are  dealt  with superficially, and  the  teachers,

therefore,  will  always be  confronted  with  some

technical  problems in the course  of  implementing

these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



activities.  As  a  result, the reaction  from  the

students  cannot be properly checked. Each  time  a

sports meet or some kind of competition is held  in

any  district, the students who form the spectators

are  very small in number. Very few would  want  to

see  such games or sports meets. It is just a  case

of   competitors   and  officials  performing   for

themselves with hardly any spectators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to take immediate remedial action on this. I feel that only those persons who have knowledge and experience and proper training should be allowed to take charge of physical education and sports activities of the students, and not allow such matters to be put into

the  hands of inexperienced school principals. Only

then will we be able better to implement cur policy

in the field of sports and athletic activities.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

interesting to hear from the Member for Paya  Lebar

that  some teachers are not interested in  sporting

activities. I think there is a mission for him,  as

president  of  a  teachers' union to  inculcate  an

interest  in sporting activities among the teachers

when   he   meets  them.  In  some  way,   he   has

misunderstood  the  organisational  set-up   of   a

school. When you appoint a man to be a principal of

a  school,  he  is responsible for all  the  school

activities.  If  he  is a good principal,  he  will

choose   a   man  who  is  experienced  in   E.C.A.

activities  to  run  those  activities  and   those

experienced  in sports to run sporting  activities.

However,  if  we were to make the sports  secretary

responsible  for sports activities  in  the  school

without  being  responsible to  the  principal,  we

would have a situation when the principal might  be

holding, let us say, a session in the hall and  the

sports  secretary might be calling for the students

to  take part in sporting activities outside. There

is  more  than  one leader. There are  two  leaders

there. So from an organisational point of view,  it

is   not   desirable  that  the  school's  sporting

activities should be run by a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



person who is not responsible to the principal. I

agree that it must be run by someone who

understands what he is doing. We are running

classes for those who will be taking the lead in

extra-curricular activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Jurong who is

dissatisfied  with the grading of  extra-curricular

marks. I would like to inform the Member that there

has been a revision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> rose -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister has given way. Mr Ho.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  did  not mean that. At first the marking  system

was in a state of confusion, but after adopting the

suggestions  of  the  teaching  organisations,  the

system  has been improved. What I mean is that  the

Ministry has not been paying much attention to  the

marking  system of various schools.  The  situation

should be improved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It is our duty to see that any

marking  is  fairly made. We do send out inspectors

from  time to time, but it is not possible to  send

them  to  every school. Here again, I come  to  the

question of whether we have a competent man to be a

principal  of  a  school.  If  he  is  a  competent

principal,  complaints  of  this  nature  will  not

arise. Here again, both the trade unionists and the

Ministry of Education have a mission to accomplish,

and  that  is  to bring expertise and knowledge  to

bear on people holding a special post like that  of

a principal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  wish  to make a clarification. The Minister  has

misunderstood what I said. Maybe he  did  not  hear

what  I  said.  What I said was that  the  district

sporting activities are organised by principals who

know nothing about sports. I am not saying that the

teachers  are not interested in sports. What  I  am

saying is that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



sporting   activities  should,   be   planned   and

organised  by  a committee of sports  teachers  and

those who know sports. For instance, there may well

be  a  sports programme where you have a 100 metres

dash as the first event and the next event will  be

a  400 metres race then you have all the events  in

short distance running crammed together.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am sorry if I have

misunderstood  the Member for Paya Lebar.  I  quite

understand the example which he has quoted. It  has

happened. I am not at all surprised at this because

there  has  been  such  a  terrific  expansion   in

sporting  activities. However, both the  principals

and  sports  secretaries  are  in  the  process  of

learning.  As  long as they learn and  improve  the

next time, I do not mind. One has to start learning

at  some time. As long as they are learning,  I  am

quite satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister has not answered another question.  I

have asked him whether the Ministry of Education is

prepared  to conduct courses so that teachers  will

be  taught  how to run extra-curricular  activities

better than they are now doing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I thought I had replied to his

question  by  saying that we are  running  relevant

courses for those who are taking classes in  extra-curricular  activities.  Of  course,  when  we  run

classes  we hope that those attending will  improve

in  time.  The idea of running classes is  to  give

teachers  the technical know-how. If the Member  is

patient, he will be able to see the fruits  of  our

endeavours in due course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in the Memorandum on the

Estimates  of Revenue and Expenditure of Singapore,

it  is  stated that the deletion of 111  specialist

teacher  posts,  for  which grade  recruitment  has

ceased,  has resulted in a saving of $1,237,360.  I

presume  that this reduction is to be  found  under

the  three subheads that I have mentioned just now.

The  question  is whether there will  be  any  more

recruitment  of specialist teachers  from  now  on.

Sir,  I  also  want  to know the  position  of  the

present  incumbents  of  these  specialist  teacher

posts. Have they all retired or have those who  are

still in service lost their specialist allowances?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the complaints that we often hear from

teachers  is  that  there is a  lack  of  promotion

prospects  in the education service. There  are  no

opportunities  to move from one grade  to  another.

The  teachers  have always claimed  that  the  vast

majority of them, in fact, about 90 or 95 per  cent

of  them,  would  begin and  end  their  career  as

teachers. There is no possibility of even  a  small

fraction  of them becoming principals or inspectors

of  schools.  That being the case, it appears  that

now  even  the  opportunity for  some  teachers  to

become specialist teachers has been denied. Can the

Minister   inform  the  House  who  the  specialist

teachers   were,  and  why  the  posts  have   been

abolished once and for all?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my brief tells

me  that  the  recruitment of  specialist  teachers

ceased  in 1958. There has been no more recruitment

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



specialist teachers since then. Except  for  24  of

them, all have left the service. Presumably most of

them retired, some may have died, and some may have

joined other services. The present position is that

24  of them are in the service. They have not  lost

their  pension nor have they lost their  specialist

allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint that 90 or 95 per

cent of the teachers begin and end their career  as

teachers, this is not surprising. There is always a

pyramid in any profession. If the pyramid is put at

a  hundred per cent, you get about ten per cent who

can  go  to  the  top. I think that  is  very  good

indeed.  I do not know how we can make it  possible

for  the 90 per cent of the teachers to go  to  the

top  of  the  pyramid. I do not think that  in  any

service  it is possible for the top of the  pyramid

to contain 90 per cent of those who join it. As far

as  I know, there is going to be no recruitment  of

specialist  teachers. Anyway, the Teachers'  Unions

and  the  Ministry have been discussing avenues  of

promotion  and  the  restructuring  of  the  salary

scales.  Once  the  recommendations  are  accepted,

there  will be avenues for promotion for  teachers.

The system will be such that in promoting a teacher

to  become a principal, we do not at the same  time

lose  a good teacher and gain a bad principal. That

is  the  principle  on which we will  work  on  all

promotion schemes. It will be possible for  a  good

teacher  who really likes teaching and is a  credit

to the profession to remain as a teacher and yet be

given   recognition.  If  he  is  a  good  teacher,

probably  he need not be promoted to be a principal

or  an  official in the Education Ministry in order

to  enjoy  a  pay  which  is equivalent  or  almost

equivalent  to that which a principal and  Ministry

officials  enjoy.  We will make teaching  a  worth-while  career  in the restructuring of  the  salary

scales.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I partly accept the

Minister's   explanation.   The   recruitment    of

specialist  teachers stopped  in  1958.  I  am  not

quarrelling about that. I thought the Minister said

that  in a pyramid you could never have 90 per cent

of  those in service right at the top. I agree with

him entirely on that point, but you do not have  in

any  service  90 per cent remaining  right  at  the

bottom  either.  It  must be  a  pyramid  which  is

correctly structured from the base to the  apex.  I

think the Ministry acknowledges this fact. That  is

why the Minister himself has said just now that the

Ministry   is  looking  into  the  possibility   of

providing more promotion prospects. If that is  the

case, I gladly withdraw this amendment. However, we

have to make the pyramid sharper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, if the pyramid is sharper,

there  will  be a smaller percentage going  to  the

top.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I mean broader, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> A pyramid depends upon the base.

If  we have a broader base, then we have more  room

at  the top. But here again it all depends. We have

about 17,003 to 18,003 teachers in the service, and

we  cannot  expect more than 10 per  cent  to  hold

really  high posts. Otherwise we will have so  many

generals and so few soldiers. Anyway, it is in  the

interest of Singapore and the Ministry of Education

to  see  that the teachers are relatively satisfied

with  their conditions of service. They should have

enough  of  what has been described as an  unchaste

subject -money. At the same time, we must also keep

our sense of perspective to see that people are not

promoted  beyond  their  capacity.  We  will   make

available  all  avenues  of promotion  commensurate

with  their  service. This has been  occupying  our

attention in the Ministry for some time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1158.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the problem of the shortage of

graduate  teachers in secondary  schools  has  been

with  the  Ministry of Education for  more  than  a

decade, and non-graduate teachers have been playing

a  very important role in the secondary schools  in

the  last decade. I am just wondering whether, with

the  intention of improving the system  of  teacher

training  and  the  talk  about  setting   up   the

Institute  of  Education, the  Ministry  will  take

immediate  steps to conduct Bachelor  of  Education

courses to enable serving teachers to take up  such

courses  so  that they can move from their  present

status of non-graduate teachers to that of graduate

teachers.  This  not  only provides  an  additional

incentive to the teaching profession, but  I  think

it  also  helps  to serve a need in  our  secondary

schools where the question of constant upgrading of

professional expertise is very essential.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we understand

that  everybody wants to improve himself, not least

the teachers. We will explore every avenue possible

to  see  that  the ambitious teacher who  wants  to

better  qualify himself for his job should  have  a

way  by  which  he can upgrade his  skill  and  his

position in the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Institute of Education. I would

like  to take this opportunity to inform the  House

that  when  I assumed the post of the Minister  for

Education, the Institute of Education Bill had been

read  the  First  time and I took  it  through  the

Second   and  Third  Readings.  Since   then,   the

officials   of  my  Ministry  and  I   have   given

considerable thought to whether we should go  ahead

with  the setting up of the Institute of Education.

I must confess that I have second thoughts about it

because the circumstances then prevailing have  now

changed.  On going through the experience of  other

countries where they have the degree of Bachelor of

Education, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



find  that  there were some very critical  comments

made on the setting up of an Institute of Education

purely to give a degree in education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here the remarks of a well-known British

educationist, Professor G. Taylor, who wrote in  an

article  in  The Times Educational Supplement  that

"the setting up of the Bachelor of Education degree

course is a flagrant example of the current fashion

among educationists and intellectuals to decide now

and  think later." I would like to learn from  this

statement  and  I prefer to think now  rather  than

later.  I  think there will be a delay,  if  not  a

postponement, in the setting up of the Institute of

Education. But I would like to assure officials  of

the   Singapore   Teachers'  Union   as   well   as

Backbenchers  that this will in  no  way  stop  the

upgrading  of skills and the training of  teachers.

In  fact, we will be taking over some, if not  all,

of  the  functions which are now undertaken in  the

School  of Education in the University of Singapore

so  that  there  will be sufficient facilities  for

those who want to better themselves to take up  the

necessary  course  of education  in  the  Teachers'

Training College itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for

Education whether he is aware that his Ministry  is

violating  one of the provisions in the Instruction

Manual  which stipulates that no acting appointment

should  exceed  more than a year. In his  Ministry,

for  example, some principals act for  as  long  as

three  years.  I just do not understand  it.  Civil

servants  cannot  violate  the  provisions  in  the

Instruction   Manual  without  any   penalty.   The

Ministry  of  Education is getting away  with  this

without any penalty.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that a few months ago, applications

were invited from teachers for promotion posts  and

nothing  has happened after that. We would like  to

know   what  is  the  progress  of  this  promotion

exercise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a law-abiding citizen and I dislike violating anything,

much   less  the  Instruction  Manual  of  my   own

Ministry.  However.  I think  there  are  practical

difficulties  in not violating the  provision  and,

allowing  acting appointments to exceed  more  than

one  year  largely  because of  the  difficulty  of

finding the requisite people to fill the posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of filling the posts of

principals  of  primary schools, as  Members  know,

appointments and promotion exercises  do  not  come

within  the  purview of the Ministry of  Education.

This is done by the Public Service Commission. I am

given to understand that the usual process has been

completed and it is likely that the candidates will

be called for interview some time next month.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, as regards promotion

posts   such   as  the  posts  of  principals   and

Inspectors  of  Schools, it is not  a  question  of

difficulty  in getting experienced people  to  fill

them. I think it is because promotion exercises are

not   held   regularly.  I  accept  the  Minister's

explanation that this matter is outside the purview

of  the  Ministry of Education and  that  it  is  a

matter for the Public Service Commission. I suppose

that  the  P.S.C, which deals with recruitment  and

promotion  exercises  for the whole  civil  service

always  faces the problem of finding  the  time  to

have  regular promotion exercises for the  Ministry

of  Education. In view of this practical difficulty

and since the Ministry is big and a large number of

personnel are involved, like the Police which has a

separate  commission dealing with staff matters,  I

wonder  whether the Minister will consider  setting

up  a separate education service commission dealing

with recruitment as well as promotion exercises for

members of the teaching profession.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1193.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the term "supernumerary" really bugs me.

Previously  I  had two amendments on similar  posts

which  I  withdrew  under  the  head  Ministry   of

Education.  Throughout  the  Estimates,  I   notice

Office   Boys  (Supernumerary),  Clerical  Officers

(Supernumerary),        Clerical         Assistants

(Supernumerary), etc. For the first time,  we  have

"Teachers. Non-Graduates (Supernumerary)",  889  of

them,  and not just one or two of them as requested

in  other  Ministries. Last  year,  there  were  no

estimates  for  this special brand of supernumerary

teachers.   The  amount  required   for   them   is

$3,354,000. I would like the Minister  to  tell  me

who  these  supernumerary teachers  are.  Sir,  the

substitute  relief teachers cannot be supernumerary

teachers   because  under  subhead  2118,   another

$2,403,000   is   asked  for   "Substitute   Relief

Teachers".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the teaching service, we already have too many

different  types  of  teachers.  We  have  graduate

teachers,   teachers  in  the   General   Education

Department, vocational teachers, technical teachers

and to this multitude of categories in the last few

years.  Two  more  categories have  been  included,

i.e.,  the substitute relief teachers and Teachers,

Non-Graduates  (Supernumerary).  What   are   these

Teachers,  Non-Graduates (Supernumerary),  expected

to teach?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,

"supernumerary" here is a term used by the Ministry

of  Finance.  I believe, to warn the Department  or

the  Ministry concerned that you have  more  bodies

than  they  think you should have. If Members  will

refer  to subhead 1158, they will see that in 1970-71 we had an establishment of 2.223 whereas for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



1971-72 we are given an establishment of 2,056.  In

other words, there is a difference of 100-odd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, under subhead 1192. Members will find

that  for 1970-71 we had an establishment of 7,797,

whereas  for  1971-72 we are given an establishment

of 6,997. In the eyes of the Treasury, there should

be  a paring down of the number of teachers in  the

Ministry   of  Education.  In  other  words,   they

estimate that we have too many bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, I would like to take the

opportunity  also to explain that the  Treasury  do

have  a  case in that we are having too many bodies

in  the  Ministry. This is so if you  consider  the

situation  as a whole, but, in actual  fact,  there

are  not too many bodies for the simple reason that

there  has been a terrific expansion in the English

stream.  We  are very short of teachers there.  But

there  has  not  been this expansion  in  the  non-English  streams,  with the  result  that  we  have

excess bodies there.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these excess bodies in most cases cannot be

used  to  do the work in the English stream.  As  a

result of this, we have to pare down the number. It

will  not be that easy to get extension -would like

the Member for Paya Lebar to pay close attention to

this  -  for  those  who are  due  for  retirement.

Because  of the shortage of teachers it  was  quite

easy  to  get  an extension of three years  in  the

first instance after the retiring age from 55 years

until  58  years.  After that, another  two  years'

extension, and then a further extension  from  year

to year till he is 65 years old. But now we are not

given  SO large an establishment, so we have to  be

very  careful about giving extension  and  have  to

justify every post that we fill. I hope that  gives

the  Member a clear picture of what a supernumerary

post  is.  It  is not a super human  being  in  the

Ministry of Education!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1196.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under this subhead I wish to touch upon the plight of the Tamil teachers in the teaching service. During the past seven years the salaries of Tamil teachers have been brought up to the same level as that of the teachers in the other streams, and the anomalies have been done away

with.   During  the  terms  of  the  previous   two

Ministers  for  Education, much has  been  done  to

improve the terms and conditions of service of  the

Tamil teachers. Now I can say that they are more or

less in parity with their counterparts in the other

streams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to point out that there are a few

disparities  in  the facilities  allowed  to  Tamil

teachers as compared with the teachers in the other

streams.  Firstly, the retraining of  the  S.S.L.C.

trained  teachers  (a term used by  the  Ministry),

resulting  in  an  increase in  their  standard  of

teaching  and  their scales of pay.  Secondly,  the

transfer   of   those  teachers  who  have   G.C.E.

certificates  with three credits, including  Tamil,

to  the  higher scale of service. Thirdly,  to  put

these  Tamil  teachers in the scale of $295-925  as

Division II officers, and to issue certificates  to

them to that effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that these three facilities have

been  accorded to the teachers in the Malay  stream

but  not to the Tamil teachers. These three  points

are the only ones outstanding with the Ministry for

the  last few years. I hope the Minister will  look

into this matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will iron

out all anomalies where-ever possible. I am not  so

sure whether we have not ironed out completely  all

the  anomalies. What is left there is  probably  to

give these Tamil teachers the training so that they

will be able to obtain the requisite qualifications

as  their  counterparts in the other streams.  Once

that  has been done I am sure they will be accorded

the  same  conditions of service. We do  not  allow

discrimination in the Ministry of Education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I did say at the beginning of my

remarks  that most of the anomalies - I can  safely

say  about 95 per cent - have been done away  with.

Only  these three little disparities are  there.  I

hope  the Minister will look into them. I beg leave

to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have just heard the Minister say that his Ministry is having second thoughts about the implementation of the Institute of Education Act. From one viewpoint, I think the Minister must he commended for always being willing to take a second look at a problem and, if

necessary   resort  to  quite  radically  different

approaches to its solution. But I would like to  be

enlightened on one or two points with regard to the

possible change of mind vis-a-vis the establishment

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



the   Institute  of  Education.  The  Minister  has

mentioned  in a previous sitting that  one  of  the

purposes  of  the  Institute  of  Education  is  to

improve  our  standards of teaching and  to  remove

limitations  in the present administration  of  the

Teachers' Training College. I am certain that these

points  are still in his mind, otherwise  he  would

not  have thought of other means, but I hope  that,

as  soon as it is feasible, he will enlighten us on

the   steps   that  he  is  taking  to  ensure   an

improvement  of  the standards of teaching  and  to

remove  the  limitations inherent  in  the  present

administration  of the College.  The  Minister  has

mentioned  -  I  think  I  interpreted  him   quite

correctly  - that the Ministry will be taking  over

the  functions of the School of Education. Is  that

right, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The T.T.C.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Yes, the T.T.C, is taking over the

functions of the School of Education. I am speaking

in  relation to the upgrading of the qualifications

of   non-graduates  mentioned  by  the  Member  for

Moulmein.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten  us

on  how  this  could be done. In other words,  what

opportunities  are offered at the  T.T.C, to  non-graduates to better their qualifications?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  quite in agreement with what the Member  for

Katong  has  said.  Last  year  during  the  Second

Reading  on  the Institute of Education  Bill,  the

Minister  for Education talked a great  deal  about

it. He said that the setting up of the Institute of

Education  would  raise the level of  the  teaching

profession in Singapore. Today, however, we are sad

to  note that he is going to reconsider the setting

up  of  the Institute of Education. This news  will

prove  to  be  quite a blow to those  aspiring  for

higher  qualifications among our teachers.  I  hope

the   Minister  will  consider  the  question  very

carefully.  I would like to ask him whether  he  is

going  to  consult  the opinions of  the  Teachers'

Unions  before he takes the final decision. He  has

said just now that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



he respects the opinions of the Teachers' Unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also mentioned that the T.T.C. will eventually take over the School of Education in the University of Singapore. I would like to ask him whether the T.T.C, is going to grant degrees to participants in the course, not only the Bachelor of Education degree, but also Master or even Ph. D.

degrees in Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to ask the Minister is

this.  We know that in the past certain courses  in

the  T.T.C, were not suitable. For example, Science

teachers undergoing training have to take a  course

in  the teaching of the Chinese language, and  vice

versa.  I would like to ask the Minister if  he  is

going  to  review  the  courses  available  at  the

Teachers' Training College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask him is

whether  all trainee teachers are going to  have  a

smaller  work-load in schools, and how many periods

is this reduction going to be?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,

the Teachers' Training College has been established

for   quite  some  time  now.  It  has   played   a

significant  role in the training of  teachers  and

the promotion of education in our country. However,

it  suffers from a number of shortcomings. I  would

like to list the more glaring ones below.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the question of the quality of the

lecturers.  The great majority of the lecturers  in

the  Teachers' Training College have never had  any

experience  in  teaching in primary  schools.  They

have  not  got the faintest idea about the teaching

methods to be applied in primary schools. What they

do  lecture  on  is  based entirely  on  textbooks.

Therefore,  they  have  not been  able  to  provide

accurate  guidance  in the matter  of  teaching  in

primary  schools. There are a number  of  lecturers

who do have experience in teaching primary schools,

but  they  are not qualified because they are  only

certificate trained. If we expect these certificate-trained  lecturers to lecture to trainees in  these

certificate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



classes,  we  are  barking up the  wrong  tree.  We

cannot   expect   them   to  have   any   excellent

performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the teaching method. When the lecturers

in education at T.T.C, lecture on teaching methods,

they  just  reproduce  blindly  material  from  the

textbooks.   They  are  great  in  theorising   and

shoptalk. But on how to teach a particular  lesson,

they are not able to provide any guidance and leave

the  trainees to grope in the dark. One can imagine

what results we are going to get.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is the lack of training in

professional  ethics.  Actually  this  matter   was

raised  by  me  two  years ago  during  the  budget

debate.  I said that the Teachers' Training College

lacked  a  training course on professional  ethics.

Today, after two years, we still cannot find such a

course  in the T.T.C. I therefore bring this matter

up  again so that the Minister can have a good man-to-man talk with the Principal of the T.T.C, if  we

expect   our   teachers,  after  completing   their

training, to carry out their duties faithfully,  to

be  responsible teachers, and to make sacrifices in

the  interest  of education, we must  inculcate  in

them a set of professional ethics to enable them to

understand more fully the duties of the teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad to note that the T.T.C, does not

provide a training course on professional ethics. I

think this is an extreme deficiency. The result  is

that  many  teachers, after having completed  their

training and performed their duty, will soon  leave

their  teaching  posts  to  seek  greener  pastures

elsewhere.  From  this we can see that  the  T.T.C.

should  provide  a training course on  professional

ethics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point refers to the in-service

training  courses conducted by the  T.T.C.  1  find

that  many of these courses are repeated  over  and

over  again.  For example, there was this  one-year

course  on  advanced education for  primary  school

teachers conducted from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



1968 to 1969. If we take a look at the syllabus, it

would  appear  that the syllabus is very  ambitious

and  comprehensive. But actually there  is  nothing

much in it. It is quite devoid of any real content.

It  merely consists of old material being  modified

here and there. It is like putting old wine into  a

new  bottle.  There  are some  lecturers  who  know

nothing  about  the subject they  are  supposed  to

lecture on. Instead they waffle and beat about  the

bush  during lectures. They not only waste the time

of the teachers, but also public funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point I would like to bring up is the

inequitable  manner in which monetary  rewards  are

made.  Some  of  the  in-service  training  courses

conducted  by  the  T.T.C., for  example,  training

courses  on  second-language  teaching  and  music,

carry a monetary bonus at the end' of it. Those who

complete the course successfully will either get an

extra increment, or a bonus of $150, but some  will

not  get  anything  at  all.  And  there  are  some

teachers  who have undergone the same training  and

do   the   same  amount  of  teaching  but  receive

different  treatment. This is extremely unfair  and

unreasonable.  Although  one  may  argue  that  the

teacher should always seek to improve himself or to

improve his knowledge and methods of teaching,  and

not  look forward to monetary rewards, nevertheless

we  must treat all teachers alike. If we do want to

give  monetary  rewards,  then  all  of  them  must

likewise  he  entitled to them.  There  must  be  a

uniform  principle in granting these rewards.  This

will then show that our Government is fair, and  it

will  not  give rise to dissatisfaction  among  our

teachers, which could result in poor performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern methods of education advance each day. If

we  expect  the education system of our country  to

keep up with the times we have to pay attention  to

the training of our teachers. And as a body charged

with  the  responsibility of training our teachers,

the  T.T.C, suffers from a great number of defects.

It is time that the Ministry took remedial measures

immediately.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, the Education Minister

has  said earlier that he is having second thoughts

about   the  establishment  of  the  Institute   of

Education. He has quoted the views expressed by  an

expert in England about the desirability of setting

up  such an institution. I think there is a  danger

of  being  influenced too much by  expert  opinion,

particularly  if the expert is a foreigner,  as  he

would  probably  be talking in a different  context

and,  therefore, his opinion might not  necessarily

be   correct.  Offhand,  I  would  say   there   is

definitely  a difference in the situation  existing

in  Singapore as compared with that in  England.  I

believe  that most of the teachers in  England  are

qualified in teacher training and are on  a  salary

scale different from Singapore's, so that there  is

no  good  reason for them to further their  teacher

training   in   order  to  obtain   the   necessary

recognised  qualifications. But in Singapore  there

is  a  great need to provide non-graduate  teachers

with   the   opportunity  to   advance   themselves

professionally. In this respect, it is not  just  a

question of getting them to attend classes  and  so

on,   but  to  give  them  proper  recognition   on

completion of the course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see advantages in having an Institute of

Education,  because  this Institute,  for  example,

could confer diplomas which could be equated  to  a

university  degree, and so give these teachers  the

recognition   which  graduate  teachers   are   now

enjoying. The Teachers' Training College,  however,

is  not  in a position to confer such a degree.  If

non-graduate teachers were to go to the  University

of  Singapore,  for example, to  obtain  a  special

university   degree,   then,   apart   from   their

difficulty  in  having to compete with  the  school

leavers, I think they would be faced with  so  many

other problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My immediate reaction to the British expert's

opinion, therefore, is that the expert and  we  are

placed  in  very different situations.  Perhaps  he

could  be  right if we are talking specifically  of

what  the  functions and scope of the Institute  of

Education should be. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



there could be common agreement on this. But we  on

the  other  hand, need not have to have a different

plan,  contrary to what he has in mind  because  we

can  always pattern his recommendations to suit our

local conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I think there is a need to provide

educational  research facilities  for  teachers  on

teacher training, methodology, and the like.  These

research  activities must be directed  towards  the

improvement  of teaching methods, and I  think  the

Institute  of  Education can  take  on  this  extra

responsibility which, at this moment, no department

or  any  section of the Ministry of  Education  can

undertake  with  authority. So there  are  so  many

other  benefits which this Institute  can  provide.

There  are so many other matters which we have  got

to   look  into  in  the  context  of  our  present

situation. Therefore, before the Minister makes  up

his  mind  while  he is having second  thoughts,  I

think   there  should  be  more  consultation   and

discussion with the teachers, as there can be a lot

of other useful views on the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge him to think very carefully, and I

must  say that I disagree with him on the  need  to

have second thoughts. Perhaps we could sit down and

find  out  what kind of Institute of  Education  we

should  have,  and  work it out  according  to  the

context. I believe the teachers will be very  happy

if  we have an institute of Education. It gives the

feeling  that teacher education is put  on  a  high

level,  and  I  think this will give  the  teaching

profession a sense of pride and professionalism.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said

just  now that I have second thoughts and I say  it

again  that  I still have second thoughts,  because

while  having  second thoughts we can  discuss  the

pros  and  cons  of the Institute. Except  for  the

conferment of degrees, there is nothing  which  the

T.T.C, cannot do that the Institute  of  Education

can do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to pose this question to

Members   who   are  au  fait  with  the   teaching

profession: of the two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



types  of  degrees,  a  B.A, plus  a  Diploma   of

Education and Bachelor of Education, which do  they

think is more attractive to the teaching profession

or  to  those who are going for higher studies?  As

far   as   obtaining   better   qualifications   is

concerned, there is nothing to prevent non-graduate

teachers  from  studying for  an  external  degree,

which  means that together with the Certificate  of

Education they would be graduate-trained teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to clarify the point about taking

over  the School of Education in the University  of

Singapore.  I  did not mean "taking over".  I  said

that  we  would probably assume the role which  the

School  of  Education  is  now  performing,   i.e.,

awarding a diploma in Education. I have given  this

some thought, because in my mind all of us want  to

upgrade  the  quality  of  our  teachers.  But  the

question  is  whether it is best done  through  the

Institute of Education, because it would in  a  way

prohibit  or  would  not  give  the  teachers   the

mobility which they now have. Supposing we  do  set

up  the institute of Education on these lines,  and

ask  students to apply. I am very doubtful  whether

we  will  have a sufficient number of them to  come

in,  spend three year~ in the Institute,  come  out

with  a B.Ed, degree, and be stuck in the Education

service.  As  against this, if  they  go  into  the

University of Singapore, take a BA, degree in three

years,  then get into the T.T.C, to do a one year's

course  for a Diploma of Education, they will  have

greater  mobility. And knowing how calculating  and

how  materialistic the people of Singapore  are,  I

have  my  doubts whether the Institute of Education

will  attract the number of students that we  want.

As  it  is now, we are finding great difficulty  in

attracting people to the teaching service.  As  for

upgrading  the  teaching scale, I  think  there  is

nothing  which the T.T.C, cannot do  except,  as  I

have  said,  to  confer degrees, and  that  may  be

possible later on. We will see whether it is  worth

while to confer this degree.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I am swayed not only by the

opinion of the English authority that I have quoted

-  there  are,  in fact, about six or  seven  other

authorities who are very critical of the degree  of

Bachelor of Education conferred in England - but  I

am  also swayed by the circumstances which  we  are

now  in.  If  I remember rightly, the Institute  of

Education  was conceived at a time when  we  had  a

surplus  of teachers. Therefore, the thinking  then

was  that  we could bring these teachers  into  the

Institute  and  make them specialise  in  teaching.

Another  point of view, with which the  Member  for

Katong  will agree, is that we must not only  teach

the pedagogic aspect of the profession but also the

subjects  in  which they want to  teach.  In  other

words,  we  give them education in the subjects  in

which  they  want to teach. If we  just  make  them

specialise in the professional aspect, will  we  be

turning  out the kind of teachers we want? We  have

taken  all  these  matters  into  consideration.  A

better course of action now will be to improve  the

standard  of lecturing in the T.T.C, and  gradually

build  up  a  professional corps  of  lecturers  in

education  who will have an international standing.

If by that time we feel that it is really necessary

to  confer  a  degree in Bachelor of  Education,  a

degree in Master of Education or a Doctorate degree

in  education, it is not too late to do it. But  at

the  moment  we should go in more for consolidation

of existing practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to answer the Member for Jurong. There will,

of  course, be regular revision of the syllabus and

curriculum  in  the T.T.C, to see that  quality  is

being maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has levelled a very

sweeping criticism not only at the teaching service

but  also  at the T.T.C. Let me take up that  point

first. He has not much good to say about the T.T.C.

Everything there is wrong! I cannot agree with  him

on  this. If the T.T.C, had not been doing  a  good

job, we would not have been able to expand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



the educational service as much as we have done. We

would  not have been able within ten years to offer

every  child of school-going age a place in  school

in any language stream which his parents may choose

for  him.  Nor  would  we be getting  the  kind  of

results we are getting both in the Cambridge Higher

School  Certificate and the School  Certificate.  I

agree  that there are some shortcomings,  but  they

are not of such magnitude as he has described them.

We will try to plug any loopholes whenever possible

and we will try to make improvements where needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come now to his other point that there has

been unfairness in giving monetary rewards to those

who  have been given special training. Here  again,

he  has  probably not examined the cases carefully,

because  it would be very stupid if we were  unfair

in  the granting of rewards. That would only  bring

discontent.   It  is  not  our  policy   to   cause

discontent by being unfair in implementing policies

in  the Ministry of Education. The Member for  Paya

Lebar  implies that teachers lack dedication.  This

is  a  very  sweeping statement because  he  cannot

generalise  on the basis of a few teachers.  It  is

not fair to the majority of them,



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister has half a minute

more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The good results achieved in the

education   service  are  largely  due   to   their

dedication.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  wish to clarify one point. I was referring  just

now  to the lectures in the T.T.C. Trainee teachers

in   the   T.T.C, do  not  receive   training   in

professional  ethics.  I am  not  saying  that  the

teachers  are not responsible. They are responsible

and they have been doing their job well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, if the T.T.C, has not

inculcated  a  sense of dedication in  the  present

teachers,  where  then  have  they  got  it   from?

Obviously there must have been some inculcation  of

the spirit of dedication in them when they were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



in  the  T.T.C.  As a result of that,  we  are  now

having dedicated teachers who are doing their  work

well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Those who are

responsible  will  remain  so.  For  example,   the

Parliamentary  Secretary  sitting  opposite  was  a

teacher.   However,  he  has  left   the   teaching

profession  because he did not receive training  in

professional ethics in the T.T.C.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Paya Lebar is

referring to a particular Member?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have tried to be humble and silent.

However, my interest has been aroused and I wish to

say a few words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has said that the

T.T.C, has  not inculcated a sense of professional

ethics  in the teachers. I can understand him  when

he says that the teaching of professional ethics is

lacking  in  the T.T.C. However, he has  also  said

that  the  teachers, after their  training  in  the

T.T.C.,  have proved to be adequate in professional

ethics.   Since  they  are  already   adequate   in

professional  ethics, why is he  complaining  about

the  lack of training in professional ethics in the

T.T.C.? We cannot adopt a critical attitude towards

the  T.T.C., because these trainees have not  shown

to  be  inadequate.  This goes  to  show  that  the

trainees have benefited from their training in  the

T.T.C. I think his criticism is rather unnecessary.

If  these  teachers  already  display  professional

ethics, what else does the Member expect from them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the establishment of an

Institute  of Education, the Minister is  going  to

reconsider  the question and I think  his  decision

should  be supported. Although I have not had  long

experience  in teaching, I do know something  about

it.  I  have  some  ideas about  teaching.  On  the

question  of  promotion for those in  the  teaching

service, I believe that Members will agree with  me

that  education  is a process of  advancement.  The

most  important  factor is that  the  teacher  must

understand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



the  subject he is supposed to teach. For  example,

if  he does not know how to teach history and he is

not  familiar with this subject, how can  he  teach

it?  There used to be a Department of Education  in

Nanyang  University  in which  many  subjects  were

taught,  for  instance, the concept  of  education,

teaching  methods,  the  history  of  teaching   in

Western  countries  and other subjects.  I  studied

some  of them in my university days. However, after

the   reorganisation  of  Nanyang  University,  the

Department  of  Education was  abolished.  I  think

there must have been some reason for its abolition.

When  a student selects a subject for study in  the

university, he will select one which holds out good

prospects. He must consider what he is going to  do

after graduation. Students who study Geography  can

teach that subject after they have graduated. Those

who  have  studied  Chinese can teach  the  Chinese

language  and literature after graduation. However,

graduates  in  education are  not  going  to  teach

education because the whole process of teaching  is

education.  Education is not  a  narrow  field.  As

such,  it  is  not a subject of study  in  schools.

Therefore,   graduates  from  the   Department   of

Education   have  no  scope  for  employment.   The

important  thing is what they have learnt  and  not

the degree that they have obtained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before we take in all the subjects relating to education, or abolish the present system, we have to consider whether it is really necessary to establish an Institute of Education as against the present system. In fact, at the present moment there is still a Department

of  Education in the University of Singapore. If we

wish  to  establish an Institute  of  Education  as

originally  planned,  there  may  be  a  danger  of

duplication. This is a matter which requires second

thoughts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the contents of education,

including  the  merits  and  demerits,  these   are

matters  on  which I have received divergent  views

from various quarters. We should not be obsessed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



with the defects in the T.T.C. The T.T.C, itself is

run  by  the staff and the principal of the  T.T.C.

The people who are concerned with the management of

the   T.T.C, are  the  Teachers'  Unions  and  the

teachers  themselves. They are part and  parcel  of

the  T.T.C, tradition. They constitute the  spirit

and  tradition  of  the T.T.C.  If  there  are  any

shortcomings in the T.T.C., these will be reflected

on  the teachers themselves. In view of what I have

said,  I believe the leader of the Teachers'  Union

is  not  quite  right in making such an  accusation

against  the  T.T.C.  In fact,  in  the  past,  the

Teachers'    Training   College   conducted    many

activities   which   were   necessary   under   the

circumstances. For example, there were  courses  on

the   methods   of  teaching,  the  principles   of

education and other such subjects.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were doing what was necessary to inculcate

the concept of methodology in the trainee teachers.

After  some  time they would be able to  understand

the   theories   and   principles   of   education.

Furthermore,  there  are  other  practical  aspects

which require further development and these must be

carried  out by the teachers themselves  in  actual

teaching  work. This is not the kind of  work  that

the  T.T.C, or the Institute of Education  can  do

within  a  short space of two or three  years.  The

teachers  themselves  must  learn  while  they  are

teaching.  So teaching must also go with  learning.

As  the  Chinese saying has it, you must learn  and

teach  at  the same time. This is a very  important

aspect  that the teachers who are Members  of  this

House  must take note of. I am sure they will agree

with me on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are certain subjects in the T.T.C, which will be of help to our colleagues in the teaching profession. Perhaps during their days in the T.T.C., they were concentrating too much on certain subjects like Geography or Chemistry and did not devote sufficient time to the

educational  aspects, how to  teach,  for  example.

They  did  not do enough research or study  in  the

methods of teaching and principles



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



of education except to devote their time and energy

to  subject study. There are historical aspects  of

education which should be reviewed, e.g, the  study

of reports on educational development in Singapore.

Many people have a collection of such reports.  But

nobody has made a systematic study of them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, time is up. Mr Conceicao.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may be

allowed  to  speak  briefly  on  this  question  of

ethics.  I  am  very well acquainted  with  a  very

reverend   gentleman  at  the  Teachers'   Training

College. My experience has been that when I call on

him to speak on certain matters sometimes connected

with education, I have to fight shy of the topic of

ethics  because he is obsessed with this particular

subject.  In view of that, I feel that the  ethical

development  of  our budding teachers  is  in  good

hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of ethics is also a question of the

continuing development of the teacher which is  one

of    the    responsibilities    of    professional

organisations. 1 would like to refer, if I may,  to

the question which the Minister has asked just now,

whether a teacher would prefer a B.A, degree plus a

Diploma  in  Education  or  only  a  B.Ed, degree.

Personally I would have no hesitation whatsoever in

saying that certainly a teacher would prefer a B.A.

degree plus a Diploma in Education. That is what  I

have   too.   I   left   the  teaching   profession

temporarily  in  order  to  equip  myself  with  an

additional  higher  qualification.  But  will   the

Ministry consider giving the same opportunities  to

serving  officers  that  I  had  when  I  had   the

opportunity  to  go  to the  University  to  get  a

degree? Perhaps some serious thought could be given

to  this  matter,  because I think  there  are  two

benefits in bursaries and scholarships being  given

to  serving  teachers. One  of  them  is  that  the

teachers certainly improve themselves. The other is

the  presence of so-called mature students  in  the

University. Certainly no one can disagree with  the

fact that the presence of people who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



come  from  the work situation into the  University

adds  a  new  and  more  mature  dimension  to  the

situation in the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another solution to this problem -I may be

touching  on rather delicate ground here -  is  for

our   policy  makers  to  think  seriously  of  the

possibility of providing opportunities for teachers

and  others  to  prepare part-time  for  University

qualifications.    At   the   last    seminar    on

modernisation which was organised by the  Singapore

Teachers' Union, this question was brought up again

and again. I think that serious attention should be

given  to  this  problem, as I have  said,  by  our

policy  makers.  If I may voice my  opinion  as  an

adult  educator, I would say that in  Singapore  we

are  imaginative enough to be able to seek ways and

means  of making such a provision without incurring

too much financial expense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have had a

very  professional discussion, and being  the  only

layman  around, I am most grateful to  the  Members

who  stood up to speak on education. I am glad that

the  Member  for  Katong  agrees  that,  given  the

choice, most people would go for a B.A, degree plus

a  Diploma in Education. That is one of the reasons

which make me hesitate whether we should set up the

institute  of Education and whether we  would  have

enough students wanting to join the Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point the Member for Katong brought forth is

that  opportunities  should be made  available  for

teachers to qualify for degrees. I think there  are

now avenues for them to do so by taking an external

degree  or degrees. Whether it can be done  locally

or  not will depend very much on the University  of

Singapore,  and  whether  they  would  allow   such

extramural   studies  to  be   conducted   in   the

University  itself.  This is a question  which  the

University authorities should start to think about,

and  whether  facilities should be made  available.

Once they are made available, the problem of having

more  avenues for teachers to upgrade their  skills

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



qualifications would be temporarily solved. But  in

the  meanwhile,  I  have doubts whether  we  should

proceed with the Institute of Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to make a

very brief and passing reference to the Educational

Television  Service.  I had  occasion  recently  to

watch  an  E.T.V, programme. This was  designed  to

illustrate one of Charles Dickens' stories.  I  was

rather  surprised  to  see  on  the  programme  the

depiction of a Yorkshire countryside with plenty of

snow  and a Victorian carriage passing through  the

scene. One swallow does not make a summer, Sir. But

I  do  think that we should not take it for granted

that  our  children  understand  references  to  an

entirely foreign environment, and that it would  be

better  for  us to take care that we  do  not  just

include  these references without first  explaining

what they are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, here again is

another  problem which we face, being a  nation  of

two million people and using all the modern aids we

have  in  educating our young people. It  would  be

ideal,  of course, if we could project on E.T.V, a

series of films which are made in Singapore showing

scenes  of  Singapore.  But making  films  is  very

costly. Besides the cost of the films, we must also

have  the  expertise, which is not easily  acquired

nor is it latent in a lot of people here. As I have

said,  it  would  be  ideal if we  could  do  that.

Unfortunately, we cannot. We are doing the best  we

can.  We  have  limited resources  and  we  have  a

limited E.T.V, audience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Member for Katong did say that

one  swallow does not make a summer. There are many

other series of telecasts on E.T.V, where the films

are  made locally. In this instance, I am sure that

when  a  strange scene like a Yorkshire countryside

is projected on the screen during. E.T.V, time, the

teachers are supplied with notes of explanations so

that the students, looking at it, will know and try

to  understand what is happening elsewhere. I would

like to repeat that it would be ideal if everything

could  be  done  locally. But it  just  cannot  be.

Moreover, since it is from one of Charles  Dickens'

stories  it would be a dramatic story and  students

who   read   his  books  are  probably  given   the

background  information so  that  if  they  have  a

command of the language and have a good teacher and

a  vivid imagination, they would see the story come

to life.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1281.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we established the National Junior

College  two  years  ago,  we  selected  the   best

students  in our country to be educated  there.  We

hoped that the cream of our youth would be able  to

put   up  an  outstanding  performance  under   the

guidance  of  the  teachers in the National  Junior

College.  However, today we are sadly  disappointed

by  the fruitless efforts. When the results for the

Higher  School Certificate were announced, a number

of  people  who  arc concerned with education  were

dissatisfied  with the results.  The  percentage  o

passes for these students, who were supposed to  be

the  cream of the lot was 93 in the Chinese  stream

and  only 83 in the English stream. This has  taken

us by surprise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister may defend the National Junior

College and its teachers by saying that the results

were  the  best among all the schools in Singapore.

But  I  would like to remind him that the selection

of  students for the Junior College is very strict.

This  is a matter of common knowledge. The students

who   apply  for  admission  to  the  College   all

performed  very  well in either the Secondary  Four

examination  or  the  Cambridge School  Certificate

examination  with  an aggregate  of  less  than  12

points.  Only students with such excellent  results

can  be admitted to the College. Undoubtedly,  they

were  among the best of our students. The equipment

and  facilities at the College are excellent.  They

had a quiet environment in which to study. In fact,

we  can  say that they had nothing but the best  of

everything, so that it is not expecting too much if

they  secured  very good results. It  should  be  a

matter  of course for them to perform very well  in

the  H.S.C, examination. Sir, after studying in the

National  Junior  College  for  two  years,   their

percentage  of passes was only 83 per cent  in  the

English stream.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago when these students were selected

for admission to the National Junior College, their

parents were very proud of them. Even their friends

and  relatives held them in high regard. If we look

at those who have failed in the H.S.C, examination,

we   feel  both  surprised  and  sorry  for   them,

especially  their  parents. Those  of  us  who  are

concerned  with  the cause of education  will  also

feel sorry for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a famous philosopher in China, Lao Tze, in one of his famous classics called Tao Ter Chin, said that difficult things are meant to complement the easy ones. The long is meant to be compared with the short. This is a universal truth. In fact, without comparison one cannot see the

difference between the difficult and the easy,  and

between  the  long and the short.  It  is  only  by

comparison  that  we  begin to see  the  difference

between them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the secondary schools in Singapore, with the

exception  of  the  National Junior  College,  have

received a directive from the Ministry of Education

which  says  that  for admission to  Pre-University

classes,  the aggregate for Arts students must  not

be  more  than 24 points, and for Science  students

must  not  be  more than 25 points. All  those  who

satisfy  these  conditions should  be  admitted  if

there are vacancies. Although the standards of  the

students are uneven, all of them who satisfy  these

conditions must be admitted. One could say that  it

is  like pulling a cow up a tree. Secondary schools

in  Singapore do not often have the facilities  and

the environment anywhere comparable to those of the

National  Junior College. They also  have  half-day

sessions  only,  but  their  pass  rate  has   been

anything  from  50  per cent to 90  per  cent.  The

National    Junior   College   has   an   excellent

environment for study, longer hours of  study,  and

the  best student potential, but we regret to  note

that  the  results have not been satisfactory.  The

students have not been trying their best.  I  think

the  principal should be primarily responsible  for

his    duty   in   the   planning,   guidance   and

encouragement of the students. Very often  we  hear

about  meetings held by associations and societies.

When  a  new committee is coming in to replace  the

old  one,  they  pay compliments  to  the  outgoing

president or chairman, and praise his qualities  of

leadership. We can see how important leadership is.

The  National  Junior  College  possesses  so  many

excellent conditions. It is not an excessive demand

to expect that the students would perform extremely

well. It is out of the warmness of our hearts  that

we expect them to do well. We cannot therefore give

credit to the principal of the College for the  way

he is handling it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention another point, and that

is  that  the principal in question has  written  a

letter of recommendation asking a certain secondary

school to admit a particular student into his Pre-U

class,  although he knew very well that the student

concerned did not possess the minimum requirements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



specified  by  the Ministry of Education.  This  is

most  puzzling. I do not know whether to  laugh  or

cry; whether he meant this as a joke or whether  he

was  not  aware of the policy of the Ministry.  How

can  we  expect  him,  in  such  circumstances,  to

contribute  in  any  way  towards  the   cause   of

education and towards our country?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not know

whether  to  laugh  or cry after listening  to  the

Member for Paya Lebar. He is an educationalist  and

a  very  voluble critic of the educational  system.

Having  taught  in schools, he must be  aware  that

passing  an examination does not solely  depend  on

the  principal or the teacher; it also  depends  on

the  students themselves. During the difficult  age

of  between  16 and 19 years, a lot of  things  can

happen.  So if the students fail, surely the  blame

does  not  lie  solely with the  principal  or  the

teacher.  There  are  many  extraneous  factors.  I

expect  him,  as an educationalist,  to  understand

that  point.  He  is also a very difficult  man  to

please.  Did he expect a 100 per cent pass  in  the

H.S.C, examination for the Junior College students?

Of course, the National Junior College is there not

only  to  inculcate knowledge in the students,  but

also  leadership qualities. May I inform  him  that

leadership  qualities  do  not  depend  on  passing

examinations  only. I have known a  lot  of  people

with  First-class honours degrees who do not do  as

well when they come to leading a team as people who

have   just   a  Third-class  honours  degree.   So

leadership  does not depend on just the ability  to

swot   over   facts.  There  are  other  intangible

qualities which a leader requires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to disabuse him of another piece of

false  information which he may have gathered,  and

that  is that two years ago the best students  were

taken  into the National Junior College. They  were

the  best only in the sense that they were the best

among  those  who applied. So you cannot  say  that

they  were the best from all over Singapore,  those

with five or six distinctions. Even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



granted that if we take the best, we cannot  expect

a  100  per  cent pass. As I say,  at  the  age  of

between  16  years and 19 years, the boys  and  the

girls   pass   through  quite  a  lot  of   changes

physically  and mentally, and passing  examinations

depends  not only on the principal and the teacher,

but  also a lot on the home surroundings and on the

students themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  I  withdraw my amendment, I would  like  to

point   out  to  the  Minister  that  if  he   says

examinations  are not important, I would  like  the

examination  system abolished so that all  students

can  go into secondary schools, and secondary  four

pupils can go into Pre-U classes. They would have a

greater advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I express another point? When the H.S.C.

results were announced, the National Junior College

said that the students who were admitted to it  had

an  aggregate of not more than 12 points. They were

all  Grade One holders. However, since the Minister

has  replied  to  my  questions,  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I would like to clarify one

point.  I  never  said  that examinations  are  not

important.  I  only said you should not  place  too

much  importance on examinations.  The  Member  has

placed  too  much  importance  on  the  examination

system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1401.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, allow me to ask

the Minister certain questions. Technical education

has  been  promoted in Singapore and  has  been  in

existence  for two years. I would like to  ask  the

Minister    whether   its   progress    has    been

satisfactory.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is about the workshops in our

schools. How many schools have their own workshops;

and  how  many centralised workshops are  there  in

Singapore?   Are   these  workshops   adequate   to

accommodate the technical students?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is this: under the vote for

subhead 1435 I see that there is only provision for

one  Assistant Inspector of Schools. If  it  is  so

important to have technical education, why is there

a vote for only one Assistant Inspector of Schools?

Does  it mean that it is not necessary to supervise

these school workshops? Is the provision sufficient

for this purpose?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is the in-service graduate

teachers  who  are being trained at the  moment  as

technical  teachers. During the day  they  have  to

teach in school and in the evening they have to  go

for  training. They complain that the  lessons  are

rather  burdensome. Certain courses or lessons  are

not  quite  suitable.  I  would  like  to  ask  the

Minister whether these allegations are really true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that although technical

education  has  been  implemented  for  two  years,

parents  at large still do not understand  what  it

is. So, many are not willing to send their children

to  receive  technical education. Is  the  Minister

prepared  to launch some sort of publicity campaign

to  enable  the  parents  to  understand  the  true

meaning of technical education?



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the

Member for Jurong for his observations on technical

education, and for affording me the opportunity  to

answer   and  clarify  a  few  points,   lest   the

significance of the frequent participation  of  the

Parliamentary Secretary and the Political Secretary

to  the  Minister for Home Affairs and my  constant

silence during the debate may be misinterpreted!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since its establishment two years ago, we are fairly satisfied with the progress made by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



Technical  Education  Department.  Originally   our

target  was  to  have by 1975 one  in  every  three

secondary  school leavers vocationally biased.  But

now  I  think we will achieve that target by  1973.

There are not enough places available for all those

who want it, but the capacity is sufficient to meet

this   target.  We  have  some  16,000  places   in

secondary  technical  schools  and  8,000  in   the

vocational  institutes for technical education.  We

do  not  wish to train more students than necessary

in  this  respect,  because such graduate  is  less

flexible than that in the general education stream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the facilities which the Member

for Jurong has asked for, if I recall correctly, we

have  some 33 units of centralised workshops, about

30  schools  with  their own  workshops,  and  nine

vocational institutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also referred to the provision of

only  one  Inspector  of  Schools  for  the  entire

Technical  Education Department. I am afraid  there

is  some  confusion here, and I wish to  take  this

opportunity to clarify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular Inspector of Schools is actually

provided for the Technical Education Department for

the  Vocational  Guidance  Unit.  The  professional

aspects of the workshops and the responsibility for

inspection   are,  in  fact,  undertaken   by   the

Superintendent and the Assistant Superintendent. In

the  General  Education  Department,  however,  the

system is slightly different. Here, the work,  with

respect  to  inspection  of teachers,  planning  of

curricula,    and   drawing   up   the    equipment

requirements,  is undertaken by the  Superintendent

and  Assistant Superintendent, and the  operational

and  administrative duties are  undertaken  by  the

Assistant Training Officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that clarification, Sir, if you will look

under subheads 1433, 1434, 1443 and 1444, you  will

find  that  there  is a total of 20 Superintendents

and  Assistant Superintendents and, under  subheads

1436  and 1445, a total of eight Assistant Training

Officers. This compares very favourably with the 40



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



Specialist  Inspectors under the General  Education

Department.  Comparing the student population  with

the great variety of subjects that are available in

the  General Education Department, I think we  have

done  fairly well. Of course, we would like to have

more such posts if we can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point raised by the Member for Jurong

concerns  the  possible reduction of work-load  for

the   teachers  under  training.  I  think  he  was

referring  to  those technical  teachers  who  have

already  been  trained in one trade,  and  are  now

under  training for a second trade. Sir, I  believe

all  of  them  are  relieved from  extra-curricular

activities.   The  time  required   for   technical

training  is roughly three to six hours  per  week,

and  this is about the same as that for the  E.C.A.

load.  However,  if  the Member  has  any  specific

instance  where a teacher under technical  training

is  not relieved of his E.C.A.-load, or if he feels

there is a certain unfairness, will he let me  know

and we will look into it to rectify the situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point raised by him concerns public

relations.  In  fact, the Ministry is  thinking  of

injecting professionalism in this respect.  We  are

going  to  engage  one expert on  public  relations

under  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme

project,  known as Projects Supports  Communication

which undertakes public relations work in order  to

"sell" the department to the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am rather

interested  to hear that the Ministry of  Education

is  going  to  engage an expert. Is  he  a  foreign

expert, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the post will be created

under  the U.N.D.P, project, and the appointee  may

be a local or a foreign expert.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Then may I suggest that we get

somebody who understands the local community before

he goes out on a public relations campaign? Since I

have  the opportunity now, Sir, may I also  suggest

that  we make thorough use of the community centres

to put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



across  this idea, and, if necessary, even  to  use

colloquial  dialects, like Hokkien  and  Cantonese,

besides the official languages?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice

that  there  is  only one notice of amendment  with

regard  to  technical education. I  think  this  is

because there is so much confusion in the Technical

Education   Department   that   even   Members   of

Parliament do not know where to start. Or it  could

be due to the fact that the Department is very well

run! But I take it that it is fairly well run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is this. I think there is too much

preferential treatment, so to speak, being given to

the  Technical Education Department as against  the

General  Education Department. Even  the  quota  of

teachers for technical education is more than  that

for  general  education. There is also poaching  of

teachers from the General Education Department, and

together  with  the  transfer of  teachers  to  the

Technical Education Department, it has resulted  in

a  shortage  of  teachers in the General  Education

Department. The question I want to ask is this:  in

the   light  of  the  limited  resources  and   the

difficulty  of  getting  suitable  teachers,  could

there  not  be  some kind of check to prevent  this

over-emphasis  that  is being  given  to  technical

education,  because all this is at the  expense  of

general  education?  I  think  that  whenever   the

Education   Ministry  embarks  on  any   particular

project, it overdoes things a bit.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all those

suggestions raised by the Member for Katong will be

taken  into  consideration  when  we  launch   this

Projects Supports Communication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the points raised by the Member

for Moulmein, first of all, it is not quite true to

say  that  the quota of teachers for the  Technical

Education  Department is more  than  that  for  the

General  Education Department, and therefore  their

teachers  are  better off. In fact, they  are  not;

because those teaching in the workshops have a much

heavier load than those teaching in the classrooms.

Unfortunately, when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



the  Technical Education Department started, we had

to  get  the teachers, and we just could  not  grab

anyone  from  the street and make him  a  technical

teacher. The obvious answer was to retrain teachers

from the General Education Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point that we are developing

technical  education  at  the  expense  of  general

education, it is not so, Mr Speaker, Sir. There is

constant   liaison  between  the  two   departments

regarding staffing, and we always ensure  that  the

Technical Education Department will not develop  at

the expense of the General Education Department. In

fact,  the Ministry is looking into the possibility

of integrating the two departments into one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the

Minister of State for his detailed explanation, and

I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to discuss some questions relating

to Nanyang University under this amendment, We know

that  Nanyang University was established at a  time

when  there was a pressing need to imbue the people

with  the  spirit  of nation building.  Like  other

institutions  of  higher  learning,  the  financial

position  of Nanyang University was very  difficult

in its initial stages. The main source of financial

support  came from the rank and file of the  people

of  Singapore.  Thus  the  development  of  Nanyang

University  has  been  made  under  conditions   of

financial  paucity. Sir, since its  reorganisation,

the   Government   has  undoubtedly   given   great

financial  assistance  to Nanyang  University;  for

instance,  the building of a library, the provision

of  annually  recurrent expenditure and  equipment,

and  the proposed building of a sports complex. All

this  is  concrete evidence to show that Government

is lending great support to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



Nanyang  University. Furthermore, a few years  ago,

the  Government  has  also  given  recognition   to

Nanyang  University  degrees,  thus  enhancing  the

status of the University and its graduates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, Nanyang University does not have a

long  history behind it. In its initial  stages  it

has  to  depend  on  financial  as  well  as  human

resources to meet its various requirements. But  in

view  of the greater development programmes  ahead,

the  University  needs  more financial  assistance.

Sir,  I  endorse whatever programmes the University

has to contribute to the development of society and

to  nation  building. I must also  pay  tribute  to

those   people  who  have  stoutly  supported   and

sponsored Nanyang University, and to those who have

been   running   around  raising  funds   for   the

University  to  build  a  college  of  research,  a

commercial  college, and a students'  hostel,  etc.

Sir,  on  the  grounds of supporting  the  idea  of

cultivating  the people of Singapore,  I  hope  the

Government  will lend greater financial support  to

the  further  development of Nanyang University.  I

believe  it  will be an asset to Singapore  if  our

universities can turn out all the people  that  our

country  needs. And i hope that Nanyang  University

will carefully make use of the funds donated to it,

because  ultimately  these  funds  come  from   the

taxpayers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot understand why many people still have

the  pro-foreign thinking with regard  to  tutorial

staff.  They  think that "scholars" recruited  from

abroad   must  be  very  good.  I  am  not  against

recruiting genuine scholars. However, I  regret  to

note  that  recently  certain  unlearned  so-called

foreign   "scholars"  have  come  to   our   higher

institutions of learning to make a living, and they

are  highly paid. This only results in a  waste  of

the taxpayers' money, and the students will suffer.

I  want to stress that we must encourage more local

people  to  fill the key posts in the  Universities

because   only  they  have  a  sense  of   national

consciousness  and  loyalty and  thereby  they  can

really contribute their best to the country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Nanyang University should continue to be a

national university with the special characteristic

that its graduates are bilingual. We must not allow

it   to   be   made  into  a  non-Chinese  language

university,  because  this  will  disappoint   many

people.  I  hope  the  Minister  will  caution  the

University authorities about this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes, Sir,I can assure the

Member  for  Jurong that it is the  policy  of  the

Government to see that Nanyang University takes its

rightful  place  as another institution  of  higher

education in Singapore. I will not enlarge on  this

point, as I have only one minute left.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall come directly to the question which the

Member   has  asked,  and  that  is,  the  academic

qualifications  or  the  qualities  of  the   staff

appointed to Nanyang University. May I clarify that

appointments of academic and non-academic staff  to

the  University  are not made by  the  Ministry  of

Education,  but by the Establishment  Committee  of

the  Council  of Nanyang University  of  which  the

chairman  is the Vice-Chancellor of the University.

And, of course, there are two Government representatives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



who are given directives to see that not only

expatriates   but  also  local  staff   are   fully

qualified  before they are appointed.  Here  again,

may  I  stress that it is not possible to fill  all

the  posts, nor is it desirable to fill  the  posts

either  in  Nanyang University or in the University

of Singapore with purely local staff.
