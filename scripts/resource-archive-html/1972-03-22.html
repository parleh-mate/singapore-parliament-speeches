<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Bird Park is owned by the Jurong Bird

therefore,  been  forwarded  to  the  Company   for

consideration. Since its opening, the Bird Park has

reduced  its  admission charges to half  the  usual

rates   for   groups  organised  through  community

centres.  There  are also concessionary  rates  for

school  children organised through schools.  It  is

further  noted that of the 478,280 paying  visitors

to  the Bird Park during the period 1st April, 1971

to  29th February, 1972, only 12,707 took advantage

of  the community centres' concessionary rates, and

70,445  students were admitted under  the  schools'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1101 -



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Yeo Choo  Kok, Ho See Beng and Seah Mui Kok.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my criticism of the Ministry of Law and

National  Development,  I  would  like  to  confine

myself   to   three   topics,  (1)   Planning   for

development;  (2) The co-ordination  between  Urban

Renewal  and Resettlement Departments; and (3)  The

Lettings  and  Sales Sections of  the  Housing  and

Development Board. In fact, it can be said that the

coordination  among all the agencies  that  I  have

just outlined also leaves much, to be desired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears as if plans are drawn for an area

earmarked  for  development, and  as  soon  as  the

overall  plans  are  approved  the  squatters   and

landowners  are  issued  with  clearance  and  land

acquisition  notices. No planning or  co-ordination

takes place at this juncture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



for the number of houses to be cleared, within what

period  and  to  where they are  to  be  resettled.

Phased  acquisition of land and land  clearance  is

not  properly carried out. Squatters and landowners

are  asked to move out even though the Resettlement

Department   is   unable   to   provide    suitable

alternative .accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you are aware that Telok Blangah is under an

intensive urban renewal project, and I know what  I

am  talking  about. In some phases of  acquisition,

one-room  flats  are  offered  to  large  families,

because they are the only ones available. In  other

phases of acquisition, families which cannot afford

to  pay  high rentals are offered 2-room and 3-room

flats  because  these are the only ones  available.

The Lettings and Sales Sections cannot cope up with

flat  requirements  of the Resettlement  Department

and  everybody  is  under pressure,  including  the

Member  of Parliament. Could this not be the  fault

of   the  overall  planning  in  the  Housing   and

Development Board?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other cases, the whole area is served with

notices of clearance and only partial clearance  of

smaller   areas,   like  kampongs,   takes   place.

Sometimes  even  after one year of the  serving  of

clearance  notices,  nothing  happens.  Owners   of

houses   do   not  repair  dwellings  while   under

clearance   notices,  and  tenants'  requests   for

Housing  and Development Board flats are  not  met,

the  reason  being that the areas are not  required

for immediate clearance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nobody likes to move out of a place where

one  has  been  living  in for  years,  paying  low

rentals,  or  no  rental at all in  the  rural  and

suburban   areas.  If  people,  who   are   already

reluctant to move out, are further burdened by  the

offer  of  flats miles away from where  they  work,

resentment breaks out especially when they have  to

pay  higher  rentals  and  have  to  travel  longer

distances to their places of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my constituents in Pulau Brani, Sentosa,

Bukit  Theresa, Bukit Purmei, Radin Mas and Kampong

Heap



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



Guan  San,  who are all affected by urban  renewal,

are  dependent  on the Port of Singapore  Authority

and  the sea for their livelihood. They also belong

to  the  lower  income group. If they  are  offered

alternative accommodation far away from the area of

their  means  of  livelihood as  a  result  of  bad

planning,  we  cannot blame the  citizens  if  they

offer  resistance. If planning in  phases  is  well

thought  out, one area of Telok Blangah could  have

been  acquired first, and flats built  to  re-house

residents of other areas of Telok Blangah or  those

residents  in  close proximity to the Constituency.

This has neither been thought out nor done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance during his

Financial  Policy Statement mentioned  the  Sentosa

Development Corporation. Many residents of  Sentosa

are  boatmen, solely depending on the sea for their

livelihood,  i.e, ferrying cargo. They ply  between

ships  anchored  in the outer roads and  Singapore.

They  have  contributed to the  entrepot  trade  of

Singapore and will continue to contribute  to  make

the  Singapore harbour a thriving one. They are  an

economic necessity to the survival of Singapore.  I

have  no  quarrel  with making  Sentosa  a  tourist

paradise.  But what does the Government propose  to

do  with  the residents of Sentosa who depend  upon

the  sea  for their livelihood? If they  are  moved

out,  will  they be given alternative accommodation

close to the sea? Will they be provided shore space

to  moor  their boats? Or will they be  allowed  to

continue  remaining in one part of Sentosa  and  be

allowed to continue to ply their traditional trade

between the outer roads and Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I have your

permission to reply to the Member for Telok Blangah

now  before the other Members, who have also  given

notices of the same amendment, begin to speak?  The

reason  is that by answering them one at a  time  I

will  not  forget all the points that  are  raised,

especially after five or six of them have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



been  on the Floor. And perhaps it may also prevent

a repetition by the Members themselves or by me.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member for Telok Blangah hit

the nail on the head when he said that no one likes

to  move  out  from an area in which  he  has  been

living in for a very long time. That is the crux of

our resettlement problem. However, if Singapore  is

to   develop,   there  must  be  resettlement.   He

complains of the lack of co-ordination between  the

Resettlement    Department,   The    Housing    and

Development Board and the Planning Department. I do

not   think  he  has  been  fair  to  these   three

departments. They are in one Ministry, and they  do

co-operate with one another. Perhaps there may have

been  lack  of  liaison between  one  Ministry  and

another. Let me give the Member an example.  .  The

Ministry  of Defence requires some parts  of  Pulau

Brani, and resettlement is necessary. But it is the

Ministry  of Defence, and not the Ministry  of  Law

and    National   Development   that   wants    the

resettlement  to  be  expedited.  The  Resettlement

Department  is  then asked to do  the  resettlement

work,  a  most unpleasant job in any circumstances.

However,  the Resettlement Department is doing  its

best    to    provide   as   suitable   alternative

accommodation as is possible; but people,  shifting

from homes which they have occupied for a long time

are,  as  the Member has pointed out, reluctant  to

move.  Then  they  become choosy. It  is  sometimes

impossible  to  provide a Housing Board  flat  near

their  homes.  For example, in Pulau `Brani  or  in

Sentosa there are no Housing Board fiats. As far as

Pulau  Brani is concerned, some of the people  have

been resettled and, as far as I am aware, they  are

satisfied.  Out  of 230 families affected  by  this

project  of  the Ministry of Defence, 214  families

have  been resettled. About 200 families are housed

in  one-room  flats at Henderson  and  Redhill  and

about  30 families in Jurong where they have  one-,

two-  and  three-room flats. Moreover,  the  Marine

Police personnel who live in Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



quarters in Pulau Brani have vacated their quarters

and  are  now living in Clementi Road houses  which

have  been  vacated  by  the  British  Forces   and

reverted   to   the   Bases   Economic   Conversion

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as Sentosa is concerned, I would like to

point  out to the Member that we are only concerned

with  resettlement,  the  unpleasant  part  of  the

project.  What will happen to Sentosa  island  will

have  to  be  decided  by the  Sentosa  Development

Corporation,   after  its  incorporation   shortly.

However, I can assure the Member that nothing  will

be  done  until  the  Resettlement  Department  has

completed a survey of the population on the island.

I  hope  that  it  is  possible  for  part  of  the

population to find employment on the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Urban Renewal Department is

concerned,  it is merely involved in  the  physical

planning for the development of the island  into  a

tourist  complex.  It  is not  involved  in  policy

decisions,  which  are  really  a  matter  for  the

Corporation. I have one suggestion to make  to  the

Member.   In  order  to  lighten  the  effects   of

resettlement,   perhaps  the  Member   could   make

representations to the Corporation that one or  two

villages in Sentosa be preserved and renovated as a

tourist  attraction. I believe quite a  few  people

living in Sentosa collect and sell sea shells which

many a tourist buys. Sentosa is quite a big island,

and  I am sure one or two villages can be preserved

for  this purpose. And for the information  of  the

Member,  he should make his representation  to  the

right  quarters,  which  is  not  the  Ministry  of

National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the Member complains of the long waiting

period for public housing and that we seldom  offer

immediate alternative housing whenever resettlement

problems  arise.  We  do  our  best  with  what  is

available. Hence, some of the Member's constituents

were offered flats in Jurong and some in Henderson.

Some  were offered flats in Redhill, which are,  in

fact,  closer to his constituency. The  demand  for

flats,  whether for rental or purchase, far exceeds

the supply. Moreover, a few of these flats



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



are  used  to  resettle people who are affected  by

Government's  urban renewal projects.  The  Housing

Board  finds  it  difficult to satisfy  everybody's

demands.  If the Member is interested, I will  read

to him the latest figures. As at 29th February this

year, there were 21,687 families registered to rent

Housing  Board flats. At the same date  there  were

36.906   families  registered  to  purchase  flats,

making  in  all  a  figure reaching  nearly  60,000

registrants. The Housing Board built a little  more

than  16,000  units last year. It will  build  more

this year. However, within the next few years,  the

maximum  number which the Board can build,  without

raising  the  cost price of each flat,  is  in  the

region of 20,000 units. If we start building  today

with  a backlog of 60,000 units -we can only  build

about  20,000 units a year - and every day of every

month  more and more fresh applications for  rental

or for purchase of flats are made to the Board, and

with  more and more Government development projects

taking  place,  resulting in more and  more  people

being  resettled, I think it is a little unfair  to

complain  that  there  is a lack  of  co-ordination

between   the   Housing  Board,  the   Resettlement

Department and the Planning Department. It is  just

a  question of supply and demand. These departments

are doing their best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to come back to the Member's first

point, no one likes to shift, and that is the  crux

of the problem. We try to do our best for them, but

it  is difficult to satisfy anyone who has to shift

from  a  home  which he has occupied  probably  for

generations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, it is

well  known that in recent years it has become  the

policy  of  the  Housing and Development  Board  to

encourage  our  citizens to purchase Housing  Board

flats.  However, it seems to me that in some  cases

this  encouragement has been over-enthusiastic.  It

has  come  to my attention that flat dwellers,  who

have  applied  for a transfer to bigger  flats,  as

well  as  new applicants for flats have  been  told

that they should apply



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



for  purchase  rather than for rental  of  the  new

flats  as this would shorten the period of waiting.

This is not true, and everyone knows that flats are

allocated  on a first come first served basis.  The

waiting  list of intending purchasers is, in  fact,

no  shorter than that of those who intend to  rent,

as  has just been pointed out by the Minister. Will

the  Minister, therefore, please instruct his staff

not to be so aggressive in encouraging the purchase

of  flats. Many people who simply cannot afford  to

purchase flats feel that they are being bullied  by

this  new  tactic. Furthermore, I hope the  Housing

and  Development Board will continue to let out  2-room  or  3-room  flats to poor but  big  families,

because they just cannot afford to buy them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the increasing population in

Housing  Board estates and the addition of  several

electoral  divisions,  will the  Minister  consider

setting up new Housing Board Area Offices so as  to

lighten the burden of the present offices,  and  so

make them more easily accessible to the public?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Housing Board tenants have lodged

complaints against their noisy neighbours,  but  it

seems to me that they are to no avail. Some tenants

have even abused the use of the common corridors to

the  annoyance and irritation of other  tenants.  I

wonder  if  the Minister will consider  introducing

legislation to empower the Area Officers  to  first

warn  the  recalcitrants of the noise  and  trouble

they  make by ticketing them, and failing that,  to

penalise them by terminating their tenancy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a housewife in my area was robbed and

stabbed inside a Housing Board lift. Not long ago a

tragedy  of a different nature also occurred  in  a

Housing  Board lift, but this took place in another

area. If we have enough hourly-rated lift operators

from  the  various Housing Board  Area  Offices  to

check  on the safety and security of lift-users  at

certain  hours  and in certain crime  prone  areas,

such as mine, then we can prevent similar tragedies

from  occurring  in Housing Board  estates  in  the

future. I think the sheer presence of an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



official  from the Housing Board Area  Office  will

contribute  to the sense of safety and security  of

the lone lift-user.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Housing and

Development Board officials have adopted aggressive

tactics, I would agree with the Member that  it  is

highly regrettable, and that such tactics should be

stopped. However, I find it difficult to understand

why  a  Housing Board officer should use aggressive

tactics  to force someone to change his application

from  a  transfer to a purchase. Perhaps there  has

been  some  misunderstanding. With the shortage  of

flats, it is difficult to get a transfer and it  is

probably  for  that reason that the  Housing  Board

officer  may have advised the applicant to purchase

a  flat  rather  than to apply for  a  transfer.  A

transfer means that he is already occupying a  flat

but  wants  to move to another flat. There  are  so

many others who do not have flats.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member wants me to assure him that the

Housing  Board  will continue to rent  or  let  out

flats.  I  gave  this assurance in  this  House  in

answer  to  a Question by the Member for Katong.  I

said  that the Housing Board will continue  to  let

out  20 per cent of the fiats it builds and not  to

sell every flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lifts, the Housing Board has more than

1,000  lifts in the various Housing Board  estates.

If  we  are  to have lift attendants, we will  need

about 3,000 persons to operate 1,000 lifts on a two-

or  three-shift  basis, and it will  cost  some  $5

million  per year. I am sure the Member will  agree

that this is rather prohibitive. As for security in

the lifts, the Police are responsible, but I am not

putting the blame on the Minister for Home Affairs.

It  is  quite impractical to expect the authorities

to  station security guards or policemen  at  every

block  of  flats  when there are  more  than  1,500

blocks  of  flats. At present, about a little  more

than  one-third of our population live  in  Housing

Board estates, and the number of residents in  each

block  ranges  from  several  hundreds  to  several

thousands. Perhaps the residents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



themselves can get together and keep a look-out  so

that  criminal activities can be stopped and  anti-social elements caught. If the residents co-operate

by  reporting the activities of these criminals,  I

am  sure the crime rate in our housing estates will

be substantially reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for noise, we can pass laws but I am not in

favour  of  passing  more and more  laws  to  force

people  to do or not to do this and that.  I  would

rather  persuade, and surely residents  of  Housing

Board  flats  can  get  together  and  collectively

reduce   the   noise  made  by  children,   radios,

television, motor-cars and motor-cycles. The  Board

is  doing  its  best  to request  residents  to  be

considerate to one another, and complaints of noise

nuisance have been dealt with. But the final answer

to  the  problem really lies in the  hands  of  the

residents of the flats themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

has  not  touched  on one of the points  I  raised,

i.e., whether he is going to increase the number of

Area  Offices,  in  view of  the  additional  seven

electoral divisions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The number of electoral divisions has

been   increased.  That  is  a  good   reason   for

increasing the number of Members in this House, but

surely  not  Housing  Board  estate  offices.   But

perhaps  the Member meant that, with more and  more

Housing Board estates coming up, then more and more

Housing Board offices are needed. I can assure  the

Member  that the number will be increased.  But  it

must  correspond  with  the  increasing  number  of

people living in Housing Board flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to raise certain matters connected  with

the  urban  renewal project in my  constituency.  I

think the Minister for Law and National Development

is aware that about 150 premises in my constituency

are  on temporary occupation licences. Quit notices

have  been  issued to chief tenants and  subtenants

alike after the acquisition of these premises,  and

these  tenants  have been been told  to  apply  for

Housing and Development Board flats. Some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



applied and got it, but some did not get it.  Those

who  were allocated flats have moved out, and those

who were not, continued to stay in. Among those who

were given Housing Board flats were `chief tenants.

When  the  chief tenants moved into the flats,  the

subtenants   will   have   to   take    over    the

responsibility  of the premises in the  sense  that

they  have to pay the temporary occupation  licence

fees  plus  water  and  light charges,  which  were

previously paid by the chief tenants. Although  the

subtenants do not mind paying the water  and  light

charges, they are prohibited from subletting  those

vacant  rooms after acquisition, because these  are

not  premises or flats built by the Housing  Board,

but    premises   previously   owned   by   private

individuals.  `Sir, the point is that these  people

are mostly wage-earners in the low income group. It

is  impossible  for  them to  bear  any  additional

financial burden unless they are allowed to  sublet

the  vacant rooms. Before the acquisition of  these

premises  by  the Government, the sub-tenants  paid

only  $10 to $15 a month as rental, including water

and  light charges. But now they have to  pay  very

much more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another complication after

acquisition,  and  that is the condition  of  these

premises is far from satisfactory for many  of  the

premises are 50 to 60 years old and are in need  of

major  repairs. But the occupiers are placed  in  a

dilemma  because they are wondering whether  it  is

worth  their while to repair. They are afraid  that

their money spent on repairs will be wasted if they

were  asked to quit shortly after the repairs  were

done. And this is possible since the Government has

not  been able to inform them as to when the  urban

renewal   project   will  take   place.   In   this

connection, Sir, I would therefore like to ask  the

Minister  for Law and National Development  whether

he will be able to inform them as to when the urban

renewal project is likely to commence, so that  the

occupiers will be able to decide whether or not  to

carry  out  those  necessary  repairs  to  the  old

houses. Secondly, will the Minister be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



prepared  to waive those regulations which prohibit

the  subletting of the vacant rooms?  If  so,  this

will  greatly relieve the financial burden  of  the

occupiers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am afraid I cannot give the

Member either the assurance he desires or the exact

date   when  the  Urban  Renewal  Department   will

commence  work  in  the areas  about  which  he  is

complaining. The delay in the implementation of the

scheme has been due to clearance problems. Once the

place is cleared, construction begins. But I do not

know  when they will shift. We are not blaming them

entirely  because  they will not  shift  until  the

Housing   Board  provides  them  with   alternative

accommodation,   which  at  the   moment   is   not

sufficient. I believe the areas referred to by  the

Member for Bras Basah fall under the Theng Hai  and

Holloway redevelopment schemes. To-date, only about

15  per  cent of the resettlement cases  have  been

cleared,  and  it is true that in some  cases  only

subtenants are left in the premises after the chief

tenants have moved out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid it is not the practice of the

Land  Office to allow such State properties  leased

on temporary occupation licences to be repaired, as

these  repairs are usually done by the Public Works

Department.  Further, it would  be  undesirable  to

allow  tenants to do the repairs themselves and  at

their  own expense, as this could lead to extensive

renovations, alterations and additions which  would

tend  to  prolong the occupation once  the  tenants

have  spent large sums of money on repairs.  It  is

also  not the practice to allow such houses  to  be

sublet  by the chief tenants as this would increase

clearance  commitments when the area is  eventually

ready  for  development. In fact, it is a condition

of  the  temporary  occupation licence  that  there

should be no subletting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for reductions in rent, the Member can make

his  representations. I believe we have acceded  to

some of his representations in the past.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister for Law



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



and National Development has said earlier that more

than 21.000 persons have registered to rent Housing

and  Development  Board flats, and  another  31,000

persons have registered to purchase these flats.  I

am  sorry  to say that they will have to  wait  for

quite a long time, perhaps another one or two years

before  they  can  rent or purchase  Housing  Board

flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the present long waiting list of

Housing Board flats for rent and purchase, I  would

like  to  ask  the  Minister for Law  and  National

Development  whether he will limit the construction

of  multi-storey office and shopping  complexes  so

that   more   construction  workers  and   building

materials  could  be  channelled  to  expedite  the

construction of more Housing Board flats.  This,  I

believe,  will  lessen the long  waiting  time  and

shortening  the waiting list. At the moment,  there

is no acute shortage of office or shopping space.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the construction of multi-storey

office  buildings and shopping complexes should  be

restricted, so that the construction of Housing and

Development  Board  flats could be  increased  from

20,000   to  25,000  flats  each  year.  Sir,   the

construction  of multi-storey office buildings  and

shopping  complexes is purely for profit only,  but

the  construction of Housing and Development  Board

multi-storey flats is a social development for  the

workers,  especially those in the lower and  middle

income  groups.  They  cannot  afford  to  purchase

houses  built  by the private sector because  their

prices  are  fantastic,  ranging  from  $38,000  to

$85,000 per unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> More than that!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> But do not blame me for that. The

question  of whether there is at present  an  over-building  of  shopping and office  complexes  is  a

controversial  one,  as  there  are  many   factors

affecting  supply  and  demand.  The  Ministry   of

National  Development is keeping a close  watch  on

the  capacity of the building industry. Because  of

the shortage of labour, and the increased



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



cost of building materials - there are shortages

of  cement  or  steel  at  various  periods  -  the

Government has suspended the fourth and fifth sales

of   urban  renewal  sites  which  were,  in  fact,

scheduled for 1970 and 1971 respectively.  For  the

same reason, the Government has also withdrawn  the

concessions   for  property  tax  and   development

charges,  which were previously granted to  certain

prestige   projects  in  the  Central   and   other

designated  areas. But the building of  residential

flats  and houses is being actively encouraged.  In

this   respect,   `the  Government   still   grants

exemption  to developers of residential flats  from

paying  development charges if the density of  such

residential development exceeds the maximum density

allowed under the Master Plan. What else can we do?

The    Government   is   also   accelerating    the

construction of Housing and Development Board flats

under the Five-year Building Programme for 1971-75.

If  owners  of land, who no longer get  concessions

for  property  tax and development  charges,  still

desire to erect offices and shopping complexes, who

are  we  to tell them that what they are  doing  is

wrong. The risk is theirs. It is not for us to stop

them  in  this  island of free enterprise!  We  can

either encourage or discourage, but we cannot  stop

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Housing and Development Board, under the charge

of  the Minister for National Development, has done

a  wonderful  job, and our Republic  has  earned  a

world-wide reputation for providing housing for the

lower  income  group, both for rent and  for  sale.

However,  because  of the great  demand  for  these

houses, the Board has not been able to build enough

to  cope  with the demand. There is one section  of

the  community, the middle income group, which  has

not  been catered for, and they have to turn to the

private developers for their housing needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my constituency has many private housing

estates, consisting mainly of high-rise flats. They

are either for sale or for rent. The developers are

only concerned with the collection of rentals



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



or  payment  of  instalments from owners  who  have

bought  these  houses, and pay no regard  to  their

obligation  for maintenance. The compounds  are  in

such  a  bad  state of repair and the  gutters  are

leaking. Generally, there is litter and filth  both

in  and  around the compounds. Although  there  are

agreements entered into between the tenants and the

developers that the maintenance of these  flats  is

the   responsibility   of  the   developers,   such

undertaking is not observed. As a matter  of  fact,

some  of  these blocks of flats have been  occupied

for  more  than five years now, and have  not  been

issued  with  any  certificate of  fitness  by  the

Ministry.  Will the Minister for Law  and  National

Development and the Minister for Health  look  into

these  complaints of the tenants and enforce a  law

to  protect  the interests of the poor flat  owners

who are mostly from the middle income group and who

are  at the mercy of these developers? Sir, I  have

some pictures here showing the state of these flats

for the Minister to see.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Photographs handed in to the Clerk for Mr

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, my immediate answer to the Member

for  River  Valley is: it is best for him  and  his

constituents who are affected to seek legal advice.

If   there  are  agreements  entered  into  between

landlord   and  tenant  or  between  landlord   and

purchaser,   and  there  are  breaches   of   these

agreements under which perhaps the developer or the

vendor agreed to maintain not only the building hut

also  the  land on which the building stands,  then

legal  action can be taken. The Government is aware

of these problems and is, in fact, even thinking of

introducing  legislation to  help  out.  But  until

then, the tenants or occupants should enforce their

legal  remedies,  or  alternatively  clean  up  the

premises  themselves. If everyone  in  a  block  of

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, although the facilities in Housing

Board  flats  are good, they can still be  improved

further.  For example, to bring down  a  coffin.  I

believe  that  those who stay in the lower  storeys

face   no   such   problem,  but  there   will   be

difficulties  for  those  staying  in   the   upper

storeys,  even  though  there  are  staircases  and

lifts.  This is because the dimensions of the  lift

are not big enough to accommodate a coffin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to state in this House that I have

received  complaints from certain  members  of  the

public  that there was an instance when a  bereaved

family  had  great difficulty in  bringing  down  a

coffin  from an upper storey flat. The' undertakers

had  to use a rope to slowly lower the coffin  over

the  verandah, but before it reached the ground the

rope  snapped  and it fell down.  This  is  a  very

unfortunate   case.   I  hope   the   Housing   and

Development Board can provide bigger lifts so  that

such unhappy incidents will not recur.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The matter referred to by the Member

will certainly be given consideration. But this  is

one  of  the many problems that crop up when people

begin to live in high-rise flats. Perhaps the lifts

can  be  made  larger or, if not larger,  at  least

longer, provided the costs are not prohibitive.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1O11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to comment

on   the  anomaly  which  has  arisen  out  of  the

acquisition  of land by the Land Office.  The  Land

Office   is   the   Government  agency   which   is

responsible,   among   other   things,   for    the

acquisition of land for development purposes. Every

year the Land Office acquires considerable areas of

land.  Generally  speaking,  there  should  be   no

problem   with   the  process  of  acquisition   if

reasonable  compensation  is  paid  to  those   who

deserve  it. But what is the actual position,  Sir?

The  Land  Office, to save itself from any trouble,

normally  adopts  a perfunctory  manner  by  paying

compensation to the landlords instead of taking the

trouble  to count the number of families  involved,

the buildings, the improvements, and the number  of

fruit  trees affected by the acquisition. It is  at

this point that problems crop up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, it is quite normal to find more

than  one  family living on any one piece of  land.

Very  often the landlord sublets the land to others

such  as  families who live on farming. The farmers

then  build  up their farms and homes  and  planted

fruit  trees on the land, and after many  years  of

hardwork and toil they begin to enjoy the fruits of

their land labour.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the land is acquired by Government, it

is only the landlord who gets the compensation. The

tenants, in many cases the poor farmers, do not get

a  single cent as compensation. This creates a  lot

of  problems. Without being compensated, how do you

expect them to move out? How do you expect them  to

resettle elsewhere to rebuild their farms?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Land Office officials for

the sake of their own convenience



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



have caused considerable trouble to others.

I  have  received  a number of complaints  of  this

nature during my "Meet the people" sessions.  These

people   complained   that  Resettlement   Officers

visited them every day in an attempt to force  them

out  of  their homes. But without getting a  single

cent  as  compensation, and without any savings  of

their  own, how do you expect them to move out?  Do

you  want  them to pull their own houses  down  and

live in the open air? Sir, I do not understand  why

officials  of  the  Land  Office  cannot  take  the

trouble  to make a detailed investigation  to  find

out  who the owners of the properties are, and  who

are  the tenants living on the piece of land to  be

acquired, before they make payment of compensation.

They must ensure that compensation is paid to those

who  deserve  it,  in order to  eliminate  all  the

problems  that may arise out of acquisition,  which

may  cause  delay  to the Government's  development

programme. In this way, Sir, the people who get the

compensation will be resettled without  difficulty.

Otherwise, the tenants will continue to stay on the

land because they have no money to move out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when private land is

compulsorily acquired under the provisions  of  the

Land Acquisition Act, a search is first made in the

Registry of Land Titles and Deeds to ascertain  the

names and addresses of the registered owners. It is

the  owners  of the land who are paid  compensation

under  the Land Acquisition Act, because  they  own

the  land. But perhaps there is some confusion here

between  compensation for the land and compensation

for  buildings,  perhaps  temporary  buildings,  or

improvements  to  the  land, and  fruit  trees.  In

addition to the notices which are not only gazetted

but  also  served on the owners of land, there  are

acquisition  notices  posted on  the  land  itself,

inviting  persons  who claim compensation  to  make

their  claims  to  the Collector of  Land  Revenue.

Under  the  Land  Acquisition Act, a  claimant  for

compensation  must  satisfy the Collector  of  Land

Revenue that he is the person interested within the

meaning of the Act. If he is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



merely  a tenant, farmer, or squatter, then  he  is

not entitled to compensation as of right, but he is

paid  ex-gratia compensation for improvements  made

by him to the land, subject to his proving that the

improvements   were  effected  by  him.   But   the

situation   is   different  where   the   landowner

undertakes  to  clear  and compensate  the  tenant,

farmer, or squatter. In such a case, it is  he  who

pays  compensation  to his tenants  for  all  their

improvements on the land. It is then a  matter  for

the  tenant, farmer or squatter to settle his claim

with the landowner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that we are as interested

as   he   is  in  effecting  smooth  eviction   and

resettlement. It is no use our paying  compensation

to  the  landowner  only to  find  the  land  still

occupied  by  squatters and we do  not  get  vacant

possession.  For  then, nothing  can  be  done.  Of

course,  there are cases where the moment a  notice

under  section  3 or under section 5  of  the  Land

Acquisition  Act is gazetted, people  quickly  move

into  the area in order to claim compensation  from

the Government. But these are only a few cases. But

if  many  of  the Member's constituents  have  made

these  complaints to him at his "Meet  the  People"

sessions, he should send them with their complaints

to the Land Office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish

to  draw the attention of the Minister concerned to

the  sad plight of the residents living at Koh  Sek

Lim Road, which is in my constituency. Most of them

were resettled years ago under development projects

for  the  Paya  Lebar Airport.  These  people  were

affected by the construction of the airport.  Small

plots  of land used for dwelling purposes, as  well

as  stove-making and agriculture, were allocated to

them  at Koh Sek Lim Village. Sir, Members  of  the

House,  especially those representing rural  areas,

will  agree with me that stove-making and vegetable

farming are not profitable propositions. The people

engaged  in  these occupations have  to  live  like

everyone of us here. Therefore, they turn to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



cottage-industries, such as iron foundry, furniture-making,  rattan-cleaning  apart  from  farming,  in

order to supplement their living. These people have

been, issued with notices from the Commissioner  of

Lands  to  stop such activities, because  they  are

said  to  have contravened the terms and conditions

of their leases. Sir, our Government has been, both

practical and realistic, and I hope it will  always

be.  But  since these poor people cannot supplement

their  living, by stove-making or farming, I  would

urge the Minister to consider making, amendments to

the present conditions of the lease so as to enable

such  people, who are unable to earn a  sufficient

living  by  farming or stove-making, to  return  to

their farms, as I mentioned, earlier, to make their

living.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, those; persons

affected by the acquisition of land in 1955 for the

development of Paya Lebar Airport were resettled in

the Bedok resettlement area, as pointed out, by the

Member  for Changi. The allocation of land on  this

area  was  done  on a, very special basis  in  that

resettlers  were  not  given Temporary  Occupation,

Licences  but 60-year leases, with effect from  1st

January, 1955. These leases; carry no premiums  but

special covenants restricting the uses of the land.

One  of'  these covenants require the  lessees  to.

farm, cultivate, manure and manage the whole of the

land  they leased in good and husband-like  manner,

and  to  use  the  buildings  erected  thereon  for

dwelling  purposes only. Recently, it has  come  to

light that, in a number of cases, the law has  been

flouted and the lessees have breached this covenant

by  using the land not for agricultural or dwelling

purposes,  but for purposes foreign to  the  lease,

such  as  rattan-splitting, metal works,  furniture

manufacture, sundry shop, etc. Hence  they  run  to

their' Member of Parliament for help. Notices were,

therefore,  served  by the Land'  Office  on  these

lessees  for  breach of the covenant.  However,  in

view  of  the  number of appeals received  and  the

appeal from the Member for Changi, a survey of  the

whole  of the Bedok resettlement area is now  being

carried out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



by  the Land Office to ascertain the extent of  and

reasons   for  the  breaches,  and  other   related

information.  The Primary Production Department  is

also  being  asked  to advise on  the  agricultural

potentials of the area. The Member will be glad  to

know   that   consideration  as  to  whether   this

restrictive covenant in the lease should be removed

to  enable the lessees to use the land for purposes

other than agriculture can only be given after  the

survey  is  completed and the report, incorporating

the views of the Primary Production Department,  is

made  available. But consideration will  be  given,

and I hope the Member is satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have  a  very  good explanation from  the  Minister

regarding land and housing problem. But I think  it

is  proper  for me to explain the position  to  the

Minister.  Where a building has been  leased  on  a

Temporary Occupation Licence, the occupants  should

be  given permission to carry out minor renovations

to  the building. I say this because there are some

buildings  which are going to collapse, and  unless

renovation is carried out they would have to go  to

the Housing Board for flats. As it stands, the Land

Office   in  most  cases  has  refused   to   grant

permission for any form of renovation or  extension

to be carried out to these buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are certain areas in Singapore where

the land belongs to the Government. Since this land

is  not used for any particular purpose, can we not

allow  some form of cultivation to be carried  out,

such as farming, provided the occupants do not  put

up  any  structures on the land, and provided  they

return the land to Government without compensation?

This   will   help   Singapore's   production    of

vegetables, thereby reducing our dependence on  our

neighbours for our vegetable supplies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to bring up is

this:  when  a building catches fire  but  is  only

slightly burned, why should the Land Office  insist

that  the  occupants should move out? Why  are  the

residents not allowed to continue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



to   occupy   the   building  after   repairs   and

renovations have been carried out? There  are  many

buildings in such a state. They are still  in  very

good  condition  in spite of the slight  damage  by

fire,  but they are all locked up to prevent people

from  going in. The occupants, therefore,  have  no

place  to  go  to, but to the Housing Board.  As  a

result,  the  demand for' Housing  Board  flats  is

increasing. What we can do to help is to allow them

to  carry out repairs and to let them continue  to

occupy the premises for some time.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a building at No. 13 Choon; Guan Street,

which  is in my constituency. I would like  to  ask

the Minister to go' and see it. The building is  in

good condition, but nobody is occupying it. It, was

only  slightly burnt. In fact, only the groundfloor

was  slightly  burnt. Yet the door remained  closed

and nobody is occupying the building. It is a three-storey building and many families can, stay in  it.

However,  the Government's urban renewal policy  is

such  that nobody can occupy it. We must relax this

policy.  Under  the  urban  renewal  schemes,  many

residents in old buildings have been asked to  move

at  short  notice. I am referring  to  the  private

developers.  When  a  private developer  wishes  to

develop a piece of land on which there are some old

buildings,  he may offer $1,000 or $2,000  to  each

tenant  and  ask them to quit; their houses.  These

are  poor people' and they think that $1,000  is  a

lot  of'  money.  They  also think  that  they  can

straightaway get a Housing Board flat by making  an

immediate   application  to  the   Housing   Board.

However, having received the $1,000 they find  that

they  cannot  get  a  flat immediately.  And  these

tenants may get an advice from their lawyer not  to

quit  unless they get more money for it.  The  Land

Office  must  first see to it that people  who  are

living   in   old  houses  are  given   alternative

accommodation  before  granting  approval  to   the

developer to demolish the houses and to develop the

land. Only then will the people say that it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



a  very  fair  deal. When approval is  given  to  a

developer  to  develop an area, the  Housing  Board

should  at the same time build more flats  for  the

people  who are to be evicted. We have to  consider

all  these factors. Therefore, it would be  a  wise

move  to  introduce legislation to the effect  that

when  a private developer wishes to develop an area

he  should  provide  alternative  accommodation  to

those  who are to be evicted and not to offer  mere

monetary  compensation. I hope  the  Minister  will

consider this matter and take any necessary  action

and  to  allow tenants temporary occupation of  the

premises.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I reply to the

last point raised by the Member on the question  of

alternative  accommodation  for  tenants  occupying

houses affected by private development? I think the

Member  is aware that the whole island of Singapore

is  governed by the Control of Rent Act  which  has

been  in  operation since the last war.  In  short,

Sir,   this  Act  protects  tenants  of  controlled

premises,  meaning  houses, `buildings  or  offices

built  or completed on or before the 7th September,

1947.  If  you live in a controlled premises,  your

landlord  cannot evict you. He can only succeed  in

evicting  you if he pays money. And if  you,  as  a

tenant  or  an  occupant, accept such  compensation

from  your  landlord and move out, then you  cannot

claim  priority for a Housing Board  flat.  In  the

same  way  in  the  Golden  Shoe  area  where   the

Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act apply,

the landlord can evict the tenants provided he pays

compensation  as fixed by the Tenants' Compensation

Board.  If they are paid compensation, they  should

find alternative accommodation for themselves; they

have  no  choice.  However, for  the  rest  of  the

tenants in Singapore, they have a choice. There  is

no  need  for them to move out. But if they  accept

compensation and move out, then they should not ask

the  Housing Board for priority to flats. They  can

apply  for flats but they will be put on the points

system. They do not deserve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



priority since they have been paid compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for houses affected by fire, it is not

Government's policy to acquire every piece of  land

on  which  the  buildings  are  affected  by  fire,

especially when only the fringe has been  affected.

I  am  not  conversant  with  the  particular  case

pointed out by the Member, but if he could give  me

more particulars I shall look into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other point, I do not know whether

it  is  a question of acquisition or of Government,

having  acquired land and evicting  the  occupants,

doing  nothing  to  re-develop it.  Perhaps  it  is

because  plans for urban renewal or development  in

that area have been delayed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am not complaining

about  priority  consideration  for  Housing  Board

flats for these people. I am only pointing out  the

treatment that they get.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tenants do not know about the difficulties

of alternative accommodation. When they are offered

money,  they  do  not hesitate  to  give  up  their

tenancy.  Money is a very dangerous commodity.  But

later,    when    they   cannot   get   alternative

accommodation, they regretted. That is the trouble.

Therefore,  my point is that we must  prevent  this

from happening again, so that these people will not

suffer.  If  I  may repeat, I am  not  saying  that

priority should be given to these people when  they

apply  for  Housing Board flats. I  only  want  the

Minister to listen to their complaints.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member

has  made the point that money is the root  of  all

evil.  But surely it is up to Members of this House

to  advise their constituents. Not everyone here is

a  lawyer, but as far as housing and the Control of

Rent  Act  are concerned, this is what I advise  my

constituents - and Members here should also  advise

their  constituents - do not quit unless  they  are

satisfied  with  the  amount  of  compensation.  Of

course,  I  am  referring to  controlled  premises.

However, if an occupant has accepted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



compensation, he should not insist on priority  for

Housing Board accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before

approving   any   plans   for   development,    the

authorities concerned should ask the developer  how

many tenants or squatters there are in the area  to

be  developed,  and  how  many  houses  are  to  be

demolished.  They  should also  ask  whether  these

people require alternative accommodation or whether

they  prefer  compensation.  Only  after  all  this

information  has been supplied should the  plan  be

approved.  These innocent people do  not  know  the

law.  That is why we must have a scheme to  protect

these  poor people. Private developers are  putting

up  many multi-storey buildings. They make a lot of

money,  but  the poor tenants suffer  because  they

cannot get alternative accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret that there

is  no  such  law  at the moment. We  cannot  force

developers to provide accommodation for  their  ex-tenants. However, the tenants themselves can insist

on   this  provision  by  refusing  to  shift,  and

agreeing to do so only on condition that they  will

be provided with accommodation in the new building.

There  have been a few cases like this. The tenants

refused  to  shift until they were  sure  that  the

plans  could be approved by the Planning Department

and  until  they  knew where their new  alternative

premises   would  be  -the  exact  dimensions   and

location  of the building offered by the  landlord.

This  can be done by private agreement. To  provide

for  this  arrangement in the  law  would  mean  an

amendment  to  the  Control  of  Rent  Act  or  the

Controlled  Premises (Special Provisions)  Act.  At

the  time  when  the  Controlled Premises  (Special

Provisions)  Bill  was being studied  by  a  Select

Committee,  the Member should have suggested  these

amendments before it was passed in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  not  satisfied  with the answer  given  by  the

Minister. My



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



intention  was to draw the Minister's attention  to

the fact that officials in the Land Office were not

performing their duties properly. If this state  of

affairs  continues,  then our resettlement  schemes

will be hampered. If no compensation is paid to the

squatters or the tenants, they will not be able  to

move out and to rebuild their farms elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also said just now that notices were

put  up on the land itself to request any claimants

to  come  forward. As far as I know, these  notices

are  usually  written in English  and  in  a  legal

language.  The  notices are, in  fact,  beyond  the

comprehension of the man in the street,  let  alone

the  farmers.  I  wonder whether any  of  them  can

understand  notices written in English and  couched

in  legal  language. It is only  the  landlord  who

understands these notices, and probably he will  be

the   only  person  to  make  a  claim.  He   will,

therefore,   say   that   all   these   lands   and

improvements thereon belong to him and  him  alone.

Consequently, the officials in the Land Office will

pay  everything to the landlord at the  expense  of

the  tenants.  I have received many  complaints  of

this  nature, and I have referred them to the  Land

Office.  The answer I invariably received  is  that

all  payments of compensation have been made to the

landlord  and  nothing more can be done.  Will  the

Minister  look after the interests of  the  tenants

who are not paid any compensation? Can we introduce

legislation to ensure that part of the compensation

received  by  the landlord should be  paid  to  the

tenants?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid we cannot

legislate as suggested by the Member, as it will be

against the principles of property law. All  I  can

advise him is to file his complaints with the  Land

Office.  As for notices in the English language,  I

am  sure  the  occupants of the  land  are  not  so

illiterate or foolish as not to find out  what  the

notice  is  all about. The Member can translate  it

for   them.  I  am  sure  he  can,  if  his   other

constituents cannot. However, assuming that they do

not get compensation to which they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



entitled  as of right, or at least be paid  an  ex-gratia payment, then my advice to them is that they

should  not  move  out until the Land  Office  pays

them. It is as simple as that. There is no need for

legislation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do not think there can be any use in continuing the

debate  on  this  line. It will  not  lead  to  any

conclusion, because the Minister does not appear to

be  very  sincere  in wanting to  help  these  poor

tenants  who  are  affected  by  land  acquisition.

However,  in view of the limited time, I beg  leave

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1107 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101*.(* The same amendment also stood in the names of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the total allocation for expenditure on the

National  Development  Division  under  Head   1107

amounts to $14.59 million for this financial  year,

which  is  slightly less than the amount  allocated

for 1971-72 which was $15 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department is responsible

for  the planning and increasing the production  of

farm  produce  in Singapore. With the encouragement

of  the  Primary Production Department,  there  has

been  considerable  increase  in  farm  produce  in

Singapore.  The Department has also  given  various

kinds  of assistance to the farmers, which includes

methods  of  improved  production,  inoculation  of

poultry   and   farm  animals  and   technical   or

scientific  aid to the farmers. The Department  has

also introduced better breeds of poultry and pigs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



to  the  farmers.  As a result of such  assistance,

there  is a considerable increase in the production

of eggs, meat and pork, and there is also a surplus

for export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of this bumper harvest, poultry

farmers  and  pig  rearers have excess  produce  in

hand.  As  a  result, the' prices of their  produce

drop  considerably. This affects  the  pig  rearers

adversely.  I have tried to analyse the causes  for

the  drop  in  the price of pigs and pork.  1  have

exchanged views with my constituents and, according

to them, the drop in the price of pigs and pork can

be  attributed to two factors. The first is because

of  the  lack  of  planning in production.  A  year

before  last, the price of pigs reached a  peak  of

more   than  $100  per  picul.  This  resulted   in

increased production and a rise in income  for  the

pig  rearers.  According to  the  estimates,  their

production increased by more than 100 per cent. But

this high price has resulted in a surplus which, in

turn, has caused a drop in price. The second factor

is  that  the Monday-off for butchers has caused  a

drop in pork consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is any good harvest, it should be

taken  as  a good sign. But because of an unlimited

and unplanned increase in production and because of

the  lack  of marketing facilities, the  prices  of

farm  produce  have dropped. This is  a  very  hard

economic blow to the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to look after the interests of these

farmers,  the  best  way is to  set  up  a  farmers

association or a co-operative society. We  have  to

make an estimate of the number of pigs required for

consumption  and for export in order to  make  sure

that  the forces of supply and demand are balanced.

In order to make this plan succeed, all the farmers

must co-operate. They must understand that this  is

for  the  common  good and mutual  benefit  of  all

farmers. The proposed farmers co-operative  society

must  ensure  that middlemen will not be  able  to'

continue to exploit the farmers or to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



manipulate the prices of farm produce. In this way,

the prices of farm produce could be stabilised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department has spent more

than  $40  million  of public funds  for  the  main

purpose  of  helping our farmers to  develop  their

agriculture  and  farming activities  and  to  look

after  the  interest of the farmers. The Department

has  experts  as well as organisers in this  field.

They  know their jobs and surely they can help  the

farmers   to   organise  a  co-operative   society.

Furthermore,  the Minister for Social  Affairs  has

said  in this House yesterday that the Registry  of

Co-operative  Societies would be prepared  to  help

farmers organise co-operatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be denied that everything is

difficult  at  the  beginning,  but  we  must  also

believe in the proverb that man can move mountains.

So with the Government's efforts and organisational

help, coupled with the co-operation of the farmers,

we  will  be able to overcome whatever difficulties

there  may  be at the beginning. We are  a  dynamic

Government. We have solved the serious  problem  of

unemployment.    We   have   succeeded    in    our

industrialisation programme. We  have  also  solved

the acute shortage of housing. Similarly, Sit, with

this  dynamism,  the Primary Production  Department

can  give their attention to this problem and solve

the  difficulties. The farmers, the Department, and

the  animal  feeds producers can come together  and

work out a way to stabilise the prices of pigs  and

other  farm  produce. In this way, the  welfare  of

nearly 300,000 farmers will be well looked after.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the economy of

Singapore operates in a free enterprise system  and

the  prices  of  commodities are regulated  by  the

forces of supply and demand. Prices of farm produce

are  also  dictated  by such forces.  We  have  had

previous  occasions  in  this  House  when  Members

complained that the price of eggs was going  up  or

down,  and  I  have explained the reasons  in  this

House  several  times. Because of their  perishable

nature, an over-supply of farm produce will  result

in a fall in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



prices  greater  than  in  other  commodities;  the

opposite  is  also  true. The  fall  in  prices  of

primary  produce  has frequently been  due  to  the

farmers  themselves over-producing when prices  are

good.  This results in a price drop when the market

is over-supplied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for pigs, the prices for the last three or

four years were relatively high, not less than  $90

per  picul, but sometimes the price reached a level

of about $130 per picul. This was the time when the

producers  of  pigs  really had  it  good.  At  the

beginning  of  this year, prices of pigs,  however,

went down and the price now is about $70 per picul,

mainly  due to over-production. Singapore  produces

over 1,100,000 pigs per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department has been

supplying  the  farmers  with  up  to-date   market

information.  It  is,  unwise  for  Government   to

intervene in market prices or the market system, as

this    may    have   serious   and    far-reaching

repercussions. If the price is high and  we  impose

controls, pigs will be sold in the black market. If

the prices are low and we fix the prices higher, no

one  will  buy. Of course, the position is  not  as

simple as that, but I am only putting it simply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the suggestion of a co-operative society,

this  is,  in  fact,  under the  portfolio  of  the

Minister for Social Affairs. The Primary Production

Department, of course, will be glad to provide  any

advice and assistance to farmers who wish to set up

a  co-operative  society. But for any  co-operative

society  to survive, it must rely mainly  on  self-help  and  be  strongly supported  by  the  farmers

themselves.  The farmers must also  be  made  fully

aware of the aims, objectives and benefits of  such

a society. A word of warning: the society must have

a strong management. Many such other societies have

not   succeeded   because  of   mismanagement   and

subsequent lack of support from their members.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Primary  Production  Department  is  in  charge  of

several primary production projects, and these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



have  resulted in the gathering of much useful  and

interesting  knowledge and expertise.  Examples  of

such  projects  are fish rearing, including  edible

species as well as tropical aquarium fish, mushroom

cultivation  and  hydroponics.  I  would  like   to

suggest  that this knowledge and expertise be  made

available  to  interested members  of  the  general

public through appropriate courses. `They could  be

organised   either   by  the   Primary   Production

Department  itself  or in collaboration,  possibly,

with  the  Adult Education Board.  I  am  sure  the

Minister  will  agree  that,  for  example,  orchid

cultivation   and,  indeed  more   recently,   the,

breeding   of  aquarium  fish  have  become   quite

significant commercial activities. In the  case  of

orchid  cultivation, quite an important  factor  in

its  development has been the interest  of  private

enthusiasts.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not be at all surprised that in the case

of  tropical  fish also, recreational activity  has

turned  out  in  the end to be quite  a  profitable

activity  for many people. It may be possible  that

with  more  people  being  interested  in  mushroom

cultivation   and   hydroponics   as   recreational

activities, such enthusiasm may also turn out to be

profitable activities; even, in the monetary sense,

for  the  individual; and useful for  the  national

economy in a humble yet significant way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the knowledge and information

acquired    from    research    experiments     and

investigations conducted by the Primary  Production

Department  in  various farming  topics  are  being

effectively  disseminated to the farming  community

and also to the public at large. The department has

over the years developed a network of ten extension

centres in the more important farming areas.  These

centres are staffed by qualified officers who visit

the farms regularly and give on-the-spot advice  to

farmers.  They  also organise training  programmes,

talks  and  demonstrations.  Information  is   also

spread widely through the department's monthly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



news  bulletin, pamphlets, and by way of film shows

and  rural  news  broadcasts. The Pig  and  Poultry

Research and Training Institute and the Fresh Water

Fisheries  Laboratory at Sembawang organise  within

the  station  talks and demonstrations  on  various

aspects  of  pig  and  poultry  rearing  and   fish

cultivation.  The  research  findings  on  mushroom

cultivation  have  been disseminated  to  some  700

people  from all walks of life through a series  of

short  courses  conducted between  March  1970  and

October 1971. On hydroponics, the findings  so  far

indicate that this system of cultivation can  be  a

commercial  proposition  for  certain  crops,   but

results  have  not been so satisfactory  for  other

crops. Further research is, in fact, very necessary

to  improve and perfect the system. The Farm School

at  Sembawang offers one-year residential  training

courses  for  farm  youths, who are  given  general

training  on  farming  techniques  and  specialised

training  in  animal  husbandry,  horticulture  and

fresh water fisheries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member has any concrete suggestion,

perhaps he could make his representations direct to

the   Director  of  Primary  Production,  who  will

certainly   co-operate  with  the  Adult  Education

Department  to  further publicise  the  results  of

research   and   findings  made  in   the   Primary

Production Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  had  more than one occasion in this House  to

speak   on   the  treatment  of  farmers   by   the

Government,   and   that  is,  the   treatment   is

inadequate. After hearing the Minister's  reply  to

the Member for Sembawang, we can see that there  is

evidence   for   this  inadequate  treatment.   For

example,  the Minister mentioned that  the  current

price  of  pigs is $70 per picul. Let me  tell  him

that  the current price is less than $50 per picul.

This goes to show that either the officials in  the

Primary Production Department are sleeping, or some

of  them  are deliberately deceiving the  Minister.

Because of the fluctuations in prices, farmers  are

generally  adversely  affected,  but  the  Minister

keeps on repeating the old theme that prices are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



determined by supply and demand and that he  cannot

do  anything about it. I am sure he can  find  ways

and means of assisting these farmers. For instance,

help  them  to  explore overseas  markets.  At  the

moment  the Government is merely providing  certain

technical assistance through the Primary Production

Department.  But  that is not  sufficient.  As  the

Member  for Sembawang has pointed out, the  Primary

Production Department has, in fact, provided  quite

a  lot  of  technical assistance to  increase  farm

production,  but  what  is the  consequence  of  an

increase in the farm production? The consequence is

an overproduction of farm produce. As a result, the

farmers are being exploited by middlemen and prices

go down, and farmers stand to lose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government believes in democratic

socialism.  I  hope the Government  is  not  merely

interested in raising the standard of living of the

middle  and higher classes, but also interested  in

raising  the  standard  of  living  of  the   lower

classes,  especially the farmers and the fishermen.

I  have  here several question3 to ask the Minister

concerned:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) I would like to ask the Minister whether the

Government  is going to allocate certain  areas  of

land for the use of farmers. Although the land area

in  Singapore  is limited, we can see that  certain

areas  are  earmarked  for industrial  development,

residential  estates, military purposes,  etc.  Why

cannot  we do the same thing for the farmers,  that

is,  to  earmark  certain  areas  for  agricultural

purposes?  The majority of our farmers in Singapore

are   occupying  land  under  Temporary  Occupation

Licences,   meaning   a   licence   for   temporary

occupation  only. Therefore, the  farmers  have  no

security of tenure, because at any time they may be

asked  to  move  out.  I  would  like  to  ask  the

Minister,  if  he has earmarked certain  areas  for

agricultural  purposes, whether he  can  provide  a

longer  tenure  for  these  farmers,  for  example,

granting  a  30 years' or 50 years' lease  so  that

farmers  can carry out their farming activities  in

peace.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is the Minister going to convert the Primary

Production Department into a statutory board? As  a

statutory  board, the department  can  better  look

after  the farmers in various ways. A few days  ago

we  heard the Minister for Communications say  that

the  Telecommunications Department  would  soon  be

converted  into  a statutory board.  He  said  that

after  conversion  the Board  would  do  better  in

respect of recruitment and implementation and  that

there would also be a greater degree of flexibility

in the management of telecommunication services.  I

wonder if the Minister for National Development  is

going  to  do the same with the Primary  Production

Department.  For  instance, the Primary  Production

Department  as  a statutory authority  can  provide

information  obtained as a result of research,  and

also  provide  plans for production and  statistics

for the farmers. These farmers can benefit from the

result  of  these  various forms of  financial  and

technical  assistance. Another matter is about  the

use  of chemicals and fertilizers in the farms,  If

the   Primary  Production  Department  can  provide

technical  expertise in respect of these fields,  I

am sure the farmers will be able to benefit a great

deal.  I wonder what the Minister has to say  about

this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member accuses me of repeating an

old theme. What am I expected to do when he himself

never  raises any new theme? His grouses on farming

have  been heard in this House for many a year.  My

answers  have never satisfied him, but he  realises

that  the Primary Production Department has done  a

lot  for  farmers in Singapore, though, of  course,

not  to the Member's satisfaction. I can assure him

that  this Government is also for the poor  people.

If  the Member is not satisfied with my answers, it

is  unfair of him to say that I am not for the poor

people.  In fact, I begin to be very suspicious  of

Members  who  get up in this House and  shout  that

they  are for the poor. I think that is the general

feeling  in  this  House. To  accuse  the  People's

Action Party of not being a socialist party and  of

not being for the poor is indeed very foolish. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



we  were not for the poor, we would not be in  this

job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his first question whether I am allocating

certain  agricultural areas for farmers, there  are

already   agricultural   areas   or   areas   zoned

"agriculture"   under   the   Master   Plan.    The

agricultural areas are already there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his second question about turning the Primary

Production Department into a statutory corporation,

the answer is no. The Primary Production Department

is  not  on  all  fours with the Telecommunications

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear! hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> What is good for them may not be good

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

has  replied to many points about poultry and pigs.

But  what  efforts have been made  by  the  Primary

Production Department to introduce poultry and  pig

rearing in flatted factories? Our precious land  in

the  rural areas is generally used for poultry  and

pig  farming.  By centralising their production  in

flatted factories, production can be increased  and

exported, thereby bringing the cost of living down.

The    Singapore    housewife    has    experienced

`fluctuations  in the price of fish.  Most  of  the

fish  we  consume are imported, and  therefore  the

catch of fish is subject to the weather. It is high

time  we  introduced trawlers for deep-sea fishing.

This will not only produce bigger catches, but will

also help to bring the price of fish down. Further,

deep-sea  fishing is less likely to be affected  by

weather conditions or foreign market control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the proposals for this scheme of

pig  and  poultry  rearing in flatted  farms  on  a

commercial scale



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



have been under consideration for some time now.  A

pilot  scheme will be introduced in order to  study

the  management  and operational problems,  disease

control,  and  the design of the buildings.  Whilst

such  a system of farming for pigs and poultry will

optimise the use of land, the capital investment is

much  higher than for the conventional method.  The

economics   have,  therefore,  to  be  worked   out

properly before such a method can be introduced  to

farmers in general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for fish, whilst deep-sea trawling is a

laudable idea, it is again not a simple matter.  It

requires  high capital as deep-sea fishing  vessels

and  fishing gear are very expensive. What is  also

required is a high level of skill. It is also  true

that,  though deep-sea trawlers are independent  of

weather  conditions,  they are  very  dependent  on

fishing  grounds.  Not  every  part  of  the  ocean

contains  fish, or fish that can be caught  without

the   fishermen  themselves  getting  caught.   The

Government  itself is doing all it can  to  promote

deep-sea   fishing.  It  provides   the   necessary

infrastructure such as ship landing  and  marketing

facilities,  training in fishing and research  into

fishing grounds to encourage the private sector  to

go into deep-sea fishing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister mentioned that I have no new theme  to

speak  about. It goes to show that the problem  has

not  been  solved. If the problem has been  solved,

then  I would have dwelt on new ideas and opinions.

The  Minister also mentioned that under the  Master

Plan  for Singapore, there are certain areas  which

are  allocated for agriculture. I would like to ask

whether he can inform the House of the areas  which

have  been allocated for agriculture. He  has  also

omitted one of the points I raised. In these  zones

which  have been allocated for agriculture,  is  he

prepared  to  grant a longer term of  lease  rather

than a Temporary Occupation Licence?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer to the last question is a

definite   no.   As   for  the  areas   zoned   for

agriculture, without a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



map  of  Singapore, I cannot point them out.  There

are areas in Punggol, Jurong, and in Chua Chu Kang.

I  would  be  happy  to point out the  agricultural

zones  if  the  Member will visit my  office  on  a

convenient date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt whether my answers have satisfied him, or

whether  I  have  left  out anything  on  which  he

desires further information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,    as   the   representative   `of   a   rural

constituency, I am most interested in the  fall  in

the  price  of  pigs.  I am sure  the  Minister  is

equally  interested.  I am  not  objecting  to  the

Minister's  statement  that  prices  of  pigs   are

determined  by the supply and demand. But  I  would

like  to  ask  what he is going to  do  about  this

problem. When the prices of pigs drop, what is  the

Primary  Production Department going to  do?  Until

now,  has the Depart-went done anything to  reverse

the trend of falling prices?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer is nothing has been done.

It  is up to the farmers to produce less. When  the

prices  of pigs were high, we have never heard  one

squeak from the Member. When the prices are low, he

asks what is the Department doing about it. It is a

question  of supply and demand - produce  less  and

the  prices will go up, produce more and the prices

will  go  down. They should not run to the  Primary

Production  Department every  time  something  goes

wrong, but try `to learn to look after themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not  agree with what the Minister has said.  If

the  Government is sincere in helping the  farmers,

it  can  do  so by looking for overseas markets  so

that  they  could export their pigs.  The  Minister

said  that in the last two years the prices of pigs

were  very high. If the Minister is going  to  help

the  farmers,  then he can try to  help  them  sell

their  pigs  overseas. The Government can  help  by

doing this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, there are many ways of exporting

and selling pigs. The Primary Production Department

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



always  been  behind the farmers.  Pigs  have  been

exported to Malaysia, and also to Sabah. From  time

to  time  a ban is imposed. In fact, at the moment,

there  is  a  ban against the import of  pigs  into

these  countries.  But  there  are  other  avenues.

Moreover,  when  the  price is  up,  the  consumers

shout.  Therefore,  I think it is  unfair  for  the

Member  to come to this House and ask what  we  are

doing  when  the price is down, or to say  that  he

does not get any satisfactory answers from me. They

must learn to control their supply with the demand.

When  the  price of eggs goes up, the  farmers  are

happy,  but the consumers are angry. So I  have  to

answer  questions in this House  about  what  I  am

doing  to get the price of eggs down. And when  the

price  goes down, someone asks: what are you  doing

to bring the price of eggs up?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I think we can give the Minister some rest.  I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (2), Mr Ho Kah Leong. Are

Ho?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1107 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I would like to

talk  about  the  problem of fisheries.  We  talked

about  agriculture just now, so this is a different

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember last year in this House the

Minister  concerned  mentioned that  our  fishermen

could only catch one quarter of our consumption  of

fish and he thought that it was a shame. Sir, after

a  period  of  one  year,  has  the  Minister  done

anything  in respect of promotion of fisheries!  Up

to  the  present moment, fishing activities in  our

country are declining. Although we say that we  are

going  to  encourage deep-sea fishing, the  Primary

Production Department is only providing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



certain  technical assistance to some  youths.  The

Department  has not thought of ways  and  means  to

encourage  people to invest in deep-sea fishing  or

in  joint  ventures between the State  and  private

enterprise.  So  deep-sea  fishing  activities  are

still  in  their initial stage because nothing  has

been  done  in this respect. Off-shore  fishing  is

also   declining   because  of  deep-sea   trawlers

operating along our coasts, and the Government  has

not taken adequate steps to prevent the supplies of

fish  from dwindling further. Hence the decline  in

our fishing activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, I would like to ask the Minister

whether   the  Government  intends  to   help   our

fishermen  to develop off-shore fishing or  coastal

fishing.  Secondly, is the Government  prepared  to

allocate  stretches  of land  along  the  coast  to

accommodate   fishermen   affected   by   clearance

schemes, so that they may have a place to live  and

to  anchor  their fishing boats? Thirdly,  has  the

Government  any intention of negotiating  with  our

neighbouring  countries  to  extend   our   fishing

grounds  and  to  sign an agreement  with  them  to

enable  our  fishermen to fish in their territorial

waters?  I remember that before confrontation,  our

fishermen  could get licences to fish in Indonesian

waters.  After confrontation, it has ceased.  So  I

would  like  to  know whether the  Government  can,

through   ASEAN  or  some  regional  organisations,

acquire this privilege for our fishermen to fish in

their  territorial  waters. If this  can  be  done,

fishermen   who  have  strayed  into   neighbouring

territorial waters, either because of storms or  if

they are faced with difficulty and are detained  by

them,  will  be able to return to Singapore  safely

and   as  early  as  possible.  Fourthly,  is   the

Government   prepared   to  co-operate   with   our

neighbouring  countries to eliminate  pirates  from

the high seas? I have received many complaints from

fishermen  that  whenever  they  were  accosted  by

pirates on the high seas, they were robbed of their

fishing nets, and sometimes even their motors  were

taken away and the crew



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



were taken as hostages until they had paid up their

ransom.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, is the Fisheries Section of the Primary

Production  Department  willing  to  continue  with

their  training courses to enable our fishermen  to

acquire  some  knowledge on deep-sea  fishing,  for

example,  the  spotting of fish in  deep  sea,  the

repair of vessels and other related subjects  since

our fishermen are not so well informed about modern

techniques in deep-sea fishing? I hope the Minister

will reply to all these questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid I am

going  to  be rather long in my answer. I have  got

five  questions  which  the Member  has  taken  ten

minutes  to ask. Anyway, I will do my best to  give

as much information to the Member as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of licensed fishermen has

increased from 1,919 in 1970 to 2,209 in  1971.  Of

this number, 1,549 fishermen or 73 per cent of them

were  employed on inboard-powered fishing  vessels;

439  fishermen  were  employed on  outboard-powered

fishing  vessels, and the remaining  230  fishermen

were   employed  on  non-powered  vessels.  It   is

anticipated that the number of fishermen on inboard-powered vessels will continue to increase with  the

trend  towards off-shore and deep-sea fishing.  The

number  of  in-shore  fishermen  will  continue  to

decrease  in  view  of increasing industrialisation

and coastal development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to fishing vessels, the number of

licences  in  1971  was  794.  There  is  a  slight

increase in the number of motorised vessels  and  a

decline  in  the number of non-powered vessels, in

1971  a  total of 15,210 tons of fish were produced

or  caught  by local fishermen. A total  of  38,000

tons  were  imported from West Malaysia, comprising

about 80 per cent of the total fish imports. In the

same  year  1971, a total of 737 local and  foreign

vessels made use of the fishing port facilities  at

Jurong,  landing a total of 13,716  tons  of  fish.

Together



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



with  the fish brought in by lorries from Malaysia,

a   total  of  nearly  53,000  tons  of  fish  were

auctioned  at the Jurong Central Fish Market.  With

the  addition of one fish processing factory during

the year, the total number of factories at the port

has been increased to `four.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marine Fisheries Research Department of the

South-east   Asian  Fisheries  Development   Centre

concluded  its second year of activities  with  the

completion of its first training course  for  seven

trainee-scientists  from the Philippines,  Vietnam,

Thailand and Singapore. The research vessel  Changi

completed seven research and fishing survey cruises

totalling  93 days in the South China Sea  and  the

Indian Ocean. The emphasis on these cruises was  on

trawling and oceanography. A preliminary survey  on

tuna  long-line was also conducted. The reports  on

these cruises and quarterly reports on research and

training   activities   of  the   department   were

circulated  to member countries. The staff  of  the

department  presented four research papers  at  the

Second  Congress of the Singapore National  Academy

of Science in November 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to the training and education of

fishermen,  a  batch of 21 trainees graduated  from

the  Changi Fisheries Training Centre.  This  is  a

joint  project of the Singapore Government and  the

United  Nations Development Programme. The trainees

graduated in September 1971 after undergoing a one-year course in marine engineering, navigation,  and

fishing gear technology. March 1971 saw the arrival

of  the  230 gross ton stern trawler tuna long-line

training  vessel Jurong to join the  60  gross  ton

training  vessel  Kangkar. Another training  course

commenced  recently. A wider field of  training  is

being  provided  to enable a greater  diversity  in

employment opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member is interested in aqua culture, an

investigation  was made on the culture  of  grouper

fish  in  floating  cage-nets in  selected  coastal

areas.  They were stocked intensively and fed  with

trash fish. Experiments to condition them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



to   pelleted  feed  will  be  carried   out.   The

preliminary   results   of  the   experiments   are

encouraging,   but   further   investigations   are

necessary. Experiments were also conducted  on  the

rearing  of  carp  in  floating  cage-nets  in  the

Seletar  Reservoir. Mass production  of  the  giant

freshwater  prawn  was  successfully  carried  out.

About  50,000  juvenile prawns were distributed  to

fishpond operators on an experimental basis so that

they can rear the prawns together with the carp. If

the  Member is interested in ornamental fish, I can

elaborate  further.  However,  this  is  merely  to

assure  him  that the Primary Production Department

is doing something for fishermen in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

appreciate  very much the bouquet he has  given  to

the  staff  of  the Primary Production  Department.

However, he has not replied to my questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the Member's

questions  is  whether  we  intend  to   help   our

fishermen.  And  I  have given  an  answer  to  his

question as to what we are doing to help fishermen.

It  is  not  a bouquet, but a whole rigmarole!  The

Member  has asked mc what are we doing to encourage

fishermen  to  go in for deep-sea fishing.  I  have

given  him  particulars of  what  is  happening  at

Changi.  That is what we are doing. The Member  has

also asked me what we are going to do about fishing

in  foreign  waters. He should  have  directed  his

question  to  the  Minister `for  Foreign  Affairs,

because he deals with affairs outside Singapore. As

for  our fishermen being captured by pirates, I  am

afraid  there  is  nothing the  Primary  Production

Department  can  do about affairs in  international

waters  or in foreign waters. If our fishermen  are

caught  in Singapore waters, then it is up  to  our

Marine  Police  to  catch  the  pirates,  if   any.

However,  some  of our fishermen have  been  caught

thousands  of miles away from Singapore.  There  is

nothing we can do to stop this. All we can do is to

make representations for their release from foreign

countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

some  of  my questions may be on matters which  are

not  the responsibility of his Ministry, but anyway

he  is not prepared to reply to them. There is  one

matter,  however, which is under his  jurisdiction.

Is  the Minister prepared to allocate a stretch  of

coastal area to fishermen who are evicted? When the

fishermen are resettled from their place, they will

not  be  allocated land just because they  are  not

farmers.  Now  that many coastal  areas  have  been

reclaimed  for development purposes,  they  do  not

have enough moorings for their fishing boats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all I can say in

answer  to  a general question is that, unless  the

Member  gives me specific particulars, we will  not

be able to help. However, I must know where are the

areas   which  they  require.  There  are   fishing

facilities in Jurong and also at Punggol.  Some  of

the few kelongs opposite the East Coast reclamation

have had to be demolished and compensation paid  to

the  fishermen affected. Therefore, to say that  we

evict  fishermen without compensating them  is  not

true and is misleading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  is  what has happened at Tuas Village  in  my

constituency. It is a traditional fishing  village.

`There are many fishermen staying there. When their

land  was  taken  over for development,  they  were

evicted  without being allocated land just  because

they did not belong to the category of farmers.  It

may  well  be  that  due  to  the  difficulties  of

interpretation the Minister was unable to  get  the

gist of my questions and, therefore, was unable  to

give  me a satisfactory reply. However, because  of

the time factor, I do not wish to talk any further.

I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1107 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1501*.(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Ch'ng Jit Koon and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have recently come into contact with taxi

drivers  in  the  course  of  their  charity  drive

campaign. Some of them are my constituents. I  have

heard  grouses from them that they are not  allowed

to  use  the  public car parks, even  if  they  are

prepared  to pay the usual fees. I have  been  told

that  the  existing  rules and regulations  do  not

permit  taxis to be parked in the public car parks.

Sir,  I do not quite understand the reason for this

objection.  There  may  be  occasions   when   taxi

drivers,  either owners or hirers, may wish  to  go

shopping on behalf of their wives or children. They

may  wish  to  bring their families to the  movies.

They may wish to park their taxis in some place  to

go  for  their meals or to attend to some  personal

affairs.   It   is,   therefore,   illogical    and

unreasonable  to  deny them parking  facilities  at

public  car  parks, not for free but on payment  of

the usual fees.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absurd for the taxi drivers to park their

taxis  at  the taxi-stands and then go  about  with

their  families in other taxis or buses  to  places

some  distance away from the taxi-stands. Moreover,

under  the  law,  taxi drivers are not  allowed  to

leave  their  taxis unattended in the  taxi-stands.

Sir, the matter of taxi-parking in public car parks

was,  in  fact, raised by the Member for  Sembawang

during  the  debate  on the Reorganisation  of  the

Motor  Transport Service in September.  1970.  With

your  permission, Sir, I would like to  quote  from

the  Hansard  what the Minister for  Communications

said.  This is found in Vol. 30, No. 5,  dated  2nd

September, 1970, col. 261:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Member for Sembawang has made the suggestion

that  taxis should be allowed to use car  parks.  I

see no reason why they should not be allowed if the

taxi  drivers pay for it. Of course, a taxi  driver

cannot just go to a public car park, parks his taxi



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



for  free, and goes for his meal. But if  he  parks

his taxi in the public car park and is prepared  to

pay  the regular 20 or 40 cents, I personally think

[Interruption}.  I will look into  this  matter.  I

cannot see the logic of it. It is a good suggestion

which  I  am prepared to follow up with  the  party

concerned. In this respect, of course, it  is  true

that  the  Car  Parks Division is  in  a  different

Ministry,  and  I  will  have  to  seek  their  co-operation to agree to this.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, I would like to find out

from  the  Minister what decision  has  since  been

taken on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, under the Motor Vehicles (Parking

Places) Rules, 1959, taxis are not allowed  to  use

the  hourly parking lots. However, this prohibition

has  been  relaxed  in certain circumstances  where

taxis  find  it necessary to park in a paid-parking

lot  for  reasons  other than for plying  for  hire

during  such  periods.  Some  of  the  reasons  are

letting down tourists in shopping areas and  having

to wait for them; and having official business with

Government  departments in localities  where  taxi-stands  are  not available. But when  the  rule  is

relaxed, the taxi driver takes advantage, and there

are  abuses as the Member should appreciate parking

attendants  have  been  instructed  to  use   their

discretion to ensure that taxi drivers do not abuse

this privilege of using the hourly parking lots  on

some pretext to ply their taxis for hire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid I was not following the Member

in  the  last few seconds of his speech.  Could  he

repeat his point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I just quoted from the

Hansard  in  which the Minister for  Communications

had  promised to look into this matter  during  the

debate that took place on the 2nd September,  1970.

The  Minister for Law and National Development just

now said that there are certain restrictions. But I

do  not  think  they are necessary. We  should,  in

fact, allow the taxi drivers to park their taxis at

public parking places without any restrictions.  No

taxi  driver  in his right senses would  waste  his

time in a public car park. He would rather keep his

taxi  going on the road and so get more  fares  for

the  time  which he would have lost in parking  his

taxi.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



What I want is to grant them absolute permission to

park  their  taxis  in the public  car  parks.  The

Minister  has said that some abuses have  resulted.

Can  the  Minister say what these  abuses  are  and

whether  these  cases  have been  reported  to  the

Superintendent of Car Parks?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, firstly, I am not responsible for

what  the Minister for Communications says in  this

House and whether or not he has followed up on  his

statement. I do not know. If the Member wishes,  he

can  ask him. But he is not in charge of car parks;

I am. And I do not agree with the Member that taxis

should  be  allowed  to park in public  car  parks.

There are parking places meant for taxis, and  they

can  use  them. There are parking places for  other

vehicles.  If you allow taxis to park and  ply  for

hire from public car parks, then you may find taxis

in  all  public  car parks, while their  own  taxi-stands  are  not used. I am afraid I  cannot  agree

with the Member on his suggestion to allow taxis to

park freely in public car parks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, the Minister has not

answered  the point whether abuses by taxi  drivers

have  been  reported to the Superintendent  of  Car

Parks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer is yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  give  my  views

regarding   car  parks.  Recently,  I  received   a

complaint from a friend of mine who said  that  one

night he went to the Airport to see his friend off.

He  was in a hurry and he parked his car in one  of

the parking lots. After he had seen his friend off,

he  returned  to  the parking  place  and  found  a

parking  attendant.  When  he  wanted  to  pay  the

parking  fee, he found out that he had  parked  his

car  in a prohibited lot. At the Airport, there are

three types of parking lots - hourly parking season

parking   and  reserved  parking  lots.   But   the

signboards for the three different kinds of parking

lots are all the same - blue background with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



white  lettering. If one does not pay attention  to

them,  one will make mistakes by parking in a wrong

place.  Under the circumstances, my friend  made  a

mistake.  So he apologised to the parking attendant

and  wanted  to pay for parking his car there.  But

the  attendant said that he could not  do  anything

because another parking attendant had already taken

down the number of my friend's car and asked him to

go  home and wait for the summons to come.  I  have

given this example not because I want to accuse the

parking  attendant for his attitude, but because  I

intend  to  request  the authorities  concerned  to

consider  using different and brighter colours  for

the  signboards for reserved and season parking  or

any  other type of parking in order not to  confuse

the   public.   In  fact,  the  parking   attendant

concerned was not wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another case which I myself experienced.

One afternoon, I parked my car in a parking lot  in

Niven   Road.  As  I  could  not  see  any  parking

attendant  around, I went off to attend to  my  own

business. After 20 minutes I returned to my car.  I

looked  around for a few minutes but  I  could  not

locate  the  attendant. I could not help  but  walk

back  along  the  parking lots  hoping  to  find  a

parking attendant. Finally, I saw one hiding behind

a  wooden  box on the five-foot way eating  kachang

puteh. Sir, in this instance, the parking attendant

should  be considered as being negligent  of  duty.

But  we  should  not  be too  particular  about  it

because she was the only attendant in charge of the

whole stretch of parking lots. If we want her to go

up  and  down  all the time attending  to  all  the

parking  lots, it would be too much  to  expect  of

her. I feel that it is also a matter of shortage of

staff  and the situation is the same as in some  of

the  other car parks. I would therefore request for

more   staff  to  be  employed  by  the  Car  Parks

Division.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, season and reserved parking lots

are   differentiated   by   the   installation   of

appropriate  signs,  word  markings  and   coloured

delineation lines



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



on  the  ground  in  the following  manner.  Season

parking places are indicated by the installation of

an adequate number of "Season Parking" signs, which

also  show  the  prescribed  monthly  charges.  The

season  parking lots are demarcated in white  lines

on   the   ground.  Reserved  parking  places   are

indicated by the installation of an adequate number

of  "Reserved Parking" signs. The reserved  parking

lots are demarcated in red with the word "Reserved"

marked  out  on the ground. The Car Parks  Division

carries out regular checks and maintenance  of  the

parking lots to ensure the legibility of the  signs

and  the  markings. Motorists should not have  much

difficulty  in differentiating between  season  and

reserved  parking lots. Of course,  some  motorists

are  in a hurry. But for those who are not, and are

in  doubt,  they  can  always consult  the  parking

attendants on duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need reply to the Member's

comments on his own particular experience with  one

car parking attendant.

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1107 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1517.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that car park attendants are

normally young men and women who are in their early

twenties. It would seem to me that a better  future

is in store for them if they are encouraged to take

up jobs in factories where opportunities for skill-upgrading  are available for them to improve  their

earning capacity and future prospects. On the other

hand,  there are retrenched employees who  are  too

old  to learn any new skill and are unable to  find

alternative   employment.  In  future   recruitment

exercises of car park attendants, I would  like  to

enquire    whether   the   Ministry   of   National

Development  will  consider  giving  preference  to

those retrenched employees who are willing to  work

as car park attendants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Car Parks Division employs

young people as parking attendants because the job,

though   routine  in  nature,  is  a   tiring   one

especially  on  a  hot day, and  requires  physical

fitness for better efficiency. A young person  with

the  necessary physical requirements  is  preferred

for the job, as he will be better able to withstand

the  heat and other outdoor working conditions. The

job  of  parking  attendant is not  intended  as  a

permanent career for youngsters but to provide them

with  temporary  employment and  useful  experience

before moving on to other fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of age and qualifications has been

taken  up  by  the Ministry of National Development

with  the  Ministry of Finance,  and  it  has  been

agreed to reduce the academic qualifications to the

Primary   School   Leaving   Examination,    though

preference  will  be given to candidates  who  have

passed  a  higher standard. We would  still  prefer

young  parking attendants for the job, and if those

who  are retrenched are young, which I doubt,  they

will be taken on as car park attendants.

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1108 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Yeow Chong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this vote is for the Director of Public

Works. Undoubtedly the Public Works Department  has

done a lot towards the construction of public roads

in  Singapore so that our road network is  expanded

and  convenient for traffic and they are safe also.

This  has  given a good impression to the tourists.

This  year  the vote for this department  is  $13.8

million.  This  is  a large sum  of  money.  It  is

because this Department will have to undertake more

projects. In view of this, we should scrutinise the

expenditure  of every item so that its  expenditure

will pay off. In this respect I would like to raise

two matters. I would like the Minister to look into

them and take measures to rectify the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) I found that there was duplication of work in

respect of certain projects, for instance, the  one

at  MacPherson  Road. Although  it  is  not  in  my

constituency,  I  have to travel  along  this  road

every  day, and so I see that work is being carried

out now. The road has been under excavation for two

years  continually. At a certain time I saw that  a

particular  project  was  nearing  completion,  but

after some time I noticed that certain workers came

to  dig into the road again. And still later,  they

were again levelled up. This has been going on many

a  time.  This duplication of work not only  causes

traffic  congestion  there but  also  brings  about

inconvenience  to members of the  public.  Also  it

constitutes a waste of public funds.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



The authorities concerned have told us that this is

due  to  the  lack  of liaison between  the  Public

Utilities Board, the Singapore Telephone Board, the

Public Works Department and others. As a result  of

all  this, a Co-ordinating Committee was set up  to

co-ordinate  the various departments  concerned  in

this  kind  of  work so as to avoid duplication  of

work.  But  it  seems  that  there  is  still  some

dislocation  in  these projects.  If  the  Minister

could  take  a look into this matter,  I  shall  be

grateful.  I  would like to ask  the  Minister  why

there  still  is this phenomenon of duplication  of

work, and hope that he will be able to answer that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) I would like the Minister to consider this.

Under the flyovers or overhead bridges, stores  and

shops  can be erected. We have built quite a number

of  flyovers and overhead bridges, for example,  in

Toa  Payoh  and other places, which are  all  major

projects.  These overhead bridges  have  a  lot  of

empty  space  underneath. We can make  use  of  the

space  by  putting up shops or stores and  also  to

beautify  them.  In this way we  will  be  able  to

provide more opportunities for our hawkers, at  the

same  time, and this is more important,  this  will

bring in more revenue for the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, Singapore is known to have

the  best motoring roads in this region. Our  roads

are  well-planned and built for heavy traffic;  our

highways and flyovers compare favourably with those

in  the  advanced countries. Our road engineers  in

the  Public  Works Department deserve every  praise

for  their good work. However, the patching  up  of

pot-holes  and  resurfacing of  some  roads,  after

repairs   to   underground   services,   are    not

satisfactorily  carried  out.  The   roads   remain

uneven. Moreover the sides surrounding the manholes

and  water-mains are often left unfilled for  days.

If  they are filled up later by manual labour, they

are  not evenly done. So when you motor along  such

roads,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



your  car  is  bound to be affected by  the  severe

bumps.  In  this  respect I  would  urge  our  road

engineers  to  make strict checks on either  P.W.D.

workers   or  contractors'  labourers  engaged   in

resurfacing of roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another aspect of our roads which I

would like to comment on. The smooth surface of our

road  curves  or  bends is a hazard to  fast-moving

vehicles,  especially on rainy days.  To  prove  my

point,  there  were two fatal accidents  some  time

ago.  One  involved  a bus and a  military  vehicle

which  skidded near the Anderson Bridge. Apparently

the  tyres of these fast-moving vehicles lost their

grip  on  the road surface. To prevent skidding  of

speeding  motor vehicles, may I, Sir, as a  layman,

suggest that all road bends or curves be laid  with

a   rough  surface  instead  of  the  usual  smooth

surface. I notice that this rough surface has  been

laid  on  a  short stretch of the road  curve  near

Anderson  Bridge. I hope the Minister will consider

my  proposal  to  have  all road  curves  or  bends

rendered  with  a  rough surface to  prevent  fast-moving cars from skidding.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, what the Member for Sembawang

complained  about was true some years ago.  He  has

been and is still complaining, and I think there is

cause for complaint even now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> They still complain now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Now - yes, but not as bad as before.

There was a time when roads were built, but dug  up

by  one  department  and then  filled  up.  In  the

following week, another department would  come  and

dig  it  up,  and it goes on throughout the  month.

This  was quite a common practice. But a few  years

ago we formed a Roads Co-ordination Committee, with

members  coming from the various departments  which

dig  up roads, like the Public Utilities Board, the

Water,   Gas   and  Electricity  departments,   the

Singapore  Telephone  Board and  the  Public  Works

Department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Committee meets from time to time and has laid

down certain rules -one to the effect that when  an

old  road is dug up and a new road built,  all  the

services  should  be  laid in before  the  road  is

finally  asphalted. Another rule is that  any  road

that  has  been  newly surfaced cannot  be  dug  up

unless there is an emergency, like a leaking  water

or  gas  pipe, or a broken electricity  cable.  Co-ordination  has worked out better now in  practice,

but  is not as smooth as I would like it to be,  or

as the Member for Sembawang would like it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for stalls near overhead bridges, they will be

allowed  under certain conditions: (1) if there  is

enough  open space; (2) if the stalls do not  cause

hazards  to pedestrians, motorists, and other  road

users;  (3) they do not in any way damage or  dirty

the overhead bridge, and provided the food sold  by

the  stalls,  if  they  are  food  stalls,  is  not

contaminated by dust and exhaust fumes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has also complained

about defective reinstatement of trenches. This  is

due  to  the fact that someone digs up a  road  and

does not do much about filling it up and putting it

back  into  its original condition. But the  Member

will  be  pleased to know that a unit was  recently

set  up  by the P.W.D. Roads Branch, headed  by  an

engineer    to   co-ordinate   the   opening    and

reinstatement of trenches and roads.  The  duty  of

the   unit   will   be   to  ensure   that   trench

reinstatement   is  effected  by  the   departments

concerned,  or  the service departments,  to  their

required standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Member for Mountbatten, the P.W.D, has

been concerned about the condition of road surfaces

at  certain corners and bends, especially when  the

roads  are  wet. The Branch has been  experimenting

with some measure of success with a special kind of

asphalt pre-mix, which has a more endurable wearing

quality and a better resistance to skid. This  type

of pre-mix has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



laid in a number of road corners, roundabouts,  and

bends and its use will be progressively extended as

suggested by the Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1108 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take this opportunity to congratulate

the  Trees  and Parks Unit for the great energy  it

has    put,   and   generally   put   happily   and

successfully,  into making Singapore  a  green  and

pleasant place. Every encouragement should be given

to  the programme to' make Singapore cool and shady

and  a  city  characterised by a bland, garden  and

park  atmosphere.  But a few  points  of  restraint

should  also be observed. For example, where  trees

may  have to be planted on the sides of roads, care

should  be  taken  to see that  pavements  are  not

unnecessarily  ripped off and the trees  become  an

impediment to pedestrians. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it  is

possible,  especially in our  suburban  areas,  but

including  those  even in town, that  people  might

like  to  go  for  a walk in the evening  or  early

morning. However, walking becomes hazardous if  one

has to constantly step down from the pavement on to

the  road  because  of trees blocking  the  way  of

pedestrians.  Another hazard, Sir, is the  planting

of  trees at junctions, or at certain locations  by

the  roadside  which block the view of'  motorists,

thereby  increasing the danger of  road  accidents.

Having  said that, Sir, I must revert once more  to

my  note of general congratulation to the Trees and

Parks Unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to put forward a few points here. Last

of  a  shrub  and foliage planting campaign.  Could

this  year's  tree  planting campaign  be  properly

directed  in line with the meaning and  purpose  of

the campaign? More fruit trees should be planted so

that  our birds will not migrate. Some of the trees

planted  in the past have grown to such  an  extent

that  it  is evident these trees are poorly pruned.

Some  of  these  trees have drooping branches  that

brush  against  the top of certain  vehicles  going

along  the road and pose a danger to the people  in

the  vehicles. For example, the trees along Dunearn

Road block the lights from lamp-posts completely so

much  so  that  the roads are not properly  lit  at

night.  This  can  cause  accidents  especially  at

night.  It is time these trees were properly pruned

or the lamp-posts sited elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the

criticisms and suggestions of the two Members. They

can  barely be considered criticisms - planting  of

trees  on  side-walks or footpaths and at junctions

which block the view of motorists, and the drooping

branches of trees which block street lights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, directives have been given to this

effect,  taking  into account the suggestions  that

have  just  been  made. As for tree  planting  day,

Members  will  be interested to know that  in  last

year's tree planting day on the 17th of November, a

total  of 30,077 plants were planted, out of  which

7,061  were  roadside  trees,  1,339  fruit  trees,

14,330 shrubs, and 7,347 creepers or climbers. From

the  statistics, it is clear that quite a few trees

were   planted.   In  this  year's  tree   planting

campaign,  which will again be held  on  the  first

Sunday  of  November, about 15,000 trees and  3,000

fruit trees will be made available for planting  in

the various constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson will be interested to know

that the Trees and Parks Unit has four gangs of  38

men to carry out pruning of trees, transplanting of

trees and felling of dangerous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



trees. If he knows of any tree causing obstruction,

he can easily inform them and they will do the job.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may  I  just add a minor suggestion  here?  I

notice  that  quite a few of the  trees  have  shed

their  leaves. Could the Trees and Parks  Unit  not

choose  the  trees  more carefully  so  that  fewer

leaves  are  dropped and the job  of  sweeping  the

roads  made  easier? This is a  very  minor  point.

However,  I join in the general congratulations  to

the Unit. The job has been done very well indeed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the suggestion has already been

looked into. But certain trees shed their leaves at

certain times, and some trees shed more leaves than

others.  Instructions have been given not to  plant

certain trees, especially the Wattle tree which not

only  sheds  leaves  but drops quite  a  few  brown

seeds,  which litter the road. But as we plant  and

plant,  we  will  learn  and  try  to  better   our

performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Building Surveyor, now known as the

Assistant  Director (Building Control), very  often

refuses   to   grant  permission   to   prospective

residents or offices to renovate their buildings by

quoting  one  law or the other. I have raised  this

matter in my previous amendment. But this time I am

talking  about the land. Since these buildings  are

occupied by the residents, who are likely  to  stay

there  for some time, therefore, there seems to  be

little logic in refusing to grant them permission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



to   carry  out  renovations.  Sometimes  a  little

relaxation  of  the law will serve  a  more  useful

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the certificate of fitness for housing

estates  or  multi-storey buildings constructed  by

private  developers, should be issued  as  soon  as

possible.  The  reason is that when  complaints  of

damage  to  drains and other housing amenities  are

brought to the attention of the P.W.D., they  would

reply that since the certificate of fitness has not

been  granted, nothing could be done. This  is  the

case  with my estate. I would like to know why  the

Windsor  Park Estate in Thomson Road has  not  been

issued  with  the certificate of fitness,  although

the houses were built 12 years ago. Will the proper

authority  look into this matter and see  that  the

certificate of fitness for the department concerned

is  issued to residents of the Windsor Park  Estate

as early as possible?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When private developers put up houses or erect

multi-storey  structures, they often choke  up  the

drains  around  the  building sites.  These  choked

drains become ideal mosquito breeding grounds.  Can

the  P.W.D, undertake  to repair  the  drains  and

charge the developers for the cost of repairs?



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, in Windsor Park Estate there is a

drain  which was damaged sometime ago. A  complaint

was lodged with the P.W.D. The reply given was that

the  estate  was  not built by the Government  and,

therefore, the P.W.D, could not repair it.  I  took

this  matter  up  myself. The drain  is  behind  my

neighbour's  house  as  well  as  my   house.   The

situation  is  very bad, and there  are  a  lot  of

mosquitoes breeding there. So I wrote a  letter  to

the Ministry of Health and they have referred it to

the  P.W.D.  `However, the P.W.D, said it  was  not

their responsibility, and that we should go to  the

Singapore    Government   Officers'   `Co-operative

Housing  Society. I wrote a letter to the  Society,

but no action has been taken. The situation remains

the same.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Regulation 34 of the

Local Government (Building) Regulations, 1966, says

that before a certificate of fitness for occupation

of  a building is issued, the architect responsible

will   have  to  certify  that  he  has  personally

supervised the erection of the building and that it

has been built in accordance with existing building

standards   and  requirements.  In  addition,   the

architect must also submit the necessary clearances

from  the  appropriate authorities, such as  Roads,

Sewage, Health and the Fire Brigade. Delay  in  the

issue  of certificate of fitness is usually due  to

non-compliance with the requirements in one way  or

another.  It is the responsibility of the developer

concerned  to maintain the roads and drains,  etc.,

until  such  time  as they are taken  over  by  the

P.W.D.   The   P.W.D, will  not  take   over   the

maintenance  of roads in an estate  which  has  not

been properly developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Windsor Park - I believe the

Member  for Anson is a resident there - a temporary

occupation  licence was issued in 1961,  more  than

ten  years ago, following completion being reported

by  the  architect. At the same time, the architect

was  requested  to submit amendment plans  for  the

additions,  or  alterations and extensions  to  the

various  buildings in the estate.  These  amendment

plans   were  subsequently  approved,  but  despite

several  reminders the architect  has  so  far  not

submitted  his  letter  of  supervision   and   the

necessary    clearances   from   the    appropriate

authorities; hence the delay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will be interested to know that the

new Building Control Division, which was set up  on

1st February, 1972, is at present making a thorough

study  of  all outstanding cases where certificates

of  fitness  have  not been issued  and  will  take

follow-up action. I hope they will take some follow-up action in respect of Windsor Park.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

Development whether he is aware that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



the  Building  Survey Department  has  no  suitable

equipment  for the demolition of illegal structures

made of steel. Sir, I have received complaints from

the  residents of Lorong Melayu in my  constituency

that a factory had been illegally constructed. This

factory  was  erected  in a residential  area.  The

atmosphere  there  is now polluted  by  dust  as  a

result of the work carried on in this factory.  The

reply   I   received  from  the   Building   Survey

Department  was that the structure of the  building

is  made of iron, and that the Department, however,

has  no equipment to demolish it. Demolition  work,

therefore,  cannot  be carried out.  On  the  other

hand,  if  houses  are owned  by  poor  people,  of

course, they are made of planks and they would  not

be   spared  from  demolition.  This  factory   was

constructed by rich people and the material used is

made   of  iron.  Therefore,  it  is  spared   from

demolition. The building is still standing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think it is

a question of a building constructed by rich people

or  a question of a building made of iron. However,

if  what  the  Member alleges is  true,  then  that

factory should be demolished. All I can say at this

stage is that I will look into this matter to  find

out   why   this  unauthorised  factory  is   still

standing,  irrespective of  what  it  is  made  of.

Whether it is made of iron is immaterial. And if he

wishes  to  take it up further by way  of  an  Oral

Question  I  would probably be able to provide  him

with a better answer.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Planning Department approves a

certain plan for development, a development  charge

is  levied.  Sometimes, however, a plan is  revoked

and  money refunded. Why does it collect the  money

in  the  first place if the plan would  be  revoked

later?  It  is a waste of time if a plan  is  later

revoked and the money refunded. Why is the Planning

Department so fickle-minded about approving a plan?

If the Planning Department wishes to reject a plan,

it  can  give 101 reasons for rejecting it. On  the

other  hand, if it wishes to approve a plan it  can

give  101  reasons for approving it. If a developer

asks  for  a  development plan to be approved,  the

Planning Department will ask for the plan and  say,

"All  right, I want to see your proprietor."  I  do

not know why this is done. Anyway, there will be  a

delay  in  approving the plan. Surely something  is

wrong  with  the Planning Department.  I  hope  the

Minister  will reorganise the Planning  Department,

otherwise  there  will  be  more  complications  in

future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there seems to be

some  confusion  in this matter. The  Planning  Act

does  not  provide for the refund of a  development

charge  even if the approved development plan,  for

which   a   charge  was  levied,  is   subsequently

cancelled.  There  is no record that  the  Planning

Department has refunded development charges in  the

manner  cited  by  the Member for  Anson.  However,

refunds  are  made  by the Planning  Department  in

respect  of development charge deposits payable  by

applicants  at  the  time of application.  This  is

provided   for   under  the  Planning  (Development

Charge)  Rules, 1965. Such refunds  are  only  made

when  the  planning permission applied for  is  not

granted or if the application is withdrawn before a

decision  is  made  on  the  application.   Perhaps

therein lies the explanation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Botanic Gardens has established its name both

in   the  international  botanic  circles  for  its

variety  of plants and among the tourists  for  its

serene  and beautiful atmosphere. Since the Botanic

Gardens  is  a leading tourist attraction,  can  it

sell  plants and orchids to the tourists? I am sure

they  would  like  to  buy  some  orchid  cuttings.

Unfortunately,  the Plant Sales Section  is  in  an

obscure  corner of the Botanic Gardens,  where  the

tourists are unlikely to notice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may just say

this:  most  of the criticisms against my  Ministry

appear  to  be  about  someone  who  works  in   my

Ministry.  The  sale of plants and orchids  by  the

Botanic  Gardens is now centralised  at  the  Plant

Sales  Centre along the Floral Mile, Dunearn  Road,

so  that  a  better service may be rendered  and  a

wider  choice  of plants may be made  available  to

local  customers  and  tourists.  The  Plant  Sales

Section  of the Botanic Gardens was transferred  to

the  Centre recently to release land at the Botanic

Gardens for the development of other amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From past records, it appears that very few

tourists  wish  to  buy plants, including  orchids,

because apart from the difficulty of carrying them,

most  foreign  countries  have  very  strict  plant

importation  rules,  which  make  it  difficult  to

introduce  plants  from other  countries.  I  think

therein  lies  the  explanation  for  tourists  not

buying plants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why does the Ministry of Health recruit

student nurses and assistant nurses and put them on

different salary scales when they all have the same

qualifications?   There  is  great  dissatisfaction

among  the assistant nurses because, although  they

possess  the  same qualifications  as  the  student

nurses they have very little prospects of promotion

apart from the fact that they do not draw the  same

pay as the student nurses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another complaint. Some of the

matrons  in  the  hospitals  seem  to  be  a   very

unsympathetic "breed" of people. Not only  do  they

bully  their  junior staff but they  also  show  an

indifferent   attitude  towards   them.   This   is

especially true as far as the granting of leave  is

concerned.   Perhaps  I  can  quote  a   particular

instance.  The  father of one of the nurses  passed

away. Yet, the matron was so unsympathetic that she

refused  to grant the nurse a short leave in  order

to recover from the shock of her father's death. In

the end, however, the nurse was granted leave by  a

sympathetic ward doctor. He had to intervene in the

case  because of the unfortunate condition  of  the

nurse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses working on night shifts have to work for

seven consecutive days, and each shift is a 10-hour

duty. I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



this  is  too strenuous for them. I wonder  whether

shorter  working hours can be introduced for  night

duty in the hospitals.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What form of co-ordination exists between the

school health doctors and the hospital authorities?

Quite  often,  children recommended by  the  school

doctors for further treatment in the hospitals  are

subjected to great difficulties and humiliation  by

the  doctors in the hospitals. In a few cases  only

was  there  any  understanding between  the  school

doctors and the doctors in the hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the sole purpose of a post-mortem?

It seems that "tough" doctors, responsible for post-mortem,  harass the relatives of the deceased  into

giving  them permission to perform the post-mortem,

failing  which  they  even  threaten  the  grieving

relatives with delaying the release of the body for

burial.  I  wish to quote the example of a  patient

who  was in hospital for more than a week and  died

there.  The  doctors could not find  the  cause  of

death  or  the disease he was suffering  from,  and

they  insisted  on a post-mortem. The  officers  in

charge  of  the mortuary deliberately  delayed  the

release  of the body. Surely after the patient  had

been  in hospital for more than a week, the doctors

should  have diagnosed the cause of illness,  which

would  then not cause further inconvenience to  the

bereaved relatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to know how long does it take

for  the authorities to collect a dead body if  the

person  dies  either on the road or on a  five-foot

way?  There  are times when bodies have  been  left

lying  by the side of the road for as long  as  six

hours.  They  were nothing better than dogs  having

been  knocked  down  by some vehicles.  Early  this

month  at a place just off the Woodlands Checkpoint

a man died of natural causes. The body was left for

exhibition  for more than six hours.  Surely  in  a

progressive-minded State like Singapore,  even  the

dead should be given a certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



amount  of respect and should not be left lying  by

the  side  of  the road to rot. If  this  situation

worsens,  the mortuary authorities might have  only

the bones to collect by the time they get moving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to mention the case of an

old lady, who is a resident in one of the Homes for

the Aged, who fell sick and was sent to the Thomson

Road General Hospital. She was warded for a day and

discharged although her condition had not improved.

I  contacted  the  Medical  Superintendent  of  the

Hospital  and  asked  him  to  retain  her  in  the

hospital.  He  replied that she was all  right  and

furthermore  there  was no  bed  available  in  the

hospital. Later I contacted the Director of  Health

of  the  Emergency  Unit  of  Outram  Road  General

Hospital,  and although I offered to  pay  for  her

ward  charges, he refused to ward the old lady  and

asked  me  to  refer  to the Thomson  Road  General

Hospital. Subsequently, she was taken to the Outram

Road  General Hospital personally by her  daughter,

and   she   was  immediately  admitted   with   the

assistance  of a Sister. I have got  to  thank  the

Sister  for helping her. Now I am told the  patient

has  been  discharged from the  ward.  She  is  not

completely cured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that patients in first- class and

second-class  wards are allowed to stay  longer  in

the  hospitals, and be put under their  care.  This

poor unfortunate old lady has been discharged,  and

now she is not well again. Why is she not given the

same treatment although her daughter had agreed  to

pay the ward charges? From this experience, I think

that  some of the doctors take a couldn't-care-less

attitude towards M.P.s. Is this the kind of service

that Government servants can offer?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to inform the House that

doctors  in  the  hospitals do not have  sufficient

instruments. For example, when a person wants to go

for  a full X-ray, he has to line up. Otherwise  he

has to go to a private doctor to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



X-rayed. There are so many instruments that doctors

require but are not available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister should look into these matters and

make the necessary arrangements to provide a better

medical service for the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Member for Anson has  enumerated

about  10 queries. I shall answer them one by  one.

The  first  query  is about Assistant  Nurses.  The

question  is:  why  should we continue  to  recruit

Assistant  Nurses?  The answer  is  that  Assistant

Nurses  are of a grade different to that of Trained

Nurses because they do different types of jobs, the

difference  being  that the Assistant  Nurses  have

lesser  responsibilities and they  work  under  the

supervision  of  the  Trained Nurses.  The  Trained

Nurses  are not required to work under supervision.

The  point  raised  by  the  Member  is:  why  have

Assistant  Nurses  been  recruited  with  the  same

qualifications  as Trained Nurses?  The  reason  is

that  although  an Assistant Nurse is  required  to

have   a  minimum  education  at  Form  III  level,

preference  is  given  to  those  with   a   higher

qualification. Trained Nurses, however,  must  pass

the  School Certificate. What happened was that  in

1967  in  a  recruitment for Assistant Nurses,  the

number   of   applicants  with  School  Certificate

qualifications  exceeded the  number  of  vacancies

available. As a result most of the Assistant Nurses

recruited  were holders of the School  Certificate,

and  this  has continued since 1967.  But  we  have

found  that  because  these  Assistant  Nurses  are

School Certificate holders there have been a  large

number  of drop-outs. It is because of their better

qualifications, they have taken up  jobs  elsewhere

which  offer better opportunities. As a  result  of

this, the Ministry of Health has recommended to the

Public  Service Commission that the recruitment  of

Pupil  Nurses should now be confined to  non-School

Certificate holders. I hope that will suffice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question that has been raised is: why

are Matrons not sympathetic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



people? It is important to bear  in  mind

that  one cannot tar all Matrons just because of  a

particular case; I think it is unfair. With  regard

to  this  particular case of a nurse  who  was  not

given  sympathetic consideration when  she  applied

for  leave, I must say this is the first time  that

such a case has come to my attention. If the Member

for  Anson  had  only been more  conscientious  and

brought this matter to my attention, it would  have

been  thoroughly  investigated  and  any  injustice

would have been put right. The point is that it  is

very easy to make these allegations. We should have

the specific facts of the complaint and there might

well be a very good explanation to it. So I do  not

think it is fair to jump to conclusions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is: why are nurses put on night

shifts seven nights at one stretch? This matter  is

debatable.  There have been instances, particularly

in the United Kingdom and other European countries,

where  nurses  prefer a continuous seven-day  night

shift.  Of  course, there are others  who  disagree

with  this. But this has been the practice for many

years  without  any complaints. Now  there  is  one

school  of  thought  which says that  a  continuous

night   shift   causes  hardship  and   is   rather

strenuous.  The  Ministry  has  looked  into   this

matter, and as a result we are proposing a new type

of  night duty roster, i.e, the nurses will perform

night  duty for three consecutive nights  and  then

get  a  break. May I say that this is still  in  an

experimental   stage   and,   if   it   is    found

satisfactory, we might make this a general rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point concerns school health doctors

and  their co-ordination with the hospitals. May  I

say to the Member for Anson that there is close co-ordination between the two services. I do not  know

why he has brought up this complaint about lack  of

co-ordination. This again is the first complaint of

its  kind that I have heard. Of course, there might

be cases where there could he some misunderstanding

between the two services. But I can assure him that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



there  is  close  co-ordination.  If  he  has   any

particular  complaint, he should  not  hesitate  to

bring it to my attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also raised a question on

post-mortem.  May  I  tell him  that  it  is  quite

essential  for the advancement of medical knowledge

that there should be post-mortem, because diagnosis

is  not  always a certainty and knowledge is gained

through  post-mortem. However, let me say  that  no

one  can  be  forced to consent  to  a  post-mortem

against his wishes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that the Member for Anson raised

is   about  the  collection  of  dead  bodies  from

roadsides and other public places. May I  tell  him

that  the  responsibility for  the  collection  and

transport  of a dead body from a road  accident  is

generally  undertaken by the Fire Brigade ambulance

or  the  Police  and  not the  ambulance  from  the

hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the case of the old lady, here again

this is the first time I hear of this case. If only

the Member has written to me on this, of course, it

would have been looked into. May I point out that a

single  case cannot possibly mean that the  doctors

or  the  medical superintendents are unsympathetic.

The  point is that we must have specific  facts  so

that  an  investigation can be undertaken  and  the

matter put right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained about insufficiency of

instruments in the general hospitals. As far as our

officers  are  concerned - and  they  are  handling

equipment  everyday - the instruments and equipment

used  are considered adequate for day-to-day needs.

The  point  I  can admit here is that some  of  our

equipment is quite old, and that is the reason  why

we  have requested the Ministry of Finance  to  up-date all the equipment.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This request for finance has been approved, and

the  amount  of over $l� million has been  provided

for the up-dating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



and replacement of existing equipment,  over

and  above that provided in the Ordinary Estimates.

So the Member for Anson will in the future see that

more up to-date equipment are in use in hospitals.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister for Health

asked  me  to put up a separate complaint for  each

case. There is no doubt that if I were to put up  a

separate case for complaint, I will only receive  a

reply  saying it is "regretted", "denied",  "to  be

considered",  or  "next  time  it  will   be   very

carefully considered". Therefore, I do not want  to

bring  these cases to the Ministry but to bring  it

up  to  the House. But I am sure the Minister  will

look  into  these  matters  properly  and  will  do

something  about them. I, therefore, beg  leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $16,412,890 for Head 1201 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1202 -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1202 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1031.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, patients in third class wards are sometimes

accommodated in the passage ways in the Outram Road

General Hospital. Why is this so? I also understand

that  the  food  supplied to the  patients  is  not

proper,  and the plates and cups appear to be  very

unhygienic. Can this matter be looked into?  May  I

suggest  that  more first class, second  class  and

third  class wards should be created as the  demand

for  beds  is greater than the supply available  in

these wards?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays medical authorities are aware of the

latest  medical  treatment  of  children.  In   the

advanced  countries of Europe and America,  parents

are  allowed  to  stay with their children  in  the

children's  ward so as to facilitate the  treatment

of the children. It has been found that in this way

children recover faster. Further, parents are able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



to relieve the doctors and nurses of their tiresome

chores.  It is time the Ministry of Health  allowed

parents  or close relatives to stay close to  their

children, thereby reducing the length of  stay  for

the  children  in  hospitals. In  this  respect,  I

suggest  that  a  common rest room for  parents  or

close relatives be set up so that they can be  near

their children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, let me first take the

point about beds being put in the verandah on the C-class ward. The answer is quite simple. If we  find

that  there  are no beds available but the  patient

must be admitted, of course, we have to put him  on

the  verandah.  It is because of  the  shortage  of

beds.  However, as a result of the taking  over  of

the  Alexandra  Hospital, this  situation  has  not

occurred so often.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about the plates in the C-class ward. There is an allegation that some of the

plates  are  broken. May I say that the plates  for

the C-class patients are not made of porcelain.  In

fact,  they are steel plates. So it is not possible

for them to break.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another matter raised by the Member concerns

the  treatment of children. I agree with the Member

for Anson that it is best you allow the parents  to

come  along  to  stay with their  children  in  the

hospitals.  In  this way they can also  look  after

their  children, and the children will not  have  a

traumatic experience of being taken away from their

parents.  As far as it is feasible, this  has  been

the  practice. In fact, this has been done  in  the

Mistri  Wing  of the Outram Road General  Hospital.

But  because of physical impossibility that has not

been  the general practice. First of all,  we  have

not  got a sleeping room for parents in the  Mistri

Wing  of  Outram Road General Hospital. Of  course,

there  are no facilities for them to sleep in,  but

there is a common room there which can be used  for

this  purpose.  But  now that  we  have  plans  for

rebuilding the hospital, this matter will certainly

be  taken  into  account. As far as  the  Alexandra

Hospital is concerned, the children's ward has such

facilities. The parents can also stay in.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



In  fact,  we do allow parents in certain cases  to

remain with the children in the various wards.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the

explanation  of  the  Minister,  I  beg  leave   to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1202 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1321.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking at Kandang Kerbau Hospital from

outside,  you will see that it is neat  and  clean;

but  it is not so inside. The third class ward  has

swing  doors  which  are  either  badly  dented  or

damaged. Yet nothing has been done about it.  These

doors have panels made of metal, but they are  torn

and  become a source of danger to the patients, the

nurses and the amahs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out to the Minister

the  discrimination  that  exists  in  the  Kandang

Kerbau  Hospital. The third class patients are  not

served with proper food. What is worse is that  the

nurses  and amahs treat the patients very badly.  I

always   support  the  Government   servants,   but

wherever possible I would ask the Minister to  take

action. Quite often the nurses and amahs make  rude

remarks  about certain patients in front  of  other

patients. What is worse is that they shout  at  the

patients if the patients are unfortunate enough  to

require  any  assistance. Such practice  should  be

stopped  immediately.  The  nurses  and  amahs  are

Government  servants.  As  such  they   should   be

familiar  with  Government  regulations.  There  is

absolutely no excuse for these Government  servants

to  behave  like demi-gods. I know  the  amahs  and

nurses   in  the  hospital  are  very  hardworking.

However,  they  must carry out their duty  properly

and not be rude to the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I first take the

allegation  that  there has been discrimination  by

nurses  and  amahs  against  C-class  patients   in

Kandang Kerbau Hospital? I say again that it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



rather  unfair  on the part of the Member  to  make

such a general allegation. There may have been such

cases, but I have always stated that Members of the

House or even members of the public can bring  them

up  to  me. The point is that I think it is  rather

unfair to make a general allegation and thereby tar

the good name of the amahs and nurses in particular

hospitals.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Not all of them!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The point is that general

allegations   are  not  helpful   at   all   unless

specifically  spelt out so that investigations  can

be  made.  There  is always a black  sheep  in  any

flock.  As I have always stated, it is our duty  to

see  who is the black sheep and appropriate  action

will  be taken. I think it is rather unfair to just

tar  the  others  because of the misdeeds  of  one.

Besides,  the Ministry of Health makes it  a  point

that  all nurses, doctors and amahs have name  tags

on  them. So it is not an impersonal service; it is

a  personal service. You can personalise those  who

have done good and those who have been at fault.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about metal doors. I do not

know  why  the Member for Anson should bring  up  a

tiny  point like this in this Chamber when he could

easily  have put it in to my Ministry,  and  I  can

assure him that it will be attended to.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I quite agree with the

Minister's  explanation that not every one  of  the

amahs  or nurses is rude to the people. I  am  just

bringing  this  matter to the Minister's  attention

with the hope that he will take action on it. I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $60,350,910 for Head 1202 ordered to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1203 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I merely wish to ask the Minister for Health to

what  extent  do  these  Inspectors  of  Factories,

Industrial  Health Unit, who are under  the  Senior

Health  Officer, have duties and functions  similar

to  or different from those Inspectors of Factories

in  the  Factory  Inspectorate of the  Ministry  of

Labour,  under Head 0601 subhead 1104. Furthermore,

in  what  way is liaison and co-ordination achieved

between the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry  of

Health  in  this  important  sector  of  industrial

health?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> As far as the first question

is concerned, the post of Inspector of Factories in

the  Industrial  Health Unit  is  actually  for  an

officer   correctly  designated  as  an  Industrial

Hygienist. Industrial hygiene is concerned with the

measurement, assessment and control of the  working

environment relating to factors that could lead  to

industrial   disease   and   illnesses.   In    the

establishment there is no such title as "Industrial

Hygienist",  and  so  the closest  nomenclature  is

"Inspector  of Factories", which has been  used  as

the  basic qualification. The salary scale  for  an

Industrial Hygienist and an Inspector of  Factories

is the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Inspectors of Factories in the

Factory  Inspectorate  are concerned  largely  with

industrial  accidents and safety measures  and  not

with  industrial diseases. Their responsibility  is

to see that safety requirements relating to factory

machinery  and  conditions in the factory  premises

are observed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to liaison between the Industrial

Health  Unit of the Health Ministry and the Factory

Inspectorate of the Labour Ministry, the answer  is

quite  simple. The Industrial Health Unit has  been

administratively shifted to the Labour Ministry and

are operating under the Labour Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is the Public Cleansing Department supplying

enough  bins at the collection centres? Very often,

because  of  insufficient bins at these  collection

points,  rubbish spills over to the  road,  thereby

producing   not  only  a  strong   odour   in   the

neighbourhood,   but   also   providing   excellent

breeding   grounds   for   rats,   mosquitoes   and

cockroaches. Surely by providing a few more bins at

these centres we are not going to tax the commoners

more.  The  Public Health Department officials  can

surely  take  a little more action in this  regard.

The  "Keep Singapore Clean and Green" campaign will

become pointless if one of our Ministries becomes a

specialist in breeding rats!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say

that  the  Ministry of Health does not breed  rats!

But  if we do breed them, they are white mice  used

for  experiments. Regarding the other  point  about

insufficiency of bins at the bin centres, as far as

we are concerned there are sufficient bins at these

centres.  The problem is that at peak periods  like

the  Chinese  New Year, or just before the  season,

everybody  does spring cleaning, and  they  discard

just about every old stuff so that they can buy new

items, like furniture and so on. That is the reason

why  rubbish  during those periods  has  piled  up.

These    are   periodic   instances   of    rubbish

accumulating in excess of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



normal  volume  because of certain  habits  of  our

people.  So  if the Member for Anson  comes  across

rubbish  overflowing and spilling on to  the  road,

may I say that it can be just one of those seasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, of course, there may be cases where a

vehicle  has broken down and rubbish is not removed

for  that  day.  But in such cases  it  is  usually

removed  on  that evening or the next day.  So  the

problem  is  not the insufficient supply  of  bins,

because if that is so, then it is very easy for  us

to solve it by providing more bins.

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1203 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Alsagoff Estate, which includes Geylang

Serai, Kampong Ubi and Kampong Kembangan, is a low-lying area and often the drains get clogged and the

water stagnated, so that it does not flow. This may

be  the  result of the failure on the part  of  the

Public  Health Department officials  to  carry  out

their  duties  properly.  Sometimes  the  residents

themselves  clean the drains because  they  do  not

wish  to  see the dirty and smelly drains.  Workers

from  the Public Health Department do the cleansing

work  from time to time. But this is unsatisfactory

because the number of workers engaged in such  work

is insufficient and time is also limited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to suggest that more anti-malarial oil he

pumped into the stagnant water as it is one of  the

ways  to  reduce mosquito breeding in the  area.  I

believe   if  this  problem  is  looked  into   and

resolved,   mosquito  breeding  will   be   greatly

reduced, thus providing a better health environment

for the residents there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

perennial problem. It has been brought up again and

again since last year. The Member for Geylang Serai



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



has given us his version of the problem. But as far

as the Ministry of Health is concerned, we have our

own  version of the problem which I shall  explain.

This  problem has arisen fundamentally because  the

whole area is a low-lying area. The drainage of the

area consists of a vast network of earth drains and

the  gradient  is so slight that the water  becomes

sluggish  and,  in  many cases, stagnant.  In  some

places  the matter is aggravated because of silting

of  these  drains  when  it rains.  The  result  of

stagnant  water,  of course, is mosquito  breeding.

May  I  inform  the Member for Geylang  Serai  that

unfortunately some of the residents also contribute

to  the problem by throwing refuse into the drains.

There  are some civic-conscious residents who  help

to clean the drains, and at the same time there are

those  who  are not so civic-conscious. They  throw

rubbish into the drains and worsen the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that we can only solve this fundamental

problem by redeveloping the whole area, because  it

is  not  possible  to make water flow  upwards,  as

water  flows from a higher level to a lower  level.

If  the outlets are at a higher level than that  of

the drain, then you cannot solve the problem unless

you   raise  the  level  of  the  whole  area   and

reconstruct  the whole drainage system.  Meanwhile,

whatever can be done to alleviate the situation has

been  done.  The Ministry of Health and the  P.W.D.

are   responsible  for  the  maintenance  of  these

drains,  and  the following action has been  taken.

There  has  been regular oiling of the drains,  but

the  drawback is that if you oil it in the  morning

and  it  rains  in  the  afternoon,  the  oil  will

literally  go  down  the drain. Now,  the  relevant

department  has also been desilting the  drains  as

far  as  possible, and any overgrown weeds on  both

sides  of the drain are being cleared once  in  two

months.  If  the  Member for  Geylang  Serai  would

exhort  the residents in his area to be more civic-conscious and not to throw rubbish into the  drains

but  into  proper  dustbins,  then  of  course  the

situation will improve.

<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  if  what the Minister for Health has said  is

true, that is, there is no other alternative except

to  redevelop  the whole area, then I  believe  the

residents  will  welcome it. May I then  know  when

will  the development take place? However,  in  the

meantime, the Public Health Division must carry out

their     daily    work    conscientiously    until

redevelopment takes place. Sir, as far  as  I  know

the  Public Health Inspectors only check houses  to

see whether there is mosquito breeding, but neglect

places  like  drains  and vacant  land.  So  whilst

waiting  for  redevelopment  as  mentioned  by  the

Minister,  I  hope the Ministry can  discharge  its

duties  to  eradicate  mosquito  breeding  in   the

residential areas as well as in vacant places.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe I

have  already answered the questions raised by  the

Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan.  As  far  as   the

Ministry  of  Health is concerned,  in  conjunction

with  the P.W.D., they are doing whatever they  can

to  maintain  the  environment.  However,  we  must

realise  that this is a very difficult job  because

of  the  prevailing conditions there. We are oiling

the  place  regularly, but, as I have said,  if  it

rains  in the afternoon after it has been oiled  in

the  morning,  then it is oil down the  drain.  The

other  work  of  desilting  is  being  carried  out

regularly,  and  unless we get the co-operation  of

these  residents by refraining from throwing litter

into  the drains, then of course whatever has  been

done to alleviate the position will be to no avail.

Whatever  it is, action is being taken as  best  as

the circumstances permit.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, in view of

the  explanation by the Minister concerned,  I  beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1203 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1741.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Vector Control Unit check building

sites more often because these are the places  that

mosquitoes  often breed? Despite the  anti-mosquito

campaign,  we still have a lot of mosquitoes,  thus

giving  us  sleepless nights. It is high  time  the

Vector  Control Unit did something positive and  in

full  swing to get rid of the mosquito menace  once

for all!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the

Member   for   Anson  has  advocated  about   going

thoroughly into the matter of reducing the mosquito

menace  in  Singapore is being done  by  the  Anti-Mosquito Branch of the Ministry of Health. In fact,

for  the  last six months Public Health  Inspectors

have  been  visiting an average of over a  thousand

homes a week, and weekly statements of incidents of

mosquito breeding have been issued to the press  in

order  to  exhort  members of the  public  to  take

preventive  measures  within  their  own  premises.

Also,  we make mention in the weekly statements  of

the  number of notices and summonses issued against

householders who have not been civic enough to take

precautionary measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, may I inform the Member [or Anson that,

although  he  mentioned  the  mosquito  menace   in

general, it has been found that the major source of

breeding  is  within private premises  in  built-up

areas  such  as residential estates,  like  Windsor

Park.  Perhaps  this  will be of  interest  to  the

Member, who is also the President of the Residents'

Association  in Windsor Park. To take the  case  of

Windsor  Park,  there has been only  one  complaint

received  from a resident concerning mosquitoes  in

the area.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was in January 1972. A survey on the

incidence of mosquitoes was conducted, and it shows

that  with the exception of a septic tank, all  the

seven  breeding sites were within private premises.

Of course, the responsibility for the prevention of

mosquito  breeding  in septic tank  lies  with  the

Government. In this case it is the P.W.D., and  the

matter has been referred to the relevant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



department  for  action.  I  hope  the  Member   is

satisfied with my answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

referring  to  a  new  building  which   is   under

construction. There is water all over the  building

site. I am not referring to Windsor Park only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I

mentioned mosquito breeding in private premises,  I

meant  building  sites as well. The  prevention  of

mosquito  breeding at building  sites  is  not  the

responsibility  of  the  Government.  That  is  the

responsibility of the site contractor.  In  Windsor

Park,  as  a  result of the survey, an instance  of

mosquito  breeding was discovered at a construction

site.  The contractor was served with a notice  and

summoned accordingly.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I only wish to say that

I  have  not  been  talking about Windsor  Park  in

particular. However, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1203 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1831.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago the Minister for Health announced

that  all  hawkers  in the City  area  particularly

would  be centralised in a hawkers' centre.  Before

this  scheme is carried out, will the Minister  see

to  it that the empty pitches in the various hawker

centres are filled up?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

correct   the  Member  for  Anson.  I  have   never

announced  at  any time that all  hawkers  will  be

centralised.  Our announcement is that  it  is  the

policy  to resite all bona fide hawkers into clean,

hygienic  centres  which will be built  in  various

parts   of  the  city.  This  will  be  done  after

consultation  with  Members of  Parliament  of  the

various constituencies and members of the Citizens'

Consultative  Committees.  We  do   not   want   to

centralise   because   we   might   get   a    huge

concentration  of  hawkers in  the  City.  What  we

announced was the policy of resiting hawkers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also mentioned about vacant

pitches  in  hawker centres. May I say  that  these

vacant pitches are only meant for bona fide hawkers

who  were  registered  in the  1968-69  census.  Of

course, some of the bona tide hawkers who were left

out  in  the census can still be considered if  the

Member  of Parliament for that area would recommend

that  he is, in fact, a bona fide hawker. In  other

words, all these vacant pitches will be filled  up.

The  only point is that there is always a time  lag

between a vacancy arising and balloting.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

read  in today's newspaper about an article in  the

Readers'  column that the latrine  in  the  Geylang

market  is dirty. The writer has suggested  that  I

should   survey   this  market  and   take   action

accordingly. I wish to inform this House  that  the

Geylang   Serai  market  is  in  the  Kampong   Ubi

constituency.  It  is  not  in  the  Geylang  Serai

constituency. This has been so ever since the  1968

general elections. If I remember correctly,  before

the  Member for Kampong Ubi went to the Philippines

as  Singapore's  Ambassador he did suggest  to  the

Ministry  concerned that the Geylang  Serai  market

should have its name changed to Kampong Ubi market.

However,  the  matter  has  so  far  not  yet  been

resolved   by   the  authorities   concerned.   All

complaints  in  respect of this  market  have  been

directed to me because the market is known  as  the

Geylang Serai market. Will the Minister explain why

this matter has not been resolved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what is in a

name?  In  fact, although the market may  not  fall

within  Geylang Serai constituency, it is  situated

along Jalan Geylang Serai. The reason why the  name

has  not been changed to Kampong Ubi market is that

it involves the changing of the regulations. If you

change  the  name of the market, then you  have  to

change the regulations. This is provided for in the

regulations itself. We have considered this matter,

and have decided that there is no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



necessity to change the name. After all what is  in

a  name? Do we have to change the name of a  market

just   because   it  falls  within   a   particular

constituency?  This  market has  been  historically

known as Geylang Serai Market because it lies along

Jalan Geylang Serai.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  for  the  information of the Minister,  Jalan

Geylang   Serai   itself   is   in   Kampong    Ubi

constituency.  The  people have  suggested  to  the

Member  for Kampong Ubi that it would be better  if

the  name  is  changed to Kampong Ubi  market.  The

people  would  then  know that  the  market  is  in

Kampong Ubi constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan has said  proves  my

point.  Do  we  change the name of the constituency

from  Kampong  Ubi  to Geylang Serai  just  because

Jalan  Geylang Serai is in Kampong Ubi and  not  in

Geylang Serai? After all, what is in a name?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a factory in Jalan

Chekor which has been illegally constructed in  the

residential   area   of  Kampong   Kembangan.   Its

electricity supply comes from a generator and  this

causes enough nuisance to the children who wish  to

study  at  home. This factory also  uses  sand  and

paint  sprayers, which dirty the surroundings  with

sand and paint sprays, thus affecting the health of

the residents living there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to know what steps are being taken to

protect the residents prom diseases which might  be

caused by the dust, sand and paint.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,

may I say that I am sympathetic to the residents of

Kampong   Kembangan  who  have   to   suffer   this

inconvenience from the operations of  this  illegal

factory.  I  was here when the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan  said to my colleague, the  Minister  for

National  Development, that this  factory  was,  in

fact,  an  unauthorised  factory.  I  remember  the

Member said that this factory was made of steel and

it was very difficult to demolish it.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff:</b> That was a different

factory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It may be a different factory,

but  the circumstances are the same, in which case,

I  think  the fastest way to deal with this problem

is to have the factory demolished. This is a matter

for  the Building Control Division. As far  as  the

Ministry of Health is concerned, where there  is  a

complaint  of noise or dust nuisance, we  can  only

serve  a  nuisance notice, if it  is  not  complied

with,  action will he taken in court. If the Member

wants  rapid  action then, of  course,  it  is  the

Building  Control Division which  can  move  in  to

demolish  the  factory,  which  I  believe  is   an

unauthorised building.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  since this factory was illegally constructed,

I  believe the P.W.D, will take action to  demolish

it. But meanwhile what steps are being taken by the

Public  Health Division of the Ministry to  protect

the  residents  in  this area from  diseases  which

might be caused by dust?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as the

Ministry  of  Health is concerned, after  receiving

the complaint of noise caused by the generator,  we

have  advised  the factory operator to  resite  the

generator  to  another place. We have also  advised

the factory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



management to confine their operations to  daylight

hours,  and  not  to operate it during  the  night.

Court  action  has  also  been  taken  against  the

management for dumping refuse into the drain on two

occasions. But as I have said, we can only issue  a

nuisance notice if there is any nuisance.  In  this

particular case, when our inspectors went on  their

rounds  they  did  not find any  evidence  of  dust

nuisance and as a result, no, nuisance notice could

be  served. Of course, as I have said, the quickest

way to deal with this matter is to get a demolition

order to pull the factory down.
