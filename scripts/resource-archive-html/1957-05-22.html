<div align="center"><b>(Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Minister whether

he  will  make a statement on the results  of  his

recent  visit to Kuala Lumpur; and, in particular,

whether at that visit he made approaches with  the

view to the improvement of trade relations between

Singapore and the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, at a joint conference of  Ministers

held in Kuala Lumpur on 3rd May, 1957, a number of

subjects of mutual interest to Singapore  and  the

Federation   were  discussed.   The   effects   of

Federation duty on Singapore manufactures received

the   attention  of  this  joint  conference.  The

Federation Government has since presented  to  its

Legislative Council on Tuesday, 7th May,  a  White

Paper  on  its protective tariff policy. Singapore

made  representations to the effect that any  form

of  tariff protection might have adverse  economic

consequences  for both territories. The  need  for

close consultation between the two territories was

stressed  to  ensure that the  interests  of  both

territories would be consulted.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Chief

Minister  state  whether specific industries  were

discussed  and whether he could hold out  hope  of

employment in the soap industry?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, in view of the delicate

nature of the question, we have discussed this  in

the joint conference in Kuala Lumpur. We tried all

we   could   to  persuade  them  to   accept   our

representations,  but in the light  of  the  White

Paper which the Federation Government presented on

7th  May,  we were told that a committee would  be

formed  by  the  Federation  Government  to  which

further  representations could  be  made  by  this

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Chief

Minister state what further efforts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>



he  is making or proposes to make to improve trade

relations?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is a different question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND STEPS TO REDUCE IT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Labour and

Welfare  what  is  the estimated increase  in  the

number  of  unemployed persons in Singapore  since

April  1955,  and what steps are  being  taken  to

reduce unemployment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to

a similar question in this House in February 1956,

I  explained that accurate figures for the numbers

of   unemployed  persons  in  Singapore  are   not

available.  For  this reason I  cannot  state  the

number  of  unemployed persons in April  1955  any

more than I can state the increase or decrease  in

the  number since that date. As recently  as  last

January I informed this House that a study of  the

various   factors  which  affect   employment   in

Singapore did not suggest that there had been  any

appreciable  change in the unemployment  situation

during  the  year 1956. I believe that that  still

substantially   represents  the  position   today.

However,  I  must  inform the  House  that  recent

reports   do   seem  to  indicate  a  decline   in

employment  in  certain industries.  For  example,

there  has been a reduction of 10 per cent  to  15

per cent in the numbers of workmen employed in the

saw-milling   and   rubber   packing    factories.

Employment  in biscuit factories has  declined  by

about  25 per cent. These changes appear  to  have

been  due  to  Federation  of  Malaya  duties  and

smaller quantities of low-grade rubber imports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retrenchment of about 400 industrial workers

at the Naval Base has been well publicised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information collected during the Labour

Department's   census   of   manual   workers   in

employment  at the end of March has not  yet  been

fully  compiled,  so  that I am  unable  to  state

whether   there  have  been  increases  in   other

industries to compensate for the decrease  I  have

mentioned.  Members  will  appreciate  that  in  a

competitive  trading centre like Singapore,  there

are inevitable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>



ups and downs in particular industries. It may  be

that  when the census is complete, it will show  a

contraction  in  the employment of manual  workers

over  the last six months; but I am satisfied that

the net change will not give rise to undue alarm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment exchanges' records show counts of

persons actively seeking employment assistance  at

various times as follows:



<pre>

<div align="center">

April 1955 - 7,031.

April 1956 - 8,122.

April 1957 - 8,074.

</div>

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am bound to point out that the figure for March

1957  was 8,858. Last month there was a sharp fall

which will probably only be temporary, as a result

of recruitment for census duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, there has probably been an increase in

the  number  of  unemployed persons  in  Singapore

since  April  1955,  both as a  result  of  school

leavers coming on to the employment market  and  a

recent  fall  in  the  volume  of  employment.   I

estimate that the total is of the order of one per

cent of the total number of persons in employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's aim is to pursue a policy of

full employment. Public works are maintained at as

high   a   level  as  resources  of  the  building

construction  industry  allow.  These  works   not

merely  provide  temporary  employment  for  those

engaged  in  actual  construction,  but  permanent

employment for those who maintain and operate  the

schools, hospitals and public buildings which  are

erected.  Government  is  anxious  to  create  the

necessary   conditions   under   which    existing

industries will expand and new industries  can  be

attracted  to Singapore. The Industrial  Promotion

Board has been set up to assist in this process.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> With reference to the steps being taken

to  reduce  unemployment, will the Minister  state

whether those longest on the unemployment register

are  given  the  first chance to train  as  census

workers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am not able to reply to

this  question without notice. I did not know this

question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>



was  coming  up. As far as the census work is concerned,

it  is  left  to  the Registrar to take on  people  with

qualifications. According to the system we employ in the

Labour  Department, those longest on the list are always

given  the  first  choice, but  we  do  not  direct  any

prospective employer as to how he should choose.

<div align="center"><b>TEMPORARY CLERKS ON STRIKE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Disparity in treatment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Secretary-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whether the Government recognises the fundamental

right of a Trade Union to go on strike;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to state the reasons why action was taken against

those temporary clerks who went on strike;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to state the reasons for the disparity in the

treatment  of  temporary clerks, who  were  under

notice  of  termination of  service,  as  between

those  who went on strike and those who  did  not

go on strike.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to

(a) the answer is Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to (b), there was no official strike of

the temporary clerks. What happened was that on the 29th

of April two temporary clerks, whose services were to be

terminated along with others the following day, absented

themselves  without permission from  their  offices  and

picketed  the Government offices, Empress Place.  It  is

understood  that they were joined there  by  four  other

clerks all of whom had obtained leave of absence.  Their

action did not have the support of the only union  which

is  recognised as representing the clerical classes, and

they  did  this at a time when the union representatives

were   negotiating  for  an  extension  of  the  notices

terminating  their  service.  The  two  clerks  who  had

absented themselves did not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>



turn up at their office on the 30th. There was therefore

no question of extending their notices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to (c), Sir, as I have already stated,

there  was no official strike. To the extent that  those

who stayed away without leave did not have their notices

extended, there was disparity of treatment, but  I  have

already  indicated the reason for this  in  my  previous

answer.  Those who continued to serve up to the 30th  of

April  were allowed to stay on for another month pending

the result of the review of the case of temporary clerks

by the Public Service Commission. There was, however, no

difference in treatment in the matter of the  review  by

the   Public  Service  Commission.  Those  who  absented

themselves  were not excluded from the  review  and  the

Government  had  made it clear to the  union  and  in  a

public  statement that if, on review, any of  them  were

recommended for absorption, they would be reinstated  in

the service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Chief

Secretary  tell us what action was taken  against  those

four clerks who had permission to be absent?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to those

four clerks, as they had leave of absence, they returned

to their offices and no action was taken against them.

Government  will  reconsider the case of  the  dismissed

temporary  clerks along with those whose  services  have

been  extended for one month, after a review and  report

on  the  case of temporary clerks by the Public  Service

Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the up-to-date position

is  that the Public Service Commission has completed the

review  and  they see no reason to vary  their  original

decision.  This  means that those temporary  clerks  not

selected  will  not  be  absorbed permanently  into  the

General Clerical Service or the General



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>



Clerical  Assistant Service. The Government  has,

however,  found alternative employment in  junior

jobs  for a number of these temporary clerks  and

will  continue  in its efforts to  find  suitable

jobs  for  as many of the others as possible.  It

must,  however, be appreciated that  Government's

capacity to do this is of necessity very limited.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether   he  will  make  a  statement   on   the

recruitment  and  training of the  new  Singapore

Infantry  Battalion,  and  when  he  expects  the

Battalion to be fully operational.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the strength of

the  Singapore Infantry Battalion as at the  20th

of  May, 1957, was 237. Recruiting is temporarily

suspended  until  1st August  this  year  because

training  capacity is full and  there  are  still

nearly a thousand applicants who have passed  the

initial recruiting test and who have not yet been

called for medical and personnel selection tests.

The next squad will be attested in June from this

backlog of one thousand applicants and will leave

the  temporary  barracks at Ulu  Pandan  for  the

Malayan  Basic  Training Centre at  Nee  Soon  in

July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three officer cadets are in training at the

Federation  Military College and  two  more  have

recently  been  earmarked by the Selection  Board

for  training  at  the Officer  Cadet  School  at

Portsea in Australia. All these cadets are due to

be commissioned as Second Lieutenants towards the

end of 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four squads under training at the

Malayan Basic Training Centre, Nee Soon, and  all

are  doing well. The senior squad has begun range

training and its standard is promising. The first

squad  is due to pass out from the Malayan  Basic

Training Centre on the 6th of July. The next  two

squads are due to pass out together on 27th July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target date to complete recruit training for

the  Battalion is August 1958, and  it  is  hoped

that the Battalion will be fully operational,  by

which I take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>



it  to  mean "up to battalion strength and  fully

construction, finishings and fittings in our new schools

has been reduced to a minimum. A considerable saving was

made  last  year  by the adoption of  a  completely  new

design  of three-storeyed schools. Technical advice  has

also  been obtained from the Public Works Department  on

using  cheaper materials for school buildings,  such  as

timber,  but  saving on first costs would be  more  than

offset  by the cost of additional land, for construction

would  be  reduced  to  two-storeys,  and  increase   in

maintenance costs. The need for economy in  the  use  of

land   and   avoiding   increasing  annually   recurrent

maintenance  cost  must therefore outweigh  the  use  of

cheaper  materials. It is not proposed to build  schools

may  be in the mind of the Member for Tanglin. But

to  answer  this particular question briefly,  the

cause  of influenza is generally by a virus  known

as  Type  A  or Type B, it was originally  thought

that the cause of the present epidemic was by Type

A,  but  recent  indications  are  that  it  might

possibly  be  a  new virus previously  unknown  to

medical  science. The virus has been sent  to  the

United  States, the United Kingdom  and  Melbourne

for  identification and further study. The  origin

of the epidemic is unknown. It is most likely that

it   originated  in  Japan  where   it   prevailed

extensively,  generally in a  mild  form,  but  it

appears  to  have invaded Taiwan, the Philippines,

Hongkong  and  the  Federation of  Malaya,  and  I

believe  that  it  has  already  now  appeared  in

hoping  to utilise a further 1,373 acres of  swamp

<div align="center"><b>INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister of Health)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the epidemic of influenza which  has

visited Singapore has aroused anxiety and  I  feel

it  incumbent upon me to make a full statement for

the benefit of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already stated earlier, this disease

is  believed to have originated in Japan  and  has

invaded   Taiwan,   the   Philippines,   Hongkong,

Singapore   and  the  Federation  of   Malaya.   A

characteristic of this disease is its capacity  to

attack  suddenly, although the actual  disease  is

mild,  and  to  extend very quickly.  The  extreme

conditions  of overcrowding, particularly  in  the

town, must certainly have favoured the spread.  It

must  also  be  realised from the  epidemiological

point  of view that the entire island of Singapore

is   one   composite   urban  unit   with   denser

aggregations  north  and south  of  the  Singapore

River.  In consequence, an island-wide spread  was

inevitable and indeed the spread to the Federation

of  Malaya was inevitable. In the view of  medical

experts,  it  is likely to prevail in an  epidemic

form  until about the end of this month  and  from

daily  reports,  there are  definite  signs  of  a

decline and that it is well on its way out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no known preventive or cure for the

disease.    The    only    course -    which    was

unthinkable - was to close the port of Singapore and

all  the ports of the Federation of Malaya and the

Siamese  border  against the entry  of  any  craft

whatsoever, and impose martial law to keep  people

in  their homes until the disease had spent itself

on  a  worldwide career. There is no specific cure

for  influenza  as there is none for  an  ordinary

common cold. The number of persons affected by the

disease  in  Singapore  and  attended  to  by  our

medical   clinics,   and   mobile   and   floating

dispensaries totalled approximately 25,000. It  is

estimated  that an equal number have been  treated

by  private practitioners and local medicine  men.

So  much  publicity has been given to the epidemic

that  I  have  every reason to  believe  that  the

number  of  persons who were actually attacked  by

the  disease  and  who have not  sought  treatment

would be negligible. Directly it was evident  that

the  disease  had  attacked Singapore,  Government

took  every possible measure to combat and control

it.  Briefly, the steps taken by Government  were,

firstly,  my  Ministry issued warning  and  advice

through  the Press, Rediffusion and the Radio  and

the  personnel  of  the medical  services  to  the

people to keep away from crowds and to rest in bed

if  the  disease was apparent. Secondly,  elective

surgery  was  restricted  to  the  barest  minimum

practicable  to  make  possible  the  release   of

medical  personnel to augment outpatient services.

Further,   extra   travelling  dispensaries   were

mobilised. Prior to the onset of the epidemic,  we

had three travelling dispensaries visiting various

parts  of the island. In addition to this, we  had

two floating dispensaries doing monthly visits  of

the   islands.  On  the  onset  of  the  epidemic,

Government  mobilised five travelling dispensaries

doing  double shifts and the floating dispensaries

were  put on an emergency basis to visit  each  of

the  islands  twice a week. The entire  staff  was

stretched   to  the  limit.  Simultaneously,   the

pharmaceutical  manufactory immediately  increased

its production of essential drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack of the disease commences with fever,

headache, pains in the limbs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>



and  back,  nausea and sore throat  and  sometimes

accompanied  with  cough  and  giddiness   and   a

temperature  which ranges from  101  to  102.  The

duration  of the fever is about two days  and  the

patient settles down to normal within four to five

days and there seem to be very few complications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that four persons might have

died    of   the   disease   although   biological

confirmation  has  yet  to be  available.  Persons

diagnosed  as  having died of  influenza  depended

solely  on  morbid  anatomy. During  this  period,

there  were  a  few  other fatal  cases  in  which

findings  suggest influenza but there  were  other

complications  such  as  broncho-pneumonia,  heart

disease  and  nervous manifestations and,  in  the

absence  of  the virus, it is hardly  possible  to

attribute them to influenza as the causal agent of

death.  Information from commercial firms is  that

about  10 per cent of the staff were away at  some

time  or  other. The disease seems  to  have  been

confined  to  Asians, Europeans being very  little

affected. Whether there is an immunity already  in

the  European race is difficult to decide  at  the

moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to pay tribute to the

excellent team-work and ungrudging service of  all

members of the Ministry, particularly the doctors,

sisters, nurses, dispensers and others who  worked

throughout - some of them fifteen  hours  a  day  on

their feet. In paying this tribute, I do so on  my

own  personal knowledge: I visited the  outpatient

department  in the General Hospital  and  saw  the

work  that  was being done there. I have discussed

matters  with  the personnel manning the  services

and  the  streamline  basis  on  which  they  were

operating  to meet the emergency and I  have  been

given  the  assurance that there was  an  adequate

supply  of  drugs.  My  discussions  with  all  my

officers  convinced me that the disease  is  of  a

very mild nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House are, of course, aware that

the  schools  were  closed.  After  consulting  my

medical advisers and on receiving reports from the

Ministry  of  Education that  there  was  a  large

number of absentees both of pupils and teachers, I

recommended that the schools be temporarily closed

with the advice to parents and/or guardians that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>



children should be kept away from crowded  places.

The  reasons for this are threefold: first,  large

numbers of children travel in crowded buses to and

from  schools  and  it is very easy  for  them  to

acquire the infection in a crowded bus; second, an

infected  child  would spread  to  others  in  the

school,  persons in the buses and members  of  the

home;  and  third, the Minister for Education  was

concerned with the practical difficulty of holding

classes without teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal conditions, recorded deaths from

pneumonia  in Singapore rank high in the  fatality

list.  In view of the anxiety created in the minds

of the population, it is not unnatural for persons

to  believe  that anybody dying of any respiratory

infection must have died of influenza and it is  a

pity that, in some cases, most exaggerated reports

have tended to aggravate the fears in the minds of

the  people.  A  glaring example of  this  is  the

report  on  the  mercy mission  to  Pulau  Sudong.

Following the visit of the mercy mission,  it  was

reported   in   the  local  Press  with   alarming

headlines  that  300  persons  out  of   a   total

population  of about 450 were down with  influenza

and  that three had died of it but Government  was

not  giving any special treatment or help and that

the  people  were dying of starvation. This,  Sir,

was a terrible indictment but proved to be a gross

exaggeration. It was known to my Ministry at  that

time  that  there  were only  21  cases  with  the

disease  and that none had died of it. On  reading

this   astounding   report,   I   made   immediate

enquiries.  It was then confirmed by  the  medical

officer  and  the hospital assistants who  visited

the  island twice a week that only 11 children and

10  adults,  most  of  whom were  recovering  from

influenza,  were the only cases in  Pulau  Sudong.

There were, in fact, three deaths: one child  from

convulsions,  another child from  gastro-enteritis

and the third, a woman, from goitre. Not satisfied

with   this  report,  I  sent  two  other  medical

officers  with members of the Press in  attendance

to  make  a further detailed check. The penghulu's

services  were  specially enlisted to  permit  the

doctors  to  examine  every  sick  person  on  the

island. The penghulu went hither and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>



thither  and  eventually brought  51  persons  for

examination most of whom looked far from  ill  and

were, in fact, in a cheerful and gay mood. Of  the

51, there were two new cases of mild infection and

a  further  six  convalescents. The  remaining  43

intimated  that they were going out  fishing  that

night.  What was even more surprising, in view  of

the  allegation  that most of the  population  was

starving,  was the finding that there  was  not  a

single   case   of  malnutrition   amongst   those

examined. I would remind hon. Members of the House

that  those  persons examined  on  that  day  were

persons  specifically  selected  by  the  penghulu

himself  as being those most in need because  they

were either sick or starving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no need to panic and it is further to

be  regretted that the fear caused in the minds of

the  people  did  much more harm  than  this  mild

outbreak of influenza really did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, one of the local papers reported that the

victims of this disease had to travel from Changi,

Katong  and  Tampenis to the General Hospital  and

one  of  these  questioned  by  the  reporter  was

alleged  to  have said, "We should  have  our  own

dispensaries in our areas or quicker attention  in

the  General  Hospital outpatient  department."  I

would  like,  Sir, to remind this  House  and  the

people  of  Singapore  that  in  addition  to  the

services  given by the travelling dispensaries  in

the   rural   areas   and  the  General   Hospital

outpatient  department, static outpatient  clinics

and dispensaries are and have been in existence in

the  following  places - and  all  these  have  been

working full strength during the epidemic:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the Kandang Kerbau outpatient dispensary

for women and children;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the Tan Tock Seng outdoor dispensary for

males;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the Paya Lebar outdoor clinic;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the Bukit Panjang outdoor clinic at the

10th mile;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) the Bukit Timah outdoor clinic at the 7th

mile;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) the Holland Road outdoor clinic at Holland

Village;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) the Thomson Road outdoor clinic at the 6th

mile;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) the Changi Prison clinic for prison staff

and  Government servants in  the  area  and

their families;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) the Changi clinic at the 14th mile, Changi;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) the Gulega Road clinic at the 9th mile,

Changi Road;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) the Kampong Batak clinic in the Malay

Settlement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) the Kallang outdoor dispensary at the old

Kallang Airport site.



<br><br>In  addition,  the  City Council  maintains  three

outpatient   clinics  solely  for   City   Council

employees  which  relieve  the  pressure  on   the

Government services. Furthermore, our records show

that  there had been daily attendances at all  the

clinics mentioned and if it is of interest to  any

Member  of  this House, he is welcome  to  inspect

these  records.  Apart from  the  Kallang  outdoor

dispensary  which  was only  recently  opened,  of

which existence the public has been well aware and

is  prominently situated in the old Airport  site,

all  the other clinics have been in existence  for

at  least  one or more years. The fact that  these

clinics  have  been well patronised  during  their

existence  and during the epidemic is an effective

answer to those who might maintain that the people

are  unaware of them. There are also three clinics

for  schoolchildren:  one  at  North  Canal  Road,

another at Katong and a third at Paya Lebar.  Five

thousand schoolchildren attended these clinics  up

to yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of the criticisms appearing in the Press

and  such  harebrained  suggestions  like  sending

loudspeakers   to  Chinatown  at   a   time   when

Government medical services were working  at  full

pressure,  had members of the public emulated  the

splendid  example of Mr Richard Lim in organising

a  special  voluntary medical service  station  at

Pearl's   Hill  community  centre   and   now   at

Serangoon,  it  would have served  a  much  better

purpose.  One  sneeze in Chinatown by  any  person

affected  in  such congested conditions  as  exist

there would result in widespread prevalence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>



A loudspeaker would only cause more panic and give

opportunities to thugs and quacks to make  capital

out  of  it, it is, of course, a matter for regret

that  the outbreak of influenza did cause economic

damage  and distress to many but I must  emphasise

that it was absolutely unavoidable and the hazards

and  distress posed could be likened to  a  common

cold  of equal incidence. About nine days  ago,  I

stated  that the disease had reached the peak  and

was expected to decline soon. This was evident  by

the daily reports and the graphs of new and repeat

cases.   Today,  I  am  happy  to  say  that   the

anticipation  of the Ministry of Health  has  been

correct, that the disease is well on its  way  out

and I understand that it is unlikely that a person

who  has  been  attacked with influenza  virus  is

likely to be attacked again in the same epidemic.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Will the Minister state

why  the  radio was not fully used  in  the  early

stages  of  the  epidemic to tell  the  public  in

simple  language  what to  do  and  how  to  treat

themselves  so  as to reduce the pressure  on  the

Government hospitals and the clinics?

opportunity to use the radio was taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister informed us that there is  no  known

cure  against influenza and that whatever medicine

the doctors could dispense would be in the form of

aspirin. Why was not aspirin made available to the

people  of  Singapore?  A  patient  going  to  the

hospital-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Was that a supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, Sir. I have a series of

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I have stated that there is no known

cure  for  the disease but such things as aspirin,

A.P.C.,  Veganin  and codeine are all  palliatives

and  they  were  made  available  at  the  outdoor

dispensaries and every clinic in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Is the Minister aware, Sir,

that a patient going to the

hospital may have to wait from morning until quite

late  in  the  afternoon, say about four  o'clock,

five  o'clock or even six o'clock before  he  gets

attended  to whereas if these medicines were  made

available,  he  would  then not  be  subjected  to

paying  high  prices to the thugs  and  quacks  as

stated?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Is the

signed by a police constable and is he again aware

that   the   police  constable  had   no   medical

qualification  to  ascertain  the  cause  of   the

deaths?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I would like to know where the hon.

Member  got  this information from. These  islands

are  visited  by  the  doctors  and  the  hospital

assistants  and they are perfectly aware  of  what

the   patients  are  suffering  from.  The   death

certificates   are  done  after  their   diagnosis

supervision.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister's  goodwill visit to Japan  probably  has

brought  back this virus but he must have  learned

what  steps the Japanese had taken when he was  in

Japan.   There   was   an  outbreak   there,   and

furthermore he must have learned what  steps  they

have  taken  in Hongkong too and I  hope  that  at

least Singapore should be benefited in the way  of

knowing what other countries are doing instead  of

a just empty goodwill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> If the Member for Serangoon

understands  English perfectly, I just  said  that

there  is no known preventive against the disease.

It  is no good kidding the public. If there was  a

preventive  like issuing masks and  so  forth,  we

would  have  done it willingly to factory  workers

and  others  but  I said that there  is  no  known

preventive.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency's consent

to  proceed  with this Bill. I beg to  move,  Sir,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a relatively short Bill and the purpose

is   fully  explained  in  the  Explanatory   Note

attached to the Bill. In passing, Sir, I  have  to

mention  that, owing to an error in drafting,  the

"Republic of Northern Ireland" is mentioned in the

Note;  the  word "Northern" should, of course,  be

omitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Consular Conventions Ordinance,

(Chapter 264), this Government has already granted

representatives of certain foreign powers  certain

immunities  and  privileges  in  accordance   with

international practice, but at present there is no

law  under which similar diplomatic privileges and

immunities  may  be granted to representatives  of

Commonwealth  countries. Up to the present,  these

have been granted by administrative action and  it

is  now proposed to rectify this by means of  this

Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill before the House follows closely the

Federation   of   Malaya   Diplomatic   Privileges

(Commonwealth Countries and Republic of Ireland)

Ordinance  which  was  passed  in  1956,  and  the

provisions  in the Consular Conventions Ordinance,

(Chapter  264), regarding immunities and remission

of  taxes,  charges, duties and  fees  to  foreign

consular representatives in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill apply at present to

Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South

Africa,  India, Pakistan and Ceylon, but provision

is  made for extension by order of the Governor in

Council  to  other countries, being (a)  countries

within  the  Commonwealth; or (b) the Republic  of

Ireland. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main purpose of this Bill is to amend

the   section  of  the  Divorce  Ordinance   which

prescribes  the  grounds on which a  petition  for

divorce  may be presented to the court.  I  think,

Sir,  that Members of this Assembly will have seen

from  the first paragraph of the Explanatory  Note

which is appended to the copy of the Bill which is

in  their hands that at the present time,  one  of

the  grounds  on which a party to a  marriage  may

institute  proceedings for  divorce  is  that  the

other  party  to  the  marriage  is  incurably  of

unsound mind and has been continuously under  care

and  treatment for a period of at least five years

immediately  preceding  the  presentation  of  the

petition.  This  care  and treatment,  Sir,  must,

under   the   existing   law,   be   within    the

jurisdiction - it must be within the  Colony - and  it

is clear, therefore, that hardship may occur where

a  party to a marriage is under care and treatment

outside    the   jurisdiction.   The    Government

accordingly  considers  it  desirable   that   the

Divorce Ordinance should be amended so that  cases

of   hardship   of  this  kind  may  be   avoided.

Accordingly, Sir, clause 2 of the Bill is designed

to  allow divorce proceedings to be instituted  in

Singapore   where  a  party  to  a   marriage   is

undergoing care and treatment in a country outside

the  Colony, provided that the court is  satisfied

that  he is receiving care and treatment according

to  standards which are substantially the same  as

those  obtaining  in  respect  of  the  care   and

treatment   of  patients  suffering  from   mental

illness in the Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that Members will have observed

from  the second paragraph of the Explanatory Note

that  the  form of amendment which is now proposed

follows the principle of the amendment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>



recently  recommended  in  England  by  the  Royal

Commission on Marriage and Divorce, where the  law

on this point corresponds to the law in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, I think, Sir, only one other point to

which   I  should  refer  in  moving  this  Second

Reading,  and that is the quite separate amendment

which  is  proposed  by clause 3.  That  amendment

restores  the  word "nisi" in the section  of  the

Ordinance  empowering  the court  to  pronounce  a

decree  of dissolution of marriage. That word  was

omitted when the 1936 Edition was amended in  1941

and  was  not  restored when the 1955  Edition - the

present Revised Edition - was prepared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is nothing useful which I can add

to  what I have said, Sir, and accordingly  I  now

beg to move that this Bill be read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the consent of

His   Excellency  the  Officer  Administering  the

Government to proceed with this Bill and I beg  to

move, "That the Bill be read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the present Pineapple Industry

Ordinance  an advisory body known as the Pineapple

Joint  Industrial Council was set  up  on  a  pan-Malayan  basis  to advise both the Governments  of

Singapore  and  the Federation of  Malaya  on  all

matters affecting the pineapple industry, but  the

executive   functions  of  registering   pineapple

canneries  were vested in Registrars appointed  in

each territory by the respective Governments,  and

inspection   of  these  canneries  was   made   by

inspectors  jointly appointed by both  the  Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Pineapple Joint Industrial Council

has  power  to negotiate agreements on prices  and

grades  of  pineapples for sale to  canneries,  to

regulate the production, grading and marketing  of

canned pineapples, and to make recommendations  to

both  Governments on other matters  affecting  the

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill, Sir, proposes that a statutory

Board  should be set up on a pan-Malayan basis  by

identical  legislation  in  both  territories   to

replace the present Joint Industrial Council,  and

that  this Board should be given executive  powers

on all matters affecting the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board, when constituted, will take over the

present   functions   of   the   Pineapple   Joint

Industrial  Council and the powers of  registering

canneries  now vested in the Registrars  appointed

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>



each territory by the respective Governments,  and

would,   in  addition,  be  empowered  to  conduct

research  into  the cultivation and processing  of

pineapples  and  their  by-products,  to  register

canners,  can  suppliers, exporters and  marketing

societies,   and   to  issue  a   certificate   of

registration in respect of each cannery owned by a

registered canner (persons aggrieved by refusal to

register  being enabled to appeal to a  Tribunal),

to register a distinguishing mark or marks for the

product   of   each  or  all  of  the   registered

canneries,  to  employ  staff  including  a  chief

executive  officer  and a pineapple  inspectorate,

and to enforce discipline in the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enforce discipline, an executive

committee  is  to  be  established  and  if   this

committee  finds any person registered  under  the

Ordinance  guilty of contravening  or  failing  to

comply  with  the provisions of the Ordinance  and

the  regulations made by the Board, the  committee

is  empowered under clause 23 (a), (b) and (c)  to

cancel  his registration or to impose a  fine  not

exceeding  $10,000, or to order costs  payable  to

the  Board not exceeding $1,000. It may impose all

or  any  one  or  two  of these  punishments,  and

persons who are aggrieved can appeal to a Tribunal

set  up  under clause 24 of the Bill  to  which  I

shall refer later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canners, can suppliers, growers and exporters

will be required to belong to an association to be

notified    in   the   Government    Gazette    as

representative  of  the  canning,  can  supplying,

marketing  and exporting branches of the pineapple

industry    before   they   are    eligible    for

registration. But in order to prevent a  monopoly,

no  association can be specified by the  Board  by

notification  in  the Gazette as a  representative

association unless it freely permits the admission

of a member on his complying with the articles and

rules of the association, and unless the rules  of

the   association  are  not  prejudicial  to   the

interests of the pineapple industry and are  first

approved by the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representative associations which are specified

by  the Board by notification in the Gazette  will

be empowered to appoint members to the Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the Registrar under the existing

Ordinance to refuse to register a cannery, on  the

ground  that  there  already exists  a  sufficient

number of pineapple canneries, has not been  given

to  the Board, and therefore it will be impossible

for  a limit to be set to the number of registered

canneries on this ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is provision for the registration

of   marketing  societies  in  the   Bill,   these

societies,  whether  they  are  in  the  form   of

smallholders'   associations   or   growers'   co-operatives,  are  not  to  be  subjected  to   the

disciplinary  powers  of the  executive  committee

because  the purpose of requiring the registration

of marketing societies is only to enable financial

assistance to be given to them by the Board,  and,

except  for registration, the other provisions  of

the  Ordinance  do  not apply to these  registered

marketing societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Sir, there is provision,

under clause 24, for appeals to a Tribunal and the

appeal  can  be  (a)  from the  decisions  of  the

executive  committee cancelling  registrations  or

imposing a fine or ordering the payment of  costs;

(b)  from  the  refusal of  the  Board  to  effect

registration of canners. Exporters, can  suppliers

or  marketing societies; and (c) from the  refusal

of  the Board to approve the articles and rules of

a representative association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is given to the Minister for Commerce and

Industry,  on the recommendation of the Board,  to

impose  a  cess or cesses on the export of  canned

pineapple, the proceeds of which will he paid into

a  Pineapple Industry Fund to be established under

the  Ordinance.  The  cost  of  administering  the

industry and maintaining an inspectorate, as  well

as  the  cost of organising agronomic,  processing

and market research, will be met from this Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pineapple Industry Ordinance (Chapter 180)

is  to  be  repealed  but the provisions  of  this

Ordinance   relating   to  the   Pineapple   Joint

Industrial  Council will be kept in force  for  so

long  as  it  is  necessary for  this  Council  to

discharge its liabilities, if any, and until it is

able to transfer its functions to the Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Explanatory Note points out, the

amendments  proposed  in  this  Bill   have   been

discussed  in and approved by the Pineapple  Joint

Industrial  Council which at present advises  both

Governments  on all matters affecting the  Malayan

pineapple industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will be aware that an

identical   Bill  was  enacted  by   the   Federal

Legislative  Council at its meeting  on  8th  May,

1957, together with an amendment to clause 24  (1)

which I shall move in Committee stage later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will see from the Comparative Table

attached  to the Bill that the amendments proposed

are  to  a  very  great  extent  modelled  on  the

existing  provisions  of the Rubber  Shipping  and

Packing Control Ordinance (Chapter 183), and  that

these proposals are therefore not new.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations made by the Board to carry into

effect  the  objects of the Ordinance have  to  be

approved by the Governor in Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill does not involve Government in any

financial expenditure. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg  to

move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>11.26 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of the Bill which is before the

House  today  is  to enable seamen  to  enjoy  the

benefits  of the Central Provident Fund Ordinance.

The   definition  of  "employee"  in  the  present

Ordinance  does  not  include  those  who  venture

beyond     territorial    waters    unless     its

interpretation is substantially strained. There is

no  reason why seamen should be excluded from  the

provisions of the Ordinance and hon. Members  will

note that this Bill brings seamen within its scope

by   amending  the  definition  of  "employee"  to

include a master, seaman or apprentice employee on

a  vessel  the  owners of which have  a  place  of

business in Singapore or have their agents here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to rectify

certain  defects  in the present  Ordinance  which

make  administration difficult. Most of these  are

trivial  but  there are three,  Sir,  to  which  I

should like to draw the attention of hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the amendment of the definition of

"employee" by deleting the reference to a  waiting

period of three months and inserting in section 7,

where it more properly belongs, a provision to the

effect  that  the employer shall pay contributions

to  the  Fund in respect of each employee who  has

worked  for the employer for a period of not  less

than  one  month. The experience  of  the  Central

Provident  Fund  Board has  been  that  a  waiting

period  of  three  months leads to  non-compliance

with   the   Ordinance,  and   that   unscrupulous

employers  keep  employees for  just  under  three

months  and then dismiss them. I would  point  out

that  the Federation Ordinance limits the  waiting

period to one month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the amendment to section 14 of the

Ordinance so as to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>



provide  that  on  the death of a contributor  the

money  shall  be  paid directly  to  a  person  or

persons  nominated  by  the  contributor  in   his

lifetime  for the beneficial use of those persons,

instead  of,  as  at  present,  to  a  trustee  or

trustees.  It  has been apparent  to  the  Central

Provident  Fund  Board  for  some  time  that  the

conception  of a trustee is a matter of difficulty

even for the educated layman, and it is not at all

understood by the generality of contributors,  who

mistrust the arrangement. Further, Sir, the actual

recipient of the contributor's money is completely

ignorant  of his duties as a trustee, and although

the  Board  does  its  best to  advise  a  trustee

recipient, the position is not satisfactory. There

is  no  legal  value or safeguard in  the  present

arrangement and it is thought that the contributor

should  be  enabled to dispose  of  his  money  to

selected individuals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third, Sir, is the amendment of section 7A

to   increase   the  interest  charged   on   late

contributions from one-half per cent per month  to

one  per  cent  per month with a  minimum  of  one

dollar. It is considered that the old rate is  too

low.  Hon. Members will realise that late  payment

means  a  delay  in investing the monies  received

into  the  Fund and the Board must be  compensated

realistically if the members of the Fund  are  not

to  suffer. The charge also must be high enough to

cover the administrative cost of collection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments are designed to improve

the  administration of the Fund and to remove  one

or  two  ambiguities. I shall not go into them  in

detail  as  they are explained in the  Explanatory

Note at the end of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will  note  that  clause  1  makes

provision for the Bill to come into effect on  1st

June.  The main reason for this is that  the  Bill

benefits  a  new class of employees - the seamen - and

that  it  provides additional benefits to a  great

number  of  employees whose work is of a temporary

nature  by reducing the waiting period from  three

months  to  one month. I am sure, Sir,  that  this

House  will  agree  with  me  that  there  is   no

justification for delaying these overdue  reforms.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.31 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when

notice  was  given  of  the introduction  of  this

amending   Bill,   the   Liberal-Socialist   Party

expected  that  an  injustice perpetrated  by  the

Government  in this Bill was about to be  removed.

Certain  improvements have been made, but the  one

that really matters has remained untouched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will remember that the Central

Provident Fund Ordinance was rushed through  on  a

Certificate of Urgency on the 29th of June,  1955,

and  put into operation two days later at  a  time

when   we  were  all  new  to  the  work  of   the

Legislature.  It was lauded to the  skies  by  the

Minister  for Labour and Welfare as a great  piece

of  social legislation. But the implication of one

section  remained  undetected  in  the  haste   of

pushing the Ordinance through all its Readings  on

the same day without the public having a chance to

consider it, and the iniquity of it has only  come

to  light  in recent months. Indeed,  it  is  even

doubtful  whether it can stand the  interpretation

put  upon it by the Central Provident Fund  Board,

but  in  failing  to amend it, the Government  has

given full backing to this iniquity. Or rather,  I

should  say that there is an amendment  before  us

but   acting   against  the   interests   of   the

contributors.  I  refer to section  11(2)  of  the

principal Ordinance - whether you read it  there  or

in  the  amended form in clause 9 before us today.

Let  me read it, Sir, in the form in which  it  is

proposed to amend it now:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Board shall cause to be credited to each

member   of   the   Fund  the  amount   of   every

contribution paid in his respect and,  immediately

upon the declaration by the Board under subsection

(3)  of  section 6 of this Ordinance of a rate  of

interest for the preceding year, interest at  that

rate  on the amount standing to his credit in  the

Fund at the commencement of such preceding year in

such manner as the Board may direct;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means - this is what the Government wishes it

to  mean - that the Board will only pay interest  on

the amount in the contributor's account on the 1st

of  January  of each year, and will  not  pay  any

interest on the next 12 months' contributions.  In

other words, the Board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>



has   the  whole  of  the  contributions  to   the

Provident Fund for 12 months duly invested without

giving   any  proportion  of  the  current  year's

interest  to  the  persons  to  whom  the   money

belongs. Sir, we cannot accept this position which

seems  to us not only unfair but contrary  to  the

intentions  of the Ordinance. It would perhaps  be

more  convenient if I go into the implications  in

greater detail at the Committee stage, and  so  at

the   moment  I  only  bring  the  matter  to  the

attention of the Members of the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am   indeed   amused   to   be   told   that   the

interpretation  of  the Provident  Fund  Board  in

regard   to   section  11(2)   is   an   injustice

perpetrated   by  the  Government.   The   Central

Provident Fund Board, Sir, is an independent body.

It  was  set  up under the Central Provident  Fund

Ordinance  to  operate the Ordinance  and  it  can

fully exercise the powers conferred upon it by the

Ordinance.  The Government does not interfere  nor

does it give any directions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member was not right when he said that

this Government rushed the Bill through. I thought

that the Progressive Party, which has now been  embraced by the Liberal-Socialist Party, would  want

to claim credit for the introduction of that Bill.

What the Government did in, I think, June 1955 was

to amend the Schedule to the Ordinance so that any

employee who draws less than $200 need not have to

contribute to the Fund, whereas his employer  will

in  duty  bound be asked to donate five per  cent.

That  was  only  what the Labour  Front  Coalition

Government did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, section 11 of the Ordinance has been

interpreted by the Central Provident Fund Board in

such a way that clause 9 of the Bill now seeks  to

remove the ambiguity. Sir, I think it is wrong  to

say  that  there  is any attempt at  cheating  the

contributors. The money is a trust  fund  held  in

trust  for them. Whatever money is not distributed

to  the contributors by way of interest will still

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>



kept  in  the fund for further distribution.  Sir,

this  matter  came  to light  as  a  result  of  a

newspaper  article.  It  was  suggested  by   that

newspaper  article what the hon. Member now  seeks

to  amend, but it was pointed out by the  Chairman

of  the Central Provident Fund Board that it would

of  course  be  open to the Board to  direct  that

interest should be paid in the manner suggested in

the  article,  and  in the manner  sought  by  the

amendment.  The adoption of this suggestion,  Sir,

would mean that after each year's end some two and

a  half  million  separate  interest  calculations

would  need  to  be  made, as  the  Board  is  not

empowered to decide the interest rate until  after

the  end of the year. This vast calculation  would

be possible but at a cost in time and labour which

would  be  out of all proportion to the amount  of

the  interest involved. Indeed, Sir, in  the  long

run the increased cost of administration would  in

fact reduce the total amount of interest available

for distribution to contributors. What the Central

Provident  Fund Board seeks to do  is  to  try  to

protect the interests of the contributors and  not

to  spend  money  indiscriminately  in  increasing

administration costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin, Sir, said he would have

more  to  speak  about this during  the  Committee

stage,  and I, Sir, would like to speak  a  little

bit more too at the Committee stage when he raises

the matter again.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 8, lines 25 to 28, to leave out from

"amount"   to  the  end  and  insert   "of   every

contribution paid in his respect from the date  of

receipt of every such contribution:".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now, Sir, the sub-clause as it

stands means that the Board will only pay interest

on  the amount in the contributor's account on the

1st  of January of each year and will not pay  any

interest  on the next 12 months' contributions.  I

have  my  own statement of account in the  Central

Provident Fund Board with me here. On the  1st  of

January, 1956, the amount in my account was  $250.

On  the  31st  of December, 1956, the  amount  was

$900,  but the interest earned is two and  a  half

per  cent on $250 only, namely, $6.25, making  the

total  amount in my account on the 1st of  January

this  year  $906.25. Now if my  contributions  and

those  of  my  employer had been put in  the  Post

Office  Savings Bank each month in 1956,  so  that

the  two  and a half per cent interest  would  run

from the date of paying in each contribution,  the

amount in my account would be more than $906.25 by

something like $8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me carry the argument one step further to

make this situation still clearer. As I have said,

my  account stood at $906.25 on the 1st of January

this year. It will be this sum which will earn two

and  a half per cent seven months from now on  the

31st  of  December, 1957. In other words, the  $50

per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>



month  which is being paid into my account  by  my

employer each month of this year is bringing me no

interest  whatever, but is being invested  by  the

Board at something like six or seven per cent. And

this goes for every single one of the thousands of

compulsory contributors to the Fund, most of  them

much more in need of the extra interest, which  is

their right, than I am.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance, as it stands, compels the people

of   Singapore   to  lose  valuable   savings   in

comparison with what they could get from the  Post

Office. That is why we propose this amendment. The

Central   Provident  Fund  Board  holds   to   the

contention that it is protected by section  6  (3)

of the principal Ordinance which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interest shall be payable on contributions to

the  Fund  at such rate per annum, not being  less

than two and one half per centum, as the Board may

declare  after and in respect of each year  ending

on the thirty-first day of December:".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board's interpretation of the word "annum"

with  reference  to the interest  rate  apparently

precludes   the   application  of   the   interest

provisions  to  sums which have not  been  in  the

hands  of  the  Board for one whole year - that  is,

whether  a contribution is paid in on the 15th  of

January  or  the  15th  of  December,  it  is  not

entitled  to  interest. I do not think  that  this

argument  can be supported. If the Board  were  to

invest  any of its own funds at six per  cent  per

annum, it would feel considerably aggrieved if the

borrower  repaid  the  Board its  capital  without

interest 364 days later and contended that "annum"

meant  "year".  This interpretation  of  the  word

"annum"   makes   meaningless   the   proviso   to

subsection  (2)  of section 11  of  the  principal

Ordinance which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that where the authority of the Board

is  granted under section 12 of this Ordinance for

the  withdrawal from the Fund of any sum of  money

standing to the credit of an employee, the  amount

of  interest due from the first day of January  of

the  year in which such authority is given to  the

date upon which it is given shall be calculated at

two and one half per centum per annum and credited

to    the    employee   before   such   withdrawal

notwithstanding   that  the   rate   of   interest

subsequently declared by the Board in  respect  of

that year may be greater than two and one half per

centum per annum."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that in the case of withdrawals interest

will  be made at not more than two and a half  per

cent  from  the 1st of January until the  date  of

withdrawal,  when you have already  ordained  that

such  interest is not payable, is of course  sheer

nonsense:   yet  here  we  have  a  Labour   Front

Coalition Government seeking in this amending Bill

to  retain  this proviso and yet not to amend  the

subsection  to allow interest to accrue  from  the

date of each contribution. This makes no sense  at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument which the Board puts up, to which

the  Chief Minister has referred, is that the cost

of  administration would be too high. We  on  this

side  of the House are not prepared to accept that

unless  we are supplied with facts and figures  to

support it. It is common knowledge that the  Board

is  investing its funds at six or seven per  cent,

whereas it is paying out interest at only two  and

a  half per cent. When on top of that the Board is

acquiring for itself considerable capital interest-free,  a  proper explanation from the Minister  is

clearly  called for. I hope that we shall be  told

what income at, say, a minimum of six per cent  is

received  on the contributions paid in during  one

calendar year and how this compares with the  cost

of  administering  the Fund. The balances  already

accumulated should be enough to pay for the  extra

administrative costs, if the General  Post  Office

can  do it in the case of post-office savings, why

not the Central Provident Fund Board?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Government will probably try to answer

that  the Board intends to do better than the Post

Office  and raise the interest rate to  three  per

cent when allowed to do so under section 6 (3) (b)

of the principal Ordinance, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the Board shall not declare a rate of interest

exceeding  two  and a half per  centum  per  annum

until the assets of the Fund valued at the current

market  price exceed its liabilities  by  ten  per

centum;";



<br><br>but  that  is  one  of the airy  promises  of  the

future. Who is to know that once the condition  in

this  paragraph is fulfilled, there will be enough

excuses put forward that three per cent cannot  be

entertained because the funds will no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>



longer be invested in six per cent, or the cost of

living  has  gone up, or some such else?  Whatever

the   excuse,  the  fact  remains  that  all   the

contributors  to  the Fund have  been  denied  the

interest  on  their 1956 contributions  and  their

1957  contributions to date, to  which  they  were

entitled under this Ordinance as it was originally

drafted: and that the Board and the Government are

hiding behind the phrase in section 11 (2) of  the

principal  Ordinance "in such manner as the  Board

may  direct".  That  is a dangerous  phrase  which

gives   far   too  much  power  to   a   statutory

corporation and enables it to snap its fingers  at

the public and the Legislature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board should act as trustees for their

contributors and the Government must see to it, if

they  are to justify the compulsory savings scheme

in  the eyes of thousands of working people,  that

the  terms offered are at least as good  as  those

offered by the Post Office, and for the first  two

years the people have been forced to contribute to

something which is less good.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, one would

feel that what the Member for Tanglin has said  is

as  a  result  of what the Labour Front  Coalition

Government has done. I said on the Second  Reading

that  this  Bill  was being claimed  by  the  then

Progressive  Party  as their  masterpiece  in  the

interests of the workers of Singapore.  I  sat  on

the  Select Committee on the Bill not as a  Member

of  the  Progressive Party but as a Member of  the

Labour  Party, and as the Member for  Tanglin  was

not there on the Select Committee, he is therefore

not  aware that this matter was discussed at  some

considerable  length and the decision  arrived  at

was  that we should try out the operation of  this

new  venture and leave it to the Central Provident

Fund  Board,  which  would be entrusted  with  the

running   of   this   Fund,   to   discharge   its

responsibilities under the provisions of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy, Sir, to say that more and more money

should be paid to contributors, but the Board  has

to  pay  the  money out of interest  earned  as  a

result  of investments and it can only pay out  of

its profits. There is a guarantee of two and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>



a  half  per cent and to date the Board  has  been

operating on a deficit. At the beginning of  1956,

I  am  informed that the deficit was $540,996.  At

the  beginning  of  1956 the  total  contributions

amounted  to $9,075,065, whereas at the  close  of

the  year  the  amount standing to the  credit  of

contributions was $34 million. As a result of  the

operation  during the year 1956,  the  net  profit

earned  was $332,329, and on the basis of  payment

of  interest  as decided upon by the  Board,  this

would  mean a distribution of $223,005, leaving  a

balance  of $109,324 to reduce the opening deficit

of  $540,996.  The deficit as at the beginning  of

this  year  is therefore $431,672. I  am  informed

that  the Board hopes that by the end of this year

this  deficit  will have been totally  reduced  so

that  in  later years the interest to be  paid  on

contributions, even on the basis of what the Board

has  decided, will be more than two and a half per

cent.  It is not correct to say that it was  wrong

for  the  Board to be given such wide powers.  The

powers  are  given to the Board and  it  can  only

exercise  them  within certain  restrictions,  and

those  powers and those restrictions were  in  the

principal Ordinance - the product of the Progressive

Party. If the amendment proposed by the Member for

Tanglin is to be accepted, as I said on the Second

Reading,   Sir,   it  will  mean  extra   clerical

assistance  at least to work out two  and  a  half

million accounts.



<br><br>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at each stage of the contribution interest is

to  be  paid on that basis, we know that the money

that  comes into the Fund from the employers  does

not come in at the beginning of the month, but  it

keeps on coming in during the course of the month:

and  employers  have up to 21 days  to  remit  the

money  to the Central Provident Fund Board  before

they  become liable for interest. Now if one  were

to  stretch what is being sought by the amendment,

it  would  not  only mean two and a  half  million

accounts, but it would mean very, very much  more.

Is   this  worth  it  in  the  interests  of   the

contributors concerned? The money is  in  a  trust

fund. It is their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>



money. No one can take it away. The Government has

no  right  to  take it away. It is vested  in  the

Central  Provident Fund Board which has discretion

to   use  that  Fund  in  the  interests  of   the

contributors.  In  the  light  of  what   I   have

explained, Sir, I find it difficult to accept  the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, credit

was  given  to the Progressive Party for  bringing

forth  this Bill, and I think if it had been taken

through  by the Progressive Party then  you  would

have to give it greater credit, because that Party

never  acted  on impulses. It would probably  have

given  a  great  deal of thought to those  clauses

which  the Member, who sat on the Select Committee

as a representative of the Labour Party and who is

now  the  Minister  for Labour  and  Welfare,  has

overlooked as being not important. They would have

had a thorough investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree with the statement by the

Minister that if the contributors were to be  paid

more money, then more and more money would have to

be  paid  to  them. I say they must be paid - it  is

their  right;  it is their money; it  is  not  our

money. If we make a profit on it, we are making  a

profit  on  the money contributed by a section  of

the  people whom we say we are out to protect. The

figures  which  the Minister has  given  are  most

interesting.  The Board operates on a  deficit  of

$540,996. Sir, sometimes when we have a little bit

of  money to spare, we bring it to the Post Office

and  they accept it and immediately credit us with

three per cent interest. If we have more money  to

spare, we go along to a bank and the banker  says.

"Yes, we welcome your money on a three-month or  a

six-month basis, and we will pay you three  and  a

half  per  cent." If we pay that  money  in  on  a

current account with some banks, we will still get

some  interest on that money. We can  deposit  and

draw out the money as we like. There must be a lot

of  clerical  work  involved, and  yet  commercial

firms  seem to be able to do much better. It gives

me  the feeling that whatever Board the Government

sets up, is always run inefficiently. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>



the   Government  wants  to  run  it  on  a   very

economical  basis, I suggest it would be  best  to

deposit  every account in the Post Office  Savings

Bank,  and  there  you  are,  you  save  all  your

clerical  work. The Post Office Savings Bank  will

give  you  three  per cent. The Central  Provident

Fund Board is giving the contributors only two and

a half per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1956 is a very interesting year. The Board had a

net  profit  of  $332,000. That  money  was  money

earned  by  the Board from the money deposited  by

the people, and to put it away and not give it  to

the  poor people - those earning under $200 a  month

pay  no contributions at all - and say, "I will save

it up for you," is, I think, open to query. I ask,

"Save  it  up  for  whom?  Save  it  up  for   the

Government  to invest in other things so  that  it

has  more  money to play about with." What  little

money the people contribute should bring them  the

maximum amount of interest. The Government  should

not  take advantage of forcing people to pay  into

their  Fund  and  make money out of  it.  That  is

absolutely wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the excuse that if you are going to

pay  them as they deposit the money, you will have

extra clerical work. I cannot understand how  that

can  hold water. If you operate a small number  of

accounts,  you  need less clerical work,  but  you

have less business, you have less money to invest,

and you have less profits. But if you have a large

number of accounts, you operate a big concern  and

you   can  cut  down  overhead  expenses, if  the

argument  were to be true that if you have  a  big

organisation and you cannot pay more, but you must

pay  less  because  it involves  greater  clerical

work, then all the big businesses should fail. You

must  open  up small shops all over Singapore  and

you  will make much more money than the big firms.

But  that  is  not the case. Usually we  find  big

businesses  swallowing up small ones because  they

can  cut  down on overhead expenses. It is  not  a

good  argument to say that if extra clerical  work

has  to be called in, the net result will be  less

profits. The Post Office Savings Bank can do that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>



The banks can do that. The insurance companies can

do that with even a lesser volume of business. Why

cannot a Government body do that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide powers referred to in the amendment is

opposed by the Government on the ground that it is

the product of the Progressive Party. I would like

to  remind  the  Government  that  even  with  the

Education Bill and many other Bills placed  before

this  House during the last sitting we are against

such wide powers. This is a democratic country. We

do  not  want to produce dictators. I think  those

persons  who are going to handle business for  the

people  must be servants of the people  and  given

just sufficient powers and not over-riding powers.

Sir,   I  support  the  amendment  moved   by   my

colleague.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, a little

knowledge  is  indeed a dangerous  thing!  What  I

said,  Sir,  was  not to ridicule the  Progressive

Party for having introduced the Bill. I gave  them

due  credit. I said this is their Bill.  It  is  a

good  Bill. If it had been a bad Bill, the  Labour

Front  Coalition Government would not have put  it

into operation, but what we did was to improve the

Bill  by  not asking people drawing up to $200  to

contribute. That was all, and that was  introduced

because  of  opposition worked up by people  whose

line  of  reasoning  had been  the  same  as  that

expressed   by  the  Member  for  Serangoon:   the

Government  is cheating the people; the Government

is  using this money for its own good. What is all

this? If you want to pay interest, you have to pay

it  with  the  money you have earned,  even  in  a

business  venture where you earn  very  much  more

than from investing in gilt-edged securities. When

you  begin a business, you will not be able to pay

handsome dividends for the first few years. In the

same  way, the Central Provident Fund Board cannot

pay   interest   which  can   be   attractive   to

contributors.  It  was because of  that  that  the

Progressive  Party  felt that there  should  be  a

guarantee  of two and a half per cent.  Had  there

been  no such guarantee at all, hon. Members would

certainly have realised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>



that it could not be two and a half per cent

interest  at all for still some time  to  come.  I

gave  a  profit of $332,329. On that basis, paying

interest  at two and a half per cent on the  total

contributions at the beginning of 1956  will  take

away $223,005. If we were to pay it at the end  of

the  year on $34,101,466, it would mean a  deficit

of  $520,207. You will have to find $629,531 more

in  order  to  pay  two and a  half  per  cent  on

$34,101,466  at the end of 1956. If you  work  out

two  and a half per cent on $34,101,466, you  will

get  a  figure  of  $852,536. With  only  $332,329

profit  there  will be a deficit of  $520,207  and

this,  if added to the deficit as at the beginning

of 1956, would mean that the Board would be in the

red for $1,061,203. That is all. The statement  of

accounts  for 1956 will, I think, soon  be  tabled

and  when hon. Members see that statement, it will

be time for them to criticise with the information

which  will  be at their disposal. I do  not  know

what the figures are other than those which I have

given,   and   I  suggest  that  the  Member   for

Serangoon, before passing judgement on whether the

Board  has badly handled its work or has  in  fact

handled  it  quite well, await the Report  of  the

Central  Provident Fund Board which should  be  in

his hands in the not distant future.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I would like to point out

to  the  Minister that this Bill,  as  he  himself

says, though originally drafted and passed by this

House  in  1955, is a good Bill, but the point  is

that  it  has  been  wrongly  interpreted  by  the

Central  Provident Fund Board, and I  think  there

are two points which bear this out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By wrong interpretation, I mean that it was

understood, when the Bill was framed in 1953, that

interest  would be paid on contributions from  the

date of paying in those contributions and not only

once  a  year on the 1st of January. I would  draw

the  Minister's attention to section 6 (3) (a)  of

the principal Ordinance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interest shall be payable on contributions to

the Fund at such rate per annum...:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) no such interest shall be payable in

respect  of  the  year  during  which   this

Ordinance comes into force;".



<br><br>Now there would be no point in having that proviso

in  at  all if the intention of the Ordinance  was

that   there  should  not  be  interest  paid   on

contributions  from the date of  paying  in  those

contributions. In point of fact, that is precisely

what  has happened - no interest was paid until  the

1st   of   January.  If  that  was   the   correct

interpretation  of the Ordinance, this  particular

proviso  would be entirely unnecessary.  The  fact

that  it  is  there points to the  fact  that  the

intention  was that interest should be  paid  from

the moment of paying in contributions.



<br><br>12.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other pointer in the same direction

regarding the intention of the original  Bill,  to

which  I am glad the Minister gives credit to  the

Progressive   Party,  is  the  proviso   which   I

mentioned  earlier. Mr Chairman, the proviso  to section  11  (2)  of the principal Ordinance,  and

there  you  have  the very same thought  and  idea

running  through the Ordinance - that, in  cases  of

withdrawal, interest shall be paid for the  period

of  the  year up to the time the withdrawal  takes

place.  An  attempt is being made to  correct  the

situation now so that the Board can interpret this

Ordinance  in  the way in which  it  has  in  fact

interpreted it, namely, only to allow one interest

payment  on  the 1st of January, by the Government

amendment  before us, that is by  calling  this  a

cleaning  up  of an ambiguity. It is  not.  It  is

trying  to put straight the interpretation of  the

Board     for     its    entirely    unjustifiable

interpretation;  and  that  is  the  point,   that

through  this  mis-interpretation of the  original

intentions  of the Ordinance, the contributors  in

1956  and  1957  to  date  have  been  denied  the

interest  on  their contributions to  which  under

this  Ordinance they were entitled. The case seems

to   me   not  to  have  been  proved   that   the

administration costs would be too high to allow of

the  Ordinance being properly interpreted  and  so

intended, unless facts and figures are given  with

which to convince us.

<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to enable more

effective  action to be taken against the  drivers

and  owners  of private motor vehicles  which  are

used  as taxis although they are not licensed  for

that purpose. These vehicles, Sir, are, of course,

commonly   known  as  "pirate"  taxis   and   they

undoubtedly  operate in Singapore in  considerable

numbers. The Commission of Inquiry into the Public

Passenger  Transport  System  of  Singapore  which

reported  in  January 1956 had before it  evidence

that  the total number of these taxis was  of  the

order  of 5,000 and there is no reason to  suppose

that the number is substantially lower today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate that to some members of the

public,  pirate taxis may appear to be a  blessing

rather  than a menace as they have been  described

and  I  propose therefore to refer briefly to  the

case   against  it - the  case  which,  in   effect,

justifies  in  the  view  of  the  Government  the

provisions  of this Bill. That case was summarised

in paragraph 385 of the Commission of Inquiry into

the Public Passenger Transport System of Singapore

and,  with your permission, Sir, I would  like  to

read that paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The operation of these 'pirate' taxis is in our

view  a  practice which should be stamped out, it

permits  fares to be charged which  would  not  be

possible  if the 'pirate' taxis paid their  proper

licence  fees. It can undermine the  finances  of

the  public  services, and in the  end  result  in

poorer  services for those who rely upon them.  It

takes  business away from the taxis proper,  which

are regularly inspected and properly licensed.  It

involves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>



the   carriage  of  passengers  without  insurance

cover, for the insurance policy is invalid in  the

case  of  accidents which occur when the  vehicles

are  improperly used. It adds to congestion on the

streets, because of the small carrying capacity of

the vehicles compared with buses. And in any event

it is illegal."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I think that hon. Members will

probably  agree  that  one  of  the  most  serious

objections to the use of pirate taxis on the roads

is  the fact that their use is not covered by  any

form of insurance. In consequence, the only remedy

left to persons, including the passengers in these

vehicles,  who may be injured in the event  of  an

accident  in  which one of these vehicles  may  be

involved is an action against the driver  with  no

right  of indemnity against any insurance  company

and,  as  a  result,  Sir, in  such  a  case,  the

dependants  of persons killed or injured  in  an

accident  of  that  kind may  very  well  be  left

entirely destitute. Another factor is that  it  is

the experience of the police that pirate taxis are

frequently   used  by  law-breakers  because   the

tracing  of a pirate taxi is, of course,  often  a

very difficult matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Sir, the authorities have

always done what they can to take action to  bring

drivers of pirate taxis before the courts but they

have  been considerably hampered by reason of  the

difficulties   they  have  experienced   both   in

investigating  particular cases and  in  producing

evidence,  in effect, in proving charges.  At  the

same  time,  Sir,  it  does seem  clear  that  the

limitation  on the number of taxis  which  may  be

licensed, which has only recently been lifted, was

an  important contributory cause of the activities

of  pirate  taxis  and it has therefore  been  the

Government's   view  that  any   new   legislation

designed to make the control of pirate taxis  more

effective  should  only be introduced  after  this

limit had been removed. As Members of the Assembly

are,  I think, generally aware, this has now  been

done.  The  limit on the number of vehicles  which

may  be  licensed as taxis has been, so to  speak,

abolished and, in consequence, Sir, the Government

in  introducing this Bill does so in the hope and,

of  course, with the intention that it  will  give

the   authorities  the  powers  they  require   to

suppress the activities of pirate taxis. For this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>



purpose  the Bill is designed to enable action  to

be  taken against the owners of vehicles which are

used as pirate taxis as well as against those  who

drive  them  and  it provides for imprisonment  in

addition or as an alternative to a fine for second

or  subsequent convictions. That, Sir, is provided

for by clause 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 contains the major part of the

amendments  which  are now proposed  to  the  Road

Traffic  Ordinance  and  the  proposals  which  it

makes,  Sir, if they are adopted, will  confer  on

the Registrar of Vehicles and on his officers,  if

they are in uniform, certain additional powers  in

cases where they have grounds for believing that a

vehicle  is  being  used as a taxi  without  being

licensed   for  that  purpose.  These   additional

powers,  Sir,  include the  power  to  arrest  the

driver if the Registrar suspects that the name and

the  address which he has given are false and  the

Bill also proposes to confer on the Registrar  and

his officers, if they are in uniform, and also  to

confer on any police officer in uniform, the power

to  arrest any person who appears to have  been  a

passenger in a pirate taxi if that person  refuses

to  give his name and address. This will, Sir,  it

is  hoped  ensure  that  their  evidence  will  be

available should it be required if proceedings are

instituted against the driver or the owner of  the

vehicle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not much more to say, Sir, at this stage,

but  I  would just summarise the position in  this

way.  The  Government takes the  view  that  these

additional  provisions to deal with  pirate  taxis

are  the  minimum necessary and I hope  that  that

view  will be shared generally by Members of  this

Assembly.  It may be suggested that the Bill  does

not  go  far  enough  and  that  greatly  enhanced

penalties including perhaps the power to order the

confiscation of vehicles should have been provided

for.  It  is, however, the view of the  Government

that the primary object of this legislation should

be  to enable effective action to be taken against

persons  who operate unlicensed vehicles as  taxis

rather than to impose very heavy penalties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, Sir, takes the view that the

provisions of this Bill combined with the  effects

of  delimitation will enable the activities of the

pirate taxis to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>



be  very  greatly  reduced but if experience  does

show  that  this Bill does not go far enough,  the

Government will not hesitate to come back to  this

Assembly  and  to  ask for further  powers  to  be

conferred   on  the  appropriate  authorities   by

legislation. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Government

may  introduce any number of Bills. Government may

introduce  all  sorts of measures  but  Government

cannot introduce a Bill to force co-operation. Co-operation must come willingly from the people  and

whatever Bill is to be introduced depends  on  the

goodwill of the people concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this matter, Government will have to do a

great  deal  more  to infuse confidence  into  the

public  and make them want to co-operate with  the

authorities. The existence of pirate taxis  is  an

evil,  not because it comes about of its own  free

will.  It is created by our bad transport  system.

If  our transport system had been good and  if  it

had  been  convenient for everybody to  travel  by

this  means  to  their places  of  employment  and

homes,  pirate taxis cannot exist:  I  should  say

that  people  would not even want to  own  private

cars  if  the public transport system is  good.  I

have been to London and I noticed that they have a

good  system of public transport. Even  owners  of

cars  do not make use of their cars but prefer  to

use public transport which is cheap and efficient.

This evil is not because of anything else, but  is

due to Government being slow in making this public

transport system efficient. Another cause for  the

existence of pirate taxis, I will say, stems  from

another   fault  of  the  Government - unemployment.

Nobody in this world would want to go against  the

law  if  he  can  help it. Nobody  would  want  to

operate a pirate taxi knowing that operating it is

against the law but when faced with the problem of

starvation for himself and for his family  because

there  is  no  job available, there is  a  Chinese

saying that it is better to postpone death than to

have   immediate  death.  In  this  case,  it   is

unemployment that has caused these pirate taxis to

flourish.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1976</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember, Sir, that we are introducing

this  system  in  order  to  make  the  people  of

Singapore observe the law. We must be aware,  Sir,

that  in  Singapore there are people  who  operate

such taxis because of necessity. It is wrong to do

that.  I do not say that it is right. These people

need  to  have some time to find alternative  jobs

and Government must help them in this. A period of

grace  should  be given to them so that  they  can

find alternative jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard that Government intends to delimit

taxis  but  it  will be interesting to  know  that

delimiting taxis by the City Council on the advice

of  Government is carried out in a fair manner. It

has  come  to my knowledge that it is not possible

to  obtain a new car from the car dealers. All new

cars  have  been booked up - all cars  that  can  be

converted  into  taxis  have  been  booked  up  by

certain individuals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> By the Progressive Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> It has been pointed out by

many   people  outside  this  Assembly  that  huge

profits have been made out of this. If this  is  a

measure put forward by the Government to introduce

new  taxis and somebody is cashing in on it, well,

something  is definitely wrong. I think  about  it

this  way. You want to take away the pirate  taxis

and you want the owners to become legally licensed

taxi owners. The way to go about it is not to say,

"You must have a new car before you can be granted

a  licence."  Why not allow existing  cars  to  be

registered? There is a certain standard which must

be  maintained and we can make them  observe  that

standard:  get  their  cars repaired  to  a  state

whereby  it will be safe for the people.  If  this

were  to be implemented, then it would give a true

chance   to  those  people  who  are  at   present

operating  these pirate taxis to get licences  for

new  taxis;  but if the system of licensing  taxis

only  when  they come fresh from the salesroom  is

imposed   this   will   only   help   unscrupulous

individuals to corner the market, make  the  money

and  yet  deny the chance of lawful employment  to

those  people  who are affected. If  these  people

whom  the  Government is setting out to  help  are

faced with such a problem, they are only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>



again  becoming  drivers  for  new  taxi  owners.

Government should think about this seriously  and

try to see if it could help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, everything said about the pirate

taxis may be true. They break the law, they  take

away  revenue  and  they are  not  able  to  give

compensation  if they are involved in  accidents,

but  I would like to remind Government that their

help  was called upon when there was that general

transport strike. Whether such services  rendered

are  to be taken into account, I do not know, but

I  think that if the Government is a fair one - one

that  thinks  of  the  good  a  section  of   the

population has done - then it should be taken  into

account and a period of grace should be given  to

these people. I personally feel that if old  cars

now being used as pirate taxis could be licensed,

it will help immensely.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  a  legislator, without any hesitation, I rise

to  support this Bill but as a representative  of

the  people,  I  would  wish  the  Government  to

consider my suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Explanatory Note reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The object of this Bill is to enable more

effective action to be taken against the  drivers

and  owners of motor vehicles which are  used  as

taxis without a public service vehicle licence."



<br><br>It  is  straightforward and this Bill is intended

to  deal  with the so-called "pirate" taxis.  The

Hon. the Attorney-General stated that not only do

these  pirate taxis break the law by  not  paying

licence  fees,  but the important thing  is  that

most of them are not covered by proper insurance.

Therefore   the  passengers  are  not  positively

covered. Also, most of the pirate taxis have been

used  to  break the law. I am sure that  no  hon.

Member can deny these facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us trace the history of the existence

of  these pirate taxis. I cannot agree more  with

the   Member  for  Serangoon  when  he  just  now

mentioned  that  the existence  of  these  pirate

taxis was mainly due to mass unemployment. People

find it hard to get a job, so they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>



try  to find an easier way. If there is a supply,

there  is  a demand, and vice versa. There  is  a

need  for  transport  services,  especially  when

there  is  a  strike  on by the  buses.  I  still

remember, Sir, during the Hock Lee riots and  the

strike by the Singapore Traction Company, that  I

suggested  the  relaxation  of  certain  measures

against  the  pirate taxis because,  during  that

time,  it could be said that our entire transport

facilities had come to a stop and that the pirate

taxis then rendered a valuable service. They were

running  in the most reasonable way. For example,

I took three trips-



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> In a pirate taxi?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> One from Robinson Road to

Alexandra  Road, for which I paid 50 cents;  from

Bras  Basah  Road to Serangoon Road,  I  paid  70

cents, and from Changi Market to Changi Point,  I

paid 50 cents. I think it was a wonderful service

to the public during that period. Therefore there

is  a  reason for their existence and they  could

render  a valuable service, of course, at a  time

when we need such services but, of course, we  do

not hope to have a general transport strike every

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also remind the House that the

rural  population always rely on the pirate taxis

for  their transport which hon. Members who  stay

in  town  or  who  have their own  cars  may  not

realise.  Sir,  as an Assemblyman for  the  rural

areas,  I  know quite well that the rural  people

find  it  hard  to  get  a taxi  especially  when

somebody is sick. They rely mostly on the five or

ten  pirate  taxis run by the kampong  folk.  The

operators  of  the pirate taxis are also  kampong

folk   and  they  know  one  another  very  well.

Therefore, when a member of the family  is  sick,

they simply say, "Come on, I need you. Send us to

the  hospital  or  somewhere else."  Therefore  I

would   like  to  put  forward  this  point   for

consideration - that  in  the  rural   areas,   the

existence of pirate taxis in many ways has become

a necessity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, Sir, at present, we have two

types of taxis. One is what we know as taxis now,

and the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>



with  garage  licences and the  letters  on  their

licence  plates.  Although  these  cars  with  the

letters  "SZ" on their licence plates are  private

cars,  the main purpose, as I learned, is to allow

Service personnel to make use of them, but,  as  a

matter  of  fact, these licensed  cars  which  are

supposed to be reserved for Service personnel  are

usually  used  by  the public as well.  Therefore,

since   the  Service  personnel  have  a   special

privilege, why can we not consider another  system

for  the service of the rural residents too?  Poor

people  mostly  stay in the rural areas  and  they

have no cars. They need a quick and cheap means of

transport  and  the pirate taxis  can  serve  that

purpose. So if we have taxis with the letters "SZ"

on  their  licence plates, why can we  not  create

another  class  of transport to be made  available

for  the  rural  folk in the most  convenient  and

economical  way? We can register all those  pirate

taxis running in the rural areas, especially those

stationed  in kampongs, reduce the fare  and  also

reduce  some  of  the  so-called  checks  on   the

vehicles, like a change of vehicles after three or

five  years,  and  so on, which the  rural  people

cannot  afford. So my suggestion is that we should

give  consideration to the rural area pirate taxi-runners  and  try  to find a  way  to  settle  the

problem  in the light of a long-term policy.  They

know  that they are breaking the law and they know

that they will be punished if they are caught  but

they are forced to do so because of unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to touch upon is that as

soon  as this Bill has been passed - it is now going

through  its Second Reading and I am sure that  it

will pass its Third Reading - new and unlimited taxi

licences  will be issued. Sir, although I  do  not

agree  with  the views contained in  an  anonymous

letter  which I received since I pressed  for  the

setting   up   of   an   Anti-Corruption   Inquiry

Commission,  I  received several complaints  about

the issue of new taxi licences. To demonstrate the

true  democratic spirit, limitation in the  number

of taxi licences to be issued should be decided by

the taxi-drivers themselves. Public opinion is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>



now  divided.  Some say that the taxi-drivers  are

fighting  very  hard against the  delimitation  of

taxi  licences. Others say, "No, that is not true.

They  are  only influenced by a few remnants  with

the  support of capitalists. They sell  their  own

taxis  and  now  they want to try and  make  their

money  back." So there is a controversy about  the

issue  of  new  taxi  licences.  Why  cannot   the

Government  take  a stand to call  all  registered

taxi  licensees  to attend a meeting  and  take  a

decision?  That is the easiest and most democratic

way.  Some of the registered licensed taxi-drivers

want  more taxi licences to be issued. Others say,

"No,  we do not want that. At present, we find  it

very  hard to make enough money." My suggestion  I

think,  will  clear up a lot of misunderstandings,

rumours, allegations of corrupt practice,  and  so

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a legislator, I am bound by duty to

support  the  Bill  to  allow  the  Government  to

institute  law  and order but, as a representative

of  the  rural people, I hope that the  Government

will  consider  the  few  points  I  have  raised,

especially  the  issue  of new  licences  and  the

calling  of  a general meeting of all taxi-drivers

to take a decision democratically.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  have  a  small point to mention.  If  the

Government  were to agree to allow  these  alleged

pirate taxis to be licensed as legal taxis,  there

naturally  will  be  periodical  examination   for

mechanical defects. What I would wish to plead  is

that when they hold the examination, it should not

be spiteful.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of all the

speeches  I  have  heard  in  this  Assembly  this

afternoon, there was one which was one of the most

ambiguous  speeches  ever  made.  The  Member  for

Changi  (Mr  Lim Cher Kheng) claims  that  he  is

fully aware that pirate taxis are illegal and  yet

he  encourages  the  running of  pirate  taxis.  I

really cannot understand it. In one instance-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I

have  not said that I supported the pirate taxis.

I  only  wish  the Government would consider  the

creation of another class of licensed taxis.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. It is

a point of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am fully conscious he did

not say that he supported the pirate taxis but  I

said  that  he encouraged the running  of  pirate

taxis. In the first instance, when he opened  his

speech,  he said that he supported this Bill  and

he  went on further to say that this pirate  taxi

trade  was  of benefit to the people  because  it

provided  cheaper  fares. As  a  Member  of  this

Assembly, he is fully aware that pirate taxis are

illegal,  but  he  himself has travelled  in  and

encouraged the running of pirate taxis. I  cannot

really  understand, Sir. It is not a question  of

whether  you get cheaper fares or whether  it  is

convenient  or inconvenient to get  a  taxi.  The

question is one of law and we must, as Members of

this  Assembly,  stick to  the  law.  He  himself

claims to be a legislator of all legislation  and

yet  he  comes to this Assembly to say, "I  think

that  it is beneficial to the public and that  we

should co-operate with them." The thing is  this.

In  asking the Government to create another class

of  taxis, I think the Member is fully aware that

there  is already another class under the  serial

of  "SZ" and if anybody wants to run pirate taxis

legally,  he  could  apply to  the  Registrar  of

Vehicles  for that serial of "SZ".  There  is  no

question of any limitation on "SZ" at all. I  can

not understand that a man who claims himself as a

legislator could come here and speak otherwise.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry

that the Member for Serangoon is not in the House

at  this moment. He told us that the pirate taxis

were  created because of the bad transport system

prevailing  in Singapore and he said, "This  evil

is  due to the reason that the Government is slow

in  making public transport efficient." Sir, I am

inclined to use certain words



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1982</b></font><br><br>



which  I am afraid you will not permit me to  use

but  I  must say that this statement is far  from

the  truth.  Firstly, up to  very  recently,  the

public transport system was not under the control

of  the Government at all. It was entirely  under

the  control of the City Council - a City  Council

dominated by the Liberal-Socialist Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Of course. Pirate taxis are

not  only the result of the bad transport  system

of  Singapore. Pirate taxis are the result of the

policy of a Liberal-Socialist City Council  which

kept the vested interests of those who held taxis

of  paramount importance against the needs of the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this city has grown in population and in

size.  Suburbs have been developed and  therefore

the  need  for  more taxis has been apparent  for

many, many years and yet we find the City Council

carrying  out  a  running battle, preventing  the

Labour  Front  from carrying out  its  policy  of

delimitation of taxis. "The limit should be 1,560

and  no more" and that limit was there for  years

and years in spite of the city increasing in size

and  in  boundary! Sir, the Labour  Front  had  a

tough  time in the City Council to carry  through

its  policy  of delimitation of taxis.  There  is

such a thing as the law of supply and demand  and

the  demand  was  there for more  taxis  but  the

Liberal-Socialists in the City Council refused to

satisfy  the demand so that the vested  interests

could continue their exploitation. Yet we hear of

glib   talk  of  Government  not  making   public

transport  efficient - the public transport  which

was  under  their  control  all  the  time  until

Government  thought  it  wise  to  take  it  over

recently!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes the plea, "Unemployment is another

cause  for  these poor people who go  out  taking

pirate  taxis to earn a living." Why can you  not

legalise  it?  Why do you stand  in  the  way  of

legalizing  it?  Let them have them  as  licensed

taxis.  They will be willing to go and get  their

licences.  But  no,  you want  to  keep  them  as

illegal operators.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No, Sir. Not you but the

Liberal-Socialists in the City Council. I am

sorry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we have the "champion" of the poor

pirate  taxi  operator asking for grace  in  order

that he should be able to find an alternative job.

Why is there any need for the operator of a pirate

taxi  to find an alternative job? He could go  and

get   his   taxi  licence  if  only  the  Liberal-Socialists in the City Council would permit him to

do so by saying, "We are not asking for new taxis.

We  will relax and let the old taxis be licensed."

It  is  entirely  a  matter for the  City  Council

whether  they  want  to permit  new  taxis  to  be

licensed only or whether they would allow old cars

to  be  licensed  with certain modifications.  But

they would not; and yet Government is going to  be

blamed for it!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang (Mr Goh Tong

Liang)  said, "Examination of taxis should not  be

spiteful."  I  wish  he would  tell  that  to  the

Liberal-Socialist element in the City Council.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to

correct the last speaker on one point. It is  well

known that the Liberal-Socialists were not against

the  delimitation  in  the  number  of  taxis   in

principle  but  they said that  such  delimitation

should  not  take place until amending legislation

to  control pirate taxis was introduced. The  fact

that  this Bill is before us now is a victory  for

the  Liberal-Socialist policy over the stubborness

of the Government.

way  in which the debate has gone. I do not  think

that there is very much I have to say in reply but

I  was  very  glad  to notice that  although  they

expressed  themselves  in  different  ways,  as  I

understood them, all those who spoke on the  other

side seemed to support this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two matters which I should like to

correct. It seemed to me that both the Member  for

Serangoon  and  the Member for Bukit  Panjang  are

under  the impression that the licensing of  taxis

has  got  something to do with the Government.  It

has  nothing to do with the Government at all.  It

is  a  matter for the Registrar and for  the  City

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final observation which I would like to make

is  that  I was astonished to hear the Member  for

Serangoon talk about the Government's intention to

delimit  taxis. Surely, he knows that  this  it  a

matter  which  has  been dealt with  by  the  City

Council, that it is a matter for the City  Council

and that steps have already been taken by the City

Council  to  delimit the number of vehicles  which

may be licensed.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have His

Excellency's recommendation and consent to proceed  with

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second  time."  As pointed out in the Explanatory  Note,

the  purpose of this Bill is to enable part-time members

of  the Singapore Military Forces to be used on internal

security  measures. The need to use them  to  supplement

the  police and regular military units has been felt for

some time. We are conscious of the need to fully utilise

our  resources  in  internal security  measures.  I  may

mention,  Sir, that in October last year, for  instance,

many  members of the Singapore Military Forces including

National  Servicemen  offered  their  services  in   any

capacity  in which they could be of use to the authority

in restoring law and order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Singapore Military Forces Ordinance,

however,  only three types of service, are provided  for

part-time  members,  namely,  Colour  Training  Service,

Reserve Service and Mobilised Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not usually be practical nor desirable to

take the major step of mobilising the Singapore Military

Forces in whole or in part to deal with civil disorders.

On the other hand, their employment on internal security

duties would not be covered by either Colour Training or

Reserve Service as defined



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>



under  the  Ordinance.  Their use on  internal  security

duties  would therefore raise consequential difficulties

over their legal status in carrying out their duties and

over compensation for any injury sustained. The only way

to get over these difficulties is to amend the Singapore

Military Forces Ordinance and this is what clauses 3 and

4 of this amending Bill seek to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 14 of the Ordinance to allow

part-time  members  to  be used  for  internal  security

duties  when called upon by order of the General Officer

Commanding,  Singapore  Base District,  under  whom  the

Singapore Military Forces operate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 34 of the principal Ordinance.

The  effect  of  these amendments to section  34  is  to

provide  for  the  pay of members employed  on  internal

security duties, and the intention is that men so called

out  would be paid the rates of pay they now receive  on

continuous  training. In the case of  death  or  injury,

pensions and gratuities would be paid at the same  rates

as  if  they were called out on actual service, that  is

mobilised service, both to the men themselves and/or  to

their  dependants. Provision for this has  already  been

laid  down in the rules governing the Singapore Military

Forces, namely, the Singapore Military Forces (Pensions,

Gratuities and Other Grants) Rules, 1954.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as stated in the Explanatory Note, the

opportunity  has also been taken to substitute  for  the

references  to the Army Act in the principal  Ordinance,

references  to  the  Army Act,  1955.  This  has  arisen

because  a  new Army Act came into force on 1st  January

this  year  and  the old Act lapsed at  the  same  time.

Clauses  2  and  5 of the Bill merely provide  for  this

substitution and nothing more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill which enables part-time members of the

Singapore  Military Forces to be used when necessary  on

internal  security duties in support of the  police  and

regular  military units is a further indication  of  the

Government's intention and determination to maintain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>



law  and  order in Singapore which is  so  vitally

necessary for the Island's well-being. The use  of

part-time members of the Singapore Military Forces

in  addition to the regular Battalion, which  when

ready  will  be  available if  needed  to  provide

support   for  the  Police  on  internal  security

duties,  shows  also  that in our  early  approach

towards  internal self-government,  we  are  fully

conscious  of  the need to utilise fully  our  own

resources in the matter of internal security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, however, Sir, that the occasion will

never  arise  in  the  future in  Singapore,  when

circumstances are such that we will  have  to  use

part-time members of the Singapore Military Forces

to  supplement  the  police and  regular  military

units,  but that does not mean that we should  not

take all adequate steps to meet any eventuality. I

am  sure, Sir, that for the reasons which  I  have

given,  this  Bill will have the  support  of  the

Assembly. I beg to move.

recommendation  and consent to proceed  with  this

Bill.  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is similar in nature to the Singapore

Military Forces (Amendment) Ordinance, 1957, which

has  just  been  passed by the Assembly.  It  also

makes  enabling  provision  for  members  of   the

Malayan Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve to be called

out  to  assist in internal security duties.  Like

their  brothers in the Singapore Military  Forces,

members  of  the  Malayan  Royal  Naval  Volunteer

Reserve,  who are composed entirely of volunteers,

are  also desirous to play their part in times  of

civil disorders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, however, the Malayan Royal Naval

Volunteer  Reserve  Ordinance  (Cap.  78  of   the

Revised  Edition) provides for only two  types  of

service,  namely,  service  when  attached  to  or

otherwise  acting  as part of or  with  the  Royal

Navy,  and  actual service (which means  mobilised

service),  neither of which covers the eventuality

in  mind.  It is not practicable nor desirable  to

order   a  general  mobilisation  of  this   force

following the proclamation of a state of emergency

merely  in  order  to employ members  on  internal

security  duties. Clause 2 of the  Bill  therefore

amends  section 10 of the principal  Ordinance  to

provide for their being called out during



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1989</b></font><br><br>



civil disorders by an order of the Flag Officer,

Malayan Area, under whom the Malayan Royal Naval

Volunteer Reserve operates, and when so called

out, will be subject to the Naval Discipline

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like in the previous Ordinance just

passed, this Bill also provides for the  pay  of

members  employed on internal security measures,

and the intention is that they be paid according

to   the  rates  of  pay  they  now  receive  on

continuous  training. In the case  of  death  or

injury,  this Bill also provides for payment  of

compensation  at the same rates  as  for  actual

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the remarks I made on the previous Bill

about the maintenance of law and order and the

need to utilise our own resources equally apply

here, and therefore there is no need for me to

repeat them. Sir, I beg to move.

and  the  Malayan Royal Naval Volunteer  Reserve

without  having  to  be  called  out  on  actual

service   under  section  17  of  the  principal

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of this amending Bill now provides for

their being called out during civil disorders by

an  order  of  the  Air Officer Commanding,  and

clause  4  provides that when  called  out  they

shall be subject, for disciplinary purposes,  to

the  Air Force Act. Clause 5 of the Bill enables

rules  to  be  made  to  provide  for  pay   and

allowances,  and the intention is  to  prescribe

the same rates of pay and allowances for service

on   internal  security  duties   as   are   now

prescribed for continuous training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal Ordinance already provides for

rules  governing  the payment  of  pensions  and

gratuities in the event of death or injury,  and

when  the Bill becomes law, steps will be  taken

to   make   rules  prescribing  the   rates   of

compensation payable in the event of  injury  or

death of a member of the force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as also stated in the Explanatory Note,

the opportunity is also being taken, in clause 2

of this amending Bill,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1991</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to move the motion standing in my name

which reads,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly urges upon the Government to

set  up  a  committee without delay to review  the

provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance (Cap.  166)

with a view to recommending such amendments to the

Ordinance  as  to  suit  local  conditions,   with

particular reference to personal reliefs  to  aged

parents and other close relatives solely dependent

on the taxpayer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1993</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the last sitting of the

Assembly  on  24th April, in reply to my  question

regarding  amendments  to grant  personal  reliefs

under  the  Income  Tax Ordinance,  the  Hon. the

Acting Financial Secretary had this to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, a proposal of this nature requires

consideration on a pan-Malayan basis. This is  one

of the many questions that are constantly engaging

my  attention. I am sure the hon. Member will  not

wish  me to anticipate any statement that I  might

wish to make at a future date."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Sir, I did not press for an

anticipated statement because I fully realised the

complicated nature of the consultations  with  the

Government  of  the Federation of  Malaya,  but  I

asked  whether  there had been  any  consultations

with  that Government and the reply was,  "I  have

nothing more to add."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really surprises me, Sir, that in spite of

the  admission  by  the Hon. the Acting  Financial

Secretary   that  this  matter  has  engaged   his

attention for some time, no attempt had been  made

to  negotiate or commence consultations  with  the

Government of the Federation of Malaya. The answer

given  last month was most unsatisfactory and  has

prompted  me  to table my motion today  because  I

realise  that filing in more questions will  serve

no  useful purpose. If I had not put in my  motion

today,  I am quite certain that, at the expiry  of

the   term  of  office  of  the  Government,   the

Ordinance will remain what it is today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows, Sir, that Government, including

the  Hon. the Financial Secretary, is fully  aware

of  the anomalies in the Income Tax Ordinance, yet

it  has taken no action on the matter. Why has  it

adopted a tida apa attitude? I believe, Sir,  that

the  most probable reason is that most of them are

now Ministers drawing fat salaries and do not mind

being taxed at all, whatever the amount may be.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Shame! Real shame! A few

months  ago,  Sir, the Labour Front,  through  its

General Secretary, Mr Tang Peng Yeu, made a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>



public announcement that it was going to call upon

the  Government to set up a committee on the  same

principle as set out in my motion, but right up to

today  nothing  more  has  been  heard.  What  has

happened?  I  do  not know. Nobody  has  made  any

further  announcement.  I think,  from  a  further

announcement  by the General Secretary,  that  the

proposal  has  died a natural death.  I  will  not

comment  on what that statement was. I  hope  that

the Hon. the Chief Minister or the Chairman of the

Labour  Front  will  be  able  to  explain  better

because  I am not in the Front and I do  not  know

what its activities are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the delay in amending the Income Tax

Ordinance is causing great concern to the  public.

Singapore   is   an   Asian   country   and   with

Malayanisation  in progress, I believe  that  this

Island  will  be fully Asianised (not Malayanised)

in  five to ten years' time. If that be the  case,

Sir, let us adopt the Asian way and attitude;  let

us  frame our legislation on the same principle - in

the Asian way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This delay in amending the Ordinance has

prompted  the formation of a new body  called  the

Income  Taxpayers' Association. The  anomalies  in

the  Ordinance  and the tida apa attitude  of  the

Government has prompted this Association to send a

memorandum to the Government. I have a  copy  with

me.  I  am happy the memorandum has been submitted

as  it  will  save me from making a  long  speech.

Without it, I might have had to elaborate  on  the

technicalities  or details of the  Ordinance.  The

points which I intend to raise this afternoon  are

almost  identical  with  those  contained  in  the

memorandum,  so  there  is  no  need  for  me   to

elaborate my motion much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Ordinance, Sir, gives a lot of power

to  the  Comptroller of Income  Tax,  but  to  the

taxpayer there is no way out at all. There  is  no

privilege at all for him. He is oppressed. Even if

he  should submit an appeal, it will serve him  no

good.   I   will  quote,  Sir,  what  the   Income

Taxpayers' Association has said about appeals:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the case of an appeal, the appellant is

required to furnish a statement of the grounds  of

appeal,  and  he  is not allowed to  rely  on  any

ground other than those in the statement save with

the consent of the Board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>



of  Review. This cannot but operate to the detriment  of

the  appellant  as where the grounds are  divulged,  the

Comptroller  is allowed time to prepare his defence  and

put  forth counter-proposals without the former  knowing

what those proposals are. In addition, when we take into

account  the  fact that the taxpayer is not  allowed  to

rely  on  any grounds for appeal besides those contained

in  the statement, it is felt that the Ordinance is one-sided.  The  burden  of proving that  an  assessment  is

excessive is onerous enough without these provisions. We

suggest  that the words 'a statement of the  grounds  of

appeal'  in  section 75 (1) (b) together with subsection

(6) of section 75 should be deleted."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the Association had to say. Apart from

the  fact  that an appeal will serve no useful  purpose,

the present personal reliefs granted to the taxpayer are

far from adequate. It has been stated again and again in

this   Assembly   by   many  Members,   Government   and

Opposition,  that the reliefs are very, very inadequate.

The  present reliefs are for the wife and children only.

But what about parents? Oh, do not mind them at all! The

Hon. the Chief Minister himself is an Asian and I think

he  knows  that he has the responsibility of maintaining

his parents if they are unemployed. If such be the case,

why  forget  about  such reliefs in the  Ordinance?  Two

years  have passed, yet nothing has been done. It is  an

unsatisfactory  Ordinance which provides  only  for  the

wife and children but nobody else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote again from the letter of the Taxpayers'

Association, on the matter of reliefs:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Child allowance - Section 35 (2) (d) provides allowance

for children whether legitimate or adopted maintained by

the  taxpayer,  but  it is too often that  the  taxpayer

brings up his younger brother or sister, or the children

of  his  Sister or brother who is destitute or deceased.

He may also have to support his aged parents who have no

income  of  their  own, as is the custom  in  the  East.

Allowance  for these dependants should be deducted  from

the  income of the taxpayer before it is subject to tax.

For instance, in the United Kingdom [United Kingdom,  it

says,  Sir] apart from personal allowance of �440  to  a

single  person or �240 for a married man in addition  to

two-ninths of the net earned income, a maximum  of  �450

for the following allowances are allowed:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) Dependant relatives: �60, if a taxpayer maintains

a  relative of himself or his wife. Children:  �100  for

each  child, stepchild or adopted child under 16  years.

House-keeper or person looking after children:  �60  for

widow or widower with female



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>



relative   or   house-keeper  looking  after   children.

Unmarried  men  with  widowed mother,  or  husband  with

incapacitated wife, daughters' service: �40 if  daughter

is  maintained by and lives with taxpayer because he  or

his wife is infirm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are innumerable cases which have come to our

notice why, by reason of the execution of the father  by

the  Japanese or his death during the enemy  occupation,

his children are being supported by other relatives.  It

is  formally recommended that consideration be given  to

the  amendment of section 35 (2) (d) to provide for  the

deductions  to  be allowed in respect of such  dependant

relatives or child."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you see from what the Taxpayers' Association

writes  that  even in the United Kingdom allowances  are

provided  for  the  father, mother, children  and  close

relatives of the taxpayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My motion, Sir, does not seek to ask the Government to

amend  the Ordinance straightaway. What it calls for  is

the  setting up of a committee to review the Income  Tax

Ordinance  with  a  view to granting  reliefs  for  aged

parents  and  close relatives. I am fully aware  of  the

complications which that may involve. As  the  Hon. the

Acting  Financial Secretary has said, he has to  consult

the Government of the Federation of Malaya before he can

amend the Ordinance. What I want now, Sir, is to have  a

committee  set up to review the Ordinance and report  to

Government.  With  that report, the Government  can  hold

consultations  with  the  Federation  and  see   whether

amendments   can  be  made  to  suit  both  territories.

Therefore,  I  hope, Sir, that both sides of  the  House

will accept my motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I end, Sir, may I make it clear that by

"committee"  I  do not mean a select committee  of  this

Assembly,  but one set up by Government of experts  such

as accountants and economists who can really go into the

Income  Tax Ordinance and make recommendations. A select

committee  of this Assembly will not serve much  purpose

as  I can see very few accountants here; apart from  the

Hon. the  Acting Financial Secretary, I  do  not  think

anyone  else here can claim to be an expert on  figures.

So  I  do  hope,  Sir, that my motion will  receive  the

unanimous support of the Assembly. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the motion moved by

the Member for Queenstown. Income tax, Sir, is  in

force in Singapore and it is the same method as in

the  United  Kingdom. I have here  a  circular  to

claim  for repayment of United Kingdom taxes given

to  me  by  a Britisher who is affected  by  this.

Refer to clause 13. Sir, there, if you maintain  a

relative   of  yourself  or  your  wife   who   is

incapacitated by old age or infirmity, or  if  you

maintain  your  widowed  mother  or  your   wife's

widowed mother, although she may not be incapable,

you  can claim an allowance of �60 for each person

so maintained. This allowance, however, is reduced

by one pound for every pound of the relative's own

income   excluding  voluntary  contributions   and

income specifically exempted from income tax  such

as  unemployment benefit and national  assistance.

The  maximum allowance is �105; if the  income  is

�160 or more, there is no allowance. In Singapore,

we do not have national assistance or unemployment

benefit, but I see no reason why the allowance for

maintaining  relatives  granted  in   the   United

Kingdom  cannot  be introduced into  this  Colony,

where  the taxpayer usually has several dependants

to support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, I would like to quote the case of

a  bachelor.  His  present personal  allowance  is

$3,000   per  annum  or  $250  a  month.  If   the

additional benefit of �105 is given, at  the  rate

of $8.50 to a pound we get $892.50, making a total

allowance  of $3,892.50 per annum or  $324.38  per

month.  A  bachelor in Singapore  earning  $320  a

month  with one dependant therefore need  not  pay

income   tax.  If  he  has  two  dependants,   his

allowance  will  be  $892.50  multiplied  by  two,

giving  $1,985,  plus $3,000, making  a  total  of

$4,985 per annum or $415.45 per month, under which

figure he need not pay tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of married couples, Sir, the husband

is  now entitled to $3,000 and the wife to $2,500,

making  a  total  of  $5,500.  If  they  have  one

dependant,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>



the  proposed  benefit will mean an  allowance  of

$892.50, making it $6,392.50 per annum or  $532.75

per  month.  Married  couples  earning  $530  will

therefore not be liable to tax if we introduce the

extra  benefit. If they have two dependants, their

allowances  will total $5,500 plus $1,985,  making

$7,485  per  annum or $623.75 per  month.  Couples

drawing $620 a month will therefore not be  liable

to pay tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known, Sir, that we Asians living in

this  country  have to support parents  and  other

dependants  on  account of filial love,  which  is

known to the world. I am not challenging the  Hon.

the  Acting  Financial Secretary but, speaking  on

behalf  of the people of Singapore, who are mostly

wage-earners,  I  ask the Government  to  consider

introducing this benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this amendment is merely to

widen  the scope of the motion and not, of course,

to  conflict  with it. I think  that  I  have  the

acceptance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>



by   the  hon.  Member  for  Queenstown  of   this

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion then, as amended, is a simple one - that

this  House  is of the opinion that an independent

committee be set up to look into the operation  of

the    present    Income   Tax   Ordinance,    its

inconsistencies,  anomalies and  injustices.  Sir,

this  Ordinance  has been in operation  for  about

nine years. During all this time there has been no

thorough  examination of the way in which  it  has

been operated. There has been no consideration  by

an  independent body as to how far this  Ordinance

has   been   adapted  to  suit  the  customs   and

traditions  of a multi-racial population,  and  to

suit   the   particular   needs   and   conditions

prevailing  on  a  small island  depending  almost

solely   on  trade  for  its  existence.  Let   me

therefore  give  some examples  of  the  questions

which deserve close and careful examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first example is that of errors or mistakes in

assessments and returns. The taxpayer has only  30

days in which to lodge a valid objection or appeal

against   an   assessment  before  the  assessment

becomes  final and conclusive. On the other  hand,

the  Income  Tax  Department can raise  additional

assessments under section 73 (1) of the  Ordinance

at any time within six years. In other words, if a

taxpayer  has made a genuine error or  mistake  in

his  return,  after 30 days he  has  no  means  of

correcting  his error, and the Department  is  not

obliged to reopen and amend his assessment. But if

the Department makes a mistake, it can rectify the

assessment  at  any time up to six years.  It  has

been  said  that  the Department  is  prepared  to

reopen  assessments in cases of genuine errors  by

taxpayers, but the public of Singapore is entitled

to  written  safeguards  so  that  the  Department

cannot change its policy at any time according  to

its  fancy, and so that there can be no  suspicion

of   discrimination  between  one   taxpayer   and

another.  In  the  United  Kingdom  Act  of  1952,

section  66 allows relief in respect of  error  or

mistake at any time not later than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>



six years after the end of the year of assessment.

Here is an injustice limited to Singapore and  the

Federation   which   quite  clearly   requires   a

committee of enquiry to look into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is then the question of personal

reliefs  on  which the Members for Queenstown  and

Kampong Kapor have already touched, and I  do  not

want  to  repeat  their  arguments.  Nevertheless,

there  are  three points which should be  subjects

for  consideration. The first is the allowance for

a  wife.  In  the year of marriage, a taxpayer  in

Singapore is assessed, firstly, on his own  income

of  the  previous  year on the normal  basis,  and

secondly, a proportion of the wife's income of the

previous year, but no personal allowance  for  the

wife is granted. While it is true that the wife is

granted  a personal allowance for herself  against

the  balance of her income for that year, it  must

be  pointed out that the combined effect is to tax

total income at a higher rate than normally.  This

is  extremely unjust and this anomaly falls  at  a

time  when  the young couple is most  in  need  of

funds  to  go on their honeymoon or to  set  up  a

home. In brief, the method of assessing the wife's

income is such as to be either a dis-incentive for

married  women  to  work, or an  encouragement  to

living  in sin. Our view is that the wife's earned

income   should   be  subject  to  an   additional

allowance  (it is in the United Kingdom;  why  not

here?) based on a certain percentage of income and

subject  to  a certain maximum, let  us  say,  for

example,  $1,000. This allowance of course  should

be  granted  in the year of marriage, also,  at  a

time when it is most needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, another form of allowance which needs

consideration is an education allowance in respect

of a son or daughter studying at the University of

Malaya.  Allowances are given to parents  who  can

afford  to send children to universities overseas.

Should not an appropriate allowance be allowed  to

parents  who  cannot  even afford  to  send  their

children to our own university?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a committee of enquiry should consider

the question of earned income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>



relief.  From  the  point of view  of  equity,  we

consider that greater relief should be accorded to

a person who earns his income by personal exertion

than  to  a recipient of investment income,  whose

monetary  reward  is not obtained from  productive

effort.  In  other  words,  there  should   be   a

distinction  between  income  from  salaries   and

income  from dividends. I believe, Sir, that  this

matter was considered some years ago shortly after

the  Income Tax Ordinance was introduced,  but  it

was  rejected at that time on the ground that  the

rates  of tax were low and the personal allowances

generous.  Those  grounds, in  our  view,  are  no

longer valid. Firstly, the rates of tax have  been

increased and, secondly, personal allowances which

might have been generous then, are no longer so in

1957 due to increases in the cost of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the subject of dividends,

consideration should be given to the  question  of

making assessable for tax, dividends received from

a  source  outside Malaya by persons  resident  in

Malaya. At present, such dividends are only liable

to Malayan tax if they are exclusively received in

Malaya. It appears wrong, to say the least of  it,

that  persons resident in Malaya may invest  their

money   abroad,  leaving  dividends  or  interests

abroad  and  not  paying Malayan tax.  Since  this

country   needs  money  for  investment   in   new

enterprises,  such a provision may  deter  persons

from investing abroad and induce them to invest in

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it might be considered by

Government  that  these points do  not  merit  the

setting  up of a special independent committee  of

enquiry, that the things which are wrong purely as

a  matter of opinion or policy do not need special

investigation.  But  I will  now  go  into  detail

regarding  a  matter  which is  very,  very  wrong

indeed.  Sir,  at question time on  20th  November

last  year,  the Hon. the Financial Secretary  was

asked to give the figures of the number of persons

who  had  left  the  Colony without  paying  their

income tax, the total amount of income tax due  by

them  and  the break-down for each year since  the

coming into force of the Income Tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance.  The Hon. the Financial Secretary,  who

was Mr Hart at that time, replied:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...since the Income Tax Ordinance came into

force,  1,827 persons have left Singapore  without

paying  their  income tax. The total  amounts  due

from these persons are ... $1,102,007."



<br><br>I  will  not worry you with the details  for  each

year  but  I will ask you to note that the  figure

was  just over $44,000. Now Sir, I have to  submit

to this House that the picture presented to us was

extremely  misleading. When the Hon. the Financial

Secretary  stated  that  1,827  persons  had  left

Singapore without paying their income tax  over  a

period  of eight or nine years, what he meant  was

1,827  persons known to the Income Tax  Department

left  Singapore without paying their  income  tax.

Let  me  give  you  the real  facts.  The  present

practice of the Income Tax Department is, in  view

of  section 10 (1) (b) and section 12 (4)  of  the

Ordinance,  to  consider all  persons  other  than

British  subjects  or  Commonwealth  citizens  who

visit Singapore for business purposes as liable to

tax,  and  liable moreover at the rate of  30  per

cent without the benefit of personal reliefs.  Let

me read to you the relevant sections. These are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Section 10 (1) (b) Income tax shall, subject to

the  provisions of this Ordinance, be  payable  at

the  rate or rates specified hereinafter for  each

year  of assessment upon the income of any  person

accruing in or derived from the Colony or received

in  the  Colony from outside the Colony in respect

of gains or profits from any employment;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Section 12 (4) The gains or profits from any

employment exercised in the Colony shall be deemed

to be derived from the Colony whether the gains or

profits from such employment are received  in  the

Colony or not."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 (4) is the more important of the two

for  it  means that any person visiting  Singapore

for  business reasons for however short a time  is

subject  to  tax even if the income or  salary  he

receives  is  paid to him elsewhere. In  effect  I

should  make  it clear that this applies  to  non-British subjects only because British subjects  or

Commonwealth citizens will be covered, as a  rule,

by double taxation arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let us look at the facts. If we turn

to the 1955 Report of the Income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>



Tax  Department, Abstract B, on page  8,  we

find  that  the number of persons non-resident  in

Malaya  assessed  for tax for  the  year  1955  is

1,786.  Our next enquiry is on the 1955 Report  of

the Immigration Department, Appendix B, which is a

statement of persons arriving in Singapore  during

1955 by sea and air.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Head "Aliens", those other than

British  subjects who come under another head,  we

find  that  the  number of aliens who  arrived  in

Singapore on business visits in 1955 was 6,565. In

addition,  a  further 18,377 visited Singapore  in

transit,  making a total of nearly 25,000 persons.

Now  it  may  be argued that most of those  18,377

were  only  here for a night or two and  were  not

here  for  business reasons, but nevertheless  the

Income Tax Department pursued some of them. I have

known of a case only recently of a businessman who

was  here  in transit for only a couple  of  days,

arriving  by  one plane and waiting  to  leave  by

another, who received a letter from the Department

asking  the  purpose  of  his  visit  and  for   a

statement of his income paid to him in the  United

States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us, however, leave aside the 18,377 transit

visitors  and consider the 6,565 persons  here  on

business.  As  the  income tax figures  show,  the

Department  caught  only 1,786.  In  other  words,

4,779  left Singapore without paying tax in  1955,

whereas the Financial Secretary gave us the figure

of  1,827 persons over a period of nine years.  It

is  clear, therefore, that section 12 (4)  of  the

Ordinance  is  badly enforced, and  a  rule  badly

enforced is worse than no rule at all. Since 6,565

aliens entered the colony for business, presumably

all  should  have paid tax on their income  earned

whilst  in the colony; and yet the 1955 Report  of

the  Income  Tax Department shows that only  1,786

did  so.  In  fact,  it  is well  known  that  the

majority  of these people do not pay.  Only  those

unfortunate  enough to come under the Department's

eye  through  newspaper reports and other  sources

receive   the  usual  demand  for  a  return   and

eventually  for payment of tax. This naturally  is

leading  to  two  results:  firstly,  people   are

deliberately evading tax; and, secondly, Singapore

is losing business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>



and foreign currency as the minority who  are

caught are advising others to by-pass this island.

It  would be the duty of a committee of enquiry to

consider  whether  persons bringing  business  and

wealth to Singapore should be asked to pay 30  per

cent  of  their  earnings over to  the  colony  as

income  tax,  and whether in truth  it  is  not  a

direct  discouragement to the expansion  of  trade

and  industry  in this country which  the  present

Government  professes  to wish  to  encourage.  An

American businessman arrives in Singapore  wishing

to  make business contacts and interested  in  the

possibilities  of building a new  factory  on  the

island.  In  a  misguided moment he expresses  his

intentions  to newspaper reporters at the  airport

and  finds himself the subject of an article on  a

commercial  page  of  the  Straits  Times  or  the

Singapore Standard. What is the first response  he

gets?  A  letter  from the Income  Tax  Department

asking  for  30 per cent of his earned  income - and

his response is to take the next plane out of Paya

Lebar Airport before the Department can catch him,

and with no further interest in building a factory

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, there are many persons coming here

for a short period who cannot afford to pay 30 per

cent  in tax and maintain themselves here  at  the

same time. Indeed it would be pertinent to enquire

from  the Department how much tax on non-residents

has  had to be written off through their inability

to  pay. Let us take the case at random of a Dutch

bank  assistant earning the equivalent of  $800  a

month  in  Holland who comes out from his homeland

to  relieve  a colleague for a few months  who  is

going  on leave. His salary is taxed at a straight

30  per cent, leaving him with $560 per month  and

no  benefit of reliefs or allowances.  If  in  the

United  Kingdom a non-resident is immune from  tax

for  a stay of six months until he becomes defined

as  a  resident, we see a number of reasons to  do

the  same here if businessmen are to be encouraged

to come to this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that I am going to be told that the

Government  cannot afford to lose  the  $2,343,456

which the 1,786 non-residents paid in tax in 1955.

There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>



is,  however,  in  our view, a simple  answer  to  this.

Instead  of spending their energies and their  staff  on

tracking  down  non-residents who bring wealth  to  this

country,   the  Department  should  first   turn   their

attention to those entering the country to reside  here.

Once  again, we turn to the Immigration Department table

giving  the  number of persons who arrived in  Singapore

for residence during 1955, that is, those filling in  an

Immigration  Landing Card. Let us take the  males  only,

leaving out females and children who, in the main,  will

of  course  not be subject to tax. We find  that  16,939

British  subjects  or Commonwealth citizens  and  13,585

aliens entered Singapore, making a total of 30,524 males

who  entered Singapore for the purposes of residence  in

1955, and let it be noted that of this number 8,246  (or

more than one-quarter) were Europeans almost all of whom

would be liable to tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, allowing for those males entering who would not

be  liable  to  tax - and that number is  limited  by  our

immigration  laws - for  those entering  the  colony  from

overseas  more than once during the year, for those  who

have  left the colony, and for those who proceed  direct

to  the Federation, there must be a very fair number  of

taxable   persons  taking  up  residence  in  Singapore.

Whether  the  figure - and it is obviously  not  30,000 - is

20,000 or 10,000 or even 5,000, it is still a large  one

if taken into conjunction with my next point. If we look

at  the Income Tax Department Reports for 1954 and 1955,

we  will  note  that  18,752 resident  individuals  were

assessed in 1954 and 19,340 in 1955, a total increase of

only  588.  Is it conceivable that the number of  30,000

entries  can  be whittled down as low as that,  and  you

must  in any case allow for an increase in old Singapore

residents becoming subject to tax?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here then is the position. New residents are coming

into  the  country  at the rate of thousands  per  year,

whereas the increase in the number being assessed  is  a

few  hundred  per  year.  I  must  confess  that  I  was

staggered when I examined these figures, and I hope  the

Government will be shocked into the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>



realisation that there must be evasion on a large scale,

and that our request to the Government from this side of

the House for the setting up of an independent committee

is  thoroughly  justified.  Indeed  there  seems  to  be

sufficient  evidence to suggest that the  tax  clearance

scheme  before  people  leave  the  country  should   be

considered,  as  it  is  adopted  in  Australia  or  New

Zealand.  Consideration needs to be given as to  whether

the Income Tax Department is using or is being allowed to

use   all   possible   legitimate  ways   of   obtaining

information.  There seems to be a case  for  considering

whether section 64 of the Ordinance empowering heads  of

firms  to send in a list of employees liable to  tax  is

enough when one knows the numbers of representatives  of

overseas firms residing here who have no heads of  firms

here sending in those returns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget debate last November the Financial

Secretary said, "I consider that the Department has done

and  is  doing  a splendid job." In the  face  of  these

figures, we beg to differ. If there has been an  excuse,

it  has always been that of a lack of experienced  staff

and  trained  income tax officers. In our view,  if  the

existing staff - and it is a hard-working staff - were taken

off  the  job of chasing non-residents who stay in  this

country for three days and turned their attention to the

detection of new residents through more street  surveys,

the  Income  Tax Department would be more respected  and

more revenue would flow to our coffers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have said enough to convince the

Government  that  this present situation  is  thoroughly

unsatisfactory  and  that  the  time  has  come  for  an

independent  enquiry into the operation of an  Ordinance

which was drafted in something of a hurry just after the

war  and  has not been given a thorough enough  scrutiny

and  attention. I congratulate the Member for Queenstown

for  introducing  this motion. We on this  side  of  the

House  are  fully  in support of it,  coupled  with  the

amendment which I have moved and which merely widens its

scope. Sir, I beg to move.

are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Statements of accounts;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the working of the Income Tax Department and

the  collection of tax could be covered in any  of

these  12  items, so I do not see much purpose  in

moving the amendment. The Member for Tanglin  said

that  I  agreed originally. Sir, I have agreed  to

the  submission of the amendment, but I  have  not

committed  myself by saying that I will  agree  to

accept  the amendment. I do not think I  have  any

right  to stop any hon. Member from submitting  an

amendment, but it is my right to vote according to

my  conscience  and whether I support  or  do  not

support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difference that I can see is the word

"independent" appearing in the amendment.  It  has

the  words  "independent  committee",  whereas  my

motion has the word "committee" only. Sir, in  the

last  part  of my speech, I think I made  it  very

clear  that the word "committee" does not  mean  a

Select  Committee  of  this  Assembly.  The   word

"committee" means an independent committee  to  be

set  up  by the Government composed of independent

individuals who are experts in the Income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>



Tax  Ordinance  and know the working of the  Income  Tax

Department. So I do not see much purpose in  moving  the

amendment.  To do so is just to overshadow the  original

motion,  and as the Member for Kampong Kapor has rightly

said,  it becomes a clash of Parties. I think this House

is  more prepared to accept a motion in the name  of  an

Independent where no Party inclinations are involved. In

the circumstances. Sir, I do not agree to the amendment.



<br><br>4.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, so far Members

of the Opposition have had the floor. The Government had

in mind to accept the original motion, but since then it

has  been  amended by the Member for Tanglin.  What  the

hon.  Member seeks to achieve by his amendment  is  that

the  Government should appoint an independent committee.

To   that  extent,  Sir,  the  Government  opposes   the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxation policy is the sole responsibility of the

government  of  the  day, and it  cannot  relegate  this

responsibility  to any independent body. Any  government

of  the day should be brave enough to state its taxation

policy   and  stand  up  to  any  criticism  which   the

Opposition Members may bring up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess that I am greatly interested in the

various points raised by the Member for Tanglin  in  his

speech.  I have not yet had time to consult my colleague

the  Financial Secretary,

but I can say this: that  some

of  the  points raised by the hon. Member  have  already

been occupying the attention of the Financial Secretary,

and  I  give the hon. Member the assurance that all  the

points he has raised will be thoroughly investigated.  I

know  he  is just as anxious as the Government  that  we

should  improve the Income Tax Ordinance so as to ensure

better   collection  and  greater  revenue.  Since   the

question of dependant allowances was brought up  at  the

last  Budget  debate,  the Government  has  been  giving

serious consideration to it. Last month-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Chief Minister confine

himself to the amendment?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, in moving his

amendment the Member for Tanglin did touch on the

subject of family allowance, and this is in reply to

what he said.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The position is that the mover of the

amendment spoke to the original Question which of course

includes  the question of allowances. Having done  that,

he  moved his amendment and any Member who speaks on the

amendment will have to confine himself to it.  Later  on

if  the amendment is lost, or even carried, the original

Question,  or  the original Question as  amended,  comes

back to the Assembly and then hon. Members can speak  on

that  aspect  of  the motion. The Chief Minister  has  a

second chance to speak, in other words.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought of

just speaking once on this amendment and when it came to

the  motion, I did not wish to speak again because I did

not  think  it was necessary to repeat what I  had  said

when speaking on the amendment.



<br><br>4.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, listening to the

arguments  against the amendment to the motion,  I  feel

that  Members in this House sometimes do not  understand

what  is  right  or what is wrong. It is  not  important

whether  a  motion  is moved by a  Party  Member  or  an

Independent Member. If the motion, or the amendment,  is

right,  then we must accept it, no matter from whichever

quarter  it  comes  from.  If it  should  come  from  an

Independent,  well  and good, he  should  be  given  the

credit. If it should come from the Government, well  and

good,  we can say that the Government knows the feelings

of  the  people. If it comes from another Party  in  the

Opposition  and that Party is genuinely for  the  people

and  voicing the opinion of the people that there  is  a

real  need  for such a motion or an amendment,  then  it

should  be accepted. Nothing should be said that because

it  comes  from  this  quarter, it should  be  rejected,

because   then   it  boils  down  to   a   question   of

personalities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of elucidation, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the

Government  has  not  stated  that,  because   the

amendment  has  been  moved by  a  Member  of  the

Opposition,  it  is  opposing it.  The  Government

opposes  it on the ground that it cannot  relegate

its  responsibility  in  so  far  as  taxation  is

concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Certainly, we will come to

that point. Sir. It so happens that the Member who

spoke  in that trend comes from the Opposition.  I

think  that if Singapore is going to progress,  it

should be on a basis of what is right and not  who

is right. Therefore on a question of this sort,  I

cannot  agree  with the Member for  Kampong  Kapor

(Mr. Seah Peng Chuan) or the Member for Queenstown

(Mr.  Lee  Choon  Eng)  for  putting  forward  the

statement  that it comes from a certain Party  and

that  therefore it should not be accepted. On  the

other  hand, Sir, the Government says that  it  is

its  duty  to  see  that its  taxation  policy  is

defended  and that it will defend it to  the  very

end. I would like to ask one question, Sir. If the

policy were wrong, inhuman and undemocratic, would

the  Government still defend it because  it  is  a

Government measure?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister mentioned, Sir, that

he  is accepting the original motion. What is  the

difference between the one and the other? Is there

a   great   deal  of  difference?  An  independent

committee,  Sir, I believe, is the best  committee

to  investigate into such affairs.  It  is  not  a

committee empowered with operating the law. It  is

not a committee empowered with collecting the tax.

That  committee, Sir, so far as tax collection  is

concerned, has only advisory power, to advise  the

Government on the change of the Schedule. It does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>



not infringe upon the powers of the Government.  I

am  certain, Sir, that this Labour Front Coalition

Government has appointed many committees. Many  of

its   committees,  it  is  said,  are  independent

committees. It has its committees to help  in  its

education  policy  and in all sorts  of  policies.

Would  the Government say that it is handing  over

power  to these various committees and that  these

various  committees  are running  the  Government?

Would  it say that it would not accept the  advice

of  these committees? On the contrary, I find that

whenever  an  attack  is made on  the  Government,

invariably it hides behind all such committees  by

saying,  "This has been recommended by the Hawkins

Committee. This has been recommended by  the  All-Party Committee. This has been recommended by  all

sorts  of  Committees." But when it comes  to  the

appointment  of  an independent Tax  Committee  to

advise  Government on the whole  matter,  it  says

that it cannot give the power to such a Committee.

Where  is  the  logic of this? It applies  in  one

case;  it does not apply in another case. I cannot

understand  the  attitude of the Government.  What

the   Government  should  do  is  to  express  its

gratitude for the assistance of the Opposition  in

bringing   to   its   notice   all   the   various

shortcomings  of  a department in  helping  it  to

collect  more  tax. After all, the  Government  is

spending  more  than what it earns,  and  if  this

state of affairs carries on with more spending and

less   saving,  Singapore  will  one  day   become

insolvent.  Somebody  comes  along  to  help   the

Government  and  this is the  way  the  Government

receives  it! It rather reminds me of rendering  a

good  act  and  in  return being  back-bitten  for

offering that help. This is setting a bad  example

for people to follow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague has voiced his opinion of the

various  ways in which the Government can  collect

more  tax.  My colleague has said that  there  had

been  a  large number of people who had made money

in  Singapore  and then left for their  homelands.

These  are  the expatriate officers I  expect  and

people  who  come from investing countries  making

their pile and then going away from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>



this country. In fact, I almost feel that the Member for

Tanglin is voicing something that the Government usually

would  not believe, he himself being of European extract

and  the voicing of such a sentiment for the benefit  of

Singapore is really a credit to my colleague, the Member

for  Tanglin. The Government cannot deny that there  are

such tax evasions and the number of such people involved

is  not  too  many - a few thousand people  perhaps.  When

these people are about to leave this country, they  have

to  go through the Immigration Department. Co-ordination

between  the Immigration Department and the  Income  Tax

Department  should make the collection of such  taxation

easier. I know that the tax clearance scheme is not  new

in  this  world. Many of the Western countries have  had

that  for  many, many years and a suggestion  like  this

should  not  be spurned. Furthermore, the amendment  did

not exclude any real substance from the original motion.

It  also asks that the whole question be investigated as

regards  reliefs  to  close relatives  who,  of  course,

include aged parents, dependants, brothers, sisters  and

children probably exceeding nine in number, but  I  hope

it  does  not include secondary wives or kept mistresses

which I think would be a wrong thing to include.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, I am of the opinion that the

amendment to the motion is a really good one and whoever

opposes such an amendment, opposes it not because it  is

not  good but because probably of personal reasons.  Any

opposition to such a motion, Sir, means that the  Member

is  not having the interest of Singapore at heart but is

calculating on what will be gained by his own person  or

by his Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have

not been convinced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>



by  the  proposer nor by the seconder of  the  amendment

that  the  amendment is an improvement on  the  original

motion. I would have supported the amendment if I  could

have   been  so  convinced  notwithstanding   that   the

amendment has come from the Liberal-Socialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning a Member of this House - I cannot remember

who - said  that a little knowledge is a dangerous  thing.

It is, Sir. The alarming figures given by the Member for

Tanglin  of  the  number of visitors to Singapore - aliens

and  otherwise, Sir - is no indication that the Income Tax

Department  has  allowed these people to  escape  paying

income  tax,  because referring to the same  section  12

referred  to  by the Member for Tanglin, we  will  find,

Sir,  under  that  section  that  where  a  non-resident

carries  on business partly in Singapore and partly  out

of  Singapore, the profits he derives from such business

operation  shall  be deemed to have  been  derived  from

Singapore  which are not directly derived  from  outside

Singapore,  and these profits are liable for  assessment

for taxation. Further, Sir, in another section, a person

must  have  resided here for six months in the  year  of

assessment before he becomes liable. So, Sir, the number

of  visitors  coming into Singapore is no indication  of

the negligence on the part of the Income Tax Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin has expressed great

interest  in  the tourist business of Singapore.  If  we

were  to say that any visitor to Singapore is liable  to

pay  income tax, Sir, that idea of tourist business will

be absolutely killed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I listened, I would say

not  with  interest but with amusement, to the ramblings

of the Member for Serangoon for the past ten minutes. He

opened  his  address, and I speak subject to correction,

by  saying that he could not see any difference  between

the  original motion and the amendment. If he could  not

see any difference, why bring in the amendment and waste

ten minutes of this House's time?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question again proposed.



<br><br>4.50 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government accepts

the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government is well aware of the feelings of

the Asians, expressed both in the Press and public

statements as well as in the speeches of the  hon.

Members  at  the last Budget debate, towards  this

matter  and  is in sympathy with the principle  of

granting allowances to dependants other than wives

and children. In fact, Sir, consideration is being

given  to  review the case for the grant  of  such

allowances.   As   will   be   appreciated,   this

additional  form of relief cannot  be  arbitrarily

fixed.  There  are about 19,000 taxpayers  in  the

Colony, and if this additional form of relief were

granted  without careful examination  of  all  the

implications involved in the proposal, it may well

be  that  there  will  be a considerable  loss  of

revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax is and will be one of the main sources

of  revenue to this country. We shall require  all

the money for the expansion of social services and

of economic activities. If it is intended that the

social  and economic services should be maintained

at  the present level of activity, it is essential

that this source of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>



revenue  should  not only be maintained  but  also

increased to cope with a mounting expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present scale of allowances is:

<pre>

                                                $

          (a)  Personal                       3,000



          (b)  Allowance for wife             2,000



          (c)  Allowances up to a maximum of $3,150

                  for nine children



</pre>



They are very generous compared with those granted

in  other countries. The following allowances  are

granted  in  respect  of  personal  allowance  and

allowance for wife in these countries:



<pre>

                                Personal          Allowance

                                Allowance         for wife

                                     $               $

              India                 645             645

              Pakistan            1,000             Nil

              Ceylon              1,350           1,000

              U.K.                1,200             840

              Australia             Nil             875

              New Zealand         3,180           1,000

              U.S.A               1,800           1,800



</pre>



The allowances for children in these countries are

also comparatively much less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, it has to be considered

whether  this  proposed relief can be  granted  in

addition  to  the present scale of  allowances  or

whether  some reduction in the existing allowances

may  have  to  be  made  for the  introduction  of

dependant allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is inevitable that the work of the department

will  be  increased  in scrutinising  the  various

claims  for  relief which, according to experience

in   other   countries,   will   require   careful

examination. The difficulties involved in checking

the   bona  fides  of  claimants  will   be   very

considerable.  At  the  moment  when  the  limited

resources  of  the  department  are  strained   to

collect  as much revenue as possible, it  will  be

appreciated that any diversion of manpower to deal

with  this  new  work  will affect  adversely  the

working   of  the  department  as  well   as   the

collection of revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of the legislation and practice in other

Asian countries which have had a lot of experience

with  this tax will have to be undertaken in order

to  obtain some guidance in fixing the quantum  of

such   allowances.  These,  Sir,  are  the   basic

problems  that have to be tackled in dealing  with

the proposal as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>



envisaged  in the motion. They will have to be carefully

considered before a final decision can be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is in existence, Sir, the Economic Committee of

the  Singapore Council of Ministers, consisting  of  the

Chief Minister as Chairman, the Financial Secretary, the

Minister for Commerce and Industry and the Minister  for

Communications  and  Works, which  considers  at  policy

level  matters involving finance and economics. It meets

at   regular   intervals   the  corresponding   Economic

Committee   of  the  Federation  Executive  Council   to

consider Pan-Malayan matters of which income tax is one.

This Committee has been tackling this task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Committee, Sir, has the benefit of the advice of

the  Malayan Board of Income Tax constituted  under  the

provisions  of  the  Income Tax  Ordinance.  This  Board

consists  of  the  Federation  Minister  of  Finance  as

Chairman,  the Singapore Financial Secretary  as  Deputy

Chairman, the Comptroller General of Income Tax and  six

Unofficials from the Federation and Singapore. The three

Singapore representatives are an accountant, Mr  J.  F.

L.  Cowin, and two lawyers, Mr A. P. Rajah and Mr  Wee

Chong  Jin, who are familiar with this country  and  the

business  conditions in Malaya. Among its main functions,

the  Board  surveys  the working of  the  Ordinance  and

considers  any matters arising out of the provisions  of

the  Ordinance  which may be referred to  it  by  either

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng) refers

to  the  representations made by  the  Singapore  Income

Taxpayers  Association on matters  arising  out  of  the

Ordinance. They are of a technical nature and I  do  not

propose  to deal with them. The memorandum was  actually

received   yesterday  by  me  and  will   be   carefully

considered and submitted to this Economic Committee.



<br><br>4.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support  the  motion with great pleasure. Allow  me  the

privilege,  Sir,  to  extend my congratulations  to  the

mover of the motion the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>



Queenstown and, at the same time, I would also  like  to

express my great appreciation of the stand taken by  the

Government by not playing party politics in accepting an

important measure moved by the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three reasons to support the motion.

First,   I  consider  that  this  motion  is  of   great

significance as an ideological advancement.  I  remember

that  during the Budget sittings for the years 1955  and

1956  regarding the review of income tax, I did  mention

that    the    paramount   importance   of   ideological

independence  should be closely considered.  The  second

part of the motion reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... as to suit local conditions, with particular

reference to personal reliefs to aged parents and  other

close relatives solely dependent on the taxpayer."



<br><br>We  must  understand  the  true  feeling  of  our  Asian

tradition.  Sir, if you will allow me to  quote - although

the audience is very poor - one example -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is no such thing as an

"audience" in this Assembly. Will the hon. Member please

address his remarks to the Chair?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I was referring

to  a  friend sitting in the public gallery. I know  him

personally. He has not only to support a wife,  children

and  parents,  but he has also to pay for the  secondary

education of his brothers. He is only a journalist.  How

much  money  can a journalist earn? Yet the  Income  Tax

Department  chases him round and round for  more  money,

and he can only claim reliefs for his wife and children.

It  is  his plain duty not only to support his  parents,

but  also to pay for the education of his brothers. This

is  the  custom in our Asian country and it is necessary

especially because a social security system has not  yet

been introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the first reason why I support the motion

is  that  I  believe  it is of prime importance  to  our

ideological   advancement.  The  second  is   that   the

committee, in the course of its discussions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>



may  be  able  to  recommend  measures   to

encourage   badly  needed  industrialisation   in   this

country.  I  am sure the Hon. the Minister for  Commerce

and  Industry  will be most pleased if measures  can  be

found to encourage not only local investors but also  to

attract   foreign   ones   as   well   to   boost    our

industrialisation. The third reason why  I  support  the

motion  is  that  quite a number of  facts  against  the

Income  Tax Ordinance have been given by the hon. Member

for  Tanglin and therefore the committee can reveal  any

loopholes  in  it, evasion of taxes or  inefficiency  in

collecting  them.  Sir,  for  these  three  reasons,   I

heartily support the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On the amendment, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member spoke on the original

motion. I have indicated earlier on that if any hon.

Member moves an amendment, he speaks on the original

Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am much obliged

to the Government for accepting my motion. I do not

think it is necessary for me to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly urges upon the Government to set up

a committee without delay to review the provisions of

the Income Tax Ordinance (Cap. 166) with a view to recommending



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>



such  amendments to the Ordinance  as  to  suit

local  conditions, with particular reference to personal

reliefs to aged parents and other close relatives solely

dependent on the taxpayer.



<br><br>put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
