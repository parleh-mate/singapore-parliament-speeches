   <b>(Request for tennis and squash facilities)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist</b> asked the Prime Minister whether the People's Association will request from the Housing and Development Board the landscaped area at the gable-end of Block 222, Lorong 8, Toa Payoh, to be utilised for building a community centre mainly for tennis and squash activities as at present no mich facilities are handy for the people in the ama, especially the Lorong 8 residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Khoon Choy) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the policy of People's Association to build community centres mainly for tennis and squash activities. Community centres are meant to cater for the social, educational and recreational needs of the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site referred to by the hon. Member is in Neighbourhood 4, Toa Payoh, which has about 1,400 units of 4-room and 5-room flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association has at present no plan to build a now community centre at Lorong 8 as Potong Pasir Constituency is already served by the Sennett and Potong Pasir Community Centres. The present size of the population in this neighbourhood is too small to warrant a new centre. The needs of the residents in Lorong 8 am, however, well catered for by the facilities including tennis and squash courts at the Sennett Community Centre. They can also avail themselves of the facilities at three new community centres, namely, Boon Teck, Whampoa and Kim Keat just 1 to 2 km away in the neighbouring constituencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Posir):</b> Sir, does the Senior Minister of State not realise that the three community centres near the vicinity mentioned do not provide for tennis and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> squash facilities, and that the Sennett Community Centre is more than 4 km away from Lorong 8, Toa Payoh?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Sir, the new Kim Keat Community Centre which was completed in December 1977 is only 1 km away. Within the same distance, the well-equipped Whampoa and Boon Teck Community Centres will be completed in a few months' time. These centres have tennis and squash facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Sir, does the Senior Minister of State realise that the new Whampoa Community Centre will have only one squash court to cater for 19,000 voters?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Sir, with the very limited resources available, it is not possible to provide squash courts for every constituency. Community centres are not meant only for the residents of that constituency. If there is a community centre nearby, all the residents around, irrespective of any constituency, should make good use of the centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, would the Senior Minister of State consider asking the Potong Pasir Constituency to raise resources for building a squash court?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Thank you very much for the voluntary service.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, that still does not answer my question. I would like my question answered. We could provide the resources. Could the People's Association get the Housing and Development Board to provide us with the land?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> The People's Association does not provide land.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> If the HDB could provide the land to the People's Association, we will build the squash court.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> If the hon. Member can tell us the particular piece of land if it is available, we will approach the Land Office.

   <b>NATIONAL SERVICE</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Deserters and Defaulters)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence the extent of desertion by those serving 'National Service and of avoidance by those who are abroad and who are liable for National Service; the action taken against such deserters and defaulters and whether the present measures taken against defaulters who are abroad are adequate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since National Service was introduced in 1967, 544 persons evaded National Service by remaining overseas. Of these, 169 were abroad when National Service was introduced and some 100 Singaporeans or more were resident in Christmas Island. The number of defaulters each year is as follows:
  <pre>
         Year        -         No.

         1967        -         129
         1968        -          31
         1969        -          31
         1970        -          41
         1971        -          55
         1972        -          41
         1973        -          45
         1974        -          53
         1975        -          58
         1976        -          42
         1977        -          18

                    Total      544
</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, this averages 49 a year as compared with some 20,000 enlisted each year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are 75 defaulters whose whereabouts are unknown but are presumed to be in Singapore. This gives an average of 6.8 per year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the persons who never turn up for National Service when they are liable to do so. Deserters are those who have served National Service, but found that they did not like it and then decided to abscond. Most of these cases - known as Absent Without
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Leave or AWOL in the Army - eventually realised that their decision to abscond was wrong and they accordingly returned to their unit to take their punishment. However, there are some who stay away for a very long time. These may be considered as deserters as distinct from absentees. If we take 31st December 1976 as a cut-off date, there are 74 such National Servicemen, and the numbers against the year in which they absconded are as follows: -
  <pre>
     Year Deserted                  No.

         1970            -           1
         1971            -           1
         1972            -           2
         1973            -           5
         1974            -          14
         1975            -          21
         1976            -          30

                        Total       74
</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of deserters seems to be going up year by year. There are several reasons for this. In recent years we have been enlisting youths of poor educational levels and they are more prone to abscond than better educated youths. The drug problem in recent years has doubtless made a contribution to the number of deserters. But part of the increase is more apparent than real. After some time the soldier either gives up or gets caught. He is then deleted from the list of deserters. Therefore, a good number of those deserting in 1974, 1975 and 1976 will eventually return to the army in future years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding defaulters who stay abroad, exit control by Immigration keeps numbers to manageable proportions. Those who have registered for National Service and want to go overseas for study or to visit foreign countries are required to furnish a financial bond of a minimum of $50,000 before they are issued with Exit Permits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, where a registrant fails to return to Singapore or where a National Serviceman deserts and decides to stay abroad, the governments of those countries concerned are informed of the status of these persons, that is, they are deserters or defaulters from National Service. It is not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> likely that the government of any reputable country will want to offer citizenship or permanent residence to such persons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked whether these measures are adequate. On the whole I think we can say that so far they are.

  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Labour (a) how many work permits have been issued to bar girls up to the latest convenient date; (b) what skills do they possess to merit the issue of work permits; and (c) why the issue of work permits to prospective employees in coffee shops, small restaurants/eating houses and provision shops is not as liberal as it has been to bar girls.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether he is aware of the serious labour shortage existing today in coffee shops, small restaurants/eating houses and provision shops, as our young Singaporeans are not interested to work in such places, and, in view of the important role such establishments have played in the economic development of Singapore, if he will consider relaxing the issue of work permits to sponsors applying for permits for their prospective employees.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, with your consent and the concurrence of the hon. Member for Khe Bong, take Questions 3 and 4 together as they are related to each other?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you agree, Mr Ho?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Yes, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our policy has been to issue work permits for work as bar girls and no skills requirement is imposed. Given the nature of the work involved, it is a profession which we do not want to encourage our girls to go into.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> The issue of such work permits, therefore, meets a desirable social objective. I do not think the hon. Member for Khe Bong is suggesting that we should be restrictive in our issue of work permits for work as bar girls so as to encourage more of our own women to work as bar girls. He may wish to know that as at the end of January 1978, there were a total of 943 work permits issued for work as bar girls.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our work permit policy is also designed generally to promote economic development through providing the required manpower. We are at present facing a tight labour market, especially in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Factories and construction worksites are of greater importance when compared to service establishments like coffee shops, small restaurants/eating houses and provision shops. According to the last available statistics, in 1973 the value added per worker for manufacturing was $12,796 when compared to $4,292 for coffee shops, $5,306 for restaurants and $5,000 for general provision/ sundry shops. Given their economic contribution and that the supply of foreign workers is not inexhaustible, Government must accord priority to factories and worksites.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coffee shops, small restaurants/eating houses and provision shops must adjust their operations to cope with the present labour shortage. Coffee shops and small restaurants/eating houses should employ more housewives as part-time help or provide self-service in their establishments. Provision shops should curtail their home delivery service. The hon. Member for Khe Bong has travelled extensively abroad and must have seen how similar establishments operate in the West where labour is even harder to come by. We cannot afford to encourage less then optimum use of manpower in these establishments, especially when we are short of labour. This notwithstanding, we have assisted these establishments to some extent. As at the end of January 1978, the number of work permit holders who were coffee shop and provision shop assistants and restaurant cooks and waiters was 1,412.

  <!-- Mr Lim Chee Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr Lim Chee Onn</b>: To ask the Minister for Labour (a) what plans his Ministry has to educate our workers on their responsibilities in increasing job security and job prospects for the labour force; and (b) how these plans relate to those workers who are unorganised or who are members of unions which are not affiliated to the National Trades Union Congress.

  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim Chee Onn.

  <b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Question No. 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the education of workers on their responsibilities in increasing job security and job prospects is a new approach to meet the challenges in our social and economic development. Many factors come into play in this aspect of workers' education. These include correct work attitude, higher skill development, productivity consciousness and industrial discipline. Its success can only be assured through the joint efforts of labour, management and the Government. In the public sector, it not only involves the Ministry of Labour and its statutory body, the National Productivity Board, but also other Ministries such as the Ministry of Education and its statutory body, the Industrial Training Board. Being a process involving values and attitudes, it takes time to nurture and should begin in schools or training institutions before the aspiring workers enter the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour and its statutory board, the National Productivity Board, have been playing an active role in the field of workers' education. The Ministry has sought to assure both unionised and non-unionised workers that there is social justice with industrial peace through its enforcement of the statutory provisions for labour welfare and against unjustified dismissals and retrenchments. It has also counselled' workers on numerous occasions to observe industrial discipline by not resorting to industrial action but follow proper procedures for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> resolution of grievances. It has also through speeches constantly stressed the need for higher productivity, skill development, positive work attitudes and curbing of job-hopping in order to overcome economic difficulties and in the process preserve job security and enlarge job prospects. I am particularly happy to note that hon. Members also have occasion to join the Ministry's efforts to this end by making similar exhortations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Board has been promoting vigorously the meaning, significance and benefits of higher productivity as well as the establishment of productivity committees and productivity incentive schemes. Its promotion of greater productivity is directed principally at managers, supervisors, workers and students in upper secondary classes and colleges and national servicemen. A display and training centre featuring productivity concepts and examples has been established and publications and audio-visual productions prepared. Programmes for dissemination of such productivity materials and visits to the display and training centre have been worked out and implemented. In addition, training in various aspects of productivity is being provided to the NTUC and its affiliated unions as well as the National Youth Leadership Training Institute.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where productivity committees are concerned, the Board has assisted firms to establish and run such committees. Publications on this subject have been made available. It has advised companies on productivity incentive schemes and scheduled in the near future a tripartite seminar to discuss merit and demerit schemes. Participation in productivity committees and the operation of productivity incentive schemes will contribute to a more responsible labour force.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools and other training institutions are the most appropriate starting points for educating our youth in good work attitudes. The Industrial Training Board recently organised a seminar on "Work Attitudes" with the objective of developing a set of guidelines, recommendations and other rele-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> vant materials for the eventual compilation of a formal instruction programme on proper work attitudes and values. Arising from this a "Blue Book" or Trainees' Handbook on Work Ethics and Proper Work Attitudes is being printed for institutional trainees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, the education process is a tripartite effort. In this connection, the NTUC has made a commendable and significant lead in holding the recent seminar on "Job Creation and Job Loss". The subsequent follow-up courses by its affiliated unions will maintain the momentum in disseminating the message of correct values and work ethics as well as skill development to the rank and file members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In time, social and economic forces will condition all the workers in employment to realise that while the Government spares no effort in promoting a healthy investment climate to increase job opportunities, the enhancement of job security and job prospects, in the final analysis, depends to a large extent on them - their willingness to give off their best, to learn patiently the skills required and to accept re-training and further training.

  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Acting Minister for Culture and Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Culture and Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Sir, the present security measures for the safety of passengers at Paya Lebar Airport are adequate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I should not publicise too much of the details lest effectiveness is affected, a brief description of these security measures would be in order.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All departing passengers are thoroughly screened with the aid of metal detectors. Body search is also carried out, if necessary. Hand baggage are subject to checks by X-ray machines and manual search. Passengers' luggage to be kept in the holds of the aircraft, which are not accessible to passengers in flight, are also searched or X-rayed by security personnel. Transit passengers who choose to proceed to the departure holding area in the terminal building are security checked before entering the passenger terminal. Airport staff holding passes are also checked before they may enter the restricted departure area.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All outgoing air mail and postal parcels are subject to X-ray screening.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X-ray screening is also carried out on hold luggage of arriving passengers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Airport is divided between public and restricted areas. All security sensitive areas such as the aircraft aprons and runway, customs, immigration and health areas as well as baggage areas, are restricted to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> airport passholders only. All entry and exit points to the restricted areas are permanently guarded by police personnel who also carry out checks on airport staff entering or leaving the restricted areas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The airport is also equipped with closed circuit television cameras that constantly monitor all activities inside the terminal buildings covering both public and restricted areas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also special police units stationed in the Airport to react immediately to any emergency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the security measures which I have briefly described provide adequate safe-guards for the safety of passengers at Paya Lebar Airport without causing too much inconvenience to passengers or affecting adversely the smooth flow of passengers and other users in and out of the Airport. These measures are constantly reviewed in the light of the prevailing security situation facing all international airports. Adjustments are made whenever considered advisable by our airport security officers.

  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed new driving test centre will be located at No. 1253, Block J, in the middle of Toa Payoh Industrial Park, off Lorong 8, Toa Payoh. The office for this centre is a factory premises with an area of 210 square metres. In front of this office is a plot of vacant ground which will be metalled and will be used for conducting parking and hill-climbing tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, has the Senior Minister of State any plans to ensure the road safety of the pedestrians, especially school children from the many schools in the area? The safety of these children would be greatly endangered by the increased traffic especially of learner drivers with limited driving experience and skill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I certainly share the concern of the hon. Member, when he raised the supplementary question. The site of this test centre has been chosen after an exhaustive survey of alternative areas in other locations. The sites considered included reverted properties in Changi, Sembawang, Tanglin and Seletar areas. However, these sites have been abandoned because their locations are inconvenient to the majority of learner drivers and instructors. Fringe car parks have also been found unsuitable because of the absence of facilities, such as office premises, toilets and canteens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Toa Payoh test centre is a suitable location as it is sited in an industrial estate adjoining a residential town. It is easily accessible and is convenient to most learner drivers. Moreover, office promises, toilets and canteen facilities are available in the industrial estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure the hon. Member that traffic congestion will be minimised. Driving tests will commence at 8.00 a.m. when the schools nearby are already in session. During lunch time, from 1.00 p.m. to 2.00 p.m., no driving tests will be conducted so that the safety of children leaving or going to schools in the area will not be endangered. Driving tuition will also be prohibited on certain selected roads during traffic peak hours. Driving tests will be conducted during non-peak hours and these tests will be spread over 10 different routes to avoid congestion. As I mentioned earlier, the parking and hill-climbing tests will be conducted within the industrial estate. Noise generated will therefore not create any nuisance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that what I have described will give the hon. Member the necessary assurance that he needs.

  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Sir, it is true that in some places, such as bus stops and shopping complexes in the city centre, littering has increased. But littering is not so rampant as to warrant a national campaign. Since the launching of the first national "Keep Singapore Clean" campaign in 1968, the majority of the population have become conscious about keeping the environment clean. However, despite rising literacy and affluence and public health education, some people still continue to liner streets, drains and public places.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment provides daily cleansing and daily refuse removal service besides surveillance of litter-prone areas, such as public resorts, bus stops, shopping complexes and food centres. Summonses are issued directly to offenders caught in the act of littering and the subsequent publicity in the mass media on litterbugs who are convicted in court helps to remind the public to keep Singapore clean.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member in his Question stated that "the bad habit of littering has come back to Singapore". It has not come back. It has always been with us. It has not gone away. In 1973, 9,578 persons were convicted of the offence. These convictions have reduced and last year, there were 3,823 cases, roughly 10 a day.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the Khalsa Crescent Centre, the others are either expanded or new. Accommodation in the centres was taken up as it became available when more and more addicts were apprehended under Operation Ferret. There is, therefore, no meaningful

  <br>
  <br> range that I can quote. However, the maximum number of inmates in those centres at various times were:

   Selarang Park Centre        1,659 inmates
   Jalan Awan Centre           1,124 inmates
   Telok Paku Centre           1,002 inmates
   Khalsa Crescent Centre        212 inmates
   Female Drug Rehabilita-
      tion Centre                218 inmates
</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For cold turkey treatment, addicts are housed in groups of up to 20 inmates in each large cell.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inmates are segregated according to sex, age and past records. The hardcore addicts and those with criminal records are housed at the Khalsa Crescent Centre. The young experimentors, on the other hand, are housed in bungalows at the Selarang Park Centre. Inmates are also segregated according to the stages of treatment and rehabilitation they are in. For example, the Jalan Awan Centre houses inmates who are in the final stage of rehabilitation and treatment, and they are given work
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of Parliament are welcome to visit any other centres, except that male visitors am usually not allowed in the Female Drug Rehabilitation Centre. However, if they wish to visit these centres, they should either contact the Director of Prisons or myself for such visits.

  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Hon. Minister tell us approximately what is the cubic capacity of space provided per inmate in the drug rehabilitation centres, and the cubic capacity of the cold turkey cell?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot give the cubic capacity of the space. However, I can give the area of the cold turkey room, but not its cubic capacity. I think its ceiling height is the normal ceiling height. The coiling height of this Chamber is not the normal ceiling height. The area of the cold turkey room is 42 square metros for 20

  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education if part-time National Servicemen residing in Pulau Tekong can be assigned petrol duties on the island itself instead of being asked to report to the mainland where they have to incur additional expenses by having to remain overnight after duty, as there is no more launch service in operation from Changi Point to take them back to the island.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are 106 part-time Vigilante Corps national servicemen residing in Pulau Tekong and Pulau Ubin. They are all attached to G District. The problem in question has been overcome by releasing these men from training or duties earlier, at 9.30 p.m. This will enable them to catch the launch from Changi Jetty at 10 p.m. by prior arrangement with the launch operator. It is only on certain occasions that they are required to remain for training or duties for the duration of the normal period of training/duties of 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. One such occasion was the training practice to prepare for the "VC Today" celebration last year. In such cases, they are informed well in advance to make arrangements with their relatives or friends to stay overnight on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vigilante Corps cannot assign these national servicemen patrol duties on the two islands as the low crime rate on these islands does not justify such patrols. Neither can the Vigilante Corps make arrangements for them to be trained on the islands as it is not feasible to establish a training centre with a full complement of supervisors, instructors, equipments and facilities on each island just to cater for 106 out of about 48,000 Vigilante Corps national servicemen.

   <b>(Measures against)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education what measures he intends to take against "hell-drivers" who despite convictions in court seem to continue to defy the law with their daredevil speeding acts thereby posing a grave danger to the life and limb of other road-users.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the recurrence of "hell-driving", despite conviction in court, indicates that punishment provided in existing legislation is insufficient to deter hell-drivers from their dangerous and irresponsible acts. Present legislation provides for a maximum fine of $1,000 or six months' imprisonment or both. However, imprisonment is not mandatory. Upon conviction, the offender is also liable to be disqualified from driving.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 30th October and 28th November, 1977 the Police conducted five operations against hell-riders. Altogether 20 persons were arrested and charged in court for rash driving and 34 were summoned for dangerous and inconsiderate driving. The first case of rash driving was decided in court on 23rd November, 1977. The rider was fined $1,000 and disqualified from riding for three years. This case, although widely publicised in the press, did not seem to have a deterrent effect on hell-riders because the Police arrested 10 persons for rash, dangerous and inconsiderate driving in their operation on 28th November, 1977.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs is taking steps to amend the existing legislation to provide for enhanced punishment against hell-drivers. The salient features of the proposed provisions are as follows:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a minimum fine of at least $1,000 for first offenders and imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a minimum fine of $2,000 in the case of second or subsequent conviction as well as imprisonment not exceeding one year: and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) disqualification of driving for a period of at least one year from the date of conviction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the five operations the Police seized 64 motor-cycles and 12 cars which were used in hell-riding and hell-driving. All these vehicles had to be returned to the hell-riders and hell-drivers after their cases were dealt with. It may, therefore, be necessary as a further deterrent to make provisions in the law for the confiscation of vehicles used in hell-driving and hell-riding, but this matter requires further consideration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides amending the existing legislation to provide for enhanced punishment against hell-drivers, the Traffic Police is also stepping up enforcement against such persons with a view to bringing to book the residual pool of such drivers and to prevent others from joining them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst I am sure hon. Members of this House have no sympathy for hell-drivers or hell-riders, would not the Hon. Minister consider mandatory imprisonment for the first offence rather harsh?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think so. I have already indicated in my answer that in spite of four operations having been carried out, resulting in a number of hell-drivers being arrested and charged in court - the first case of rash driving was decided in court on 23rd November in which the rider was fined $1,000 and disqualified from driving for three years - yet on 28th November they went on a rampage again and we had to arrest 10 of them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think, therefore, that mandatory imprisonment is too harsh. But may I say that although the proposal is to provide a minimum fine of $1,000 for the first offence and imprisonment up to a period not exceeding six months, the Magistrate has the discretion to impose imprisonment from one day to six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister confiscate the motor-cycle or vehicle without taking into consideration
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> whether or not it belongs to the rider or driver?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said in my reply, this matter is still under consideration.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what will happen if such a vehicle is on hire-purchase? If it is on hire purchase, will it not be unfair to the hire-purchase company who may not know that the vehicle has been used for hell-driving?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> An interested party!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I must point out, Sir, unlike what the Member from the Backbench has said, I have no interest in this matter. My question is, would the Minister consider returning the vehicle to the owner?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my answer is the same: the matter is still under consideration. These factors will be considered. But, may I say that under the hire-purchase law, even if a vehicle has been seized the hire-purchaser is still liable to continue to pay his instalments to the dealer or the hire-purchase firm. It does not, therefore, seem to be that bad as far as hire purchase firms are concerned.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Minister consider giving the Magistrate the discretion, especially if a motor vehicle is on hire-purchase?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said that the matter is still under consideration.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Hon. Minister define what he means by "hell-driver" and "hell-rider", and how can one distinguish them from earthly riders and drivers who merely exceed the speed limits.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, they will obviously be distinguished by their manner of driving or riding along our streets and not "as in hell". But this will clearly be defined in the proposed law which is now
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> being drafted. It may be something like this. When we talk of hell-drivers or hell-riders, we envisage a group of irresponsible people getting together for a race among themselves along public streets for prize money, with total disregard for the safety of other road users. They are not bothered whether their rash acts endanger the life and limb of other road users. They are only interested in competing among themselves for- prize money.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, considering the great interest in hell-driving or hell-riding, would not the Minister let the adventurous youths exhaust their energies in a dirt track built for them?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, it is not within my powers to build dirt tracks for these youths. I certainly do not oppose or try to discourage sporting activities among youths. But if they hell-drive or hell-ride on public roads endangering the safety of other road users and risking their lives and limbs, I do not think that is a sporting activity. It is a criminal activity.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Petroleum Act provides for the licensing of petroleum storage and transportation. Section 20(5) of the Act provides that all licences shall expire on 31st December of each year. This meant an accumulation of work at the end of each year. More than 1,000 licences are involved annually and obviously processing time would be affected since each renewal of licence requires inspection of the premises or vehicles. If the expiry dates were staggered so that renewals could be spread evenly throughout the year, the processing work would be considerably speeded up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill therefore seeks to amend section 20(5) of the Petroleum Act to enable licences
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to be issued expiring at any date not exceeding 12 months from the date of issue. The Bill also seeks to validate those licences which have expired under that section of the Act but which are regarded as being valid for the purposes of the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sections 4 and 7 of the Trustees Act (chapter 40) specify the investments in which trustees are permitted to invest. Section 4 covers investments consisting mainly of "gilt-edged" and other fixed interest securities, while section 7 covers certain types of equities quoted on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "securities" as it now appears in the Act does not specifically cover debentures. There is a doubt as to whether certain financial instruments in the nature of debentures, which are issued by public companies, whose shares are deemed to be trustee securities by virtue of section 7 of the Act, fall within the existing definition of "securities". Such instruments, whether secured or unsecured, are sometimes known as bonds, loan stock, notes or by some other designations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before this House seeks to remove any doubt that the term "securities" as defined in the Act, includes debentures. A definition of "debentures" has also been provided in the Bill to include debenture
  <br>

  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the need for aviation security measures to protect life and property in air commerce has become obvious. The growing number of incidents of aerial hijacking and sabotage of aircraft on the ground and air navigation facilities make it urgent. The early cases of hijacking were usually carried out by persons seeking to reach a destination which would otherwise have been inaccessible to them. However, the nature and character of aerial hijacking and sabotage have developed from those crude and amateurish affairs to sophisticated and well-organised operations in which aircraft, passengers and crew are held as hostages for specific demands.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet this threat the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) signed and concluded a number of multilateral conventions. The first convention was the Tokyo Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts committed on board aircraft signed in 1963. This Convention was ratified by Singapore on 19th October, 1971, by the enactment of the Tokyo Convention Act, 1971. The main objective of this Convention is to ensure that at least one State would
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have criminal jurisdiction over offences committed on board a civil aircraft in flight.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tokyo Convention has been supplemented by a further multilateral convention signed at The Hague on 16th December, 1970. This is The Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft which came into force on 14th October, 1971. Singapore signed this Convention on 8th September, 1971. The purpose of this Convention is to provide a legal framework which will ensure that hijackers do not go unpunished. The Convention makes the act of hijacking an offence punishable by severe penalties to be imposed by Contracting States. It also obliges each Contracting State to take measures necessary for establishing its jurisdiction over the offence committed. It does not bind the State to extradite the offender except to another Contracting State with which it has signed an extradition treaty. The Convention, however, provides that the State which does not extradite the offender shall be obliged to prosecute him in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary offence of a serious nature under its laws.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerial hijacking is not the only danger which threatens the safety of civil aviation today. Attacks on aircraft on the ground and other acts of sabotage against air navigational facilities are also matters which undermine the confidence of the people of the world in the safety of civil aviation. To deter the commission of such acts, ICAO concluded the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation. This Convention was concluded and signed on 23rd September, 1971, and came into force on 26th January, 1973. Singapore signed this Convention on 21st November, 1972. The Convention deals primarily with acts of sabotage, armed attacks and other forms of violence against international civil aviation and its facilities. Apart from enlarging the scope of offences, this Convention is similar to The Hague Convention.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Singapore is a party to The Hague and Montreal Conventions it has yet to ratify them. Both Conventions have gained wide acceptance in the world. As at November, 1977, a total of 79 countries were parties to The Hague Convention and 75 countries were parties to the Montreal Convention. Among ASEAN countries, the Philippines and Indonesia have ratified and acceded to both Conventions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore should now ratify the Conventions. The Tokyo Convention, to which Singapore is a party, is not designed as a deterrent against hijacking. There is no statute law in Singapore which makes aircraft hijacking an offence in itself. To enable the provisions of The Hague and Montreal Conventions to be implemented, this Bill will have to be enacted so that we have the laws in hand to discharge the obligations under the Conventions when they are ratified.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides that the offence of hijacking is committed by any person who, on board an aircraft in flight, unlawfully seizes or exercises control of the aircraft. The offence is committed irrespective of the nationality of the hijacker, the State of registration of the aircraft or the place of the hijacking, unless the aircraft is used in military, customs or police service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides that any act of violence against the passengers or crew of any aircraft in flight done by any person in connection with the offence of hijacking committed or attempted by him shall be deemed to have been committed in Singapore, regardless of where the act was committed. In other words, if a person in committing hijacking were to commit murder of a member of the crew or passenger or certain specified offences, under the Bill, our courts will have jurisdiction to try and sentence him in accordance with our law as if the act was committed in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 6 make it an offence to destroy or damage an aircraft in flight or to commit an act of violence on board such an aircraft which would endanger its safety; or to destroy, damage or interfere with air
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> navigation installations. Clause 7 makes it an offence for any person in Singapore to abet the commission of the offences defined by Clauses 5 and 6.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 provides that hijacking and other offences described in the Bill shall carry the penalty of imprisonment for life. Clause 9 provides that the consent of the Public Prosecutor is required before proceedings under the Bill are instituted. Pending such consent an offender may be arrested and charged in court.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 seeks to make hijacking and other offences by virtue of the Bill extraditable offences. It also provides that where there is no extradition treaty between Singapore and a State which is a party to either The Hague or Montreal Convention, a Gazette Notification may be made under Section 4 of the Extradition Act applying that Act to such State as though the Convention constitutes an extradition treaty between Singapore and that State.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>3.50 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ang Kok Peng (Buona Vista):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill tabled by the Minister for Home Affairs and Education,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years the unlawful seizure of aircraft, commonly referred to as hijacking, has occurred on many an occasion, sometimes with loss of lives. Only last year an aircraft of a foreign country in domestic flight was hijacked and flown to Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hijacking an aircraft endangers the safety of persons and property and undermines the confidence of the people in the safety of civil aviation. It is therefore necessary that there are appropriate measures to deal with criminal offences of this nature. Both The Hague and Montreal Conventions are designed to suppress such unlawful acts by providing the procedural instrument for hijackers to be dealt with and punished by the relevant Contracting States.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely that we now introduce the necessary legislation to deal adequately and speedily with such unlawful acts against the safety of civil aviation committed in the territory under our jurisdiction or on board an aircraft registered in our country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In going through the Bill, I find the penalty provided under clause 8 of the Bill not consistent with the penalty provided in our other Bills where a lighter offence, e.g. the illegal possession of a certain quantity of hallucinating drugs, is punishable with the capital sentence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of Article 4 of The Hague Convention and clause 3 of Article 5 of the Montreal Convention make provision for the exercise of criminal jurisdiction in accordance with the national law of each Contracting State. I therefore see no reason for this inconsistency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do, however, recognise that a treaty of extradition between States may contain a provision for a State to exercise its discretion not to extradite an alleged offender. For such a case, you will note that Article 7 of The Hague Convention and a similarly numbered Article of the Montreal Convention make it mandatory for that Contracting State to deal with the offence of hijacking as an offence of a serious nature under the law of that State which is likely to carry the same penalty as clause 8 of the Bill before the House. Would the Minister then agree that it is therefore not to our disadvantage to revise clause 8 of the Bill to make the penalty consistent with the graveness of the offence according to our law.
  <br>3.53 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, in reply to the Member for Buona Vista, may I say that there is no inconsistency with the Convention and our enactment of clause 8. Although clause 8 provides that the offence of hijacking carries the penalty of imprisonment for life, it does not mean that if a hijacker were to commit murder in the course of hijacking, he cannot be tried and punished in our courts and, if found guilty, be convicted and sentenced to death. That, Sir, as I said in my speech just
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> now, is provided under clause 4 of the Bill. As I said, clause 4 provides that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any act of violence against the passengers or crew of any aircraft in flight done by any person in connection with the offence of hijacking committed or attempted by him on board such aircraft shall be deemed to have been committed in Singapore.....' regardless of where the act was committed. In other words, under clause 4, if a hijacker in the course of hijacking, commits murder or fires a gun with intent to kill or injure, this constitutes an offence that can be tried in our courts and, if convicted, he can be sentenced to death. So there is no inconsistency as is thought by the Member for Buona Vista.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Sir, may I, as a matter of interest, seek clarification on one point? How many of those countries that have ratified both The Hague and Montreal Conventions have invoked them in dealing with hijackers?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I am not able to say how many countries have invoked these Conventions in dealing with hijackers, as such information is not readily available. This is because the manner of invoking the provisions of these Conventions differs in different countries. In some countries, the ratification itself is binding because these countries have special articles in the law which allow them to take steps against hijackers without the need to pass special legislation. This is the case with the United States and France. On the other hand, in countries like the United Kingdom, special laws have to be passed for the practical application of The Hague and Montreal Conventions against hijackers. However, from the information I have available, eight countries which have ratified both The Hague and Montreal Conventions and two countries which have ratified only the Montreal Convention have tried and punished hijackers. Punishment meted out by the courts of these countries varies tom country to country, ranging from four years' imprisonment to the death sentence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I just quote a few examples of what happened in these countries? On 1st March, 1975, Kurdish sympathisers hijacked an Iraqi Airways plane and the plane landed in Teheran, Iran. The hijackers were apprehended and they were executed by Iranian authorities on 7th April, 1975. Iran had ratified The Hague and Montreal Conventions in January 1972 and August 1976 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case, on 10th September, 1976, four Croation exiles and one United States' national hijacked a TWA aircraft from New York. They flew to Paris and surrendered there. The French authorities returned these five persons to the U.S. authorities and these persons were convicted on several charges of air piracy and conspiracy in the United States. Two of them were sentenced to life imprisonment and the other three received 30 years' imprisonment each.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another example, on 26th May, 1977, a Russian hijacked an Aeroflot plane and flew to Sweden. The USSR authorities demanded the extradition of this Russian hijacker. The Swedish authorities refused but tried and sentenced the hijacker to four years' imprisonment in Sweden.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Senior Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Jurong Town Corporation Act for the following purposes:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To change the Corporation's financial year to bring it in line with the Government's financial year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To introduce new restrictions on the purchase of JTC flats similar to those which were imposed in 1975 by the Housing and Development (Amendment) Act, 1975, on the purchase of HDB flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To exempt the Corporation from any liability for loss of, and to limit the Corporation's liability for damage to, cargo handled at the Corporation's wharves and godowns at Jurong Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To make other miscellaneous amendments to the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments were made to the Housing and Development Act in 1975 to impose further restrictions on the purchase of HDB flats and to confer upon the Housing and Development Board the power to compulsorily acquire flats from purchasers who have contravened the conditions of sale. The Bill seeks to confer similar powers upon the Jurong Town Corporation and to apply similar restrictions in respect of the flats sold under the Corporation's public housing scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume of cargo handled at Jurong Port is expected to increase following the recent addition of 865 metres of deep water berths. Though the Jurong Port is managed by the Port of Singapore Authority, the port is owned by the Corporation and there is a possibility that claims may be made against the Corporation for loss of or damage to cargo handled at Jurong Port. Therefore, the Bill seeks to amend the Act to exempt the Corporation from any liability for loss of, and to limit its liability for damage to, cargo handled at the Corporation's wharves and godowns at Jurong Port. The Corporation's liability for goods which have been duly acknowledged to be in its custody will be limited to $2,000 per package unless prior declaration is made as to its nature and value. No liability will attach in the case of goods not acknowledged by the Corporation to be in its custody. The Corporation will also be exempted from liability for loss of or damage to goods arising from force majeure, wars, riots and acts of God.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other miscellaneous amendments to the Act are for the following purposes:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to remove the existing restriction on the Corporation to delegate to its employees the power to grant loans; such an amendment is necessary in view of the growing number of loans given by the Corporation to members of the public for the purchase of flats under the Home Ownership Scheme and to employees for the purchase of houses and vehicles;
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to empower the Minister to appoint any person, whether on a full-time or part-time basis, as the Chairman of the Corporation and to enable any member of the Corporation to be appointed as acting Chairman in the absence of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to reduce the quorum for meetings of the Corporation from five to four.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, among its many different roles, the Jurong Town Corporation is also a port authority in that the administration of Jurong Port comes under the jurisdiction of JTC. One of the purposes of the Bill, as stated by the Hon. Senior Minister of State, is therefore, to exempt and to limit the liability of the Corporation for damage to and loss of cargo handled at the Corporation's wharves and godowns at Jurong Port. The relevant clause is clause 26, enacting sections 50 to 56 inclusive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the drafting stage of the Bill, I am just wondering whether any attempt has been made to ensure that these relevant sections are in all respects identical to the corresponding sections under the Port of Singapore Authority Act or any bye-laws of PSA. From a purely practical point of view, I am sure the Senior Minister of State will agree that to avoid confusion to users of our port it would definitely be desirable that the laws, rules and procedures of the two authorities are standardised. In fact, is there any reason why we should not have just one single unified port authority? By having only one unified port authority, we would not only avoid unnecessary confusion among port users but also achieve greater efficiency and savings in costs through economy of scale.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Hon. Senior Minister of State care to give his views?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first point regarding consistency with the Port of Singapore Authority, my
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> understanding is that the amendments in the Bill are consistent with the relevant PSA legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, I think it is a question of opinion. The land in Jurong Town belongs to JTC and the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that there is consistency in administration even though there are two administrative units.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, another purpose of the Bill is to introduce further restrictions on the purchase of low-cost JTC flats so that the conditions applicable to the sale of JTC flats will be identical to those imposed by HDB. This seems to indicate that because of the different administrations, obviously certain confusion must have been caused before. So does it not support my argument that there ought to be perhaps unified control and management?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, again this is a question of opinion. There could be a danger in over-centralising too many rules in one particular body. The purpose of this Bill is to make sure that there is consistency in administration between JTC and HDB. But if time proves that the suggestion of the Member for Jalan Kayu is correct, that could be the time for us to review the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the provisions of this Bill the Chairman of JTC can now be a part-time Chairman. Does this mean that the workload performed by the Chairman is now much reduced?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not necessarily so.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I agree that on any matter there are always different points of view. But when it comes to managing public funds, I think it is always better to make sure that we consider all possibilities and alternatives beforehand rather than to go on a trial and error basis, as suggested by the Hon. Senior Minister of State. As in the case of the housing development programme of JTC, I think experience has already shown that perhaps through mismanagement it has now been put under the control of the Chief Executive Director of HDB.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, just as we have different Ministries and departments dealing with different matters, we have statutory boards which were created for the purposes of having more discretionary powers for ease of administration on a decentralised basis. I do not think I have suggested that the administration is progressing on a trial and error basis to arrive at an optimum administration. In fact, it is to have greater flexibility in administration that we have different statutory boards looking after different geographical or physical areas. It is a question of proper coordination between the various statutory boards so as to arrive at a consistent administration. We admit that there might have been lapses in the past. But it is for us therefore to learn from the lessons of the past to arrive at a better administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, why is it necessary to reduce the quorum for a meeting of the Corporation from five to four? Are the present directors of the Corporation not attending the meetings regularly?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some directors may not necessarily be in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore at the relevant time. One of the provisions in the Act stipulates that there must be a meeting every month. That is a statutory requirement. To ensure that that particular provision is followed, it is necessary to reduce the quorum for a meeting of the Corporation from five to four. This is to ensure that meetings can be held monthly.

  <b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The monthly statistics on disabled registrants for the period January-December 1977 and January 1978 are provided in the Appendix below.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be pointed out that, apart from placing disabled registrants on training under the Disablement Resettlement Scheme, the Employment Service of the Ministry has also been offering direct employment assistance to some of the disabled registrants. In 1977, a total of 123 disabled registrants were successfully placed in various occupations such as general factory workers, lift attendants, clerks and parking attendants. In January 1978, 13 registrants have also been successfully placed in various occupations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the disabled who were trained had been working before training.

  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications (a) how many new street lights have been installed in 1977 in the Jalan Potong Pasir, Meyappa Chettiar Road, Lorong Bakar Batu and Jalan Kolam Ayer areas; (b) whether there are plans to install more street lights in those areas; and (c) whether there are plans to upgrade present street lights in those areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> In 1977, 4 new street lights were installed in Jalan Potong Pasir and 5 existing 100-watt lamps upgraded. No street lighting work was carried out along Meyappa Chettiar Road, Lorong Bakar Batu and Jalan Kolam Ayer. However, a proposal to install 5 new street lights along Meyappa Chettiar Road is now under consideration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the street lighting along Lorong Bakar Batu and the widened stretch of Jalan Kolam Ayer meet the required standards, there is no need to upgrade them. Street lighting for the remaining stretch of Jalan Kolam Ayer will be upgraded in conjunction with its widening in 1979.

  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist</b> asked the Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology (a) how many times in a month the Jalan Potong Pasir, Meyappa Chettiar Road, Jalan Kolam Ayer and Lorong Bakar Batu areas are patrolled by the Environment personnel; (b) what actions are being taken to improve the poor environmental conditions existing in those areas; (c) what is being done to improve the poor drainage in those areas; and (d) what particular action is being taken to reduce the existing pollution in the upper reaches of the Kallang River especially the portion flowing through the Lorong 8 (Toa Payoh), Jalan Potong Pasir and Meyappa Chettiar Road areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr E.W. Barker:</b> The Ministry of the Environment provides daily refuse removal, nightsoil removal and cleansing services to the four areas in question. Weekly vector control surveillance is also carried out. The public health auxiliaries visit the areas daily.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the cleaning up of the Kallang Basin, a long term programme has been drawn up to improve the environmental conditions of the area. This will involve redevelopment of the area together with the resiting of hawkers and farmers, extension of the sewerage facilities, resettlement of the squatters and the prohibition of pig farming and duck rearing. These developments will take time. The immediate programme is to phase out latrines hanging over rivers and to extend the daily nightsoil removal services to the affected areas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The areas referred to form part of the lower catchment of the Kallang River. Most of these areas are low and have many squatters and farms. Any drainage improvement can only be carried out in conjunction with redevelopment when the land can be filled up adequately and a proper drainage system provided.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Drainage Department has already commenced improvement work and concrete lining of the main Kallang River in conjunction with the development of Ang Mo Kio New Town. At present, six contracts are in progress covering the improvement of the river from its upper reaches at Thomson Road to Jalan Toa Payoh. This will cater for the increased run-off from the new town which otherwise would overflow the river banks and aggravate flooding of the lower catchment particularly the areas in question. Further improvement downstream of Jalan Toa Payoh will be carried out in due course under the second phase of the project.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pollution in Sungei Kallang comes from its catchment, e.g. from the discharge of pig waste in the pig farms north of Braddell Road adjacent to the banks of Sungei Kallang, the indiscriminate dumping of refuse and discharge of sullage water into the drains from premises, in particular, from the squatter colonies, mainly at Jalan Teck Kee, Potong Pasir and Kampong San Teng.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present efforts to keep Sungei Kallang clean by desilting and removing of refuse are only palliative measures. Until the sources of pollution on land have been eliminated, Sungei Kallang will continue to be polluted.
