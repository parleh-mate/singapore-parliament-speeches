<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would  like to refer to subhead 11 in page  190,

Singapore Tourist Promotion. I notice here that  we

are to spend a sum of $369,730.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want an answer from the Minister for

Commerce  and  Industry as to  what  Singapore  can

offer  to tourists when they come here, as  we  are

spending   such  a  big  amount  on  this   Tourist

Promotion  Board.  After all, we  do  not  have  in

Singapore  a snake temple or the Ayer Itam  Temple,

as  they have in Penang, or in Hongkong where  they

have  the Amarok. What we have are only swamp  land

and some fine buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who come to Singapore are not interested

in  our fine buildings and roads. What have we  got

anyway? If we are going to spend such a big sum  of

money to attract tourists, we must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>



also  develop  our place here in  order  that  more

tourists can be induced to come to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very perturbed to learn that the tourists,

whenever  they land in Singapore, are shown  places

like the death houses at Sago Lane. It happened  on

one occasion at these death houses, there were many

bereaved  families crying over their  beloved  ones

who had passed away. The tourists entered the death

house. They tramped in and out. They climbed up and

down  the  stairs. Is it not pitiful? Why must  the

tourists be brought to that area?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say this. Many people have

not  visited the death house. My father was in  the

death  house  one day, and I can say that  on  that

same  day tourists came to the house. It was really

pathetic   to  see  a  bereaved  family  in   those

circumstances. They had lost someone very close  to

their    hearts,   and   these   tourists,   mostly

foreigners, when they went there, smiled,  giggled,

and shook their heads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to spend this money, we must

develop Singapore. We must get some fine beaches or

big  hotels. At the moment, Sir, what have we  got?

We have only a few small hotels. The hotels which I

visited, when I travelled in Europe and Japan, were

very  fine ones. They were big and had hundreds  of

rooms.  This amount that we are going to  spend  is

most ridiculous, unless we are going to develop our

place  here  so  that  more  people  can  come   to

Singapore,  because  tourism is  another  invisible

export  from  which Singapore can get  more  income

besides trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade is very important. I have said on the

Second  Reading  that we must allow  all  types  of

goods  to  come  in.  Make Singapore  a  free  port

whereby  goods imported here can be re-exported  to

the  various  neighbouring countries. We  can  earn

money  on  them.  But the Government  is  not  very

concerned  about  the  Ministry  of  Commerce   and

Industry. Let us take a look at it. What experience

has the Permanent Secretary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>



to  the Ministry of Commerce and Industry got? Sir,

this  is  a very important Ministry. Trade  is  the

lifeblood of Singapore. Yet, at the present moment,

the Permanent Secretary in charge of this important

Ministry  has no qualifications and no  experience.

Neither   has   he   any  academic   qualifications



regarding  trade  or commerce,  except  an  Honours

degree on the Malay Kris.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a merchant. I know that about three-quarters of the revenue is derived from trade. We

live  on  trade. So if we are really interested  in

seeing that Singapore should get more dollars  into

the Treasury, we must develop trade. Put someone in

charge  of  the  Ministry  who  has  the  necessary

qualifications and experience, not a man who  knows

nothing   about  trade  or  commerce,  particularly

industry. This is a shame. When I look through  all

these  records. I am very perturbed  to  find  that

Singapore  is  not paying particular  attention  to

this  matter,  in  spite of the fact  that  we  are

spending the colossal sum of $805,330 on this item.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> At the close of yesterday's sitting, the



hon. Member for Serangoon interjected to say that I

had  not  given him a detailed reply to  his  point

about  shipping and shipping conferences.  Sir,  my

failure to give a detailed reply was because of  my

desire not to prolong the debate unnecessarily.  As

I had pointed out, it was getting rather stale, and

we were reaching almost the moment of interruption.

However,  since I have an opportunity this morning,



I shall give a reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot be denied, Sir, that certain shipping

conferences   at  certain  times  do   exercise   a

strangling effect on our trade. This is not  a  new

factor in our trading circumstances. It is a factor

that  has irked merchants many years. I am reminded

of  the  same  outcry against shipping  conferences

even before the war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have got a cutting of the Singapore Free Press

of  8th March, 1937. It was a morning paper at that

time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><div align="center"><b>"Autocracy of the Shipping Conferences harming the

local  entrepot trade.<br> Protest by the  President  of

Indian Chamber of Commerce.</b></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Independent Line from here to India?</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The autocracy of some of the Shipping Conferences

was condemned by Mr Mohamed Jumabhoy,"



<br><br>That was my father, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, in

his  report for 1936 to the Annual General  Meeting

that was held yesterday..."



<br><br>and  then  it goes on, for I have not got the  full

cutting. It has been eaten by white ants, I  think!

However, this factor has been very irksome  to  the

merchants. Even Mr Tan Siak Kew, who is not in the

House at the moment, has often told me that if  the

shipping conferences were more reasonable, we could

develop  our trade better, and I admit that frankly

that  would be so. However, it is not an easy  task

to  fight  these established shipping  conferences,

because they are very big and our resources are not

adequate  to  fight  them. Firstly,  there  is  the

financial  question.  Have we sufficient  money  to

have enough of our own ships to operate in all  the

oceans where cargoes from Singapore are going?  And

what  is the amount of tonnage required? The Member

for  Telok  Ayer  raised a very pertinent  question

yesterday, when he asked how much does a ship cost.

One  ship costs millions of dollars. Also when  you



really  go  out of your way to fight  the  shipping

conferences,  you come to a freight war.  When  you

come  to a freight war, what do you find? You  find

that in the end the merchants for whose benefit you

are trying to break the conference will invariably,

quietly  and,  under a different name possibly,  go

and  ship  by  the conference lines  because  these

conferences lines are able to offer cheaper freight

rates.  I  am sure the Member for Telok  Ayer  will

bear  me out, because he has had the experience  of

fighting  the  Straits  Bombay  Conference  in  the

1930's.  It is a tough fight. A merchant  does  not

always  look to the long-term advantage. If he  can

find  cheaper  freight immediately  even  with  the

conference line, he will go and quietly ship by the

conference line which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>



has  entered the freight war. Therefore, any effort

by  any  organisation or any country to  fight  the

shipping conferences will be a very difficult task,

unless  they  have powerful resources behind  them,

and it will take at least 10 or 15 years to develop

shipping  to the amount where they could reasonably

hope  to  have  a chance of fighting any  of  these

conferences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is lack of trained technical

staff.  We  have not got locally trained  technical

staff. We have not got the Masters. We have not got

the  Mates.  We have not got the Engineers  to  man

ships which we might possibly own. It has been  two

years  since  I  tried to expand  the  local  trade

limits  for the local trade masters, provided  they

take  extra subjects and pass them. We have  worked

long  hours to finalise such a scheme. Then we  put

it   to   the  Federation  of  Malaya  and   Borneo

territories. But both of them turned  it  down.  In

fact,  if  the scheme had been operated,  it  would

have  benefited  the Malays, because  most  of  the

local  trade masters are Malays. But the Federation

of Malaya could not see eye to eye with us. Neither

did  the  Borneo territories. The hon.  Member  may

well  ask why do we not go alone on it? The  answer

is  that we could not go alone because if our ships

get  out of Singapore and go to any of these areas,

the  Borneo Government or the Federation Government

could  refuse to give it a clearance and  the  ship

would be stuck there. So any action to enlarge  the

local  trade  limits and raise the  status  of  the

local  trade  masters, so that they  could  command

bigger  ships with bigger tonnages, must  have  the

approval  of  the  Federation  Government  and  the

Borneo Government. We cannot do it on our own. That

is  roughly  the  position. However,  if  the  hon.

Member  has  any  scheme  in  mind  which  will  be

workable, I should be happy to discuss it with him.

But  I  sympathise with him when he said  that  the



shipping conferences do have a strangle-hold effect

on  our  commerce; and they could, if they want  to

fight  us,  divert our trade to other channels,  as

happened in copra recently.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the subject of tourism raised by

the  Member for Tiong Bahru. He asked what we  have

got  in Singapore. Sir, I had occasion recently  to

stop for a couple of days in Honolulu on my way  to

the  United  States,  and frankly  what  I  saw  in

Honolulu  did  not  impress me at  all.  The  much-publicised Waikiki Beach has nothing except that it

is  a beach with bathing facilities, basically  the

same  as  we have in Changi; except it is a  bigger

beach. Yet it is the publicity that has made Hawaii

today a centre of big tourist attraction. They have

nothing else to offer besides that.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> They have fine hotels.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> We offer shopping facilities

here,  and I am sure many of the tourists who  come

here do a lot of shopping in our stores. The Member

raised  the question of big hotels. There were  two

proposals  I  received  last  year  for   two   big

operators  to  have big hotels here.  However,  the

proposals are still under consideration, and  I  am

afraid  that  now they are rather  sitting  on  the

fence  to see what sort of a government is returned

after  the next Elections before they would put  in

$5 million in a hotel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, hon. Members must have read the

comment made by Mr Tan Chin Tuan, Chairman of  the

Raffles  Hotel,  yesterday  about  the  raising  of

electricity  rates. Now, that has not been  helpful

to  the hotel industry. The hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar  may  very well say that the City Council  is

responsible for selling electricity at an  economic

price,  without  caring what other  industries  the

Government  want to develop. That may be  so,  Sir.

But  then the City Council's responsibility  is  to



license ice-cream sale only for health reasons, and

not to prohibit the entry of ice-cream to encourage

local industry. But they have done it, and if  they

can  do it with ice-cream, they might also consider

other industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru went on to say: "Make

Singapore a free port." It is a free port, and I do

not see how freer I can make it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he went on to attack my Permanent Secretary.

Sir,   the  appointment  of  a  local  officer   as



Permanent Secretary was the subject of an agreement

reached   under  the  Malayanisation  Scheme.   The

Malayanisation Scheme was approved by hon.  Members

on  both  sides of the House. My present  Permanent

Secretary  has  been  promoted  to  that  post   in

accordance with the Malayanisation policy.  He  has

not got any high academic degree, I admit, but then

in  the  case  of  the Permanent Secretary  to  the

Ministry  of  Commerce and Industry, it  has  never

been found necessary to have high academic degrees.

In  fact,  as  a  merchant, I hold  the  view  that



sometimes   high  academic  degrees  are   more   a

deterrent  to, than an assistance in, carrying  out

the  right  policy, because the thinking of  people

who  hold  such  academic degrees runs  in  certain

grooves,  and those grooves are taught to  them  on

the  pattern  of the economy of Western  countries.

For instance, certain economists hold the view that



this  is the line we should take, because they have

learnt their economics according to the pattern  of

Western  economics.  But these  conditions  do  not

apply  here. Therefore, it is better to have a  man

who   has  not  got  a  high  academic  degree   in

economics,  but who has experience in handling  the

matter. I can tell you that this officer is a  very

promising  officer, and I am sure he  will  develop

into a very good Permanent Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some experience in trade, as the hon.

Member  must  admit, and I am there at least  until

5th April, 1959, to guide the Ministry and to do my

best  to advance the cause of Singapore in commerce

and industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member might also wish to know that it

is  the Public Service Commission which chooses the

man,   and   when  my  former  Permanent  Secretary

resigned, we were short of local officers.  Sir,I

may  now  add  that  my Permanent  Secretary  is  a

Raffles  College graduate, and he has  studied  the

subject   of  economics.  He  has  a  B.A.  Honours

(Cambridge)   degree.  This  is  an  administrative

appointment  determined  outside  the  control   of

Government.  So  this  point  of  not  having   any

academic qualification



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>



is  again wrong. However, I am quite satisfied with

the  officer concerned. I am sure he will make good

in his job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> The hon. Minister

seems   to  be  getting  impatient,  but  I  think,

according  to  the  time-table,  we  are  still  on

schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very happy indeed to hear that the

Minister  for Commerce and Industry has  confidence

in his Permanent Secretary. I think it is the right

course  to  take, and I am very sorry  to  have  to

criticise my colleague on the Opposition  Side  who

has criticised the appointment of the new Permanent

Secretary,  and whose view on this matter  shows  a

certain degree of inferiority complex; namely, if a

European is appointed, then there will be no  query

at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> That is nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am happy that the

Minister  for Commerce and Industry has enlightened

us on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the tourist trade. I wonder

whether the Minister for Commerce and Industry  can

let the House know what exactly is in his mind when

he  says  he  wants to make Singapore an attractive

centre  of tourism. Of course, I hope the  Minister

does  not intend to attract tourists into Singapore

on  the  style of the Paris night clubs, the  Tokyo

geishas,  or  the  Hongkong  strip  tease.  On  the

question of Hawaiian dances, have we any hula  hula

dances  here?  Sir, I did mention last  year  that,

much as we would like to boost tourism, we must  at

the  same time safeguard the moral standard of this

city.  Therefore, I wish the Minister for  Commerce

and  Industry could give us more details,  since  a

year  has  elapsed  when  the  question  was  first

raised. What is in his mind when he says that he is

confident   he   is  able  to  make  Singapore   an

attractive tourist centre?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder what

the  Member for Changi knows about trade,  when  he

touched on the question of the appointment  of  the

new Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce

and Industry. I pointed out to this House that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>



the  Ministry of Commerce and Industry  is  a  very

important  Ministry. I am not against any  type  of

people - they  may be Europeans, Indians,  Malays  or

Chinese - put in charge of this Ministry. What  I  am

concerned   is   that  this  Permanent   Secretary,

according  to his past records, has failed  in  his

examinations.  He  could  not  even  get  into  the

Malayan  Civil  Service. He  actually  entered  the

Museum service as a curator. Later on he was  given

a scholarship and when he went to England, he wrote

a book entitled "Kris".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think this is completely

irrelevant  to the debate. The hon.  Member  is,  I

think, wrong in criticising an appointment which, I

take  it,  is an appointment by the Public  Service

Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> That is what I say, Sir. This is

most  unfair  because  this  is  a  very  important

Ministry.  We  must  get someone  with  experience,

because Singapore lives on trade. Even the Minister

for  Commerce and Industry has said that this is  a

very  important Ministry. We live or die by  trade.

We  must get someone who knows trade or industry so



that the Ministry can be run properly. It is no use

putting someone there who has no experience.  Maybe

the  Minister  for Commerce and Industry  is  right

when  he says that academic qualifications are  not

sufficient. What we want is a man with a  practical

knowledge of trade and industry.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has

ventilated  his grievance, and I do not  think  the

subject should now be pursued any further.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I was just trying to reply to

the Member for Changi and the Minister for Commerce

and Industry about this appointment, because it was

they who said that I was against the appointment of

the   present  Permanent  Secretary,  because   the

incumbent  is a Malay and I do not like Malays.  It

is not that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I did not say that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have indicated that I

consider  that  the  hon.  Member  has  had   ample

opportunity to answer what has been said  and  that

subject should now be closed.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Now, Sir, we come to the reply

given  by  the Minister for Commerce and  Industry,

regarding the question of a merger. He pointed  out

that  we have a surplus population, and asked where

this  surplus  population would go, except  to  the

Federation  of  Malaya, and  that  he  was  looking

forward to that. It is just like looking forward to

something  remote.  It is like hoping  to  win  the

first  prize  of  the  Social  Welfare  Lottery  of

$350,000. That is only a dream. We must face facts.

We  cannot  say:  we have a surplus population,  so



where  will  the  people  go,  unless  we  beg  the

Federation  of  Malaya to take in  a  part  of  our

population.  I  wonder  whether  the  Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry is aware that in  Singapore

today   even  in  the  public  service,   we   have

Federation   people   here.  Even   the   Permanent

Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce and  Industry

came from the Federation. Look at the place of  his

birth. I can tell you offhand of the names of  four

or  five  people  who came from the  Federation  of

Malaya. There are many more people in Singapore who

came  from  the  Federation  of  Malaya.  Yet   the

Minister talked about a surplus population and that

we  must have a merger. Sir, on the question  of  a

merger,  we  have had a reply many times  from  the

Federation - Government  officials  and  the   people

alike - that  they do not want merger. They  went  so

far as to describe Singapore as a diseased hand. Is

it  not humiliating? Is it not degrading? I am very

surprised  that  the Government  does  not  realise

that. The Government must have a thick face not  to

realise  the rebuff we receive from the  Federation

every  time we ask for a merger. The Federation  of

Malaya was serious when they said that they did not

want  merger.  We have already been  repulsed  more

than once by the Federation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the student problem. Our students are not

allowed  to  cross the Causeway and yet  Federation

students are allowed to cross into Singapore. Is it

not humiliating?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Sir, we have tariffs imposed on us. When

goods  go  to the Federation we must pay a  tariff.

When  Federation goods come in here, they  have  no



need  to  pay  a  tariff. As I said on  the  Second

Reading,  it  is  not  a  dignified  approach.  The

Government  are more concerned with the  Federation

than  with  attempting to improve the  lot  of  the

people  of Singapore. They do not face facts.  They

are  not realistic. They talk about the problem  of

merger  day  in  and day out until  they  quit  the

Government.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I think the subject of

the  appointment of my Permanent Secretary has been

sufficiently ventilated.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have closed the subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> There is only one little

point.  It is very difficult to find good  officers

with  enough  experience. We  have  advertised  for

officers for other posts in the Ministry, for lower

posts,  and even then we have not been able to  get

the officers. We have kept on advertising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have plans to try and train a few junior

officers as Trade Commissioners, but in our  search

for them we have not come across a suitable type.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming, Sir, to tourism, a point raised by the

Member  for  Changi, it is not our desire  to  have

Singapore  follow Paris or Japan with  their  night

life.  We  want to encourage tourists to come  here

and  study  how other people live and  to  see  the

world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may perhaps give a few figures here, Sir, of

the   contribution  that  tourism   has   made   to

Singapore's  economy. We had a survey  carried  out

for  the  period  1st  July, 1957,  to  30th  June,

1958 - one  year - and we found that of the number  who

landed  in Singapore from overseas, 75,456  persons

stayed an average of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>



three  days. There are other categories who  stayed

less than three days, but they are not included  in

this  figure. Those who stayed three days and  over

spent  an  average of $100 a day. This  amounts  to

$22,636  000  in  tourist expenditure  for  the  12

months  analysed.  We hope to get  a  10  per  cent

increase next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the countries from which the biggest number

of  such  persons  come  here  are:  United  States

10,774:   United  Kingdom  8,751:  other   European

countries  8,223;  India 5,486; other  South  Asian

countries  15,123; Australia 4,956;  and  Indonesia

14,426.  The other figures are in the region  of  a

thousand  or  less than a thousand  and  I  am  not

quoting  them. As I have said, the total number  of

those  tourists who stayed three days  or  over  is

75,456,  and their expenditure is over $22,000,000.

So  you  can  see  the  size of  contribution  that



tourism makes to Singapore's economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $805,330 for Head 30 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $109,130 for Head 31 stand part

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, touching on Head

31 - Agriculture - I  would  like  the   Minister   for

Commerce  and  Industry  to  enlighten  us  on  two

points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is vegetable growing. I wonder if

vegetable  production  has increased.  Furthermore,

because of floods or the limitation of land and,  I

think,   also  a  lack  of  knowledge  of   nursing

vegetable    beds   and   shortage   of    suitable

fertilizers,  will  that affect the  production  of

vegetables?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is there any possibility of developing

the flower-growing industry in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the Minister will answer these two

questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, we produce about 60 per

cent  of  our requirements of green leaf vegetables

in  Singapore. That is quite a lot when taking into

consideration the size of the island and  the  land

available for such purposes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to intensify agriculture on hilltop

land,  which  is  not  fertile  enough  for  normal

methods  of cultivation, by getting an expert  from

India  on hydroponics - that is soilless culture.  We

were promised an expert in 1956. Unfortunately  the

expert  did not turn up. For some reason, I  think,

his visit was cancelled and we could not obtain his

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rural Development Commissioner spoke to me a

few  days back. He said he was trying again to  get

such  an  expert from India. In fact, he is already

trying  out  experiments in hydroponics in  certain

areas. If that succeeds, and if it is found  to  be

an  economic proposition, we can then increase  our

agricultural   production - vegetable   production - by

quite a lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  may be interested to know  that  in

July  this  year a record quantity of  tobacco  was

harvested - two and a half times the average  monthly

harvest  in  1957. The harvest was  142,816  pounds

tobacco. That is not just accidental. That  is  due

to  the  advice from Ministry officials who go  out

and  encourage  the  farmers as  to  the  lines  of

production.  We do not force them to  take  certain

lines  of production but we encourage them in  what

lines  they  wish to take, and that is  in  keeping

with the freedom of occupation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said shows that the tobacco crop has

greatly  increased.  Our  vegetable  production  is

steady and if we succeed in hydroponics, it will go

up further.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I think the Minister has

forgotten  to  answer my point  about  the  flower-growing industry, whether it is possible to develop

flower plantations here?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a supplementary question, Sir, is it possible

for  the  Minister  to have a long-term  policy  to

provide   more  farm  lands  for  the  professional

farmers?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The growing of flowers has

also  increased, Sir. In fact, the flower  industry

is  becoming  quite an export industry.  But  I  am

afraid  I have not got the figures with me to  show

the hon. Member how it has progressed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of more land for farmers - that is a

most  difficult question, because we are  short  of

land.  That  is why I say if we have a merger  with

the  Federation we can settle some of them on their

land.  Land  is  a commodity which we  cannot  just

create out of thin air. It is a god-sent thing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> No, no.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> As I said yesterday, there is

a  lot  of land available all over the world - under-populated  land - but  it is  closed  to  us  at  the

moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $109,130 for Head 31 ordered to stand

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

the  Minister for Commerce and Industry to tell  me

what   are   the   functions  of  the  Co-operative

Development Department and for what purpose  it  is

set up.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It was not set up by me, Sir.

It  existed when I took office as Minister, and the



hon.  Member  should have asked  this  question  in

1955,  when he first came into this House,  because

it was a department which had a grant in the Budget

then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Department is set up to encourage

the development of Co-operative Societies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, on this Head - Co-operative Development - I recollect that I filed a

question last year whether the Government would  be

prepared  to  extend  cash  loans  to  certain  Co-operative Societies. I remember, Sir, the  Minister

said they had a scheme to provide a certain amount,

say  $50,000, to the farmers or fishermen.  I  hope

the   Minister   will  take  this  opportunity   to

enlighten us, by giving details on the progress  of

such  a  scheme, and whether he intends to  provide

more money for such a scheme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I wish him to give an answer whether

or  not  he is satisfied with the progress  of  Co-operative Societies in Singapore. If not,  what  is

the main cause? Is it because there is no financial

support?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry,  in reply to my question  about  the

functions    of   this   Co-operative   Development

Department,  said that it was going to  look  after

the Co-operative Societies in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are spending a sum of $98,580 on this

Department.  What  I  want  to  know  is  why   the

Department itself is not doing anything, except  on

paper?  To  register the Co-operative Societies  in

Singapore  is  not  enough. I was  told  that  this

Department  is to look after the interests  of  the

farmers in the rural areas, to help them, but it is

only on paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder how many times the Minister has said he

would   look  into  this  problem  of  co-operative

development. It is a mere waste to spend  money  on

the staff in this Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister were to study carefully the

working system past and present in this Department,

he would have a shock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, Sir, that a Committee be set up to

look   into  the  functions  and  duties  of   this

Department.  And  I can tell you furthermore,  Sir,

that  when  this  Committee  investigate  into  the

functions   of  this  Department,   you   will   be

surprised; even the Minister will be surprised!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I myself am not

satisfied  with  the  progress  made  by  the   Co-operative Development Department. I have  not  been

satisfied since quite some time in the past.  There

is  nothing I can do about it, because we have  not

got   suitably   trained  officers   to   run   the

Department.  What we lack are Chinese  Co-operative

Officers who can speak the language and go  out  to

the  farmers and talk to them about the  advantages

of forming co-operatives. We could not get such men

and I even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>



said  so last year during the Budget debate. I  did

my  very best to get some officers, but we have not

succeeded. Therefore, it is the physical limitation

which we have not been able to overcome.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a sorry

admission by the Minister for Commerce and Industry

that he is not satisfied with that Department. What

has he done after all? Why cannot he improve? It is

no  use saying that he cannot get this officer;  he

cannot   get   that  officer;  he  cannot   recruit

experienced officers. That is not enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are spending $98,580 of the

people's  money  at the expense of  the  people  of

Singapore. If we are going to pay such a large  sum

to the staff of this Department, we should see that

it  is  functioning properly and  not  wasting  the

money, as in this case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Commerce and Industry just stands here and says, "I do not know. I admit that

this  Department is not very satisfactory.  I  have

looked into it, but we cannot get the men." That is

not the excuse we want.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It is not a sorry admission,

Sir,It is an honest admission. It is not just made

today;  it has been made a year ago. I do not  know

whether  I can say this, Sir,I have tried  to  get

another  officer, but the Public Service Commission

would  not  give  me another officer.  We  are  not

dictators  who  could  order  the  Public   Service

Commission  about.  And that  is  the  end  of  the

matter. I cannot do anything further than that. The

Minister is limited by the appointment made by  the

Public  Service Commission. Though I would like  to

have  a Chinese as the Head of the Department,  who

could  go  put  to  the  farmers  (who  are  mainly

Chinese)  so  that the co-operatives  can  progress

further,  I  suppose the Public Service  Commission

have not been able to find a suitable man. Probably

it  is not their fault. Possibly it is because they

cannot  find a suitable man. That is why we are  at

the moment restricted, as I have explained.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no use the Member on the other side jumping

about. It is beyond my capabilities to procure  the

right type of man.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are very

grateful  to  have  such  an  honest  Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry! It is very  surprising  to

hear  the  Minister  admit  the  standard  of  this

Department   called  the  Co-operative  Development

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front profess to be a Socialist Party.

I  think  it is the fundamental principle of  every



Socialist  to  encourage Co-operative Societies.  I

wonder why this Socialist Government can afford for

over three years to waste such a golden opportunity

to  encourage the co-operative movement - but because

the  Public Service Commission has failed to supply

an  officer.  The Government just say, "All  right,

you cannot give me, so I cannot have." Why does the

Minister  not scrap the Department if he  does  not

have  a  suitable  man to run it?  This  will  save

money, instead of allowing it to be placed under  a

Head  in the Budget and telling the people, "We,  a

Socialist  Government, encourage more  Co-operative

Societies, just not in fact."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has failed to answer my

question whether he has a scheme in mind to provide

more  cash  loans  to  the  already  existing   Co-operative Societies. I want him especially to  give

us  a detailed report on the $50,000 which has been

loaned to some Co-operative Societies.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, I personally do not

believe  that  there is any bright future  for  co-operative  development in Singapore. The only  area

where  co-operative  development  can  thrive   and

flourish  is  in the rural areas. In the  city,  we

have  had  experience of co-operative shops,  which

were a failure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>



The  only  thriving  bodies  are  the  co-operative

thrift   and   loan  societies  and   the   housing

societies.  I  think the Government should  do  all

they  can  to encourage such bodies so that  thrift

can be maintained by the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to co-operative development in the

rural areas, I am afraid there is very little  hope

for development. Particularly with the expansion of

rural development schemes, you will find there will

be no need for any kind of co-operative development

in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Why not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> The farmers in the rural areas, my

experience  shows,  are  individualists.  They  are

necessarily individualists because they have little

farmland,  and  whatever farmland they  have,  they

will have to make use of it for their own purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no facilities for collective farming - it

is  completely  out  of the question.  I  sincerely

believe   that  if  there  is  right   and   proper

encouragement   for  rural  development   and   its

projects,  that would be adequate for the  economic

advancement of the people in the rural areas. There

is no further room for any co-operative development

in  the  rural  areas. We have  tried  co-operative

development for many years in the rural  areas  and

yet we have not been able to progress.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member  for  Seletar says he has no  hope  for  co-operative  development  in  the  rural  areas.  The

Government,  Sir,  have  no  money  to   spend   on

essential services from which the people  can  have

benefits.  Yet they see fit to spend money  on  co-operative  development. The Government  should  see

that they get benefit out of this Department. It is

a fact that this Department is set up to look after

the  problem of the farmers. What actual  work  has

been  done by this Department? Only paper work.  It

only receives registrations or reports from all the

co-operative societies in Singapore,  and  that  is

done on paper. Nothing else, only paper work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister for Commerce and Industry is

sincere  about  his job, he should look  into  this

problem.  I  pray and urge him to  look  into  this

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he cannot find the proper people to run the

Department  then close it, rather  than  waste  the

public's money.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, my admission that I was

not  satisfied with the progress of the  Department

has been misconstrued by the Opposition Members who

have  urged me to close it down. Sir, I said I  was

not  satisfied with the progress. I did not say the

Department was useless. In fact, the Department  is

doing  some work, and the amount of money  that  is

budgeted for it is just the amount required for the

amount of work it is doing. If the Department  were

doing  more work, a bigger amount would  have  been

required.  Therefore, the amount which we  are  now

budgeting  for  is  the amount  necessary  for  the

amount of work the Department is doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I failed at the beginning to give some

figures. I thought they might not be necessary,  so

as not to prolong this debate. But I will give some

figures now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Co-operative Societies in existence

in 1954 - before we took over - was 61. Today there are

104, an increase of about 40 societies. So the  Co-operative  Department is encouraging the  formation

of  Co-operative Societies. But what I said  was  I

was  not  satisfied  with  the  rate  of  progress.

Instead of 40 more, I would have expected 200 more.



But  if we could have 200 more, the amount of money



required would have been probably doubled,  because

we  would  have to have more Co-operative Officers.

Therefore, it is a fallacious argument  to  pin  me



down  by  saying. "Why do you not  close  down  the

Department?" That is not the way to do things, Sir.

The  right way is to keep the Department going. Let



it  do the amount of work it can, having regard  to

the physical limitations at the moment. But, if you

have the Department, you could expand it in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>



future when you have the right type of men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the loan to the Agricultural Society,

Sir,  I think that was mentioned last year, when  I

said  in this House that the Government had  agreed

to  grant $50,000 to buy feeding stuffs and so  on,

provided the Society raised $10,000. There must  be

a  partnership. People in Singapore seem  to  think

that  if any Government agency, like the Industrial

Promotion  Board, is prepared to  give  money,  the

money  is  there for the asking, and that they  can

then  pocket the money and do what they like.  That

is  not  so.  Unless there is a partnership,  which

makes  the  person receiving the money  responsible

for  seeing that the work progresses well, I am not

prepared to grant a loan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That $10,000 which the Society promised to raise

last year, when the Budget was considered, has  not

been  raised up to now. Therefore, the loan is  not

given,  but  the offer is still open. If  they  can

raise  the $10,000, the Government will be prepared

to give them $50,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $98,580 for Head 32 ordered to stand

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to mote the amendment standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 33 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring up this amendment just to initiate

discussion  and  for the benefit  of  the  incoming

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a merchant judges the state of his business

by  his  balance sheet at the end of the  year.  We

have already judged the Labour Front Government  by

their  balance  sheet from the beginning  of  their

period of office to the end of that period now, and

I  have  got  very little to say on  that  subject,

because   Singapore  is  in  a   very   bad   shape

economically. The result is that the taxpayers  are

suffering, especially the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my remarks are for the incoming Government,

and  the  Hon, the  Financial Secretary  with  his

experience  of  finance, might be able  to  suggest

what could be done in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a free port, but it cannot

further  develop, unless exchange control is  fully

relaxed. Look at Hongkong. It flourishes because of

free  exchange. That is, any goods can go  in,  any

currency  can  get in and can be exchanged  on  its

value from day to day. The result of having a  free

exchange for Singapore will be that, like Hongkong,

she  can get her goods anywhere. They will be  much

cheaper.  That will reduce the cost of living,  and

on the cost of living, trade and industry depend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is happening today? There is a

relaxation  on  a few items because the  Federation

have  done  so, but it does not help us very  much.

The Federation have their own economic policy. They



are a free country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as long as we are a Colony and if we have

any  voice  in the Government, it is  our  duty  to

frame a policy for our own benefit. Of course, that

is   for  the  incoming  Government  to  say.  This

Government has failed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the very same goods which are prohibited

here  can  be had from Hongkong, at a higher  rate.

Actually,  the goods do not land in Hongkong.  They



are  just  shipped  there and, by  the  same  boat,

transhipped to Singapore, but the money is paid  in

Hongkong. A lot of American goods come in that way.

If  that  could be done, Sir, would it be  wise  to



spend so much money on retaining



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>



this  Department?  We  could at  least  reduce  the

expenditure  and  save  the  taxpayers'  money  and

improve the trade of the Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House for so many days we have been

hearing about a merger with the Federation. All the

Parties have agreed that one day Singapore and  the

Federation  will  be  one  unit.  But  until   that

happens,  we  have to frame a policy  for  our  own

economic   progress,  for  the   benefit   of   the

taxpayers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merger will certainly come one day. How? Only

when the British can no longer retain this place as

a colony, as a result of pressure from other Asian-African nations, or when they have fulfilled  their

own purpose.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Federation will automatically take over

Singapore.   So  a  merger  depends  on   political

development. Then why waste time and energy on this

empty  talk  at present? It is an idea  which  will

take shape much later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the incoming Government will work out

an  economic policy. If the Federation should grant

us   preferential  rates  of  tariffs   for   goods

manufactured  in Singapore, we will  certainly  toe

their line. But, so long as we are handicapped  and

separated  from them, and also if  we  are  to  toe

their line, it will lead us nowhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is a financial problem, I hope the

Financial  Secretary  might be  able  to  reply  or

advise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, banking facilities in Singapore are the best

in  the  world. Many countries have  not  got  such

banking  facilities. They can be developed more  to

the  benefit  of  Singapore  by  a  free  exchange,

especially  in  regard to trade with Indonesia,  on

which we depend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past from 1945 when the British

reoccupied  this place till March 1955, there  were

some  of  us who did our best to get the Government

to  relax as much control as possible. At  a  later

stage,  there was a majority of elected Members  in

this  Assembly, but the Government were  not  in  a

position  to exercise their right as to  what  they

should do, because they were in the minority.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>



They  had  to  rely on the votes of ex-officio  and

nominated  Members.  At that time,  the  Government

could have resigned and said, "Look, we want this."

But they hung on to their posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the incoming Government will pursue

this problem of freeing exchange control as far  as

possible for the benefit of Singapore



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, year in and year out we

have  had the same debate on the policy of  foreign

exchange  control, and the arguments  advanced  are

the   same  fallacious  arguments  about  following

Hongkong.  Year  in and year out  I  have  kept  on

repeating that Hongkong is in a different position.

Hongkong  is  earning dollars. We are  not  earning



that  amount of dollars. Perhaps, Sir, hon. Members

are not aware that our net dollar earnings per year

amount  to M$19.3 million and that we are  spending

far, far more than that on imports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said that we have made a few

relaxations because the Federation Government  have

done  so. That is an absurd suggestion, Sir. I made

a statement in this House on the 12th of this month

that  the  Government were going to  liberalise  23

items and that that was agreed with the Federation.

Sir,   the   words  used  were  "agreed  with   the



Federation".  It  was  not  that  we  followed  the

Federation.  We "agreed with the Federation".  They

announced  it  first because their Council  sitting

was earlier than ours. Our Assembly sitting was two

days later. So it is no use trying to take away the

credit   by  saying  that  we  are  following   the

Federation.  It  was a parallel decision  taken  by

both Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can well see the benefit of having a free

exchange  market  here, the same  as  in  Hongkong,

where  you can buy all the American goods you  want

and  then sell them; but this limitation comes  in:

that  you cannot buy American goods unless you  can

sell  to  American areas and get the hard currency,

and  Hongkong  has  the hard  currency  because  of

remittances.  She  has  a big  amount  of  earnings

through remittances from overseas Chinese, from the

American States and Hawaii, and so on. We have  not

got that source of income of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>



American dollars. What American dollars we earn are

only  from  export  of goods which  do  not  really

belong to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer is always fond of

saying,    "This   Government   have   failed    in

everything." Of course, he has every right to  hold

his  opinion.  He  would have  liked  to  see  this

Government go out of office; hence his anxiety over

the  non-resignation of the Government. That  is  a

perfectly  democratic opinion, Sir,  and  I  cannot

quarrel with him. He said that this Government have

failed.  Sir,  this Government have not  failed  in

safeguarding  the  economy of Singapore.  Hence  my

announcement  of  "protection"  and  various  other

measures  to  safeguard our  economy  and  to  find

employment for our growing population.  If  we  had

failed in our duty, Sir, I would not have announced

all these measures even though they were introduced

at  a  late date. This Government are very much  on

the alert to see that we benefit as much as we can.

But  as regards foreign exchange and hard currency,



we  must  face the fact that we spend more  dollars

than we earn, and if at any time we liberalise  and

tell the United Kingdom. "We want to get out of the

sterling  area,"  they will say, "Go  ahead."  Then

what do we do? For our own immediate requirement of

dollar  goods - the essential goods - we will  have  to

find the dollars and where are we going to get  the

dollars  from? It is very easy, Sir, to talk  about

relaxations, but one has got to face facts;  and  I

warn the incoming Government to be very careful how

they  go about this. If they go blindly into  this,

they might wreck the economy of the country. It  is

not a problem that can be treated lightly. It is  a

problem  that  has  got  to be  thoroughly  studied

before a decision can be taken. I myself. Sir,  was

all  in favour of liberalising before I took office

as Minister. Then when I had the facts and figures.

I  found  that  we  are a big  dollar  earner  only



through  the dollars earned by the Federation  from

their  rubber.  The  Member  also  said  that   the

Federation  as  a  free country  have  an  economic

policy  and that is exactly the crux of the matter.

If tomorrow the Federation decide to have a Central



Bank with their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>



own  currency and have nothing to do with us,  then

all  our dollar earnings from their rubber and  tin

will  go  to  the Federation - even the  $19  million

which  we earn now we might not earn. That  is  not

understood  by  the  Members of  the  Opposition - at

least by certain Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I do not agree with the

arguments put forward by the Member for Telok Ayer.

I  will go even further and support the explanation



given by the Minister for Commerce and Industry  as

regards   the  difference  between  Singapore   and

Hongkong.  I  think about US$200 million  per  year

flows  into Hongkong. A lot of money comes in  also

from    corrupted    Kuomintang   officials,    the

Philippines,  and certain unstable South-East  Asia

territories, because there are no restrictions.  It

is  also  easier  to  settle  down  permanently  in

Hongkong  than  here. Therefore, I  entirely  agree

with  the  explanation given by  the  Minister  for

Commerce and Industry that we do not earn  as  much

American dollars as Hongkong does.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one point I cannot understand, Sir, is that

Singapore and Malaya are known as territories which

enjoy  a  surplus of dollar earnings  and  now  the

Minister tells us that it is not so and that we are

overspending.  As regards the many tons  of  rubber

exported  to  the  United States,  whether  through

illegal   channels   or  through   smuggling   from

Indonesia, I wonder where the foreign exchange goes

to.  As  regards  the many tons of rubber  exported

from  Singapore  to the United States  I  wish  the

Minister  would  enlighten us  whether  the  dollar

payments  are made to the Federation of  Malaya  or

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I do not support the entire

relaxation of foreign control, but I would like the

Government  and any future government  to  bear  in

mind  one  thing:  wisely adapt overselves  to  the

peculiar economic conditions in South-East Asia  as

we  are at the cross-roads between the East and the

West  and  also the centre of South-East  Asia.  We

have always enjoyed a certain amount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>



of  invisible trade and because of this there is  a

lot  of  invisible foreign exchange.  Therefore,  I

wish  the  Minister should have the  discretion  to

determine  whether such invisible foreign  exchange

transactions should be overlooked or should  be  in

accordance   with  the  Foreign  Exchange   Control

Regulations.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, there is one point that

I  missed - before I come to the Member for Changi - in

my reply to the Member for Telok Ayer, and that is,

he  said  that the goods coming from Hongkong  were

more expensive and that if we were in a free dollar

area we could buy those goods cheaper. But one must

remember the fact that the window of Hongkong which

is  open  to  us  is a concession, because  of  our

peculiar  economy as an entrepot centre.  In  fact,

the  other  sterling  area countries - Burma,  India,

Pakistan,  and so on - do not enjoy that  concession.

That  is  a concession given to us because  we  are



regular   trading  partners  with   some   of   the

surrounding  countries, and  it  would  affect  our

trade if we were not granted that concession. So  a

concession  was  given to us to  let  these  dollar

goods  come  into Singapore through  Hongkong - those

for  which no direct allocation was given. Now,  to

say  that  we could buy goods cheaper,  if  we  buy

direct,  means  that  we are  trying  to  make  the

concession  as  of right. And if it boils  down  to

questions  of rights, then I can assure this  House

that we will be at a loss.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the rights that we have on dollars,

they  can only be on the dollars that we earn,  and

what  we  earn  is  negligible as compared  to  our

expenditure. The dollars that we earn  belong  more

to  the  Federation  and  to  Indonesia,  from  the

rubber,  raw materials and other things  that  come

from   them.  Indonesia  has  a  right  under   the

agreement  to demand us to pay in U.S. dollars  for

that  portion of goods that we export to the dollar

areas.  In fact, we are having a liberal policy  on

the export of dollar goods, except of capital goods

to Indonesia. We do not place the same restrictions

place on other countries, and that is because we

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I thought I could make the

Hon, the Financial Secretary say a few words on  my

amendment, but he has not chosen to do so. Perhaps,

this  item  that we are discussing comes under  the

Ministry  of Commerce and Industry. I do  not  know

whether  he is going to speak or not but  that  was

what I did request of him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the balance sheet shows the failure of the

Government. Any householder, any business  concern,

city  or  country, knows what it has inherited  and

how it is living. It is no use talking empty words.

As  I said, I brought up this amendment in order to



give some ideas to the future incoming Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I think the Minister for

Commerce  and Industry has not answered a  point  I

raised.   Perhaps  he  may  want  to  consult   his

Permanent  Secretary. Sir, I want the  Minister  to

give  me  a  straightforward  answer,  whether   he

recognises that, because of our position today,  we

have a lot of invisible trade and therefore we  are

bound to have a certain amount of invisible foreign

exchange.  Will the Minister admit that that  is  a

fact?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take this opportunity, Sir, to remind

the   Hon. the  Financial  Secretary   that   the

Comptroller  of  Income Tax should  also  have  the

discretion  to  determine whether to show  leniency

towards    such    invisible    foreign    exchange

transactions. Is that possible or is that the  case

now?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, "invisible" had better

remain   invisible.  If  there  are  any  invisible

imports,  I  can assure the hon. Member  that  they

will  be quite visible when they are exports,  from

which we earn the dollars., because any exports  to

the dollar area have to be fully declared. However,

Sr, the term "invisible income" is normally applied

to  income  arising out of services rendered,  like

freight, insurance, and so on,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>

about  the Government inheriting so much money  and

squandering  so much of it, I answered  that  fully

yesterday,  but unfortunately the hon.  Member  was

outside  the House. And I do not think that  it  is

necessary for me to repeat here for his benefit. He

may look up the Hansard.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister for Commerce and Industry, on the one

hand, tries to protect our local industries but, on

the  other  hand,  encourages  foreign  capital  or

foreign industries to come in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishing industry is a very essential industry

in Singapore. Fish is not only one of the essential

commodities of food but the industry also  provides

employment  for  about 2,000 people.  These  people

include those employed in the shops as well as  the

fishermen who use the boats or prahus. If  everyone

of  these  fishermen has to look after his  family,

say,  of  five people, it means that the livelihood

of at least 10,000 people depends on this industry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instead of assisting the fishermen, the

Minister  for Commerce and Industry is helping  the

Japanese  people to come here and compete with  our

local  fishermen. Japanese ships  are  1icensed  to

bring in fish to this place, and the competition is

so  keen that most of our local fish merchants  may

have  to  close down. They are facing a very  grave

situation, and if they do close down, what will  be

the  fate of these people? They will certainly have

to face unemployment, and if there is unemployment,

then  it will be an additional burden on the State,

because  the State will have to provide  for  their

welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising out of this, Sir, fish merchants intend

to  guard  themselves  by  forming  a  company  and

building  some  sort  of a wholesale  market.  This

wholesale market will sell fish brought in  by  the

fishermen.  At  the present moment,  the  fish  now

brought  in is sold in the City Council markets - the

Clyde   Terrace   Market   and   the   Ellenborough

Market - and the City Council impose a five per  cent

levy on the cost of all fish sold through these two

markets. With this levy, the price of fish  becomes

much  dearer,  because  the  wholesalers  and   the

retailers  have  to  increase  their  price.   This

proposed market will be run more or less on  a  co-operative basis. The running of the market will  be

by the fish merchants themselves, and the directors

and shareholders will be strictly confined to those

who   are   in  the  fishing  industry.  With   the

establishment of this new market, it  will  provide

employment for more people. This market  will  also

have  an  ice  factory of its own, and more  people

will  again have to be employed. At the same  time,

this  company  proposes  to supply  fishermen  with

petrol.  At the moment, these fishermen  get  their

petrol  from the Shell Company, Stanvac and Caltex,

and they are charged quite a high price; but if  it

is  bought through this proposed company, the price

will definitely be cheaper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If funds are available, this company also

proposes  to  train local youth  in  the  different

methods of fish-catching, so that the industry will

be developed very soon. What is most disappointing,

Sir,  is  that the Government are not in the  least

interested   in  this  project.  The  company   has

approached  the  Government for assistance  in  the

form  of  money  or  land,  but  unfortunately  the

Government,  instead of giving a blessing  to  this

project, has replied that land is not available. So

the Government are not able to help this company in

establishing  the new market. As far  as  we  know,

Sir,  quite a big piece of land is allotted to  the

proposed  Constitution Exposition in  Kallang,  and

this  will  last  for only a few months.  When  the

Constitution  Exposition closes  down,  there  will

certainly be a big piece of land to offer. Why  can

the  Government not consider offering a portion  of

this land to this new company? It is not a question

of  whether  land  is available or  not.  It  is  a

question of whether Government are prepared to give

a  blessing to this company so that it will provide

more employment and, at the same time, cheaper fish

for  the people of Singapore. I hope that when  the

Constitution  Exposition  comes  to  an  end,   the

Government  will  reconsider the matter  again  and

offer a bit of land at the old Kallang Airport site

to  this  company, so that it can establish  a  new

market   which   will  be  able  to  provide   more

employment and cheaper fish.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before we

carry  on  with  this debate. I wish  to  place  on

record the distinguished service of the Head of the

Fisheries  Department, Dr Tham Ah Kow, whose  high

integrity and efficiency deserve our praise. He  is

also  generally  acclaimed by the  fishmongers  and

fish  agents  alike as being helpful,  and  he  has

greatly impressed the fishing industrialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year I raised the point that the

Minister   in   charge  of  this  industry   should

encourage or maintain the fishing industry. We know

that fishing can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>



be  divided  into  at least three categories:  off-shore fishing, deep-sea fishing and the rearing  of

fish. I think this is the only opportunity for  the

Minister  to  give us full details of the  progress

made  so  far  this year in respect of the  fishing

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On deep-sea fishing, Sir, the Member for

Queenstown  criticised the invitation  extended  to

the  Japanese, and that there has been very  little

progress because our local fishing industry has not

received  sincere and good co-operation from  them.

Therefore,  I  wish  to take  this  opportunity  of



reminding the Minister to take careful steps not to

cause  misunderstanding in the minds of the  public

that  there  is an unjustified arrangement  already

set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to off-shore fishing, I am sure that

the  Minister for Commerce and Industry knows about

the catches of many kelongs (fishing-stakes) around

our island. The yearly catches have been very poor.

What  advice or what steps has the Ministry offered



to  the proprietors of such kelongs? Sir, they  may

invest,  say,  $10,000 to $50,000  in  one  fishing

stake,  and yet the catches are not certain.  I  do

not  think that it is proper for the Government  to

let  these kelong proprietors carry on with such  a

wasteful scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, on the rearing of fish, I think the

Minister  should encourage more fish ponds  in  Ulu

Pandan, Tekong and many other swampy places. I wish

the Minister for Commerce and Industry can give  us

a   detailed   explanation  on  the  fish   rearing

industry,  the offer of technical advice  and  also

the availability of land.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  although the curfew in the Straits of  Johore

has  been partially lifted, complaints and  grouses

are  still  being made to me about the susah  being

caused  by  the police in Johore to the  fishermen.

Sir,  I do hope that the Minister for Commerce  and



Industry  will  look into the matter and  alleviate

these people's hardships.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> First, Sir, I wish to

associate  myself  with  the  Member  for  Changi's

remarks regarding the Chief Fisheries Officer,  Dr

Tham  Ah Kow. He is a very capable officer and  one

of the best we have had in Government service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown, Sir, raised the

question  of the application of a local company  to

set  up  a  central  fish  market.  Sir,  while   I

sympathise  with the applicants, it is  unfortunate

that  we  have  not got the land and  therefore  we

cannot consider the application. We have not got  a

suitable  site. The site he mentioned  at  the  old

Kallang Airport was the site Government had in mind

for  a  central wholesale fish market quite  a  few

years  ago, but the City Council wanted to  make  a

public  park  there,  because of  the  big  housing

development on the other side of Mount-batten Road,

and  we could not do anything about it. That is why

that land is not available for such a project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned that while I am trying to

protect  local  industries I  am  also  encouraging

foreign  capital to come into the same  industries.

Well, that is precisely why the job of the Minister



for  Commerce and Industry is difficult - to try  and

balance  conflicting interests in most cases,  such

as  the conflicting interests of trade against  the

interests of industry; the conflicting interests of

local capital against those of foreign capital; the

conflicting  interests of importers  of  eggs  from

China   against  the  interests  of  local  farmers

engaged  in  the  production  of  eggs.  The  local

farmers  want  me to stop the import of  eggs  from

China   but  the  importers  want  me  to  continue

importing. It is all a matter of trying to  balance

both  sides  to a fine level so that  you  reach  a

point where neither side would be in a position  of

disadvantage.



<br><br>11.30 a.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are four joint projects with the



Japanese  that were licensed and the condition  was

that the major portion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>



of  the capital must be local capital, and that  is

so.  Therefore, there is no question of  a  foreign

element  control there, but the local  companies - it

is  local capital in majority - are co-operating with

and getting assistance from the Japanese to develop

fisheries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, fisheries is a subject which should not only

be  looked  at  from the viewpoint  of  the  people

engaged in it, but also from the viewpoint  of  the

million   and  a  half  customers - the   public   of

Singapore - and  a big portion of the public  depends

on  fish  as  the  main  source  of  their  protein

requirements,  because fish is the cheapest  source

of  proteins  and  is  also one  which,  if  tapped

properly,  can yield unlimited amounts of  protein,

unlike cattle rearing which is limited by the  size

of  grazing  grounds and so on. Therefore,  it  has

always   been  my  policy  to  try  and   encourage

fisheries  in the common interest of the public  of

Singapore,  who could then get cheap fish.  At  the

same  time,  I  do  not want  to  snatch  away  the

livelihood of the local fishermen, as shown by  the

fact that I have only licensed four enterprises  so

far.  In  so doing, I am balancing the requirements

of  the  public  for  cheap  fish  as  against  the

question   of  the  livelihood  of  the   fishermen

engaged,  so that the price of fish, due to  bigger

catches through these joint projects, comes down to

a  level where the local fishermen will not die but

will  just  survive; and the public will get  cheap

fish  at  a  level cheaper than they  were  getting

before,  but not as cheap as if you threw open  the

whole  field to any corner, in which case the  fish

prices  would go down further and the public  would

benefit  but then these 4,500 fishermen  and  their

dependants would suffer. Sir, there is no  question

of  Japanese  under-cutting. It is local  companies

that  are  engaged in it with Japanese  assistance.

They are not Japanese companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, coming to this big tuna project. I

think  this has aroused a bit of fear in the  minds

of  certain big local operators. The scheme  is  to

use Singapore as a base for tuna operations. Up  to

now, catches of tuna in the Indian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>



Ocean  are  taken right up to Japan for canning  or

for  gutting  and freezing and then re-exported  to

America  and Europe. Now, I told the Japanese,  "If

you take your catches to Japan you are losing about

two  weeks'  sailing  time  between  Singapore  and

Japan - your  catches  are beyond  Singapore  in  the

Indian Ocean. If you use Singapore as the base, you

save two weeks of operational costs on your fishing

fleet,  by saving the sailing time which is wasted.

It  is  the  fishing time that is paying,  not  the



sailing  time."  That viewpoint  they  thought  was

advantageous  and then we had further  discussions,

and I insisted that half the capital must be local.

The scheme now has been arranged in such a way that



49  per  cent of the capital will be subscribed  by

the  Japanese,  49  per cent by the  local  fishing

interests,   and  2  per  cent  by  the  Industrial

Promotion Board. Because neither side would give in

to  51 per cent holding by the other side, I called

them together and I took the chair at that meeting.

They both insisted on 51 per cent, so I said, "This



is  the best solution. Both of you hold 49 per cent

each, and let Government be the referee, holding  2

per  cent",  and  both  sides  were  happy  at  the

solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have said that no catches will be allowed

to  be  marketed in the Singapore market from  this

tuna project, so that all the tuna coming here will

be put into cold storage, gutted, canned, processed

and then re-exported; and the other fish that comes

in  could be sold in fish-ball form or in processed

form, also under limitation; but no fresh fish will

be  allowed to be put in the market to compete with

local  fishermen until such time as another  scheme

which  I  have and which is also tied up with  this

comes into being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this other scheme, which I shall now explain,

this  company  will  have to pay  a  landing  fee - a

certain  percentage of the value  of  its  catches.

Now,  that  landing  fee to  be  collected  by  the



Government  will be put into a special  fund.  This

fund   will  go  towards  subsidizing  those  local

fishermen who will be affected. Once that  fund  is

of  a  sufficient amount, we will allow this  joint

Japanese project to market its other catches beside

the ordinary local catches, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>



that  will bring the prices of fish down to a  very

low  level  so that the public will get cheap  fish

and  the fishermen who will be affected by the  low

prices  will be subsidized by this fund. Now,  this

sort  of scheme operates even in England where they

have  a  "White Fish Authority", and I  think  they

levy a fee to subsidize the fishing industry. So by

this scheme the public will get cheap fish and  the

fishermen will be happy because they get a  subsidy

from the fund collected from the company. That,  in

short, is the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the question of off-shore

fishing - the  catches of the kelongs  have  dropped.

Sir,  I  have  said that off-shore fishing  grounds



have  been  fished to the limit. No  more  fish  is

available there and you cannot go round chasing the

fish into the kelong. It is impossible. And we have

stopped licensing new kelongs entirely. We  do  not

give  any licence unnecessarily, because it is  not

profitable for kelongs to operate. Besides they are

choking  up  all the shipping lanes at the  moment.

All our surrounding waters are choked up with these



kelongs. The kelong operators who put in $20,000 to

$50,000  would be well advised to go into a  scheme

similar  to  this  joint tuna project,  where  they

could  set  up  a  new industry  from  new  fishing

grounds, new types of fish and new markets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Did you advise them?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Oh, yes! We called a

roundtable conference a week back when the Japanese

came  here to finalise the arrangements with me.  I

said,  "We  have called a meeting of local  fishing

companies - the  Local  Fish  Merchants'  Association

where  the  big  towkays are - and  I  explained  the

project  to them:" The local fish companies  had  a

meeting   with  the  Japanese  and  they  came   to

loggerheads as to who should hold the 51  per  cent

capital.  I entered at this stage and I  said,  "Do

not  quarrel. Both of you hold 49 per cent each and

we,  the  Industrial Promotion Board,  hold  2  per

cent", and they were both happy. The Japanese  have

gone back now to finalise the project at their end.

The only thing is that the local people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>



should raise the 49 per cent of capital and if they

do not raise this amount, the Japanese are not keen

to  go  ahead with the project. They say definitely

that  unless  they  can get into  partnership  with

local  capital,  they will not go  ahead  with  the

project.  So  we might find that this project  also

fails  because the local capital is not interested.

So do not blame me for that!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Lim, Sir, I am very glad

that the Minister has the interests of the one  and

a  half  million people of Singapore at  heart,  by

reducing  the  price of fish. But the  question  is

this: if he is really sincere in wanting to provide

cheap  fish  for  the  people,  why  could  he  not

encourage  this  wholesale  market,  because   this

market is more or less run on a co-operative basis?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour back we were discussing co-operative

movements  and the Minister himself  said  that  he

would   do   his  best  to  help  the  co-operative

movement. This is the sort of co-operative movement

which  will  provide employment and,  at  the  same

time, help to bring down the price of fish. So just

by giving the excuse that no land is available is a

very  lame excuse! What is of more concern  is  the

policy of the Government. Is Government prepared to

give  its blessing to this enterprise? If so,  then

say  that  the Government is prepared to help.  The

question  of  land can be looked into later.  As  I

have   said   just   now,  Sir,  the   Constitution

Exposition  may close down very soon, and  when  it

does,  there will be plenty of land available.  But

even  if  there  is  no  land  available,  if   the

Government   or  the  Minister  is   sincere,   the

establishment of the wholesale market can be in the

sea; it is not necessary that it should be on land.

It  can  be a jetty built out to the sea.  I  think



that will serve a better purpose, because when  the

catch comes in, it is from the sea and it can  also

be washed in the sea; all the dirty water runs back

to  the  sea.  So  the question is:  is  Government

prepared to give its blessing? Do not give  a  lame

excuse that no land is available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to tuna fishing, the Minister says that

those  who  have invested about $50,000 in  kelongs

can come into the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>



tuna  canning  industry. Quite so,  but  with  that

$50,000  in  a  $5 million or $10 million  project,

what  authority or what sort of employment  can  be

offered  to these people? But with that $50,000  to

start  a kelong, the proprietor can feed his family

and  at the same time provide employment for  about

20  persons. With this $50,000 invested in the tuna

canning  industry,  will  he  be  able  to  provide

employment for himself and his employees? Certainly

not.  According to the Minister, the  Japanese  are

subscribing  49  per cent of the capital,  and  the

local  fishermen 49 per cent. The capital from  the

Japanese is contributed by a Japanese firm, whereas

the capital to be contributed locally will have  to

come  from all the fishermen; some may be  able  to

invest  $1,000, some $10,000. Now, will  this  tuna

company  be able to provide employment for all  the

investors? The position is entirely different. What

the fishermen are having now is that their catch is

made  here  and they sell it to provide  employment

for  themselves as well as for their employees. But

if  they are to shut down their kelongs, what  will

be the fate of those who are employed there? If the

Minister can assure me that this tuna industry will

be able to absorb all the employees employed by the

kelongs  or fish merchants, well and good.  I  will

assist in encouraging local fishermen to contribute

this  49  per  cent capital. But  the  question  of

employment  is of more concern. The raising  of  49

per  cent  is simple, as there are quite a  lot  of

rich people here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Lim, Sir, I think the

Minister  has failed to answer my question  on  the

fish  rearing  industry. I  want  the  Minister  to

answer whether a survey has been made, a scheme has

been implemented, and whether there are any grounds

available for fishing.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Coming to the point raised by

the Member for Changi, the prawn pond scheme at Ulu

Pandan is progressing. We hope to have surveyed the

land,  and  I  think  lots will be  allocated  very

shortly, probably next month or so. It takes  quite

some time to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>



get the land surveyed and cut into reasonable-sized

lots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the point raised by the Member for

Queenstown, he said that the wholesale fish  market

proposed  by  these people was a co-operative  fish

market and, therefore, it would reduce the cost  of

fish.  I  am not convinced, Sir, that that will  be

so, because the element of a co-operative scheme is

co-operation from the ground level, that  is,  from

those  who are at the producing level - the fishermen

who go out in their boats and catch the fish - and if

they are involved in that co-operative fish market,

then  the  hon.  Member's argument that  that  will

bring  down  the price of fish may be correct.  But

that is not so. As far as I know about this scheme,

the  co-operation  comes from the fish  wholesalers

who  are the middlemen. Now these middlemen are the

people  who make the most profits out of the  fish.

It  is not the poor fisherman who gets it - he hardly



earns  $5  a  day.  The  middlemen  buy  from   the

fishermen  and  sell the fish in the  City  Council

markets - they make the biggest profits. Now,  it  is

precisely  these middlemen who are going  to  found

the  co-operative market. What they want to do  is,

instead  of paying the 5 per cent tax to  the  City

Council  for using their markets, they  want  their

own  market and so save the 5 per cent.  That  does

not  mean  that  they will sell the  fish  cheaper.

However, I have not gone into the scheme in  detail



because,  as  I said, there was no land  available,

which is the first requirement, and therefore there

was no point in my going into the scheme in detail.

It  is  no  use talking about jetties being  built,



because we have investigated that possibility,  and

it will cost at least a few million dollars to have

a  jetty  built down there. It will  block  up  the

entrance to vessels coming into the harbour.  There

is  also  the  question of draught of  the  vessels

coming  in.  If  the available land were  suitable,

then  the  Government would have used  it  for  the

establishment of a fish market, because  Government

has had this project in mind since five years ago.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, on the tuna project again. He says,

"Will these $50,000-capitalists be able to have any

say  in  the $5 million - $10 million project?"  Sir,

the  project is only for $2 million, out  of  which

the  total  capital  is going to  be  only  half  a

million  dollars,  and the rest  has  to  be  found

through  loans, banking arrangements,  and  so  on.

And,  therefore, anyone who puts in $50,000 can  be



assured that he will have quite a good say  in  the

project.  And  it is not a Japanese  firm  that  is

contributing  49 per cent. It is a group  of  firms

who   have  got  themselves  together  into  a  new

company.  Sir, I think there are four or  five  big

Japanese  fishing firms who have grouped themselves

into a company to enter into this project jointly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of employment in this tuna

project,  Sir,  we  estimate  that  it  will   give

employment to about 30 persons. It is possible that

it  might  not  give employment to all  the  number

employed in the kelongs; but there again, Sir,  you

come up against this conflict - and this conflict  is

evident now all over the world. It is a question of

automation versus labour power. Efficiency can only

be  secured  through automation, through machinery,

and  so on, and through big-sized projects. On  the

other  hand,  you can have more employment  through

smaller-sized projects using more labour.  However,

you will not get the same amount of efficiency, and

therefore in certain matters in which efficiency is

not of great importance, we just close our eyes and

do  not  encourage automation. But in the  case  of

fisheries,  efficiency will bring about a  lowering

of  the  price  of fish and that will  benefit  the

whole  population  of  Singapore.  Now,  it  is   a

question  of  balancing the benefits to  the  whole

population  as  against the loss of  employment  of

maybe  a few hundred. But there again, I have  said

we  will have a fund to subsidize those who  suffer

by  it,  and  that  fund will be paid  out  of  the

earnings of the particular industry itself, and not

out of Government funds.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Lim, Sir, I am afraid the

Minister  has misunderstood me. I think  I  clearly

said  that  in the establishment of this  wholesale

market,  all  the  shareholders  will  be  strictly

confined  to  those  in the fishing  industry,  and

those in the fishing industry do not mean they  are

wholesalers  or auctioneers. Those in  the  fishing

industry  mean the fishermen who do the catch,  the

wholesalers, the retailers and those who are in the

fishing line, like selling fishing nets. So  it  is

not only the wholesalers who are going to reap the 5

per  cent for themselves, but it is for the benefit

of everyone engaged in the fishing industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the tuna canning industry, the Minister

said  that  four or five companies  in  Japan  have

grouped themselves together to produce this 49  per

cent.  These  companies do not  really  depend  for

their  livelihood on the income to be derived  from

Singapore;  whereas the 49 per cent  local  capital

comes  from  nearly 50 people,  not  four  or  five

people. I am afraid that even 50 people may not  be

able  to  contribute that 49 per cent, because  the

rich  capitalists are not prepared to invest  their

money in such an industry. It is only those in  the

line  who  are  prepared,  but  they  do  not  have

sufficient money to contribute to a capital  of  49

per cent. Therefore, this 49 per cent will have  to

be  contributed  by about 50, 100 people, or  even

1,000  people.  So  just compare  the  difference - a

group  of  companies  of four or  five  people  and

another  group of company of about nearly a hundred

or  even a thousand people. That is the difference.

And a further difference is that these four or five



people in Japan do not depend on their income  from

this source, whereas the few hundred people who are

contributing to the 49 per cent local  capital  are

really  dependent  for  their  livelihood  on  this

source.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I think the same

argument could be applied to the Member's suggested

co-operative  scheme.  It might  be  200  fishermen

joining  in  a  co-operative and  contributing  $10

each,  because  they cannot afford  to  raise  more

money.  But  you  might  have  10  big  wholesalers

contributing about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>



$50,000 each; then the control will rest with them,

because they have a bigger amount of money involved

in  the  project,  even though  you  say  that  the

project does involve fishermen and wholesalers  and

so  on.  But  the wholesalers will be  the  biggest

contributors to the capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 36 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead  1

therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my main purpose in raising this question is

to  bring  to the notice of the Minister  what  the

import and export trade means to Singapore. Despite

repeated  statements  that the  entrepot  trade  of

Singapore  is  dying,  and  cannot  even   maintain

itself,   I   cannot  agree  with  the  substituted

solutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have mentioned in my speech on Exchange

Control,  we  must wisely and cleverly utilize  our

geographical  position which is at the  cross-roads

of  South-East  Asia. We provide one  of  the  best

harbour,    banking   and   insurance   facilities.

Therefore, we cannot blindly follow the import  and



export  control  policies of other  countries.  The

person  who  is  in charge of imports  and  exports

should have a very good understanding of and be  in

possession   of   practical  field   knowledge   of

Singapore's  import  and  export  trade.  Sir,  for

example,  we  have discovered that  there  is  very

little  chance of re-exporting luxury  goods.  Such

goods  are  mainly for local consumption,  and  the

person in charge of imports and exports should  try

to  discourage the importation of luxury goods  for

subsequent re-export.

charge  of imports and exports, Sir. The Controller

of  Imports and Exports is not really the Minister.

The  Minister only makes the orders. But  the  hon.



Member might as well say the Minister!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. The

Minister  should possess wide discretionary  powers

to determine whether certain goods should or should

not  be  encouraged  for import,  and,  vice-versa,

whether  such  goods  should  or  should   not   be

encouraged for export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the old story all over again - but it

is  quite  a  serious blow. We have to improve  the

standard of living of our people here. But we  must

try to buy as cheap as we can from abroad. But then

there is the question of dumping, Sir. Why must the

Minister take such measures against dumping? Has he

the interests of Singapore at heart - to maintain the

entrepot  trade, to make ii easy for our  merchants

to  re-export such cheap goods, and also to provide

cheaper  goods for our people? No, because we  have

to  accede  to  requests  from  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  But the Minister can prove to us  that  he

possesses  such  discretionary powers  by  applying

them  to  many other things. Sir, take the case  of

American-made  motor cars. I cannot understand  why

we  are faced with such a problem in the streets of

Singapore.  Yet we need not. Numerous big  American

cars  get  in. Sir, to give an example. Compare  my

Ford  Popular with the Ford Plymouth. I  think  two

Ford  Popular cars equal one Ford Plymouth in size.

And when it comes to parking, how convenient it  is



for   the  Ford  Popular!  That  is  one  practical

suggestion to solve the traffic problem,  but  that

is of secondary importance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning we have heard that we overspend our

dollar earnings. I always think that the dollar  is

very  important in any finance. Therefore, why  can

we  not  try  to control the use of such  money  by

discouraging  the import of luxury  goods?  I  have

just quoted an example to the Minister: to consider

whether  he  is prepared to exercise his discretion

to  encourage or discourage imports and exports  in

the interests of the people of Singapore.<br>



12.00 noon.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, firstly, the Member for

Changi  is  labouring under a misapprehension.  All

the  big American cars that come to Singapore  have

not  been  paid in American dollars. The cars  come

through Hongkong, and we pay in sterling. We do not

allow  the  expenditure  of  American  dollars   on

American cars, except a few of them that come  from

Canada.  But  that  is  not  a  big  slice  of  the

expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member talked about the action

against dumping. Sir, at no time have we taken  any

action against dumping as such. I believe again  he

is referring to the action we have taken in banning

certain  textiles from China. I made it very  clear

that that was a step taken to assist the Federation

Government at their request. It is a temporary step

which  will  be reviewed at the end of this  month.

There  is  no  question of our having taken  action



against   the   dumping  of  Chinese  textiles   in

Singapore.  We have never said that  there  is  any

dumping like that, and my statement did not contain

that word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister can certainly use his discretion in the interest of the country, by limiting or

restricting imports; but every time he takes such a

step, the Chambers of Commerce are going to fly  at

his throat. I know full well how much opposition  I

am encountering from the Chambers of Commerce in my

drive  to  protect  the local  industry,  which  is

dying,  because  they  are  against  any  sort   of

restriction. However, restriction is necessary, and

I  am going to fight and protect the local industry

whenever I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>



think there is a justified case for protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another aspect, and that is, the

Minister cannot just introduce restriction  as  and

when  he  likes. Singapore is a member of  G.A.T.T.

(General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade),  and  we



have  an obligation towards G.A.T.T. The obligation

requires  that before we place certain restrictions

or  quotas, we have to inform G.A.T.T. and  see  if

they have any objection. That is precisely why  the

Federation have not acted on protection policy, but

are  enacting a new anti-dumping law for  countries

which   are  outside  G.A.T.T.  Japan  is   outside

G.A.T.T. China is outside G.A.T.T. But we cannot do

it  without  at  least informing  G.A.T.T. of  our

intention. We can take temporary measures which are

of immediate necessity for safeguarding our economy

and  our  essential  supplies,  but  not  long-term

measures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Lim, Sir, I think the

Minister for Commerce and Industry misunderstood my

speech.  I  did not mention the dumping of  Chinese

textiles. I only quoted an example to show that the

Minister  does have wide discretionary  powers  and

whether, in the exercise of his discretion,  he  is

able  to determine whether such importation is good

for the country - as I have mentioned a while ago, in

the  case  of  the  request  from  the  Federation.

Therefore, I want the Minister to assure this House



whether he can exercise his discretion wisely,  and

with  a  good sense of timing, and not to  obstruct

our trading activities. I quoted American cars.  Of

course,  I  know they come from Hongkong.  But  the

Government should stop them coming into Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not allow any American cars to come

here,  no  matter where they come from. We consider

them luxurious, and not for local use. They, and  a

lot  of other luxury items, are restricted by  many

Asian  countries,  which are  trying  to  encourage

thrift.  That is, they try to save foreign exchange

as  much  as they can. They try to stop all  luxury

goods  from going into their country. When we  were

sitting on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>



Luxury Tax Select Committee, we fully discussed the

matter,  but we agreed not to implement  this  Bill

because of the desirability to protect the entrepot

status of Singapore. But now that the Minister  has

such wide discretion, why could we not restrict the

importation of luxury goods, in spite of  G.A.T.T.?

I  hope  the  Minister can enlighten us  more,  and

whether he can raise any objection, no matter where

they come from, and who pays the money. But we must

not allow such luxury goods to be imported here.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I can give the assurance

to   the  hon.  Member  that  I  will  exercise  my

discretion wisely. In fact, I have never  exercised

that  discretion  unwisely. If I have  done  so,  I

would  like  the  hon. Member to  point  out  those

instances,   except  on  the  banning  of   Chinese

textiles,  which  he  feels was  unwise.  That,  of

course, is a matter of opinion. However, I  do  not

think it would be wise to place any restriction  on

the  import of luxury goods, unless it is necessary

for us to protect an industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of American cars coming from

Hongkong,  I am sure the ion. Member did  not  know

that  they came from Hongkong. But the right  thing

to  do  is to let those who can afford to pay,  use

the  American cars, and let them pay more in  local

taxes.  In fact, that is what is happening now.  An

American  car  is liable to a 25 per cent  purchase

tax  as  against  10  per cent  tax  on  a  car  of

Commonwealth origin. So, if a man is rich enough to

pay  the  higher  tax, and wants  to  pay  for  the

luxury, let him contribute to the taxes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

R. Jumabhoy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 39 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have given notice of an

amendment  which I will withdraw now. I will  speak

on the general Head under Supplies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $246,710 for Head 39 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I

have  a  chance  to speak on this Department  as  a

whole,  I withdraw my amendment. Sir, what are  the

items  concerned under Supplies? I understand  that

the  main item is the rice stockpile. The war ended

in 1945. From 1945 onwards we have had restrictions

on  many  imports or exports, as and when the  need

arose   at  that  tithe.  We,  who  were   in   the

Legislative  Council,  tried  our  best  to   relax

controls, and many items were freed. The only  item

left  when this Government took charge was the rice

stockpile. Even on rice, we tried our best to relax

controls as far as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this rice stockpile has been the subject of

a  motion  by me in this House. Facts were  pointed

out and, if I remember correctly, the consumer pays

about  a  cent or a cent and a half per katty  more

because  of  the  existence ol this Department.  If

anybody  on  the Government side wants  to  correct

that,  I  would like to have accurate figures  from

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, an increase of one or one and a half cents a

katty  means quite a lot to a poor man who  has  to

support even a small-sized family. The Labour Front

Ministers  have not been able to do anything  about

reducing   the  cost.  They  have  supported   this

stockpile  scheme  as  a  strategic  pile  for   an

emergency. However, a period of ten years (1945  to

1955)  has  passed since the war ended. I  am  sure

they  did not expect any war at that time,  nor  do

they  expect  it  in  the near future.  The  second

reason possibly is that an emergency might arise in

the event of a scarcity of rice. Now, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>



position was quite clear in 1953 and 1954, when  it

was  seen  very clearly that the supplies  in  each

country  were  increased for  distribution  to  the

countries needing them. Not only was this the case,

but  also  those who imported rice increased  their

own  capacity to produce rice in their own country,

so that they imported as little as possible because

it  cost  more money. The figures, which I obtained

from statistics from E.C.A.F.E. conferences held in

different countries, will show that the rice supply

position  has  been easier. If it  is  easier,  why

should  we continue with this stockpile of rice  in

this  small  city  of  Singapore?  I  am  sure  the

Government is not going to put forward the argument

that it is because there is strategic stockpile  in

the Federation, therefore we must follow them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Federation produce a certain amount of

rice  for their own consumption in addition to some

imports. As an independent country now, of  course,

they  will  increase their output with  the  latest

scientific  methods and advice which  they  receive

from other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is the position, is it necessary to

continue   this  stockpile  policy,  whatever   the

excuses given, since it has increased the burden of

the poor man, who has to pay a higher price for his

own  daily staple food? This has also been  brought

to  light  in  my  motion which I  tabled  in  this

Assembly. Now, Sir, Singapore in -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I continue my

arguments   started   this  morning   against   the

stockpile on rice, when the war was over  in  1945,

and  why this policy of the Government was  not  to

the benefit of the people and trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the trade itself. I said that

since  1953,  1954 or 1955 onwards,  the  producing

countries  had to come to us to sell their  surplus

rice  from the exports of their own countries.  The

position  then  was  that  rice  was  available  in

plenty.  Why should this Department remain and  why

was  this stockpile necessary? My argument was that

it costs a cent or a cent and a half more per katty

to  the consumer. Sir, a cent or a cent and a  half

more  per katty to a poor family may not look  very

much  in  the eyes of Ministers drawing  such  high

salaries, but it is very essential to save  even  a

cent in their expenses on foodstuffs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in big countries like India, there were,

after the war, rice controls, price controls,  this

and  that, but even with such a huge population - not

only in India but also in other countries too - they

were abolished. What happens is this. In those  big

countries  if  a dealer wants to take advantage  of

the position, if a shortage occurs, then they bring

down  the  control on price. This could  have  been

done in Singapore - a small city with a population of

over  a  million and a half. If the  importers  are

willing  to  have enough supplies on their  hands - I

understand  they  have been given  assurances  from

time  to  time  to do that - then, Sir, there  should

have been a free trade. If a shortage occurs, price

control   can  always  be  brought   in   to   curb

exploitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugar and flour also came under Supplies. A lot

of  public money was wasted on these items and they

were slowly abolished; and the rice question should

have been treated in the same way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during my motion, if I remember correctly,

the  Member  for Tiong Bahru brought in  the  point

about  the corruption that existed. I do  not  know

about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>





this,  but  I am sure the incoming Government  will

appoint a Commission of Inquiry to find out whether

the  stockpiling of rice is necessary  and  whether

any  corruption has taken place. There is a  likely

chance  of  corruption because, all  of  a  sudden,

sometimes  exports  are  stopped,  or  imports  are

stopped,  or certain quantities from the rice  pile

are taken out. There is a possibility of corruption

and  the Government's duty should be to have a full

inquiry.  I hope that the incoming Government  will

take  up this very important question of having  an

inquiry,  whether  this  policy  of  stockpile   is

necessary and whether any corruption takes place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some people argue that it is the merchants

rather  than the Chambers of Commerce who want  the

stockpile to be abolished. Why not? Like any  other

trade  which is free, why should not this be  free?

There   should  have  been  no  such  restrictions,

whatever they are, on this trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not interested to hear lame excuses by

the  Labour  Front elected Ministers on this.  They

have  enough chances. They have failed  to  utilise

their chances in order to help the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said on the

motion  moved  by  my friend, the hon.  Member  for

Telok  Ayer - that appears in the Hansard,  Vol.  2.

No.  18, dated 10th January, 1957 - that rice is  the



staple food of the Asians and it is the duty of the

Government, wherever possible, to allow the  people

to buy cheaper rice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am saying it again here, that it is the

duty  of  the Government to see that the people  of

Singapore should have the opportunity to buy  cheap

rice and not the present dear rice for which we are

now paying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have brought to the notice of this Government,

Sir,  the  corruption prevailing in the Department,

and I quoted the figure of $4,000 per thousand tons

of  ripe, which would enable a tenderer to get  the

tender. I am glad that the successful tenderer  for

the last few years has given way to another.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I brought out the point about corruption in

the  Department, I was approached by  the  Minister

for  Education  and the Minister for  Commerce  and

Industry.  They told me that they did not  like  to

see  dirty  linen  washed in  this  Assembly.  They

realised   the  things  that  went   on   in   that

Department. The two words "dirty linen"  were  used

by the Minister for Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they realise that dirty things have been going

on  in  that Department, Sir, it is their duty  all

the  more  to  see that this Department  should  be

reorganised or that the State's stockpile  of  rice

should be abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about free trade, why cannot the rice

merchants be given an opportunity to import as much

rice as they like and sell as much as they like?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no use to talk about a stockpile in the

event  of  war.  I  want to ask  the  Minister  for

Commerce and Industry this: in the present  age  of

atomic  and hydrogen bombs, what can the Government

stockpile  do for the people? What the people  want

at  the moment is to buy cheap rice for members  of

their  family.  I, for one, can say that  paying  a

cent or two cents a katty more for my rice will not

affect  me,  but to a man earning $100  or  $150  a

month, even three or four cents more a day means  a

lot to these people, because everyday they must eat

rice.  And in one month, it will come up to a  very

big sum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government defeated us on that motion. But

now let the people be the judges. I can bet you.

Sir, if you were to release or give them the -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Do you take bets, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I did not read that implication in

the Member's statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> What I want to emphasise, Sir,

is  this - if we allow merchants to bring in the rice

freely, we can get cheap rice; instead of the  lame

excuse  that, in the event of war, we must  have  a

stockpile.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought this state of affairs to the notice of

the    Government   and   the   Corrupt   Practices

Investigation  Bureau  when  I  hit  out   at   the

Department   then  about  rice   moving   out   and

circulating and coming back to the same  stockpile.

It  was  their duty at that time, when I  made  the



allegations here, to make a surprise check on  this

stockpile. They would then have found that the rice

which  came back to the stockpile was actually  the

old  rice  which  had been bought by  the  dealers.

Instead  of  that,  the Minister for  Commerce  and



Industry  told  me in the C.P.A. room:  "Well,  Mr

Tan,  I  have  already dismissed the Controller  of

Supplies  and  an Inspector." That is  not  what  I

want. I want cheap rice for the people. It is not a

question  of dismissing the Controller of  Supplies

or  the  Inspector. What do I care about them?  The

people  are  very important. What we  want  is  the

cheapest  rice  that the people can  get,  not  the

dismissal  of  the Controller of  Supplies  or  the

Inspector.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

just   heard  the  remarks  expressed  simply   and

sincerely by the Member for Tiong Bahru, who is the

champion  of  anti-corruption and the  champion  of

anti-stockpile of rice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not easy to come to my conclusions.

Every  year  we come to this item of Supplies.  One



side  says,  "Stockpile in case of emergency."  The

other  side says, "We fight to bring down the price

of  rice."  Another champion for the cause  of  the

underdog  says,  "The person  who  is  against  the

stockpile of rice is the businessman who  wants  to

make  more  money." Sir, all these  statements  are

very   confusing.  I  sincerely  believe   that   a

responsible  Government must try its very  best  to

bring  down  the  cost of living. Why  should  this

Government,  year in and year out, be bombarded  by

the public and in this Assembly on this question of

stockpile  and  yet it so stubbornly maintains  the

Supplies Department? There must be some reason  for

that and I know the reason - in case of an emergency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out the following facts. (1) How

is  it  that  the Japanese, during the  Occupation,

could maintain the price of rice at eight cents per

katty  for quite a long time? (2) Why is there  now

no control over sugar and flour? How is it that the

Government  had  the  confidence  to  release   the

control on sugar and flour and not on rice? Sir, is

the Government able to say how many tons of rice we

export   from  Singapore  every  month?  We  should

confine  ourselves in this debate on "Supplies"  to

such facts.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

certain   subjects  which  have  become   permanent

features  or  landmarks  in  our  debates  in  this

Assembly.  These  subjects act as  pillars  without

which  there  is  a great danger that  the  debates

might  collapse, because there will be  no  talking

point  left  for the Opposition - subjects  like  the

Family  Planning Association, over which  we  spent

quite  some time yesterday and the day before,  and

the stockpile of rice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer, Sir, said that the

previous  Legislative Council - he always dwells  in

the  age of the colonial days - released controls  on

everything  except rice. It released  sugar,  flour

and,  I  believe,  salt - except  rice.  Perhaps  the

Member  for Changi, who just now asked why  it  was

that sugar and flour were released but rice was not

released,  should get together with the Member  for

Telok  Ayer  (who  was  a Member  of  the  previous

Council) and ask him that and not ask mc. I came in

later.  If the previous Council thought it not  fit

to  release  control on rice, then how can  he  now

turn  round  and  attack this  Government  for  not

releasing rice for the same reasons?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer stated that the rice

position  had eased considerably and that therefore

there  was  no need for a stockpile. I  think  hon.

Members  will remember that it was last  year  when

there  was  an  export  restriction  on  rice  from

Thailand  and that stocks went short in  Singapore,

and that was the time when I issued an assurance to

the public that there was no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>



cause to worry, "We have sufficient stocks of  rice

in  our  stockpile. Therefore, do not pay more  for

your rice if the merchants try to squeeze it out of

you because of this sudden shortage in Thailand."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member went on to say, "Let us not hear

the  argument  that  the  Federation  is  having  a

stockpile."  He also said, "The Federation  have  a

certain  amount  of their own rice,"  and  that  is

exactly the point. The Federation have about 60 per

cent  of their rice requirements grown at home  and

yet  they  still  maintain  a  stockpile.  We  have

absolutely no rice growing at home, and  what  will

happen  to  us in case of war? Will the  population

have  to  starve? Sir, the merchants would like  to

see  the stockpile taken off, because they want  to

trade  and fill their pockets with profits.  It  is

quite  natural.  I  do not say that  it  is  a  bad

motive.  Everyone  in  the  world  wants  to   make

profits,  except in a Communist country  where  you

are  not  allowed  to  make any  profits.  But  the

Government has to look after the wider interests of

the population, not after the narrow interests of a

certain section of the population who want to  make

profits for themselves. Now just imagine what  will

happen if war suddenly broke out and communications

were  cut  off  and we had to depend  on  Thailand,

Burma   and   Vietnam   for   our   supplies.    If

communications  were cut off or  if  shipping  went

short - even  if the communication lines  were  open,

there  would  be  a  shortage of  shipping  because

shipping  would be requisitioned by the  Government

to  carry  war  materials - how would the  public  of

Singapore  then  fare?  That  is  exactly   why   a

stockpile is maintained - to cushion any shortages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is admitted, Sir, that from next year it is

expected  that there will be a surplus of rice  and

that  there will be an overproduction of rice,  but

it has not been so until this year. In about August

or  September of last year, as I mentioned earlies,

Thailand had to curtail its export of rice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Telok Ayer went on to say

that  the importers were willing to give assurances

that they would carry the stockpile. Sir, merchants

are  willing  to give any assurances. The  question

is:  are they willing to carry them out? I say  the

merchants  will  not be willing to carry  them  out

because we tried it out already. Three months back,

we  entered  into an agreement with  the  Singapore

Rice   Dealers'  Association,  that  they  take   a

guaranteed   off-take  of  2,500  tons   from   the

stockpile in order to rotate the stockpile, so that

stocks  would  not  go  bad.  That  agreement   was

supposed  to last until December. I had high  hopes

that  if  they  kept that agreement we  could  have

entered  into a permanent agreement for 1959.  What

was  the result? They carried out the agreement for

1�  months  and then they said,  "Sorry,  we  are

unable  to  keep  up  with this guarantee.  We  are

unable  to take the rice." And they requested  that

the  agreement  be terminated. That  agreement  was

terminated and the position has gone back  to  what

it  was  before.  It  is  all  very  well  for  the

merchants to come round and say, "We are willing to

do  this."  But  are they really in  earnest  about

doing  it?  They only look to their own  interests.

The  Government has got to look after the  interest



of the public as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the allegation of corruption. That was

taken  up again by the Member for Tiong Bahru  very

vehemently,   about  the  Minister  for   Education

telling  him  outside not to wash  dirty  linen.  I

never mentioned the words "dirty linen", Sir, and I

am  sure that the Minister for Education must  have

used   different   words.  Anyhow,   whatever   was

mentioned, the fact is this. What I said to him was

that  I had not been happy with the manner in which

the  stockpile had been run, and I had investigated

the  position.  In  fact,  the  question  had  been

referred  to  the  Corrupt Practices  Investigation

Bureau, but because no proof could be found, I  was

not willing to state categorically in this House - in

which  I  am privileged and could say what I  like,

but I am a responsible Minister and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>



cannot say it - that there existed corruption. I  had

my  own  doubts. In fact, I carried out a  surprise

check  two months before the Member for Telok  Ayer

brought  his  motion  to this House - that  was  last

year,  I  believe.  As a result  of  this  surprise

check,  I  was  very unhappy and I  suspected  that

there was something going on, and I dismissed  four

officers  of the Department who were on a month-to-month  basis. Because they were on a month-to-month

basis, we could give them notice; but I would  hate

to  state categorically that those dismissals  were

connected with corruption because that had not been

proved.  We handed the matter over to the  C.P.I.B.

and  they  themselves failed to  take  any  further



steps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is all very well to shout about

corruption,  but  I think, in the interest  of  the

Public Service and also in the interest of justice,

one  has got to be careful of what one talks about.

Opposition  Members,  not  being  responsible,  can



shout  anything  they like, but a Minister  of  the

Government has to be careful what he says.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an insinuation, Sir, by the Member for

Telok  Ayer that corruption might go up to a higher

level. He did not mention it, but he said, "Imports

are stopped and exports are stopped." As a merchant

I  understand the implications of that. If  imports

are  stopped  and exports are stopped, there  could

not  be  corruption amongst official circles unless

the rice received in the stockpile is bad or of  an

inferior  quality and good money was paid  for  it;

but  when  imports  are  stopped  and  exports  are

stopped,  the  insinuation is that there  could  be

manipulation   in   the  rice  market,   and   that

manipulation  could only be done by a  Minister  or

his  associates  outside. Sir, I challenge  him  to

bring  a motion against me if he cares to and prove

it, instead of making such insinuation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think that the

Minister is justified in suggesting that there  was

an  imputation. If the Minister thought  there  was

such an imputation, I think it was up to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>



Minister to rise on a point of order at the time. I

suggest  that  the Minister does  not  pursue  that

course.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I defer, Sir, to your ruling

and I shall stop from proceeding on this line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the Member for Telok Ayer went on to say

that  he  was not prepared to hear of lame  excuses

and, as usual, after every item he raises, he walks

out  of  the  House  and does  not  listen  to  the

replies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the Member for Tiong Bahru raised the

point  of  present-day atomic  warfare  and  asked,

"What  can a stockpile do?" The stockpile can  feed

the people until such time as supplies can come in.

On  top of getting burns from atomic bombs and from



radioactivity in the atmosphere after the discharge

of  such  bombs, I am sure that the people  do  not

want to be hungry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was a plea that the people want cheap

rice.  Sir, the price of rice is not in our  hands.

The  price of rice is in the hands of the producing



countries  and  the world market of rice.  I  think

what  the Member meant was - as the Member for  Telok

Ayer mentioned - that the public have got to pay 1�

cents more per katty for their rice because of this

stockpile, otherwise they might have to pay less. I

disagree  with that, Sir. The difference  in  price

might  vary. The normal difference in price between

stockpile rice and the ordinary commercial rice  is

about half a cent per katty and that is because  of

the expenditure for stockpile operation. It happens

sometimes  that  the  price of  stockpile  rice  is

higher  because there is always a time lag  between

Government's buying of rice and the release of  the

same rice from the stockpile. For instance, at  the

moment, our price is much higher than the price  of

commercial  rice, because we bought our rice  three

or  four months ago when the market was round about

�50.  About  two  weeks ago, the price  dropped  in

Thailand to about �46 or �47, and possibly there is

going to be a further drop, but the stocks held  by

Government are at �51 and therefore they  have  got

to  be  released for some time at that  price.  The

Government operates the stockpile on a no profit no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>



loss basis. Now when these stocks are finished, the

Government will start buying cheap rice.  When  you

come  to the end of the rice season, the Government

has  got in stock cheaper rice and the traders  are

forced  to  buy end-season rice which is higher  in

price.  At that time, the stockpile rice is cheaper

than the commercial rice for a few months. There is

always  a  three or four months' lag in  the  price

factor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Changi asked me, "Why is it

that  the Japanese could maintain the price of rice

at  eight  cents per katty during the  occupation?"

Sir,  I  was not in the confidence of the  Japanese

Military Administration and, therefore, I am unable

to answer that question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures for the export of rice which he

enquired  can  be  found in any of  the  Government

publications  which are available. The  import  and

export publications give you figures of the exports

of  various commodities month by month and year  by

year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Mr Speaker. Sir, I was rather surprised to hear my

name  being brought into this debate. I was  quoted

as  having said to the hon. Member for Tiong  Bahru

that we should not wash dirty linen or something to

that  effect. I inform this House that I never said

those  words. What I told the hon. Member for Tiong

Bahru  was that it was rather unfair to attack  any

member   of   the  Public  Service,  especially   a

Permanent Secretary, without giving him a chance to

reply in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the principle should be established and

observed  in  this House that we must be  dignified

and that we should not resort to accusations or  to

personal  attacks on any person, be he a  Permanent

Secretary, or a simple peon in any office.  If  any

official is proved to be inefficient or that he has

indulged  in  malpractices, his  activities  should

first be brought to the notice of the Minister  who

would then bring it to the notice of the Council of

Ministers. There are many ways of dealing with such

inefficiency - there  is the Disciplinary  Committee;

there is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>



reference  back  to the Public Service  Commission.

What  I  told the hon. Member for Tiong  Bahru  was



that  he  should not have done that  in  the  House

without  giving the official concerned a chance  to

reply to him. I think that is unfair.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really

surprised  at  the reply given by the Minister  for

Education.  He  used two words,  "dirty  linen".  I

repeat  it again. It is not the Permanent Secretary

that  I  was  referring to. It  is  the  expression

"dirty linen", because he said, "Do not wash  dirty

linen in the House."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Department of Supplies, we notice

that  the  expenditure is $246,710 and the  revenue

from  it  is  $596,050. This is the way to  squeeze

merchants   to   pay  for  the  running   of   this

Department.  We  all know that the merchants,  when

they want to import rice from any country, have  to

buy  50  per  cent  of the quantity  they  wish  to

import.  Why must they buy rice from the Government

stockpile?  Why cannot they be allowed  to  have  a

free hand in importing any quantity they like?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister went on to say, "What will

happen  in  the  case  of  war?"  I  can  tell  the

Minister. Sir, in the case of war, one tiny  atomic

bomb  or hydrogen bomb will wipe out Singapore.  It

is  not  a  question  of  public  health,  or  rice

stockpile - even  if  you have  5,000  tons  of  rice

stockpiled in the godown. As an elected  Member  of

my  constituency, I am very perturbed to  say  that

the  merchants, when they are asked to buy  50  per

cent  against their imports, have to pay more,  and

the  other thing is that they have to pay  handling

charges  to bring the rice to the godown  and  then

back  to  the merchant's storehouse. And  the  rice

upon  circulation will be sold to the public  at  a

higher price.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very concerned because it is the duty of the

Government  to take the interest of the  masses  at

heart. It is not a question of a department  to  be

paid  for by the merchants or rice merchants.  What

do  I care for a few rice merchants? But my concern

is that in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>



past, only one man succeeded in getting the tender,

year in and year out. That is what I am against.  A

shopkeeper  or a rice merchant could never  succeed

in  getting  the  tender. There must  be  something

wrong. As an elected Member for Tiong Bahru, it  is

my duty to point out to Government that it is their

duty, in the interests of the masses, to stop  this

nonsense. I am talking about the rice stockpile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the time when the British troops

surrendered  in  1942, there were many  godowns  in

various parts of Singapore. They had thousands  and

thousands of cases of butter, milk, sugar, rice and

sardines.  Because  they were  hungry,  the  people

looted  the godowns, in spite of the armed  guards.

The  Minister  for Commerce and Industry,  when  he



talked  about my friend and colleague on this  side

of  the House, the Member for Telok Ayer, said that

when we did something, he had to follow. It is  not

that.  We  know  very well that one man's  meat  is

another man's poison. If the system adopted by  the

previous  Council is wrong, it is the duty  of  the

Government to correct it. I am very perturbed, Sir,

and  I  am afraid I cannot agree to this sum  being

spent on the Supplies Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I wish to talk a little

more about this rice situation. Although I am going

to criticise the Supplies Department, my criticisms

are entirely different from those of the Member for

Tiong  Bahru.  I  wish the Minister will  carefully

listen  to  me. I asked him to give the figures  of

how  many  tons  of  rice a  month  Singapore  rice

importers re-export to other countries. My  purpose

in  raising  this query is to assure  the  Minister

that  Singapore  always  has  plenty  of  rice  for

trading.  I  can  quote an example.  There  is  one

merchant  who  had a few thousand tons  of  Burmese

rice.  Burmese rice is only suitable for Indonesia,

because   they  prefer  it  to  Siamese   rice,   a

preference just opposite to that of the  people  of

Singapore.  During the civil conflict in Indonesia,

trade  suddenly stopped. Yet this merchant  refused

to sell below the price and he stocked Burmese rice

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>



years.  Then  two or three months  ago  he  had  to

engage hundreds of labourers to handle his stock of

rice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I want to know is whether the Minister

for Commerce and Industry has made any attempts  to

find a solution to make the rice merchants, instead

of  Government, spend money on stockpiling. For the

first  time, I have to say that the clever Minister

for  Commerce and Industry has proved to this House

that he can be a fool too. He has admitted that the

contract  of about 2,500 tons of the rice stockpile

was  terminated by the Rice Importers' Association.

That  is  very  bad  dealing.  I  wonder  why   the



Government  allowed such a contract  to  be  signed

between  the  Rice Importers' Association  and  the

Government without any guarantee. I wish  to  bring

to  the notice of this House that last year, or the

year  before,  the Rice Importers' Association  had

written  to  Government officially  and  offered  a

suggestion.   They   would   guarantee   all    the

requirements  of the Government. It is  up  to  the

Government  to  open the door to negotiations  with

the  Rice  Importers' Association.  If  the  latter

fails  to comply with Government's requirements  to

safeguard our staple food to meet emergency  needs,

then  make it public. Let us state it so  that  the

public will know that the Government did attempt to

find a solution to safeguard public funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, I only rise

to  give  an  explanation to the Member for  Changi

who,  shall  I  say, admired the way in  which  the

Japanese kept their rice at 8 cents a katty  during

the  war. I can assure him that that was due to  no

credit  of  the Japanese Army. It was  because  the

rice   was  stockpiled  before  the  war   by   the

Governments  of  Singapore  and  Malaya,  and  that

stockpile  lasted  nearly  three  years.  The  hon.

Member  must  not forget that we were  existing  on

starvation rations, getting a quarter or even  less

than  a quarter of what the Member for Changi would

be eating today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the hon. Member would not bring his class-room lectures here and stop raising these school-children queries in this House, we could proceed -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

guilty of two or three unparliamentary phrases, and

I ask him to withdraw them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I beg to withdraw them. I

do  hope  that  we  shall be able to  proceed  more

quickly with the proceedings.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir I will deal with the

points  very  shortly in order to get on  with  the

debate. The handling charges are not high, they are

only half a cent per katty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge made by the Member for Tiong Bahru

that  in the past only one man got the tender every

year  is  not correct. In the past, the system  was

that  when  Government wanted to buy rice  for  the

stockpile,  the  Government asked for  tenders  for

rice,  and different firms got tenders in different

months and for different types, according to  their

quotations. But I believe what the hon. Member  has

in  mind  is  the  tender  for  looking  after  the

Government's stores. The same firm got  the  tender

for  two  years  or  so. After  that  the  tenderer

changed,  because somebody else tendered lower.  In

the   tender  system,  you  have  got  to  take   a

chance - you may get the same man tendering  cheaper,

and  unless you have got something against him, you

have to give him that tender, otherwise you will be

charged  with  favouritism, and then  some  Members

might  stand  up and say, "Why was this  done?  Was

there  any  corruption anywhere in  the  nooks  and

corners?" and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Changi raised the point about

how  much  of  the rice held by importers  here  is

being  re-exported. There again the figures can  be

had  by  him if he wants to, though I have not  got

them  with me now, but they are published. And then

he says his contention is that Singapore has plenty

of  rice.  But  he forgets that the businessman  is

after  profits. When you have plenty  of  rice  and

there  is  a  sudden shortage, you  find  the  rice

disappearing underground, and then coming into  the

blackmarket.  The  poor  labourer  and  the  office

worker  will  have to pay five cents or  ten  cents

more  in  the  black-market. Though we  might  have

20,000 or 30,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>



tons  of  rice with the merchants, it will  all  go

underground. It has happened in the past  and  that

is  why  price control has to be introduced, though

it  never  works  properly because again  it  lends

itself to corruption.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> It depends on what action is

taken!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> And I believe Sir, in not

having   price  control  which  lends   itself   to

corruption and an expensive machinery to run it.  I

believe rather in preventive measures, and that  is

to have a stockpile. If the merchants try to do any

black-marketing, well, your stockpile is  there  to

kill it. Now, the hon. Member says the solution  is

to  make  the  rice  merchants  spend  their  money

instead of the Government. That is exactly what  is

happening - the  Government  spends  the  money   and

charges the merchants half a cent more per katty so

that  the  merchants are paying the money and  then

they  pass  it on to the consumers. Now,  supposing

the  rice merchants guarantee to carry a stockpile,

then  whatever  expenditure they  incur  they  will

still  pass  it  on to the consumers  who  are  the

public. It comes to the same thing - in the end it is

the consumer who pays. The merchant is not going to

pay   out  of  his  pocket,  and  neither  is   the

Government.  So whether the Government carries  the

stockpile, and then charges it to the merchants who

again  pass it on to the consumer, or the merchants

carry the stockpile, it is still the consumers  who

will pay.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the Member said, "Why did we not

negotiate  with the Association?" I have  just  now

given  an example of such negotiations and  how  it

failed.  I have spoken many times with the  members

of the Association. But what they want is, "We will

carry  a  stockpile provided you give us a monopoly

of  rice  imports" - 20 or 30 firms - and  they  always

say,  "We  will guarantee to carry, say. 10,000  or

20,000 tons as a stockpile, but rice imports should

be  a  monopoly of these 20 or 30 members  of  this

Association." Now, once



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>



you  give  them that monopoly, they  can  hold  the

public  of  Singapore to ransom,  and  a  Socialist

government is not prepared to do that. We have  the

interest  of the public first and foremost  in  our

hearts,  Sir. And if the merchants are  willing  to

play  ball and co-operate with the Government, very

good;  if they are not, the Government has  got  to

safeguard  the public interest first and  not  just

the interests of the merchants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure

many  Members will agree that the Hon, the Minister

for  Local Government, Lands and Housing is one  of

the  most distinguished and respected of Ministers,

especially as he can also discharge his duties very

easily.  In  the  first place, he has  a  wonderful

Permanent  Secretary,  experienced  and  a  man  of

integrity.  Secondly,  his  Ministry  has   overall

control,   whereas  the  City  Council   is   semi-independent.  The  Rural  Board  again   is   semi-independent.  The S.I.T. is, however,  a  statutory

body.  So I think the Minister's post is envied  by

many  ambitious  politicians who  want  to  be  the

Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing. I

am   sure  that  our  present  Minister  for  Local

Government. Lands and Housing will probably  remain

in the same post, no matter which Party is in power

next year. So I wish to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>



this  opportunity to extend my congratulations,  if

somewhat  prematurely, to the  Minister  for  Local

Government, Lands and Housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have touched on the City Council, the

Rural Board and the S.I.T., which are actually  not

in the hands of the Minister, I would like to raise

a  small question about the allocation of farmland.

Firstly,  there is the question of farm lots  which



we  must consider, since Singapore is such a  small

island and our population is increasing - a matter of

heated   controversy  in  the  debate   on   family

planning! Therefore, I wish to know what is in  the

mind  of  the  Minister. Has he any scheme  in  the

Budget to provide for more farmlands, or will it be

incorporated in a scheme which will be administered

by the Rural Development Panel?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if I am not wrong, he has promised to

try  and select and survey certain lands, and build

an  attap  settlement. I do not know when or  where

this   attap  settlement  project  will   come   to

fruition.  Maybe the Minister can enlighten  us  on

this  intention  to  build an attap  settlement  in

order  to give the person, who prefers or is forced

to  choose  a  house built of attap, a more  secure

place  than  he  has at present when  he  is  being

called a squatter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I wish the Minister to assure this House

that he is fully aware that the housing development

projects  now being carried out by private  owners,

and  the Government's development plan, are causing

many difficulties to the squatters, or, as they are

sometimes  called, attap dwellers.  The  Government

should  see that the compensation paid to  them  is

adequate.  However, so far there is no  legislation

to protect such attap dwellers when they are served

with  eviction  notices by the landowners.  Sir,  I

have  raised  this question more than once,  and  I

would  ask the Minister to find ways and  means  to

protect  such  people  who have  been  served  with

eviction notices. If the landlord is good, he  will

talk  terms with the attap dweller. But  if  he  is

not,  he  will  say that the attap dweller  has  no

right to claim compensation. So I wish the Minister

will consider this point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I wonder whether the Minister can

simplify the procedure when an application is  made

for repairing or building a house. Also, whether it

is  possible  to  simplify the  procedure  when  an

application is made to change the name of the owner

on the Government's notice of assessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these points which I have mentioned

concern attap houses in the rural areas, where they

find  it very difficult to have a permit to  repair

their  houses.  Why  is this?  It  is  because  the

Department  concerned with the issuing  of  permits

requires the landlord's endorsement before a permit

is granted. As you are aware, many a landlord these

days  refuse  to  help these poor  squatters.  They

would like to see the attap houses collapse so that

the  tenants have to quit the land. Therefore, they

naturally  refuse to co-operate with  or  give  any

assistance to the attap dwellers who wish to repair

or  rebuild their houses. This non-co-operation  is

especially  true when it comes to  the  payment  of

assessment.  When  a  tenant passes  away  and  the

assessment is in his name, the son, when he applies

to  change  it  into  his  name,  has  to  get  the

endorsement  from  the landlord.  If  the  landlord

refuses  to  endorse it, the son  cannot  pay  that

assessment. So all these things, which hon. Members

in  this  House may consider are trifles, are  very

important indeed to the poor squatters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point which I would like to raise is the

water supply for many kampongs. I have learnt  from

a  member  of  the Rural Board that,  although  the

Rural  Board has approved the installation of  many

public  standpipes in the kampongs, they  have  not

been  installed because of the shortage  of  funds.

Just an hour ago, a representative from the kampong



of  Loyang  Loyang  (he  is actually  not  from  my

constituency)  came to my office and complained  of

the  shortage of water, and asked whether we  could

supply  them  with water. It should be noted  that,

despite  the recent big rainfall, there is still  a

shortage of water in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>



their  kampong.  He asked me if it is  possible  to

send  any  water-wagon to supply  that  place  with

water, or install water-pipes, which I have already

requested  the  Rural Board to do, and  which  have

been  approved by them about three months ago.  The

Rural  Board  replied  to me that  they  could  not

install  the standpipes because of the shortage  of

funds.  So,  Sir, I put these five points  forward,

and  I  sincerely hope and expect that the Minister

for  Local Government, Lands and Housing will  give

me a reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on your advice

I  have,  on the first day, dealt with the question

of  salaries  under  all the preceding  Heads,  and

there  was  an amendment standing in my name  under

this  Head which also concerns salaries. Of course,

since  I  was not here, the amendment automatically

lapsed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. In any event, I think the

hon. Member is too late!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I am not speaking on the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I see.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> What I am saying, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is  this, that if I am not here  and  do  not

withdraw the amendment it will automatically lapse;

and  I am not speaking on the amendment because  it

has already been dealt with by me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

been told time and again to grow more and more food

to  help  the economy of this country, but  I  find

lots of vacant land in the various resettlements in

my  Division lying fallow. I understand that  these

lots  were rejected by those persons who have  been

displaced  from somewhere else because of distance,

unsuitability,  strange  environment  and  probably

lack  of amenities. But there are people who  would

want that land. They can make use of it. Instead of

allowing these plots of land to remain as secondary

jungles, I think it is better to have them made use

of  for the people to cultivate, if not vegetables,

at least tobacco, or sweet potatoes or tapioca.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would ask the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands  and  Housing  to  instruct  the

competent  department or departments  to  give  all

facilities to the applicants who apply for land  to

do cultivation.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, first of all, I should like to  thank

the  Member for Changi for his confidence not  only

in  myself  but also in my Permanent Secretary  and

other members of my staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, he started by saying that I, as

Minister  for Local Government, Lands and  Housing,

have practically no responsibilities, and that  the

Rural  Board  has got its own Board of  Management,

the  Singapore Improvement Trust has got its  Board

of  Trustees, the City Council has got its  elected

Councillors, and the Mayor, of course! But, at  the

same  time,  he has asked me a number of  questions

which  I think are very pertinent, and to which  it

would he my duty to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of farmlands or

resettlement of farmers, I would like to  draw  the

attention of the hon. Member to the Report  of  the

Land Clearance and Resettlement Working Party which

was  published in 1955, wherein Government's policy

with  regard to resettlement and land clearance  is

clearly defined.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with regard to the actual planning of

these  resettlement areas, they are at  the  moment

being  administered  by  the Singapore  Improvement

Trust, of course, with the approval of my Ministry.

As  I see it, there is very little more that we can



do  for  these  f farmers, because,  in  the  first

place,  there  is  a  great  shortage  of  land  in

Singapore,  although the Member for  Bukit  Panjang

did  mention  that there are still lands  available

which  are unsuitable for farmlands. But, from  the

point  of  view of Government, we have very  little

Crown   land  left  in  Singapore;  and   for   all

Government   projects - such  as  schools,   housing,

hospitals, clinics - Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>



itself has to go into the open market to buy land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two or three points of criticism

relating to the Rural Board. The first one was  the

question  of  repairs. Now, as far as I  am  aware,

Sir, there is very little difficulty now in getting

the  approval from the Rural Board for repairs  and

also  for the change of name. I am sure the  Member

for Changi is aware that, at the moment, the office

of  the  Rural  Board  has been decentralised  into

three  different centres, and work is going  on  in

these  centres  more  expeditiously.  I  think  the

public  do realise that they are getting the  help,

the lack of which they have always been complaining

about in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With decentralisation, we have done a wonderful

job  in  that  of the revenue which was outstanding

for  last year, a total of $1.5 million has already

been  collected this year, and up to date  we  have

collected more than $2 million from revenue due  to

us in 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the water supply, I do not think

the Member for Changi is correct in saying that the

difficulty there is funds alone. The fact  is  that

funds  can  and  will always be made available  for

such an amenity, but, unfortunately, it is not  the

Rural Board who installs the standpipes, it is  the

City  Council.  The Rural Board normally - after  the

relevant  Committees have approved the applications

for   standpipes - refer  the  matter  to  the  Water

Department of the City Council and it is up to  the

City  Council  to  put  up the  standpipes  at  the

expense of the Rural Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I think there is one

point  that  has  to be made clear,  and  that  is,

simplifying  the procedure regarding the  issue  of

permits, for repairs to and rebuilding of houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the Minister that since the

decentralisation  of  the Rural  Board  into  three

districts, much convenience has resulted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that the three Chairmen. Mr Lim Chuan

Kim,  Che Hussein Bin Kamari and Mr R. Ramalingam,

deserve  mention for their efficiency. I know  this

because I am the adviser to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>



the  Rural  Residents' Association and I  am  in  a

position to receive such information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I wish to point out is that the trouble is

not  because  of  the complexities created  by  the

Department, but the procedure laid down whereby the

landlord's endorsement is required, which  involves

legal points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing I want to repair my attap house, I will

have to get the landlord's permission; otherwise  I

will  not  be  able  to  repair  it.  I  wonder  if

Government  can find a solution to  help  the  poor

farmers  to  rebuild, repair or build their  houses

without  undergoing this troublesome  procedure  of

having to get an endorsement from the landlord.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the change of name in assessments, that

too   requires   endorsement  from  the   landlord.

[Laughter.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Minister for Communications and

Works,  who is laughing, thinks: "Oh, how can  this

be?   You   are  refusing  to  recognise  ownership

rights." Sir, I am fully aware of that. What I mean

is that this is a problem for us to solve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landlord who wants to develop a piece of land

can   refuse  to  negotiate  or  talk  terms  about

compensation.  He  wants to wait  until  the  house

collapses. He refuses to endorse an application for

house repairs. Therefore, he can have an easy  plan

to build bungalow houses and his land value will be

much  higher. We know this - that the price  is  much

different between a vacant piece of land with a few

squatters on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the Government can find a way out to help

the  poor  farmer  or fisherman, who  is  an  attap

dweller,  to get his house repaired or rebuilt  and

to  change his name on the assessment form when  he

inherits  it from his father or is paying  transfer

fees for his friends and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the point I wish to put forward to the

Minister for Local Govermnent's, Lands and Housing.

I am sure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>



he  has  to  consult the Attorney-General regarding

the  legal aspect. But at least I want to  ask  the

Minister  for Local Government, Lands  and  Housing

whether he has sympathies for these people who have

such troubles.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, I have lots of sympathies

for  attap  dwellers, because I myself live  in  an

attap house on land which does not belong to me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Yes, you are proud of it!



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Actually, regarding the

question of change of name for assessment purposes,

I  do not think there is very much difficulty about

that.  All that a person need do is to bring  along

his father's assessment together with the Power  of

Attorney,  to  the  Rural  Board  or  the  relevant

District  Council and change it. But that  has  got

nothing  to  do  with  the  endorsement  from   the

landlord.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to repairs, I can promise the Member

for Changi that I will look into it again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Upon the Member for Changi gesturing with his

hand-]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not know whether the hon.

Member wishes to speak or whether he wishes to act.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I wish to speak on this

point.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim Cher Kheng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, just only two days ago I

went  to the Katong District Office. It had  to  do

with  a  fisherman, staying in Siglap,  who  had  a

father who passed away quite a long time ago.  This

fisherman  owed an assessment rate  of  over  $100.

Also he was sick and I had to recommend him to  the



Social   Welfare  Department  for   public   relief

assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the trouble is this. He cannot pay the

assessment  because  it is not  in  his  name.  His

father  is  dead - he has a death certificate.  So  I

approached the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>



Chairman,  Mr Lim Chuan Kim, who had an  interview

with this poor fisherman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He insisted that, first of all, this poor

fisherman  had to swear that he was the son  of  so

and  so,  who  had passed away on  a  certain  day.

Secondly,  this man had to get an endorsement  from



the landlord, because there was a form to be filled

up  and  I  think somewhere below on the right-hand

side,  the landlord's endorsement was required.  So

that is why I have this question in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government really have sympathies for

these  poor  squatters and at-tap dwellers,  please

simplify  the procedure and do not let the landlord

have  such  powers  to refuse to endorse  the  poor

squatter's name.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the matter

referred  to  by  the  Member  for  Changi  is   an

exception. I say it is an exception because,  after

all,  the person concerned may probably not be  the

only son. There may be other members in the family.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> That is true.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Exactly, and that is why I say

Letters  of  Administration must be  taken  out  to

satisfy  the Chairman of the Rural Board that  that

particular son is entitled to have the name on  the

assessment changed into his name.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my purpose in initiating this debate is

mainly in regard to the education policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I think I spoke enough on the question

of  a  merger with the Federation of Malaya  and  I

also  touched on a Pan-Malayan economic  policy.  I

wonder  if the Government at this juncture has  any

policy in mind regarding the formulation of a  Pan-Malayan education policy.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I would like to put this

debate  in its right perspective. The amendment  is

in  regard to Grants-in-Aid, not the general policy

of  education.  So the hon. Member  should  confine

himself to Grants-in-Aid. If he wishes to speak  on

the  general  education policy, then he  must  wait

until the Head itself is proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am fully aware of your

explanation. The reason why I particularly pick out

Grants-in-Aid  is because they are linked  up  with

the education policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What type of schools do you want to grant money

to?  Will it benefit our children when we spend  so

much money in grants-in-aid?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly mention these grants-in-aid

because  I want to know from this big sum - there  is

no  need to quote this figure - how much of it is  to

be spent on Malay education? Sir, I especially pick

out Malay education, because I have just touched on

the  question of Pan-Malayan education  policy.  If

so -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Point of information. I think

it  will save time if I inform the hon. Member that

there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>







is   no  such  thing  as  Grants-in-Aid  for  Malay

education.   Malay  schools  are   being   run   by

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I thank the Minister for

Education  for his explanation. Sir, the grants-in-aid  are mainly given to Chinese schools. I am  not

wrong in saying Chinese schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have proudly been telling the world that

we  are  spending  nearly a quarter  of  our  total

revenue on education.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I think the grant-in-aid to Chinese schools

will  be  more  than the money spent on  Malay  and

Tamil education. Therefore, I want the Minister for

Education  to tell us this. What contributions  can

the  students, who graduate from the many grant-in-aid  schools,  make to this country  and  how  will

society benefit by the spending of so much money on

these  grant-in-aid  schools,  especially - and  this

looks  like an anti-climax - since the lingua  franca

must be Malay?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members may be surprised and say, "Why

does  the Member for Changi who always fights  hard

for   Chinese  education  now  suddenly  have  this

query?" Sir, I think this is the right time to  let

the  public know exactly how the money is spent and

the results that can be expected especially for the

tens   of  thousands  of  Chinese  school  students

whether in primary or secondary schools or  in  the

Nanyang University who have to face the future.  If

the  Minister  for  Education cannot  let  us  know

exactly  the  policy  in his mind  as  regards  the

future  of the many thousands of children in  these

grant-in-aid   schools,  then  I  think   that   is

disastrous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, which I want to raise is

the  question  of  salaries.  There  is  a  general

complaint  about the difference in  salary  scales.

Many  teachers do not understand how their salaries



are  arrived  at,  especially  when  some  of  them

receive  much  less than their former students  who

may  have  just graduated or are receiving training

from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>



Teachers'  Training  College  and  whose   academic

knowledge is not as good as their former teachers'.

The  student becomes a teacher and he draws a  much



higher  salary than a principal or his form master.

Therefore, I wish to take this opportunity  to  ask



the Minister to give a clear-cut explanation as  to

why there is this difference in the salary scales.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I want to raise is about the

recognition of Chinese degrees. The Minister always

says,  "Push  it to the Public Service Commission."

Sir,  I  do not think that the recommendation  that

certain   Chinese  university  degrees  should   be

recognised  and  those  of  others  should  not  be

recognised   comes   from   the   Public    Service

Commission.  Therefore,  I  wish  to  know  who  is

responsible for this recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is about the allowances of the

principals  of schools. The Minister has  given  an

assurance in public on many occasions that he  will

see  that  the  principals' allowances  in  Chinese

schools  will be on an equal footing with those  of

the  English schools. I think it is high  time  for

the  Minister  to declare solemnly in  public  when

this will come about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point, Sir, is about the new classes to

be  opened.  There are many over-age  students  who

graduate from the senior primary schools wanting to

get into the junior secondary schools. If a student

is  even  one  month over-age he  is  told  by  the

headmaster,  "I am sorry. We cannot enrol  you."  I

think  there  is a very big number of such  overage

students and the rural schools are causing a  great

deal of inconvenience. Many students from the rural

areas are over-age and simply because of this fact,

the  schools shut their doors to these students.  A

week ago, I met ex-students of the Chung Cheng High

School,  a few from the Yoke Eng School,  the  Sing

Wah  School and the Min Chong School and when I went

to  see  the  headmasters, they said,  "Sorry,  the

students  are over-age and there is also no  room."

But after I had a detailed discussion with them,  I

was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>



given  to understand that actually there are vacant

classrooms.  There  are still a few  classrooms  in

Chung Cheng High School and I also learn that there

are  a  few  vacant classrooms in Chung Hwa  Girls'

School  but  because  of  the  incidents  in  1956,

Government  decided  to  cut  down  the  number  of

classrooms in a few Chinese high schools. I  wonder

whether  such a policy is still maintained or  not.

In view of the vast number of over-age students who



cannot enter secondary schools, I wish the Minister

can   reconsider  the  reopening  of  these  vacant

classrooms in Chung Cheng High School and Chung Hwa

Girls'  School so that these students can enrol  in

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Changi referred to the question of the  future

problem of thousands of children who come out  from

the schools every year. I must remind him that I am

not the Minister for Employment. What I am doing is

to  give education. The Government is committed  to

free  primary education for all those children  who

are  of the correct age. The question of employment

depends  on  many other factors, not  on  education

alone.  Of  course,  we  will  have  to  mould  our

education  in  order to suit the employers'  needs,

but  this question arises. Can the employers,  that

is   the  trade  and  Government,  take  all  those

students? I doubt if they can, and that  is  why  I

have   always  advocated  that  children  who  have

finished their primary education should not all the

time  go for a grammar school type of education  in

the  secondary schools. They should resort  to  the

trade school and learn some other trade instead  of

merely getting a secondary education which might be

worthless to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of salaries and post allowances to

Chinese principals has been dealt with many a time.

I  have  said  publicly  that  they  will  be  paid



accordingly. There are certain technicalities still

being worked out. I cannot give a certain date  for

payments.  I cannot prophesy how long it will  take

to resolve all these technicalities, but I can give

an assurance that they will be paid very soon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of over-age pupils, previously

the public blamed the problem of over-age pupils on

the  Japanese  occupation. Well, the occupation  is

over - more than 13 years have passed since  then - and

this  should not be made the excuse for a place  in

school  for  overage pupils. We must remember  that

there  are  many other children of the correct  age

who  want places in schools and we must look  after

them  first.  The over-age pupils from the  primary

section  will  be  given a chance  in  the  evening

classes.  Evening classes have been  opened  and  I

have  stated in this House quite a number of  times

that  they  will be given a secondary education  if

they  want a simplified secondary education in  the

evening    classes.   This   House    approved    a

supplementary vote of $500,000 for this not so long

ago. Therefore, that question should not worry  the

Member for Changi so much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of capital grants, I

think  the Member for Changi was referring  to  the

grants  to  over  80 schools which  have  not  been

included  in  the Estimates. I wish to  assure  the

House, firstly, that everyone of those applications

has  been registered and dealt with in my Ministry.

I  am  aware,  however, that many of these  schools



will not be able to commence operations in 1959. It

would  therefore be unrealistic to include them  in

the  Estimates and merely show an impressive figure

with  actually no meaning in that figure. Secondly,

in  view of financial stringency, I do not wish  to

tie  the hands of the next government with too many

heavy commitments. The next government will have to

find  the money and I have no doubt that they  will

have  to do so at any cost, for the sake of Chinese

education  and Chinese culture. The next government

might  have a policy different from that  of  mine,

but  as  far  as I am concerned, my  policy  is  to

assist  all  schools which come to my Ministry  for

advice  and help. This policy is formulated on  the

basis  of the recommendations made by the All-Party

Committee  on Education. However, it  must  not  be

construed to mean that anybody can get any kind  of

help or any kind of favour from my Ministry if they

will  only ask for it. There are certain set  rules

and regulations to follow, and the public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>



are   requested  to  observe  them  so   that   the

government machinery can work smoothly, impartially

and fearlessly.
