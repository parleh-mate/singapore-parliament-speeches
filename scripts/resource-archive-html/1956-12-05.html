allegations made against them.

the  Banishment  Ordinance  are  not  intended  to

enable   persons  affected  to  learn   and   meet

allegations  made against them,  as  the  question

suggests.  They  are ordered to  be  held  if  the

Governor   in  Council  should  so  decide   after

considering a written statement of the grounds  on

which  it appears to the Chief Secretary that  the

banishment  of  an individual from the  colony  is

conducive to the public good. Whether or  not  any

enquiry is held is determined by reference to  the

circumstances  and  the facts  of  the  particular

case.

position  to  give the hon. Member the information

which he seeks. The collection of this information

would be a very formidable task. The files



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



relating to 1,344 private companies would have  to

be   examined,  and,  in  many  cases,  additional

information  would  have to be obtained  from  the

companies themselves. This would mean that  senior

and subordinate staff in the Income Tax Department

would  have  to  be taken off the  more  important

business of assessment and collection of tax for a

considerable period, and I am not prepared to give

instructions that this should be done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Does the Financial Secretary not

agree  that  this  information  is  vital  on  any

decision as to whether there is an excess  profits

tax or no, and how can he advise the Government on

that  very important factor if he has not got  the

information?

November  that I would endeavour to give  him  the

information which he seeks at this sitting of  the

Assembly.  Unfortunately,  this  has  not   proved

possible.   The   task  is  one  of   considerable

magnitude.  It involves a detailed examination  of

balance sheets and statements of accounts  of  127

public companies. I regret that I cannot say  when

this  examination  will be  completed.  There  are

other matters of great importance which have to be

seen  to.  I can assure the hon. Member,  however,

that  I  will  give him the information  which  he

seeks as soon as possible.

Secretary whether the 10 per



cent  fee  payable  on first registration  of  any

motor  vehicle is payable by the purchaser of  the

motor  vehicle or by the seller; and  whether  the

to the seller.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> It is assumed that the hon. Member

refers  to motor cars imported by dealers for  sale

locally. In such cases the additional 10 per  cent

registration fee is at present paid by the  dealer

and  the receipt is given to him. The possibility

of   introducing   an  arrangement   whereby   the

alternatively,  is  given the  receipt,  is  being

explored at the present time.

Communications and Works whether he  will  make  a

statement on the progress of the measures taken to

relieve traffic congestion along that part of  Yio

Chu  Kang  Road between Serangoon Garden  Way  and

Paya Lebar Post Office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This is a matter for the City

Council and Rural Board. I understand that  it  is

intended  that  the road at this point  should  be

straightened and widened to 66 feet with a reserve

so that it can be further widened to 100 feet at

a    later   stage   if   necessary.   Acquisition

proceedings are now in progress. As soon  as  they

have  been completed and some temporary structures

and shophouses have been removed from the line of

the  road,  the  work of widening  will  commence.

Meanwhile   some   alleviation  of   the   traffic

congestion  may  be possible by reinstituting  the

former  white  line down the centre of  the  road.

This  has  already been done in the  City  Council

section  of the road and the Rural Board has  been

asked  to do the same in that portion of the  road

in the rural area.

prophesy when the site will be clear and the  work

can go ahead.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT POLICY ON FLOOD PREVENTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Ulu Pandan Pilot Scheme)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Works whether he  will  make  a

statement  on  the  Government's policy  regarding

flood  prevention,  and in particular  whether  he

will  state the Government's intentions  regarding

the Ulu Pandan Pilot scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The first part of the question raises

a large and complicated issue. I think it can best

be  answered  by the publication of a White  Paper

which  is  now  in draft and which  will  be  laid

before this Assembly early in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the question refers, I think,

to   the   pilot  scheme  which  the  hon.  Member

mentioned  in the Assembly in November 1955,  when

he  told  us  that the object was  to  demonstrate

whether  the flood waters from the Alexandra  area

could flow westward into the Ulu Pandan valley. As

regards  that scheme, I think it is only  a  pilot

canal  that  was dug on the westward side  of  the

Buona  Vista  road  and  railway;  obviously   the

Alexandra water cannot flow down on the other side

of  the road and railway. It has to be taken  past

the  road  and railway which at present we  cannot

do.  If the flood waters of the Alexandra area are

to  be carried out to the westward through the Ulu

Pandan channel, which is the right solution,  then

it  will be necessary for three high velocity  box

culverts  to be installed under the road  and  the

railway   embankments.  This   and   other   flood

alleviation  measures are contained in  the  Chief

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> As indicated in my reply to an

Member,  the  power  to impose  and  cancel  speed

limits  lies with the Commissioner of  Police  and

the  City  Council or the Rural Board as the  case

may be. It was the opinion of the Commissioner  of

Police  that  the speed limits in all rural  areas

should  be  examined and he had  a  representative

committee  appointed to advise him. The  committee

has  concluded  its  deliberations  and  has  made

recommendations. In so far as the Bukit Timah Road

is concerned, the Commissioner of Police is

now  seeking the agreement of the Rural  Board  to

delimitation   of  the  areas  proposed   by   the

the  existing speed restrictions will  be  amended

forthwith.

<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the first of three Bills standing in

my  name  in  the  Order Paper all  of  which  are

measures  to  enact  the legislation  required  to

establish  in Singapore the system of  reformative

training for young offenders between the  ages  of

16  and 21, which is commonly known as the Borstal

System. We already have provision for children and

young persons, that is to say, the age group 7  to

16.  They are provided for under the Children  and

Young  Persons Ordinance by means of remand homes,

approved schools, approved homes and other special

places  of detention; and provision has also  been

made  for  the reformative treatment of those  who

are  over  21  years of age. The  High  Court  can

sentence them to corrective training with  a  view

to  their reformation and the prevention of crime,

but  as yet we have no properly established system

for  dealing  with the age group 16 to  21.  As  a

temporary expedient, we have segregated them  from

the older and hardened criminals in the prison  by

setting  aside a Young Offenders Section to  which

those young people over 15 are now sent. But  this

has only achieved segregation and has not provided

adequately for any reformative training, nor  have

the courts at present power to sentence people  to

reformative training. It is high time that we did

make   proper   provision  for   the   enlightened

treatment of this age group 16 to 21. This  is  an

age at which the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



majority  are likely to respond to expert  efforts

to  reclaim  them from crime and to  prevent  them

from becoming criminals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development programme provides for building a

new  Borstal  Institution and in  our  Development

Estimates for next year we have entered a vote  of

$1,000  for  preliminary work  with  a  view  to

building  a new Borstal Institution to  house  300

persons.  But  we  can  make a  start  immediately

without  waiting  for the new  building.  The  old

remand  prison  at Outram Road  Prison  has  been

separated from the rest of the prison and  it  has

been  converted  so  that it can  be  used  for  a

reformative  training centre. It will  accommodate

120  boys.  Staff can be found from  the  existing

prison  staff,  and  again in the  1957  Estimates

recently approved by this Assembly, provision  was

made for the necessary funds to pay the staff  and

to  run  a  reformative centre in the Outram  Road

Prison. I am sure that this legislation will  have

the support of all of us in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill gives the High Court and District

Courts  power  to pass a sentence  of  reformative

training  for young males between the ages  of  16

and  21,  and it also enables Magistrates'  Courts

and  Juvenile  Courts to send up to  the  District

Courts   appropriate  cases   for   sentences   of

reformative  training. In each case the  Court  is

required  to  satisfy  itself  that  the  boy   is

suitable  for reformative training, and  clause  3

(5)   and  (6)  on pages 2 and 3 of the Bill  ensure

that   great  care  is  taken  in  assessing   the

suitability of each case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important principle in this Bill is that it

provides  for  flexibility which is  necessary  in

these cases. Prisoners do not remain tidily in one

age  group  during the period of their  sentences,

nor  will they all respond in the same way to  the

reformative  treatment.  One  may  be  ready   for

release  much earlier than another,  and  what  is

decisive in this Borstal System is not so much the

gravity  of  the  offence for which  the  lad  was

convicted, but the reformation of the boy.  So  it

is  that the Courts are not empowered to impose  a

period in sentencing a person to reformative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



training  under  this Bill. The  law  provides  in

clause  2  merely  for a sentence  of  reformative

training.  The  actual  period  in  each  case  is

decided later by the Visiting Justices as  is  set

out  in  detail in Schedule D, subject only  to  a

minimum  period of 18 months, that minimum  period

being  provided  so that there  is  time  for  the

training at the centre to have effect on the  boy,

and  subject  to a maximum period of three  years,

though  it  can  be five years for certain  graver

offences. In this way, the length of training in a

reformative centre can be adjusted to  the  nature

of the person concerned, the whole object being to

reform  this young boy and turn him into a  useful

citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.34 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  purpose  of  reformative  training  will   be

entirely  lost  unless these young  offenders  are

housed  in a building which has not the appearance

of a prison. While welcoming this Bill, I think we

should  be  very  careful  to  keep  these   young

offenders  as far away from a prison in  Singapore

as  possible.  Not only the building  where  these

young  offenders are to be housed should  be  away

from  any  prison, but it should be so constructed

and   arranged  that  it  has  not  the  slightest

appearance of a prison.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Secretary, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Yes, Sir, I agree entirely that the

view  expressed by the hon. Member  is  important,

that  a Borstal Institution should not be regarded

as a prison, and our plans for the new institution

are  that  it shall be well away from any existing

prison. We have done what we can in converting the

old  remand  prison  to  separate  it  as  far  as

possible from the other parts of the prison.



There  will be a separate entrance and it will  be

an entrance which is connected with the offices of

the  prison  administration rather than  with  the

remainder of the prison, but, nevertheless, it is,

of course, a disadvantage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



that  the  institution  will  start  in  what   is

commonly  regarded  as a prison.  But  as  against

that, we feel that we should make a start. We have

something like 80 young lads now undergoing prison

sentences and we can do something for them even if

the  conditions are not ideal, and we should  like

to  start  on  trying to rescue  these  young  men

rather than wait until we can get what might be  a

much more ideal institution site.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the second Bill providing for the

introduction  of Borstal training. It  amends  the

Prisons  Ordinance to allow for the  reception  in

reformative  training centres of  persons  between

the  ages of 16 and 21 who have been sentenced  to

reformative   training  and  includes  reformative

training centres in the definition of "prison", so

that  they can be put under the administration  of

the Commissioner of Prisons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the only clause which calls for comment

is  the  new  sub-clause (3)  on page 2,  which  is

another  example  of the flexibility  to  which  I

referred just now. That clause enables a boy  whom

the Visiting Justices find to be incorrigible,  or

to  be  exercising a bad influence  on  the  other

inmates  of  the  institution, to be  removed  and

transferred to the ordinary prison. This again  is

necessary  because some lads may  not  respond  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the third and last Bill required for

setting  up  a  reformative training  centre.  The

purpose of the Bill is very fully explained in the

Explanatory Note at the end of the Bill.  Briefly,

it  is  to  enable a boy, who has been dealt  with

under the Children and Young Persons Ordinance and

has reached 16 years of age, to be transferred  to

a   reformative  training  centre   if   that   is

considered  by the Court to be more  suitable  for

him.   This   Bill  completes  the   comprehensive

arrangements  for dealing with the age  groups  of

children and young persons up to 16, the 16 to 21,

and  then  the  over 21, and it provides  a  means

whereby  a  young  person  dealt  with  under  the

Children and Young Persons Ordinance can later  be

dealt with under the provisions for persons of  16

to  21 by means of reformative training. I do  not

think I need add anything else, Sir, on this Bill.

and I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I certainly welcome all the three Bills piloted by

the  Chief Secretary. They are steps in the  right

direction. I would, however, commend the following

to Government. I always believe in the saying that

prevention  is better than cure. Cure should  come

only  when  we  have  exhausted  our  methods   of

prevention. I happen to be dealing with many youth

organisations and am interested in youth  affairs.

In  fact,  I am tackling this one problem.  It  is

important, Sir, that before a boy, finding that he

has nothing better to do,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



associates with bad company and indulges in crime,

he should be given something more constructive for

him  to  fill  his  time. I am referring  to  many

institutions which exert a very good influence  on

the  youth  of  Singapore.  Such  institutions,  I

suggest,  Sir, are really assisting the Government

in  their  efforts to prevent a boy  from  turning

into  a  bad  character, and if  Government  would

seriously  consider giving greater  assistance  to

such institutions, then I think the money spent in

this   direction   would  help   to   reduce   the

expenditure that would be incurred in starting all

these  reformative measures. I suggest, Sir,  that

the  Government should examine my suggestion  very

carefully  and  consider giving increased  aid  to

such  institutions because they have a  favourable

influence on young children.

<br><br>10.52 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in  rising  to  move  the   motion

standing in my name, namely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the policy of

Malayanisation of the public service as set out in

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 65 of 1956,



<br><br>I  wish  to emphasise that the statement of policy

on  the  Malayanisation of the public service  was

made   after   the   most   careful   and   minute

consideration  of the Malayanisation  Commission's

Report and the administrative problems involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayanisation of the public service is one of

the  main  planks  in  the  Labour  Front-Alliance

Government's programme, and it is the Government's

duty  to  see  that  Malayanisation  proceeds   as

smoothly and as quickly as possible with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



a minimum dislocation of the government machinery.

At  the  same time, it must be true Malayanisation

and this can only be brought about by malayanising

the key posts now occupied by expatriate officers.

It is only by doing this that we can hope that the

Malayanisation  policy will be pursued  vigorously

and  effectively. The Government  is  in  profound

agreement with the Malayanisation Commission  that

the  objective should be the Malayanisation of the

administrative  service.  Immediate  and  complete

Malayanisation  of the administrative  service  is

not  possible, but by taking over the  key  posts,

the  greatest  measure of Malayanisation  will  be

achieved  within the shortest time without  having

to  displace  all expatriate officers immediately.

It   is  the  Government's  firm  view  that   the

principal civil service advisers of Ministers must

be local men and this change must be brought about

forthwith  as soon as the new Public  Service  Commission comes into being, I hope, on the first  of

January, 1957. These key posts are the nine  posts

of  Permanent Secretary grade listed in the  White

Paper  laid  before this Assembly today,  and  the

choice  of candidates for these posts will be  one

of  the  first  tasks  of the new  Public  Service

Commission in the new year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, Sir, I wish to stress that the

immediate   Malayanisation  of  these   posts   of

Permanent  Secretary  grade  is  no  slur  on  the

present  expatriate holders of these  posts.  This

decision is both a political and an administrative

necessity. The expatriate holders have served well

and  have  given of their best to this Government,

and  I am confident that they will freely give  of

their  wide  knowledge and experience  during  the

next  six months so as to ensure that their  local

successors  will  be assisted to  the  maximum  in

taking  over  the new duties. I am also  confident

that  our  local officers, who will be given  full

responsibility from the start, will  rise  to  the

occasion and prove that they are no less able than

their predecessors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that no Member in this House will run away

with  the  idea that, by immediately  malayanising

the  Permanent Secretary posts, the way is set for

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>

smooth  Malayanisation of the public service.  Far

from  it.  It is just a proper start and the  only

logical approach to this difficult problem.  There

are  just  over  500 expatriate  officers  in  the

government   service,  both   permanent   and   on

agreement or contract. The problem is not only  to

replace  these  officers during the coming  years,

but  to fill the many vacancies that now exist  in

the   service   and  also  to  keep  the   service

malayanised.  The  rate  of  Malayanisation   must

depend,  in  the  first place, on  the  number  of

expatriate  officers who wish to avail  themselves

of  the  abolition  terms and leave  this  country

immediately.  It would be ideal  if  the  rate  of

exodus  of expatriate officers could be controlled

or regulated. We can do this only up to a point by

offering  some  form of inducement  such  as  that

proposed  in  the  compensation  scheme,  and   no

further,  for it is useless to force an  unwilling

officer to stay against his wish. To be without an

officer  is better than to have an unwilling  one.

We  recognise the freedom of every man  to  choose

his  employer.  We will not retain  a  single  man

against his wish. Malayanisation would have been a

much easier task if in every senior service we had

local  officers  in  sufficient  numbers  and   of

sufficient      seniority     and      experience.

Unfortunately,  Sir, we have not.  In  practically

every senior service there is a disconcerting  gap

between  the local officers recruited  before  the

war and those after the war. The gap in some cases

is from eight to ten years. Also the number of pre-war  senior local officers is small simply because

it  was  not the policy of the colonial Government

then  to  open the door of the senior  service  to

local   officers.  The  responsibility  for   this

shortage  of senior local officers must  therefore

be   placed  at  the  doorstep  of  the   colonial

Government.  We  must therefore courageously  make

use of what we have, otherwise we will not have  a

true   merdeka  if  the  civil  service  is  still

dominated by expatriate officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will note in the White Paper  that,

apart  from  the immediate Malayanisation  of  the

Permanent Secretary posts, the Government has also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



decided on immediate Malayanisation of other posts

for  which the Government is confident that  local

candidates  are available. Expatriate officers  in

posts  which are not to be malayanised immediately

will  be  retained for varying periods which  have

been   decided   upon  after  the   most   careful

consideration.  Still  it  is  not   likely   that

Malayanisation   will   proceed   the   way   that

Government wants. We will get an accurate  picture

of  what  is  likely  to happen  only  when  every

expatriate  officer  is  notified  of  his  future

career in accordance with the White Paper and each

of  them has indicated what his intentions are.  I

therefore  warn hon. Members that the, last  words

have yet to be said on Malayanisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members  will  have  noted  that  in   the

technical service the period of continued  service

to  be offered to expatriate officers is generally

longer  than in the administrative and  the  legal

services,  for instance. The reason  for  this  is

simple. We are short of technical men, not because

our boys are incapable of becoming technicians but

because  the old colonial policy was not  to  open

the  door of the senior technical services to  our

boys  to  obtain high technical qualifications.  I

want to stress that the technical departments  are

responsible  for our technical services  on  which

depends  the  well-being  of  everybody  in   this

country,  and also our reputation as a great  port

and  terminus. We are training as many technicians

as possible, but it will take time to produce them

in  sufficient numbers and it will also take  time

for  them  to  gain  sufficient  experience  after

qualification. Until then we must  depend  on  the

qualified expatriate technical officers to run our

technical services efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next few years will be the most critical

for  the  civil  service in the  history  of  this

country.  We have plans for the reorganisation  of

the  civil  service  and we hope  that  all  these

measures  will  help in not only malayanising  the

public  service  but in keeping it malayanised  by

the  supply  of  qualified  officers.  Except   in

certain technical or professional posts for  which

certain qualifications are the sine qua non, every

able officer will have an opportunity of rising by

merit to the highest appointment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, one word to our expatriate officers

who will be leaving us between now and the day  of

complete  Malayanisation. To  those  who  wish  to

leave  now,  I will repeat: we will not  retain  a

single one against his wish. To those who elect to

remain  for the period we ask for or for a  period

of  their  choice, I will say that  they  will  be

eligible   for   promotion  in   accordance   with

traditional   service   principles,   subject   to

paragraph 11(f)  of the White Paper, and that  they

will continue to enjoy the same salary scales  and

conditions  of  service as at present.  They  need

have  no  fear  that  they will  be  discriminated

against  in  any way. I want them to realise  that

they   must  move  with  the  times  in   colonial

territories. Malayanisation has nothing to do with

obtaining big jobs for a few local officers. It is

a  logical  conclusion  in  the  progress  of  any

colonial  territory  towards  self-government  and

ultimate independence. The entire control  of  the

government must be vested in the local people, and

we  must prepare for this well in advance of self-government.  I  therefore move,  Sir,  the  motion

standing in my name.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  second  the   motion,

reserving my right to speak at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.05 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  must  first  record my  regret  that  the

Government,  on  such  an  important  subject   as

Malayanisation,   has   given   Members   of   the

Opposition  a bare three days to study its  policy

before  they are asked to debate it. Some  Members

of this Assembly who have offices in town received

the policy statement on Saturday. Those who do not

have  offices  in town received the  statement  on

Monday.  The Hon. the Chief Minister stressed,  no

less  than  three  times in his speech,  that  the

Government gave the most careful consideration  to

the    recommendations   of   the   Malayanisation

Commission's Report. The Government took  no  less

than nine months to meditate on the Report.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



But it has given the Opposition a bare 48 hours to

study  this  policy statement. Fortunately  it  so

happened  that the major recommendations  of  this

White Paper were acceptable to most Members of the

Opposition, namely the acceptance of the principle

that the control room of the civil service will be

taken  away from the white man and put into  local

hands immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayanisation is one of those issues which have

bedevilled  the Government, striking right  inside

the  machinery  of government for the  last  eight

years  since the reoccupation of this country  and

principally in the last three years. Not long  ago

the whole civil service was nearly in open revolt,

not  on the specific issue of Malayanisation,  but

just  out  of a feeling of bitterness, frustration

and  discontent  with the policy of  the  colonial

Government. It is comforting to know that  such  a

bitter issue can find a relatively peaceful end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not supporting this statement of policy

because  we  believe that if this White  Paper  is

implemented   Malayanisation   will   become    an

accomplished fact. We support it because once  the

principle  of  handing over the  control  room  is

accepted and implemented, then the flood gates are

opened, and the white men will be swept out of all

positions  of administrative control in  the  next

few  years.  That  is  why  we  have  accepted  in

principle  the statement of policy  laid  down  in

this White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the reaction of the public and of

those  members  of  the public in  the  government

service  who are directly affected by  this  White

Paper  has  been a mixed and varied one, depending

upon -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whether they are or are not affected, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Whether they are white or Asian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the white man is concerned, those

commercial   tycoons   whose   friends   in    the

administrative service have long held the ring for

them, I think we shall have to wait until the hon.

Mr  Sutherland makes it known how he feels  about

it.  From  now onwards Mr Sutherland may  not  be

able  to pick up the telephone and ring up Tom  in

the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



of  Commerce  and  Industry for  a  drink  at  the

Tanglin Club to settle a few matters about  A.  P.

Forms and Foreign Exchange controls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to those who have been at the

other end of the colonial stick - the big end of the

stick - this   has   been  a  source   of   constant

irritation.  I  am  not suggesting  that,  because

local  men are moved into key positions, therefore

the revolution in Malaya will be over. In fact, at

a later stage in my speech, I wish to remind these

local  men  who  are  assuming control,  that  the

future   of  the  democratic  state  in  Singapore

depends  upon  the integrity and  the  drive  with

which they discharge their duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper has been unsatisfactory on

two  very  important branches of the apparatus  of

government -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The judiciary, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The police.



<br><br>These  were the two issues which we never  settled

with  the Secretary of State for the Colonies.  He

preferred  not  to  discuss them  until  he  could

settle  the  question of internal security.  Since

that was not settled, these two issues on which  we

knew we were going to meet difficulties ware never

discussed  at  the conference table.  But  he  did

indicate that the present High Court judges should

not  be  removed,  and  that the  Commissioner  of

Police   and  the  Deputy  Commissioner  and   the

Director of the Special Branch of the police force

could  not  be Malayanised without the consent  of

the  Defence and Security Council. I am,  however,

astounded  that, although the Secretary  of  State

had  only  reserved these three  important  posts,

this  Government  should have agreed  that  it  is

impossible to Malayanise the police force  in  six

years, and that it has proposed to retain about 30

permanent   officers  of  the   rank   of   Deputy

Superintendent of Police and above  for  at  least

six  years.  The  Commissioner of  Police  himself

admitted before the Malayanisation Commission that

the  police force including his own job  could  be

Malayanised   in   five  years.   The   Commission

recommended a period of three. The Government  has

chosen six. To a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



certain extent, the experience of Members  on  the

other  side of the recent disorders in the  Colony

of  Singapore when they found that their own lives

and  property had to be defended by Gurkha  troops

and  police and European officers may have weighed

heavily in their minds. The Asian officers in  the

police force no doubt are somewhat frustrated  and

embittered about the Malayanisation of the  police

force. I was discussing this matter recently  with

someone  who  had  occasion to  know  these  Asian

officers.  He  said, "Well, they  have  got  their

deserts.  The  cowards  did  not  go  before   the

Malayanisation  Commission  and  beard  the  white

officers  in the Malayanisation Commission's  den.

They   deserve  what  they  have  got  for   their

timidity."  To  this,  someone  wisecracked,   "Or

perhaps   this   is  the  best  place   to   start

subversion! You have a discontented group of Asian

police  officers who now find for the  first  time

that  they  have  a  stake in merdeka;  that  with

complete  and  absolute merdeka will come  avenues

for   promotion.  Therefore,  if   we   are   true

subversionists,  we should exploit  the  situation

and  hold  out  this carrot to  the  Asian  police

officers to support merdeka!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say this to the Asian officers, if they

demand  the  right to take over the police  force,

let  us see their mettle. Let us see the grit that

is  wanted in men who are to hold the rifle barrel

in this little island. Unless they can prove to us

that  they have guts, courage and integrity,  then

they  deserve  what they have got  in  this  White

Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue on which the White Paper has

been silent is the Supreme Court judgeships. It is

an  open  secret  that there  has  been  political

wrangling over the appointment of two new  judges,

dating  from  the  time  when  the  Labour   Front

Coalition  Government was led by  the  Member  for

Cairnhill.  We  now know from the  estimates  that

only  one more judgeship is to be created. We wish

to  make  it  clear that, whatever this Government

says  in this White Paper, my Party believes  that

the   principle  of  the  inviolability   of   the

judiciary  can only be accepted after we  Malayans

have decided who shall fill those positions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



We  do  not  accept that those whom  the  colonial

Government   has  appointed  as  our  judges   are

inviolate,   and   cannot  be  removed   by   this

Legislature  or  this Government. However  honest,

however good as lawyers they may be, they are part

and  parcel  of  the colonial machinery  which  is

unacceptable  to  any Malayan nationalist.  In  no

territory of the British Commonwealth in Southeast

Asia  were  European judges allowed to  remain  in

office  when  the British imperial  power  finally

departed. The only exception was in Ceylon where a

white  Chief  Justice, who I notice is  already  a

model  for the Chief Justice of the Federation  of

Malaya,   was   allowed  to  remain  because   the

Ceylonese  Government wanted him  to  remain.  But

when that Government decided that he should go, he

went.  That  is  a principle which we  must  first

establish  before we accept the principle  of  the

inviolability of the judicial service. It would be

unfair  to many distinguished judges if my remarks

were  to  create the impression that I think  they

were  all  dishonest  and useless  instruments  of

British  imperialism. The former Chief Justice  of

Singapore,  for  instance,  was  a  man  of  great

learning  and  balance of judgment, for  whom  all

members  of  the Bar, whether white or black,  had

considerable  respect.  That  does  not   in   the

slightest way detract from the principle  that  we

cannot  accept a white judiciary imposed upon  us.

We  want the principle established that if we want

them  to  quit, then they must go.  Then  when  we

appoint  our  local men, they will  be  inviolate.

They cannot be removed either by the Government or

the  Legislature except by the most  stringent  of

procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other matters of detail with which

we  could pick faults in this statement of policy,

but  before  I  do so, I want to congratulate  the

Government  on two important principles  which  it

has   established - one,   in   the   administrative

service,  and  the other, in the  police.  In  the

administrative   service   we   congratulate   the

Government for having created an executive service

so that no man shall be debarred from holding the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



highest  of  administrative posts just because  he

did  not  got to a university to take  an  Honours

degree  and  so  join the elite.  We  live  in  an

egalitarian age. A man is judged for  what  he  is

worth  and what he can contribute to society,  not

by  the  hallmarks  that he has  acquired  in  his

lifetime   in   some  venerable   institution   of

learning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the principle in the police force that

"the  Commission's recommendations  endorsing  the

system of promotion from the Rank and File to  the

Inspectorate and that the gazetted ranks should be

recruited from the Inspectorate and not by  direct

entry  is accepted. The recommendation that  every

member  of  the  Rank  and File  should  be  given

facilities  as  far  as possible  to  improve  his

English  is accepted. Lack of English should  not,

however, bar the promotion of outstanding  N.C.Os.

to  the Inspectorate, or the promotion of officers

of  outstanding ability." Sir, when the white  men

came  and  colonised parts of South and  Southeast

Asia,  they  created a caste in the administrative

machinery. They became an elite and any member who

joined  that  administrative  service  became,  in

varying  degrees, depending on one's  position  in

the  hierarchy, a member of an elite force,  where

entry  was controlled, not by what a man was worth

but  by  what  his  wealth, social  position,  and

education  were  judged  to  be  worth.  With  the

disappearance of the white elite, it is absolutely

vital  that we should not see in its place a black

elite - black, brown, yellow, whatever  the  varying

shades there may be in Asia and in Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tendency among some of the less

distinguished   officers  of  the   administrative

service  recruited locally to imagine  that  their

role is to step into the shoes of these sacrosanct

white men and that the purpose of the State is  to

provide  them with comfortable quarters, important

positions,  comfortable salaries and security  and

pensions.  To  these  men we say  that  they  will

perish,  and  not only them, but  also  the  whole

State  will  perish  with them,  unless  they  re-orientate themselves. With the disappearance of  a

white elite, we must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



put   in  its  place  a  new  and  efficient   and

democratic  group where a man occupies a  position

because of what he can contribute, not because  he

has gained entry by some false standard of values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to touch on some quite minor

points  where we feel that the Commission's Report

could  have  been improved. If we had  been  given

more  time, we might have picked out more  faults;

but  unfortunately the Government  does  not  seem

anxious that the Opposition should give this White

Paper as careful a consideration as the Government

itself has bestowed upon it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is stated here that there are to be two

Permanent    Secretaries   to   the   Treasury - one

responsible   for  Finance  and  the   other   for

Personnel - and that there is, in fact, no need  for

any  one administrative official to be head of the

civil service. On the question of principle,  that

is  wrong.  There should be one head of the  civil

service.  There  cannot be two  persons  of  equal

status, for someone in that civil service must  be

the  "Field-Marshal" through whom  the  Government

issues its directives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the medical branch, it might

interest the Minister for Health to know that  the

doctors are once more thinking of "fixing" him and

I  would  advise, if he were to fall ill, that  he

should choose his doctors carefully!



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, some people in this House

have  no  sense of humour, and for these people  I

have the deepest sympathy. But for the Member  for

Katong, I hope he will bear this in mind - that  the

local  chest specialists think it outrageous  that

they  should wait ten years before they  push  the

white men out. Further, that the local pharmacists

think it equally outrageous that they should  have

to  wait six years before they take over from  the

white  men.  So if the Minister for Health  should

have  any chest complaint, no doubt he will choose

his doctors carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, we support the detailed proposals

in this White Paper. We support it notwithstanding

the fact that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



we  know  that  many of the junior  administrative

officers  are dissatisfied because of a  statement

of  policy that there will be a five-year time lag

before   their   avenues  for   rapid   fortuitous

promotion  will be open. We say to  them  that  we

want  them  to  prove their mettle in  these  five

years,  and to show us that they can compete  with

the white men who will stay behind, not as policy-makers   but  as  functionaries.  If  they  cannot

compete with the white men, then they deserve  not

to be promoted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malayan Civil Service was a mandarinate.

The  legend "M.C.S." after a white man's  name  on

some  wooden swing-door was some kind of hallmark,

symbol  of personal power and influence - as someone

put  it,  "A member of the Black Dragon  that  ran

this  country."  It was patterned  on  the  Indian

Civil  Service. As we draw to the last  and  final

round  of  this battle to wrest control  from  the

white  man, it might be useful to recall the  role

this  particular service played in the  historical

exploitation of the territories of South and South-East  Asia.  Let me read a passage on  the  Indian

Civil Service by a distinguished Indian historian,

Mr  K.  M. Pannikkar, one-time Ambassador of  the

Indian  Government  to  the People's  Republic  of

China, who had reason to know the various types of

civil  service that a State can model for its  own

use. He said this of the Indian Civil Service:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under the 'lmperial' or central Government of

India,  there  were the provincial administrators,

again  with  authority delegated from the  centre.

The  administration of India was  conducted  by  a

Civil Service, a regular mandarinate, recruited in

England  by  open  competitive  examination.   The

curriculum  of the examination was so arranged  as

to  place  a  premium on candidates from  the  two

metropolitan universities of Oxford and Cambridge,

with their predominance of public school students,

thereby  ensuring both the 'class composition'  of

the  services and the imperial tradition.  In  the

first  quarter of the century after the assumption

of  direct government of India by the Crown (1858)

there   were  hardly  any  Indians  in  the  Civil

Service.  Though  from the end of  the  century  a

number  of  Indians continued annually  to  secure

admission to the service, their proportion was not

considerable until after 1919, that is, during the

whole  period  of  imperial supremacy.  The  Civil

Service   not   merely  administered,   that   is,

collected the revenues, maintained law and  order,

and formed generally the magistracy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



over the entire country, but also participated  in

higher  judicial work, a proportion of the  judges

of the Provincial High Courts being drawn from the

administrative service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below this practically 'all-white' service was a

large Indian bureaucracy recruited on a provincial

basis  and  strictly controlled and supervised  in

its  functions by the former. It was through  this

subordinate  or  provincial  service,  exclusively

Indian  in  personnel, that the authority  of  the

Government penetrated to the masses. The  control,

however,  was for a long time solely in the  hands

of European officials."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read what kind of society this mandarinate

created in India:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One other aspect of British authority in India

at  this  period was the conviction held by  every

European  in India of a final and enduring  racial

superiority. Seton Kerr, Foreign Secretary of  the

Government,   explained  it  as   'the   cherished

conviction of every Englishman in India, from  the

highest  to the lowest, by the planter's assistant

in  his  lowly bungalow and by the editor  in  the

full  light of the Presidency town - from  those  of

the  Chief  Commissioner in charge of an important

province   to   the  Viceroy  on  his   throne - the

conviction in every man that he belongs to a  race

whom  God has destined to govern and subdue.' Many

equally authoritative statements of this point  of

view from persons in the highest official position

in  India  could be quoted to show  how  universal

this  conviction was during the last  century  and

indeed up to the time of the first Great War.  One

further  quotation may, however, be permitted,  as

it  throws light on the attitude of the army. Lord

Kitchener, a most distinguished Commander-in-Chief

of India, declared:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is this consciousness of the inherent

superiority of the European which has won for  us India.  However well-educated and clever a native

may  be,  and  however brave he may  have  proved

himself,  I  believe that no  rank  that  we  can

bestow on him would cause him to be considered an

equal of the British officer.' ".



<br><br>And  this  is what Mr Pannikkar has to say  about

this.  (Mr Pannikkar is now the Indian Ambassador

to France.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This flat racialism permeated all the services

and  constituted the distinguishing characteristic

of  British rule in the East in the 19th  century.

Its  effects  were widespread.  In  the  Army,  no

Indian  could  hold  a King's Commission.  In  the

Civil  Service,  no  Indian could  enter  by  open

competitive examination, no appointments  above  a

certain  rank  were  open to  him,  and  the  most

distinguished Indian administrator of his day,  R.

C.  Dutt, had to resign because, on the grounds of

his  race,  he was not promoted to the post  of  a

commissioner.   Social  life   was,   of   course,

exclusive, and from hotels and clubs and even from

certain  parks, unwritten rules excluded  Indians.

Also Indian life was held cheap. Rudd, a planter's

assistant who committed an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



unusually  brutal and cowardly murder,  became  on

his  conviction, a martyr, and the European public

carried on an agitation for his reprieve."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many things have happened since India of the

19th century. The superiority of the white man was

exploded, first, by the Japanese armies  and  then

by  the Chinese armies across the Yalu River.  And

so  also  has  exploded  the  myth  of  the  White

mandarinate.  Once he was an elite, a  person  who

was  groomed  to govern. After the war,  with  the

"banana  colonels",  this  mandarinate  began   to

collapse,  and  we lived to see a Chief  Secretary

stand up and tell the poor benighted natives  that

so  many  hundreds of his European  officials  had

only   School  Certificates  but  that  they   had

commissions in the British Army and were therefore

qualified to hold positions which local  men  with

honours  degrees from local universities were  not

thought fit to hold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been a long and bitter battle, but in

Malaya  it has been much shorter than it otherwise

would  have  been, shorter than it  was  in  India

because the whole process of transfer of power  in

South-East Asia has been high-pressured. There  is

little  time  left for us to take over  the  whole

apparatus  of  state and to make it function  more

efficiently than it did under the colonial system.

In  this apparatus of state the administrators are

a decisive factor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways of revolution in Asia. One is

the Indian model where a political Party, like the

Congress   movement,  obtained  through   peaceful

methods   of   non-violence  and  resistance   the

transfer  of  power  and  the  transfer   of   the

apparatus  of state. That political movement  then

assumed responsibility and the use of an effective

machine - the  Indian  Civil  Service,  the   Indian

Police  Service, and the Indian Judicial  Service.

The  fact that India is today better governed than

Indonesia  is because they took over an  efficient

working  machine. The Dutch did not have  to  hand

over to the Indonesians a working machine and  the

result  was  chaos and muddle in Indonesia  during

the last ten years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is the other pattern of revolution,

that  is  the revolution in China. There they  did

not  take over an existing machine. They  built  a

movement  that  was a government in  itself.  Then

when  they  took over, they swept  aside  the  old

machine  and installed themselves as the  machine.

There  is  a  fundamental distinction in  the  two

methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Malaya (and I still speak in terms of

Malaya and not Singapore, because I do not believe

that  we  could exist as an island state) have  to

choose  the  first method, the method  whereby  we

take   over  peacefully  and  work  the   previous

machine. Revolution by violence in Malaya,  in  my

opinion, would lead to race war. I am sure no  one

in  Malaya,  whatever  his political  convictions,

wants  a  race war. We are convinced that whatever

the zigzags of policy between the Colonial Office,

the  local Nationalist groups and the Communists.,

the  road for this country is the road of peaceful

non-violent  transfer  of  power.  Therefore,   it

becomes  imperative that when we  take  over  this

machine,  it must work, or the whole  basis  of  a

democratic  State will collapse. If  U.M.N.O.,  or

for   that  matter  the  Labour  Front,   were   a

revolutionary Party in the Marxist  sense  of  the

term,  what would happen when they won power would

be   a   sweeping  aside  of  the  whole  of   the

administration and substitution in  its  place  of

the  U.M.N.O. party machine as the government. But

no  constitutional Party in this country hopes  or

desires to do that. What we hope to do is to build

a  democratic State in which the machinery of  the

government  is  there working neutrally,  whatever

political  beliefs  or political  convictions  its

drivers  may  have.  No  constitutional  political

Party  hopes to build up a machine that  can  take

over  the  administration  of  Singapore,  or  the

Federation. What constitutional Parties hope to do

is  to  take over the driver's seat, and the right

to   tell   the  Chief  Secretary,  the  Financial

Secretary and the Attorney-General what to do, for

we shall then be the drivers. But it will be small

consolation  to  the drivers if the  machine  that

they are supposed to drive has broken down. It  is

therefore vital to see that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



with Malayanisation, the machine is no merely kept

intact  and  efficient.  It  must  be  made   more

efficient and effective to meet demands which were

never made on the previous machine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a colonial system which did not have to

respond to popular and public agitation, one could

govern  from the clouds, from Mount Olympia.  From

Government House one issued edicts. One  moved  in

pomp  and  splendour and the whole patina  of  the

colonial  Government gave prestige and  weight  to

any  edict that was issued from high places.  That

is  not open and possible to a colonial Government

now,  and therefore this reluctant, belated  hand-over. A popularly elected government will have  to

respond  to  popular agitation. We have  to  solve

discontents  where before, they  could  have  been

ignored with impunity. A colonial Government could

send  two  Social Welfare vans down to  the  flood

area  and  the  Governor could come and  tour  the

flood  area with his trouser creases still showing

above his rubber boots, and he can be hailed as  a

democrat. But if any elected Minister attempts  to

do  that, he will perish in the next election. The

need for a machine much more effective than before

is vital. The survival of the democratic State, of

the  parliamentary  system of government,  depends

upon whether the state machine can respond to  the

new needs. It is not enough just to have efficient

routine officers who can write good minutes. It is

vital  that you find men with imagination,  drive,

integrity  and purpose to make Malaya  a  thriving

socialist democracy. Those who take over the white

men's  jobs  must  realise  that  not  only  their

pensions, and their future prospects of promotion,

but the future of a democratic parliamentary State

depends  upon whether or not they discharge  their

duties  with  honour and credit. Unfortunately  in

the  past people have been chosen for the service,

not  because it was believed that they had  signal

qualities  for  service to their  fellow-men,  but

because  they had the signal qualities of docility

and subservience to their white rulers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the Public Service Commission told me

several years ago that the reason why his son  had

got on in the world and got into the civil service

was because he and his son were not connected with

politics. He thought it was good advice to a  nice

young  man  like myself whom he should  save  from

perdition. That typifies the mind of the  men  who

choose  our civil servants. We shall have more  to

say  of  this  when the Public Service  Commission

Bill comes up for its Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to fill the civil service with

efficient  people,  then  we  must  have  men  who

understand the purpose of Malayanisation to do the

choosing.  If we have a lot of weak-kneed,  flabby

and feeble types who are more concerned with their

personal  welfare than the welfare of the  people,

to do the choosing, the whole fabric of government

will collapse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support in principle the policy statement of

the  Government on Malayanisation, but we  reserve

our  right to bring up the question of the  police

service and the judicial service, and the right to

criticise  further other points of  detail  which,

because of the shortness of time, we have not been

able  as yet to consider properly. Finally I  wish

to  remind the senior officers who are taking over

the  control  room that theirs is a  trust  to  be

discharged with honour. We hope that history  will

record  the  fact  that they  discharged  it  with

credit to themselves and the community.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  find  that  I  have  much  to  agree  with  the

Government policy on Malayanisation. I agree  with

the  Government  that  Malayan  officers  will  be

trained  to take over vacancies and that the  most

important posts in the Ministries, especially  the

Permanent Secretary posts, will be filled  by  our

local lads. The Government believes that the  role

of  the  expatriate  officers should  be  that  of

advisers and I think that should be the case.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In going through the whole of this White Paper, I

find that generally it is acceptable. I think that

Government has done one very good thing, and  that

is, after Malayanisation, and especially after the

setting  up  of the new Public Service Commission,

discrimination in the matter of promotions to  key

positions will be put to an end. Previous to this,

I  am aware that it was very difficult for a local

lad  with  good  qualifications to  get  into  the

Government  administrative service. In fact,  from

the   year   1935   or  so  onwards,   after   the

establishment of our first college in Malaya, only

the  very  best  graduates from the  college  were

selected for appointment to the lower rungs of the

administrative  service.  The  position  has  not,

however,  improved even after the  liberation.  In

the   medical   service,  there   is   still   the

requirement  that a local officer has  to  acquire

five  years' specialist experience and ten  years'

general experience before he can be promoted to  a

specialist  post. This requirement troubled  me  a

great  deal  and  I made intensive  investigations

into  the matter. What was revealed to me was that

it  had always been the order. I tried to dig deep

into   it   to  find  out  when  that  order   was

promulgated. I was informed that it  was  of  very

long standing. I am not convinced that it was  so,

because  it was not brought into operation  before

local officers obtained degrees to enable them  to

fill  such  posts. I think that unless a circular,

dating back earlier than after the liberation  and

notifying that such an order had been promulgated,

can be shown to me, I shall never be convinced  on

this subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of degrees, there is always a large

number which are equal to one another, and in many

cases  I  found  that jobs were tailored  for  the

officers  they had in mind, so that, although  the

local  lads might have higher qualifications,  yet

because the advertisement said that they must have

certain  specific  degrees from  certain  specific

schools  or universities, they were always  barred

from    entering   the   highest    posts.    This

Malayanisation policy will, however, I  feel,  put

an end to all these difficulties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we have decided on the implementation of

this policy, there is one difficulty that will  be

encountered.   This  difficulty   is   stated   in

paragraph   6  of  the  White  Paper   where   the

Government says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are eight local officers of the

administrative service who each have seventeen  or

more   years   total  service   in   the   Straits

Settlements  Civil Service and the  Administrative

Service  combined. But, below  this,  there  is  a

disconcerting gap, due largely to the  war  years,

and   the   remaining  twenty-six   administrative

officers  all  have less than ten  years  service,

sixteen of them being still probationers."



<br><br>I  say  this - they have only 26 more administrative

officers. Eight plus 26 makes 34, and out of these

34  officers, 16 of them have less than ten  years

service;  and  the conclusion that the  Government

has  reached is that "there will not be sufficient

local  officers  of experience to fill  the  other

superscale posts", so that Government has  decided

on retaining many of the expatriate members of the

overseas  administrative  service.  I  think  that

difficulty can be surmounted if Government accepts

paragraphs  20, 21, 22 and 23 at page  13  of  the

Interim  Report  of the Malayanisation  Commission

which say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, if we seek recruitment for these

superscale jobs from outside the service as  well,

the  greater become the prospects for their  rapid

Malayanisation.  It  was, however,  maintained  by

some  local officers that recruitment for the  top

posts should be reserved for serving officers.  It

was  maintained  that  since officers  joined  the

service  in  the expectation that they would  have

the  opportunity of advancing to the top, it would

be unfair if they were called upon to compete with

outsiders for the more responsible jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that, other things being equal, prior

consideration  should be given to those  who  have

made the Civil Service their life-long career. And

in normal times that should in fact be the case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the period between now and complete

Malayanisation cannot be regarded as  normal.  The

policy of Malayanisation means in effect upsetting

established  practices  by  procedures  which  are

revolutionary.    For    many    local    officers

Malayanisation opens opportunities for advancement

which  had  never existed before  and  which  they

would never have had otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it should be emphasised that Malayanisation

is  not intended as a device to promote wholly  or

even primarily the interests of the Civil Service.

Malayanisation means providing the people of  this

country with an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



efficient  Civil  Service  manned  by   the   best

available local people. If this efficiency must be

provided  by  transfusion of talents from  outside

the  service,  then  this  departure  from  normal

practice  must  be accepted at least  until  after

Malayanisation is complete."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to that, we have paragraph 5 of the

White Paper on Malayanisation which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The field of candidates for these posts will

not be confined to the administrative service.  It

is  essential that the posts be held by  the  best

men  available irrespective of their position  and

status in the service. Nevertheless, it is  to  be

expected that the majority of these posts will  be

filled  by  senior  members of the  administrative

service."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My contention, Sir, is that those who have served

us  well and for very long periods should be given

the  posts.  They  should have top  priority.  But

according  to the White Paper, even if  all  these

men  who have been in the service for a long  time

are  to  be  promoted right now to the top  posts,

there  is  still,  as  the  Government  says,   "a

disconcerting gap". There will be many posts  that

will need to be filled by Malayans. We will not be

able to find them in the civil service itself,  or

in  any  other  service of the Government.  If  we

confine  our  choice to the civil  service  alone,

then it will be narrow. The policy of filling  the

posts  with the best men, the most efficient  men,

will also not be possible to carry out. I suggest,

Sir,  that there is quite a large number of  well-qualified people who are well able to do  the  job

that  needs  to be done. I consider Malayanisation

to  be  like this: we are going to fill posts  with

Malayans,  whether they are inside the service  or

outside. So long as they are honest, efficient and

loyal  to  this country, and so long as  they  are

truly  Malayans, I say that they should  be  given

the  chance of filling such posts after the  local

serving officers have been given the chance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Schedule in the White Paper, Mr

Speaker, Sir, I find that we can divide the  posts

which  are  to be retained by expatriate  officers

into  two classes - the technical side and the  non-technical  side. I do not disagree very much  with

Government's  policy of wishing to slow  down  the

process  of Malayanisation on the technical  side,

but I do contend that the period



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



envisaged to malayanise it is sometimes  a  little

too  long.  On  page 8 of the White  Paper,  under

Broadcasting: Engineering, you have nine permanent

officers  and  you need eight years  before  local

officers can be trained to replace them.  For  the

three  permanent officers in the Printing  Office,

you  require seven years. I find, Sir, that if  we

are  to  start from scratch and we have only  boys

who just enter the university now to contend with,

we   need   less  than  eight  years  to   produce

engineers.  And  if we consider again,  Sir,  that

many  of  our  local students are already  in  the

university,  some  of  them nearly  graduating,  I

think  the period of eight years envisaged is  too

long.  The period can easily be shortened  without

the posts being left vacant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 9 of the White Paper concerning the

Police  the  Government suggests a period  of  six

years  to  malayanise  the  30  posts  filled   by

permanent  officers  of Deputy Superintendent  and

above.  I  feel also that this period is a  little

longer   than  necessary.  There  is  an   opinion

expressed  by  many police officers  that  perhaps

they  lack experience in certain departments,  and

if  they are to take over responsible jobs in  the

police  force, they should be given  a  chance  of

training  in  those departments  where  they  lack

experience.   If  the  Government  is   going   to

implement  this  scheme  of  Malayanisation   with

regard  to  police  personnel,  one  of  the  most

important  things that it should do  would  be  to

send  our  men immediately for training  in  those

departments with which they are not familar. I  am

aware,  too,  that amongst officers who  are  born

locally,   many  of  them  are  fit   for   higher

promotion,  and  it  is  a  fact  that  there  are

vacancies; and I see no reason why they should not

even  be  promoted at this stage so that they  can

acquire  more  experience and a greater  sense  of

responsibility.  The  Member  for  Tanjong   Pagar

suggests that some of our police officers  may  be

so  discontented that they can be  incited  to  be

subversive! I do not believe in that  at  all.  In

fact, I think that our police officers have always

been  very loyal and I do not think that  anything

will move them to become subversive elements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been stated in this White Paper that

Government's  policy is to give our  local  people

who   have  been  trained  a  chance  for  greater

responsibility.  On page 14 of  the  White  Paper,

under  Nursing  Staff, I am aware that  there  are

already four locally trained male nurses who  have

received  the  qualification of R.M.N.  What  will

happen  to  them? It may sound somewhat  detailed,

but  in  the  White Paper it is stated that  three

male nursing staff will be retained for six years.

Will  they  not be a bar to our local  people  who

have     already     acquired    the     necessary

qualifications?  I  would like  the  Minister  for

Health to clarify this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I agree with the White Paper,

but,  of  course, there are defects,  and  if  the

Government  will  mend them, it will  receive  our

support.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I had intended to say something on this White

Paper  and  I  hope still to say it;  but  it  was

comparatively  non-controversial  and   indeed   I

intend to give full support to Government's policy

in  this matter. I have long since accepted defeat

in  what  might  have been termed  a  pro-colonial

policy  as  far  as  this  Assembly  is  concerned

anyway,  (after all, one has to be realistic)  and

anticipated that this debate would be the  concern

of  elected  Members  only;  but  the  Member  for

Tanjong   Pagar  has  thrown  out  some  sort   of

challenge at me and I am not clear precisely  what

it  is. However, I should like to disabuse him  on

one point and, I hope, reassure him on another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that I am not a tycoon. I am a bank

manager, strictly non-commission earning, and non-profit-sharing, and working on a salary basis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



only,  and  if the hon. Member wants an overdraft,

he   can   have  mine!  I  am  flattered  at   the

implication  that  I have some sort  of  influence

over  the official Members-some sort of "old  boy"

relationship-and can only say that if I have given

any  help whatsoever in their work, which I doubt,

it  has been very gladly given. I would assure the

hon.  Member  that,  if during  the  short  period

remaining to me before I am sacked from my firm  I

can  give  any  assistance  to  the  up-and-coming

Permanent Secretaries, they have only to  call  on

me  and  I  will  do my utmost  to  the  limit  of

supererogation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the aim of the policy in this White Paper,

as  I  see  it,  and  its  attendant  Bill  is  to

compensate,   no   more  than  adequately,   those

expatriate officers who, having made their careers

in the colonial service, are in many cases to have

them  cut  short.  When  they  embarked  on  their

careers,  they  probably gave no  thought  to  the

possibility  of this colony attaining early  self-government,  and at a later date few of  them  may

have  realised that the introduction of the Rendel

Constitution heralded the twilight of the colonial

power  in  this  island.  Few,  too,  would   have

realised that men of the calibre of the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar  would rise in  this  Assembly  and

speak  of  "white men" with the acme of bitterness

in  his  voice,  as  if the white  men's  lack  of

pigment were at the root of all this trouble. I am

therefore glad to see, Sir, that the Labour  Front

Coalition  Government has pledged itself  to  give

expatriate  officers  fair  treatment.  A   benign

United  Kingdom  Government is in the  process  of

handing  over  control  of Singapore  to  its  own

destiny.  In doing so, it hands over a  government

machine  in first-class working order,  a  machine

designed   largely   by  colonial   officials   of

unquestioned   integrity,  who   have   earned   a

reputation for themselves for devotion to duty and

a reputation for zeal in their work. They have set

a  pattern  which one hopes will  be  followed  by

their local successors for whom the task ahead  is

certainly not easy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The English phrase "to have a chip on one's

shoulder"  is probably known to all hon.  Members.

As   far  as  the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  is

concerned,  I  fear he is carrying a marble  slab,

and  I  have been greatly depressed by his renewed

attack  on "white men" at such a time when  surely

the   Government   is  looking  for   the   utmost

co-operation  from this section of  the  community.

The White Paper in paragraph 12 states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some expatriate officers may not wish to accept

the offer of continued service, but the Government

hope  that a sufficient number will do so in order

that  the  administration may be carried on  while

Malayanisation takes its course."



<br><br>One  wonders,  Sir,  how many expatriate  officers

who, on learning what the Member for Tanjong Pagar

has said today, will be influenced thereby and  be

prepared to take a chance and stay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only point which I had intended to make

today  is  the following: In paragraph 13  of  the

White Paper, it states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is proposed that the provisions of the

compensation  scheme and the constitution  of  the

Public Service Commission should in due course  be

embodied in an Order in Council."



<br><br>It  seems clear that the Government's White  Paper

applies exclusively to the public service  in  the

Government sense only; but surely "public service"

also  includes the Harbour Board, the  Improvement

Trust, the Telephone Board and the City Council. I

wonder,  Sir, if the Chief Minister would indicate

what the Government's attitude is to the extension

of   the   proposed  Ordinance  as   it   concerns

compensation   to  employees  of  the   government

agencies   that   I  have  just   mentioned.   The

Malayanisation   Commission   appointed   by   the

Government   also   reported   on   City   Council

departments, and it would seem only equitable that

if   the  government  agencies  are  also  to   be

malayanised  at an early date, as presumably  they

must  be, adequate protection such as is given  in

this Bill to Government expatriate officers should

also  be  extended to those officers of the  other

public  services and their rights to  compensation

safe  guarded by provisions being included in  the

Order in Council.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

my  dream is coming true though it will take  some

ten  years  more to get it finalised.  In  October

1952,  Sir,  I  moved a motion in the  Legislative

Council   for  Malayanisation  and  the   Ad   Hoc

Committee  took two years to publish a  report.  I

think  the  expatriates knew  that  the  time  was

coming  when they had to leave. I do not know  how

many  expatriates have been appointed to the civil

service  after I moved my motion in October  1952.

Someone might query about it. Sir, I am not  sorry

that  my dream of Malayanisation will be finalised

in   ten  years.  I  am  not  here  to  give   the

expatriates  a  parting  kick.  I  only  say  that

colonialism  is  coming to an  end  with  the  key

positions of the civil service in the hands of the

local  men. Let us part as friends. I do not think

any Member on this side of the House is anti-white

men.  We  are  only against the white policy.  Any

white man is welcome to trade here, but he may not

be allowed to exploit this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those expatriate officers who stay back

will,  I  hope, give their loyalty to this country

and  also  give guidance to our men  who  will  be

taking  over  the  key  positions  in  the   civil

service;  for, without a good and efficient  civil

service, we might be in the same position as  some

of our neighbouring countries. India, Pakistan and

Ceylon are carrying on as usual as if nothing  has

happened, because there was a trained local  civil

service to take over. We must retain the integrity

and efficiency in our administrative service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members mentioned the judiciary and the

police.  The  control of the  judiciary  will,  of

course, come automatically into our hands when  we

achieve  independence, as has happened  in  India,

Pakistan  and  Ceylon. There are  plenty  of  able

people  who, in the past, did not join  the  civil

service  because they were frustrated. I think  we

will  be  able now to pick out many who,  although

very  brilliant,  would not  join  the  government

service  owing to frustration. I am sure  that  in

this connection the new Public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>

Service  Commission with executive powers will  be

able to help us a great deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all Members on this side of the House will

agree   with  the  Government's  White  Paper   on

Malayanisation.   We  have  not   had   sufficient

opportunity to study thoroughly this White  Paper,

but  there  is  one subject that I would  like  to

touch  on  at page 13. I refer to Education  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Permanent Secretary to be Malayanised forthwith.

The  post of Director of Education to be separated

from  that of Permanent Secretary and the  present

holder  to  continue  until  his  retirement.  All

officers  to  be  offered 5 years  with  promotion

prospects   up  to  Director  (but  not  Permanent

Secretary)   and   with   the   reservation   that

administrative  posts  would  also  be   open   to

teachers  in non-Government schools though,  other

things  being equal, preference would be given  to

Government  teachers; aided  school  teachers  who

have  taken an active part in politics  cannot  be

considered for Superscale posts."



<br><br>I  certainly  disagree with this.  These  teachers

never  knew  what was coming and  they  had  their

share,  like  anyone  else, of  politics.  In  the

Federation  there is no bar to teachers  who  have

taken  part in politics from rising to the highest

posts.  I do not know why we should have this  bar

against  teachers being considered for  superscale

posts  just  because  they  have  taken  part   in

politics.  When  this motion on Malayanisation  is

passed  today,  I think it can be  made  clear  to

these teachers that, if they will not take part in

politics for a one- or two- or three-year  period,

they will be eligible for the superscale posts.  I

think that is very fair. We should try to be  fair

to  those locally born people who have the  brains

and   integrity  to  rise  to  the  top  of  their

profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to say this: now

that we will be taking over, we must retain,  for

our  own  sake, a most efficient service  for  the

good of the country.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> If it please you,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I must confess to considerable

astonishment   this  morning  listening   to   the

lukewarm  support and petty fault-finding  on  the

part  of the leaders of the Opposition Parties  in

respect  of  this  radical measure  which  is  yet

another milestone in our efforts to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



come   out   of   the  dark  caves   of   colonial

exploitation and government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malayanisation of key posts is even more

important   than  new  written  constitutions   in

changing our status from that of a colonial people

to  that  of  human beings. It is recognised  that

Malayanisation  is  a  thorny  problem   and   has

bedevilled  our relations for the past  two  years

and more. It has meant months of sincere effort by

responsible    people   in   the    Malayanisation

Commission  and  on  the  part  of  Government  to

produce  this White Paper now before you, a  White

Paper  which  presents a solution that  is  sober,

that  is  adequate,  and  that  has  achieved   an

amicable settlement with the civil service itself.

I  confess to considerable disappointment that the

only  reception  from the leaders of  the  leading

Opposition  Parties is tantamount to a disgruntled

grunt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the policy indicated in the

White Paper before us means that the new year will

see  a  new era for Singapore, an era when we  can

grow  to a self-consciousness and a sense of self-respect,   because   it  is   not   only   through

constitutions that people grow. It is through  the

realities of life, and the realities, Sir, are  in

the machinery of government which this White Paper

has  attempted and, I think, succeeded in meeting.

For myself, Sir, I would like to say that I warmly

welcome  the  policy indicated in the White  Paper

and I would like to congratulate the Government on

a  magnificient achievement and an excellent  plan

for an essential part of our work as a nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On paragraph 12 of the White Paper, Sir, I would

like to say this. I am not averse to generosity. I

am  not  averse to it particularly if it  means  a

harmonious   transfer  of  power,  and   I   think

Singapore can take the palm in being more generous

than  any  other  territory in the  world  in  the

compensation  it  is  giving  for  the   so-called

element   of   interference   in   a   career,   a

compensation  averaging  $43,000  per   expatriate

officer. I wish I could find myself an employer so

generous. Sir, I refer to it only from this  point

of view - that the Government in paragraph 12 of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



the  White  Paper expresses a sense of alarm  that

expatriate  officers who receive  this  remarkably

generous Christmas gift would see to it that  they

take  it  as soon as they can, free of income  tax

plus  full pension, and try and build a  new  life

elsewhere, irrespective of the need of the  people

of  this country. The Chief Minister has said, and

said rightly, that we should never stop a man from

leaving  our employment if he so wishes.  That  is

true,  Sir,  but  a man who leaves  my  employment

against  my wish does not get by way of  thanks  a

cheque  for  $43,000. It is suggested,  Sir,  that

that  dismissal interferes with his career.  I  am

not going to argue the pros and cons, Sir. This is

not  the  time. This is the time when  I  wish  to

express  the gladness which I feel at the solution

of  a problem, a solution that is essential to our

future growth. If I dismiss him, then by all means

let him receive compensation; but if he leaves  me

against   my  will,  I  cannot  see  how   it   is

conceivably proper that he should consider himself

entitled  to compensation. I know it is  suggested

that  the  very  act of creating a Public  Service

Commission  is  an interference of  so  radical  a

character with the conditions of service that this

compensation accrues. I say, Sir, that that is  so

thin  an  argument that it must be a  very  thick-skinned man who puts it forward. I say, Sir,  that

the  Government  should  consider  either  denying

wholly  or  denying  in part the  compensation  to

those who leave the service prior to the date when

it  is  convenient for the Government to agree  to

the  termination. We cannot too soon  replace  the

administrative  officers,  but  we  can  and  must

retain those with technical qualifications whom we

cannot today replace, because of a colonial policy

in   respect  of  the  civil  service.  If   those

technical  officers take their  compensation and

leave, then it means that this country would be in

a   position  of  having  to  re-employ  them   at

exaggerated salaries and inflated allowances until

such  time  as we are ready with our  own  men-and

they  thus get it both ways. This country is being

asked   to  be  generous - $21.4  million  for   500

expatriate officers. Surely we can make it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



a condition that payment of this compensation will

only  be  made  if  the officer's  termination  of

employment  is  in  conformity  with  Government's

requirements? If we want him to leave at  the  end

of  five years and he wants to leave us at the end

of six months, by all means let him leave; but why

should he get compensation when he knows that  his

leaving  puts  us  to considerable  inconvenience?

Why, Sir? Why should we place ourselves to such an

extent  in the hands of the civil service?  I  can

see no reason, Sir. I do not mind surrendering  to

the  civil service - I am glad that we can  part  on

friendly terms. It costs us $21.4 million - that  is

cheap  enough - but  why  must  we  so  wholly   put

ourselves  in  their hands that we have  to  plead

with  them to stay, when we can say to them, quite

simply,  "If you want to go, goodbye; but  if  you

want to go before we are ready to let you, then do

not  expect  a Christmas cake." That is  the  only

criticism  which I have to make in  respect  of  a

plan which I respect and salute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to deal with some comments which the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar made, and  particularly

the  strictures of a most unpleasant character  on

our  police force. He took it upon himself to call

the  Asian police officers cowards, because  they,

with  their knowledge, their experience and  their

sense  of  responsibility,  did  not  see  fit  to

challenge  the submissions made on behalf  of  the

force by the Commissioner of Police in respect  of

Malayanisation. Sir, I think it  is  true  to  say

that  there  has  never  been  any  suggestion  of

cowardice  in respect of our police force  at  any

time,  that, in fact, in recent weeks we have  had

cause  to respect and admire their courage,  their

fortitude  and  their sense of  responsibility  in

this  territory. I can but regret that  a  person,

who  suggests  that not only is he  a  responsible

Member  of this House but the leader of his Party,

should  make  a stricture of that character  on  a

remarkably  fine body of men because they  do  not

want  to gallop as fast as he does. It seems  that

anybody  who does not agree with the P.A.P. is  a

coward. Sir, it may well be that the experience of

the next few years of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



Malayanisation  may  indicate the  possibility  of

more rapid Malayanisation in the police force, and

I  know  that the Government Benches would welcome

that  day;  and  if  that  day  should  come,  we,

whichever side of the House we may be occupying - if

we occupy any side at all - would only welcome it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other aspect of the speeches made

this morning to which I wish to refer, and that is

the  reference  to the judges. The  Labour  Front,

both  in  the  inter-Party meetings prior  to  the

Merdeka talks last April and at the constitutional

conference  in  London,  made  it  clear  that  we

considered  the principle of the inviolability  of

the  security  of tenure of judges was  one  which

should  be respected, if our wishes were respected

that  no  further judges would be  appointed  from

amongst  the expatriate officers. Sir, the  judges

who  now grace our Bench have served us well. They

carry a remarkably fine tradition that has brought

to  these  shores  one of the finest  institutions

known  to  humanity today; and I, for  one,  would

regret  any suggestion of dragging them  into  the

political  arena. I would particularly regret  any

attempt by the Secretary of State for the Colonies

who sometimes finds it so hard to learn the lesson

that  he  is living in the 1950's and not  in  the

1850's  ,  . . I would regret it very much  if  he

compels  this  country  to drag  the  question  of

security  of  tenure of judges into the  political

arena  by  appointing further  expatriate  judges.

This House has passed the Budget provision for  an

additional  judge and the matter is  certainly  in

the  hands  of  the  Governor  who  will  act   in

conformity  with  the orders of the  Secretary  of

State. I would like to give this assurance: So far

as  I am aware today, the Labour Front, as a body,

believes that the security of tenure of the judges

should   not   be  interfered  with,  unless   the

Secretary  of  State  for the  Colonies  sees  fit

himself  to  endanger  that  security  by   riding

roughshod over the wishes of the people repeatedly

expressed in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final word, Sir. The Member for Tanjong Pagar

has  made  much  of the fear, which  he  seems  to

entertain, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



the  machinery of government might break down.  If

he  has  doubts about the adequacy  of  our  civil

service   to  the  opportunities  which  are   now

offering,  I  believe he is the only  Malayan  who

does have them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Are you a Malayan?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> A great deal more than you are.

Your right to stand for election was in doubt.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I withdraw

that  remark. I am a great deal more of a  Malayan

than  the Member for Tanjong Pagar whose right  to

stand for election was in doubt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Malayan members of the civil service

have  been carrying the burden through decades  of

effort and frustration, from even before the  time

when the Member for Tanjong Pagar was knee-high to

a  pup,  and they are ultimately being  given  the

opportunity.  They come, Sir, as people  who  have

struggled and sweated, who know the value  of  the

prize  which is theirs, and the opportunity  which

is  theirs;  and  I, for one, Sir,  have  not  the

slightest  doubt, not only that the  machinery  of

government  will  function,  but  that   it   will

function with more dynamism and more sincerity  in

its  application to the welfare of the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>3.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  the  whole, I think this Malayanisation scheme

produced today is a fair and comprehensive one and

should  be  acceptable to most of  the  people  in

Singapore. Even the leader of the People's  Action

Party has found very few holes to pick in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one aspect, Sir, on which I wish to

speak today, and that is with regard to the rather

unpleasant recriminations and remarks made  during

the  Malayanisation enquiry. I am quite sure  that

all  members of the service who were attacked will

realise  that  this  was  due  to  the  spirit  of

frustration  and struggle which the local  service

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



had  to put up with for these many years. Now that

we  have produced a comprehensive scheme,  I  hope

that  those officers who will be leaving  us  will

extend  their help and forget all those unpleasant

things  that were said and give as much  of  their

experience as possible to those who will be taking

over from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the young men in the service who will be

taking over the public service, I have this to say

to  them. Their opportunities are tremendous. Such

opportunities  for advancement  and  promotion  to

positions  of responsibility I do not  think  will

occur again. I exhort them to treat this not as an

opportunity  for personal advancement,  but  as  a

dedication  to the service of this country.  At  a

time  when we are working towards the basis of  an

independent  nation, I hope that  they  will  work

hard and make Singapore worthy of its independence

when  we  achieve it and also worthy  of  being  a

member of the family of nations.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Government White Paper on Malayanisation

deserves  support.  It has made  Malayanisation  a

reality.  It is real enough to concern  those  who

did   everything   to   sabotage   it   and   give

satisfaction to those who fought hard  and  longed

for it. The White Paper marks the culmination of a

long  struggle  begun  many  years  ago  by  local

officers  as well as others to break  one  of  the

tightest monopolies in this country - the expatriate

civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a year ago, Malayanisation on the scale

contemplated  by the White Paper would  have  been

dismissed as impossible. Certainly those political

leaders  who  graced the old Legislative  Council,

most   of   whom  have  now  gone  into  unwilling

political  retirement, would have  found  a  White

Paper such as this one a dangerous document.  This

changed  outlook has come about in  a  very  short

time. This is symptomatic of the times in which we

live. We are losing our fear of change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain, Sir, there will be broad agreement

with the scheme of Malayanisation indicated by the

White Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



One  can quarrel that in certain departments,  the

Medical  Department, for instance, the  Government

has been over-cautious, but the essential thing is

that   the   key  posts  are  to  be   malayanised

immediately - and quite correctly. This will ensure,

Sir, that local officers will be in a position  to

guide  the civil service and assist in the  making

of  policy. Whether, in fact, this will be so will

depend  on  the  character, the  ability  and  the

outlook  of  the  local officers who  will  occupy

these  key  posts.  If the local  officer  regards

himself  as  a  local version  of  the  expatriate

officer  whom  he  replaces,  then  Malayanisation

becomes  meaningless. It is merely an exchange  of

the  white  heaven-born for the black heaven-born.

There   is   nothing  more  revolting   and   more

disgusting  than the sight of a black  expatriate.

For Malayanisation to succeed, it is not enough to

replace the expatriates with local officers. There

must be a new outlook and a sense of dedication on

the  part of the local officers. May I quote, Sir,

the concluding words of the Majority Report of the

Malayanisation Commission to remind ourselves  and

the   local  officers  of  the  real  meaning   of

Malayanisation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Malayanisation of the Public Service can only be

a  success  if  all  concerned  regard  it  as  an

expression  of  patriotic service. Local  officers

must  not  consider this an opportunity for  self-advancement  but rather an opportunity  for  self-sacrifice. They should not expect to see an end to

all  their problems but rather a beginning to many

greater  problems  and  they  must  face  the  new

problems  and  difficulties that will  arise  with

courage  and  determination to do  their  duty  in

spite  of the sacrifices they will be called  upon

to make."



<br><br>Without  this  sense of dedication, Malayanisation

will become a humiliating scramble for spoils. The

White    Paper   merely   opens   the   door    to

Malayanisation.  The completion of  Malayanisation

will rest, to a great extent, in the hands of  our

local  officers.  They  must  translate  the  high

intentions of the White Paper into action.  It  is

essential, Sir, that key posts should go to men of

talent and men of dedication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the reconstituted Public Service Commission

will  have  a  decisive  say  in  the  choice   of

personnel,  it is vital that this body  should  be

constituted of men who understand and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



appreciate the purposes of Malayanisation. If  the

Public  Service  Commission is composed  of  weak,

timid  and servile fumblers, then the result  will

be  a  civil  service tainted with  the  timidity,

servility and futility of those who choose them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point here, Sir, on which the

Government needs to be criticised severely. It  is

on the question of compensation. We all agree that

officers whose careers have been cut short  should

receive  some  compensation.  This  obligation  is

moral  rather than legal; but there is a world  of

difference between a just compensation and  lavish

baksheesh. A moral obligation should not be made a

pretext for unbridled generosity at the taxpayers'

expense.  We do not grudge reasonable compensation

to abolished officers, but why should we make them

lottery   winners?   On  what   basis   was   this

compensation computed, and who computed it? It  is

not  compensation but downright plunder. I  cannot

blame  the expatriate officer, Sir, for attempting

to  get  as much as he can by way of compensation,

but  even he must have been surprised at the  size

of  the give-away. Sir, I cannot accept the  scale

of compensation offered.



<br><br>3.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Government has given a  lot  of

thought  to  the  question  of  implementing   the

recommendations of the Malayanisation Commission's

Report  and has in its White Paper paid due regard

to the efficiency of the public service during the

transition period. It is good to know,  Sir,  that

something   is  at  last  being  done  to   enable

officers,  who have never had the good fortune  to

go  to  a  university, to earn  promotion  to  the

highest  post if they prove, by their  experience,

to  be  worthy of promotion. In the police  force,

Sir, there is now to be a ladder of promotion from

the  rank and file to the highest post, and direct

entry  to the rank of Assistant Superintendent  of

Police  and above is to be abolished.  This  is  a

move in the right direction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation offered by Government to the

expatriate   officers  is,  in  my  opinion,   too

generous.  These officers are very lucky  to  have

come  to this country after the last war with  the

British  military forces and to  have  found  jobs

here.  They  did  not  possess the  qualifications

required of local officers and were lucky to  find

jobs  which they would never have dreamt to obtain

if  they  had  remained at home.  They  have  been

generously paid for the work that they  have  done

and  are  now  to be compensated for the  loss  of

employment.  I do not see any justification,  Sir,

in   these  officers  receiving  more  than   what

expatriate officers elsewhere received  when  they

had to leave the service on account of merdeka.

facetiously. Since they have been made, I think  I

had better meet them in case there may be some who

think there is some substance in the attacks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of chest physicians, I think the

hon.  Member  said  that, were  I  to  go  to  the

hospital, I would be "fixed" by our local  medical

officers. I would certainly be very pleased indeed

to  lend myself to be "fixed" by the local medical

officers  in  whom I have the greatest confidence. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If there is to be an

intervention, it should be made properly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> With regard to the chest physicians,

Sir,  we have four posts now and one more has been

passed for 1957. Of those four posts, two are held

by  expatriates  of considerable  experience,  and

with the tremendous advance that we are making  in

T.B. treatment, more and more will be needed next

year  and  the  years  to  come.  I  can  see   no

likelihood  that  the  retention  of   these   two

expatriates, if they are willing to stay, will  in

any  way  block  the advancement of local  medical

officers. During the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



next  few  days there will be an addition  of  408

beds  to  Tan  Tock Seng Hospital and another  408

beds  later, in addition to the 500 existing beds,

making  a  total of 1,316 beds; and  when  certain

accommodation is released - it is now being occupied

by nurses - we will have a total of 1,100 beds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the remaining posts, two are being held by

local   officers.  One  of  the  posts  has   been

earmarked to be a superscale key post in  the  new

T.B. unit  the  operation of  which  we  hope  to

commence next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept, of course, the excuse of the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar when he said that he  had  not  had

sufficient   time   to   study   the   scheme   of

Malayanisation of the medical service, and when he

has done so, I do not think he will have any cause

whatsoever to say that our officers have  to  wait

ten  years  before they can occupy key posts.  The

offer  of ten years further service to these chest

physicians has been criticised, but I can  see  no

ground  for  criticism. As I have said before,  of

the  four  posts of chest physician, two  will  be

vacant  and additional posts will be required.  It

is   not   therefore  a  question   of   retaining

expatriate  officers who stand in the way  of  the

local  officers, but rather of retaining  what  we

need   until   sufficient   local   officers   are

available.  It  is  quite obvious  that  with  the

increase  in our T.B. work, a considerable  number

of consultant posts will be required and all these

will  be  subsequently filled, and filled shortly,

by available officers. We need all of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon spoke a lot about the

time  when  local officers had to wait five  years

and ten years and so forth before they could reach

a super-scale post, and that they were frustrated.

I  agree with him, but I can only remind him  that

that was at a time when the Government was claimed

to be predominantly "Progressive".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offer of six years to the Pharmaceutical

Chemist  was criticised by the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar. There are three posts in that department of

which two are vacant, and we shall certainly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>



need that one expatriate officer for six years  in

view  of  the  rate of expansion  of  the  medical

service today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon also criticised the

retention  of  male  nurses  for  six  years.  The

position  here is that we have two superscale  and

nine  time-scale appointments, and two  additional

posts  have been entered in next year's estimates.

Four of these posts are vacant. It has proved very

difficult to find local candidates for training as

male nurses since work in the Woodbridge Hospital

is  not  popular. With the expansion of Woodbridge

Hospital,  it is undoubtedly necessary  to  retain

the four expatriate male nurses for six years,  if

we  can, and there are plenty of vacancies for our

local officers. They will all be absorbed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang said that Government was

over-cautious regarding the medical service. I  am

glad  he said so because I wish to agree with him.

Government   has   to   be   extremely   cautious,

especially  in the Ministry of Health, because  we

have  the  health and the lives of the  people  of

Singapore to look after, and, as long as I  am  in

charge  of this Ministry, I will certainly see  to

it  that  we  give of the best we can. Should  the

Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  and  the  Member  for

Serangoon  or their family have ever the  need - God

forbid!  (to  use  an  expression  which  is  very

popular  with  the  Member for  Tanjong  Pagar) - of

going to our hospitals for attention, and did  not

receive  the  best, I am certain that  they  would

take  the first plane out to another country where

they would get more adequate service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, in reply?



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar stated that, in  his

view,  it was wrong not to appoint a local officer

to be Permanent Secretary to the Treasury and head

of   the  civil  service.  Sir,  as  explained  in

paragraph  3  of the White Paper, we have  adopted

the   arrangement  of  two  senior  officers,  one

responsible for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



finance and the other for personnel, as being  the

most  practical  immediate arrangement,  and  have

stated that subsequently it may be found desirable

to have one Permanent Secretary to the Treasury of

a  higher grade than the corresponding officers in

the other Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar also touched on

the   judiciary.  Sir,  the  judiciary  has   been

deliberately omitted from the White Paper  because

their position is a matter for discussion with the

Secretary  of State when constitutional talks  are

reopened early next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar, too, Sir, touched

on the police. The Government was unable to accept

the Malayanisation Commission's recommendation for

complete  Malayanisation of the  police  force  in

three years, because this would mean promotion  of

the  most senior local officers from four to  five

ranks  to  take over the top positions.  Moreover,

the immediate loss of half of its officer strength

would  mean denuding the ranks of the inspectorate

of  all its experienced officers in order to  fill

the  resulting vacancies in the ranks of Assistant

Superintendent. We have therefore accepted the run-down  of  expatriate officers  put  forth  by  the

Commissioner of Police which will be completed  by

the  end  of  1962. It must not  be  assumed  that

because  30  expatriate officers in  the  rank  of

Deputy  Superintendent of  Police  and  above  are

being  offered continued employment for six years,

they  will  all remain for that period.  A  number

will, in any case, reach the age of retirement and

we  must  expect that others will  either  opt  to

retire   or  be  transferred  on  promotion.   Our

problem,   therefore,  was  to   ensure   that   a

sufficient number of these 30 officers  remain  in

the  force until our local officers were ready  to

take  over completely. It is for this reason  that

we   have   offered   continued  employment   with

promotion prospects for six years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot believe that the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  really  intended the reflections  which  he

cast  upon the courage and integrity of our  local

police officers. They have shown on many occasions

that they are second to none in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



the  world, not only in their professional ability

but also in their personal courage and integrity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both the Member for Tanjong Pagar and the

Member  for Serangoon stated that while they  gave

the  White  Paper  their  general  approval,  they

criticised the detailed decisions recorded in  the

Schedule.  I  must make it clear,  Sir,  that  the

decisions  recorded in the Schedule are the  basis

necessary  for  informing the expatriate  officers

concerned  of the length of period for which  they

can  continue to serve. This must be  done  almost

immediately  and  there can be no  going  back  on

assurances once they have been given. It would  be

unreasonable to ask the officers concerned to make

their  decision unless they could be assured  that

the details in the Schedule are firm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nominated Member Mr Sutherland touched on

the  question of Malayanisation in such bodies  as

the  City Council, the Singapore Harbour Board and

the  Singapore Telephone Board. Sir, it would  not

be  proper  for  the Government  to  commit  these

bodies.  Furthermore, it must  not  be  overlooked

that the terms and conditions of employment of the

expatriate  officers in these bodies are  not  the

same as those applicable to expatriate officers in

the public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hon. Members, Sir - the Member for Cairnhill,

the  Member  for  Sembawang  and  the  Member  for

Ponggol-Tampenis - touched   on   the   compensation

terms.  Sir,  I have already given notice  that  I

will  move  the  Second Reading of the  Retirement

from   the  Public  Service  (Compensation)   Bill

tomorrow.  It  is  therefore my intention  not  to

reply to the points which they have raised now but

to  deal with them tomorrow when the matter  comes

up for discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the policy of

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the Improvement Rate

Singapore Improvement Ordinance (Cap. 259) for the

year 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this rate cannot, by law, exceed 5 per cent

on  property  within the city area.  Hitherto  the

rate  has  always been 2 per cent and the Trustees

recommend  no  change in the rate  for  1957.  The

approval  of  the Assembly is again  required  for

this   rate   under   the  Singapore   Improvement

Ordinance.  This rate, which is  in  lieu  of  the

Improvement Rate referred to in section 59 of  the

Municipal  Ordinance,  is collected  by  the  City

Council  and paid over half-yearly to  the  Trust.

The  money  from  this  rate,  together  with  the

equivalent  Government contribution under  section

23  of  the  Singapore Improvement  Ordinance,  is

estimated at $2,000,900 and forms one of the major

items of revenue of the Trust and is paid into the

Improvement  Fund.  These  moneys  are  spent   on

improvement  schemes,  the  rehousing  of  persons

dehoused   under  this  scheme,  the  opening   of

backlanes,  the  provision  of  open   spaces   in

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I

have  His  Excellency the Governor's authority  to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves of the loan by the

Government to the Singapore Telephone Board  of  a

sum not exceeding $15 millions at an interest rate

of  5�  per cent per annum repayable over a period

of  twenty years by half yearly installments based

on  the  annuity method to be secured by  a  legal

mortgage of the properties and assets belonging to

and  to which the Board holds legal title for  the

purpose  of  capital expenditure  on  the  Board's

expansion programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as hon. Members are aware, the Telephone

Board  was set up in 1955 to operate the telephone

undertaking which Government had acquired from the

Oriental Telephone and Electrical Company Limited.

The Board is charged with the task of providing an

efficient  telephone service  for  the  public  of

Singapore.  It  is  given wide powers  under  this

Ordinance  to  carry out this task. Since  it  was

established, the Board has set itself to  push  on

with the forward policy of expansion. Following up

plans  prepared  by  the  Oriental  Telephone  and

Electrical Company, the Singapore telephone system

was doubled in its capacity between 1950 and 1955.

In  the  succeeding five years up to 1960,  it  is

planned  to double the capacity once more and,  at

the   same   time,   looking   ahead   to   future

requirements  to provide a basis for  even  larger

extensions  in  the  years to come.  In  order  to

implement  this policy, a five-year programme  has

been drawn up covering work to be undertaken up to

1960.  In  accordance with this programme,  it  is

planned that in 1957 the North Exchange in Thomson

Road,  the  Queenstown  Exchange, and  the  Bukit

Panjang  Exchange will be completed. In 1958  work

will  be finished on the City Exchange and on  the

extensions  to the Central Exchange and  the  Paya

Lebar Exchange. By 1959 it is hoped that exchanges

will  be  completed at Tanjong Katong and possibly

Nee  Soon  and  Jurong. This is a very  large  and

expensive  programme  and it has  been  calculated

that,  in order to finance it, the Telephone Board

will require between now and the end of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



1959  $15  million  over  and  above  any  revenue

surplus  that may be available from year to  year.

Of  this  $15 million, $5 million will be required

late  in  1956 or early in 1957, and  the  balance

over  the next two years as the progress  of  work

demands.  In  this connection, Sir, the  Singapore

Telephone  Board has requested that it  should  be

allowed  to  draw  the money as  and  when  it  is

actually required, so that interest will not  fall

due  to be paid in advance of the actual need  for

expenditure. This is the practice followed at  the

present  time in respect of loans to the Singapore

Improvement Trust and is, of course, acceptable to

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board's investment in new buildings and

equipment will show early financial returns. There

is  a  steady demand for new telephone facilities,

and there is no doubt that the increased number of

subscribers,  as  each  new  exchange  comes  into

action,  will  mean a steady rise in  the  Board's

disposable income. As far as can be foreseen,  the

Telephone  Board  should  have  no  difficulty  in

meeting  the  annual installments of the  loan  by

1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of financing the Board,

it  has  been  decided that funds for  development

should  be  provided by Government, and  that  the

Board  should  not, for the present at  any  rate,

make  any  independent effort to raise funds  from

the  public. Financial requirements for the  Board

have been taken into account in Government's plans

for  capital development over the next five years,

which  I  mentioned  when  introducing  the   1957

Appropriation Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the terms of the loan, it is

considered  that interest at the rate  of  5�  per

cent  will  be fair and reasonable in the  present

circumstances.  The loan will  be  repaid  over  a

period   of   20   years  by  annual  installments

calculated  on  the  annuity basis.  This  is  the

method  of  repayment adopted in  the  case  of  a

recent  loan  to the Singapore Improvement  Trust.

Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a small Schedule seeking provision

for  three  important items in 1957. Hon.  Members

will note, I feel sure with satisfaction, that Dr

Benham  has been persuaded to return to  Singapore

to   serve  as  Economic  Adviser  to  the   Chief

Minister.  Dr Benham requires no introduction  to

hon.  Members. It is only a little  more  than  18

months  since he left Singapore after serving  for

eight   years   as   Economic   Adviser   to   the

Commissioner-General.  He  is  an   economist   of

international reputation and he has an  unrivalled

knowledge  of economic and financial circumstances

not  only  of Singapore but also of all the  other

territories  in  South-East  Asia.  We  have  been

fortunate in that he has been able to obtain leave

of absence from his present employers for a period

of a year. His knowledge and experience will be of

the   greatest   value  during  this   period   of

constitutional change and economic development  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is also sought for the salary of the Assistant

Minister in the Chief Secretary's Ministry and also  the salary

of his confidential stenographer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A supplement of $75,680 is also required for the

purchase  of furniture and equipment for four  new

blocks  at the Woodbridge Hospital. Sir, I beg  to

move.

attention  to the fact that for the past  year  it

has been the practice of this Government to put in

an  unending  number of supplementary  votes.  The

practice  in the United Kingdom is that in  Easter

the Budget is presented and every item -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I take it the hon. Member is

speaking  in general terms and not addressing  his

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I had intended to make

certain   general   remarks   and   also   certain

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member then, to start

off  with,  make  his particular remarks  on  this

particular item?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the post of

Economic Adviser to the Chief Minister is  one  of

those  appointments which were  initiated  by  his

predecessor. We in this House are very much in the

dark as to what exactly are the duties of such  an

Economic  Adviser.  We do know that  the  previous

Economic  Adviser  produced a number  of  reports,

including  the Report of the Committee on  Minimum

Standards  of  Livelihood. But we  would  like  to

know: first, why this item was not included in the

normal Budget Estimates if the post was considered

a permanent one; and, secondly, why it is proposed

to engage,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



however internationally well known that person may

be, an Economic Adviser at the prohibitive salary

of no less than $4,000 a month?



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, first of all, on the question of

the duties of the Economic Adviser, these are,  of

course,  to  examine and advise on all matters  of

economic and financial importance to the Colony of

Singapore,  as  may be directed for  investigation

either  by  the Chief Minister or the  Council  of

Ministers or by the Financial Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question why provision was not

made  in  the normal Budget Estimates, it is  only

very recently that we have been able to obtain the

services  of Dr Benham. We were not in a position

to  make  any  provision for  the  post  when  the

Estimates were printed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, as to why, according to the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar,  we  have to pay  a  "prohibitive"

salary  to Dr Benham, we have to pay the  proper

fee  for  ability,  and Dr  Benham's  ability  is

unquestioned, and I have no doubt in my mind  that

we  will get full value for the money which we pay

to Dr Benham in the course of next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, why was no token vote

entered for the post of Economic Adviser when it

was intended to continue this particular

appointment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I can only say that it was overlooked, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Disgusting!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $75,680 for Head D 49 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Turning to the motion, the Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $149,480 for the Heads of Expenditure and for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



services specified in the Schedule stand part of

the motion."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the practice

in the United Kingdom is that in Easter the Budget

is  presented  and the nation and Parliament  know

once  and for all what the Government proposes  to

do  with the finances of the country for the  next

fiscal year. In the autumn sums which are required

but which could not be foreseen are introduced  in

a  Supplementary  Budget.  But  it  has  been  the

practice, in pre-Rendel days, and for the whole of

the last session of this Assembly we allowed it to

pass unnoticed, to put in a supplementary vote  at

almost every sitting of this Assembly. Sir, barely

one  month  from the Budget debates, we are  today

presented with two supplementary votes of about  a

million   dollars.   None  of   these   items   of

expenditure  could be said to  have  been  in  the

"could-not-be-foreseen" category. Every item  that

appears   here - from  the  provision  of   Economic

Adviser  to  the Chief Minister, to the  Assistant

Minister  on  to the confidential stenographer  to

the  Assistant Minister - could have been  foreseen

and should have been included in the Budget, which

is  the proper time for discussion and debate.  We

must oppose this practice, on principle, of having

the  Budget  of this country debated piecemeal  at

every sitting of this Assembly. Sir, the Financial

Secretary should understand that the House expects

at  the  beginning  of each fiscal  year  to  know

exactly  what it is asked to vote for, how  it  is

going  to  be  spent, and does not  expect  to  be

approached  at  every  sitting  with  items  which

should  have  been foreseen but were  not,  either

through   negligence  or  carelessness  or   sheer

stupidity.



<br><br>3.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, the first point is that it is

inevitable  that throughout the year  we  have  to

make  applications  for funds for  services  which

could  not be foreseen at the time the Budget  was

drawn  up.  Preparation of the  Budget  starts  in

February  of each year for the following year.  It

is printed for the first time at the end of August

and  any corrections are subsequently made. It  is

not very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



easy after the first printing of the Estimates  to

make  many  corrections and it is inevitable  that

many  services which are required in the following

year  are left out of the Estimates. That  is  not

true  of  Singapore  alone; it  happens  in  every

country in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of applications for

supplementary  vote,  we  have  achieved  a   very

considerable  reduction this  year  in  comparison

with  any previous year, and the hon. Member  will

find this to be true if he compares the totals  of

the  last  Schedule for 1955 and the last Schedule

for 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is inevitable that things which should have

been   foreseen   are  omitted.   We   cannot   be

omniscient. We cannot foresee everything.  We  are

liable  to  make  mistakes, as  perhaps  the  hon.

Member is. On the other hand, I do not think there

are  many occasions when we have to come  to  this

Assembly  and  ask  for funds for  services  which

could have been foreseen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, as regards the method of presentation of

these  applications for supplementary vote, before

the new constitution came into being we considered

very    carefully   what   procedure   we   should

follow - whether we should proceed on the  lines  of

the United Kingdom Government where the Government

operate  a  very,  very large Civil  Contingencies

Vote. It is from that vote that the United Kingdom

Government  spend money on all the services  which

are  similar  to those for which we ask  funds  in

these Sessional Papers; and towards the end of the

year, in the autumn, when the Government brings up

a  Supplementary Budget, it is merely to  ask  for

funds to meet the services which have already been

paid for from the Civil Contingencies Vote and  to

make good the total of that vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that in future this Government will

operate on the principle followed by the House  of

Commons, but I thought in March 1955 that it would

be  better  for the time being if we proceeded  on

the  basis of Sessional Papers rather than on  the

basis  of a Supplementary Budget once or  twice  a

year.  This procedure does keep Members  in  touch

with the course of expenditure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



incurred by the Government for services which they

supply, and Members are not kept in the dark for a

period   of   nine   months   until   the    first

Supplementary  Budget comes  up.  I  still  think,

after   an  experience  of  18  months   of   this

procedure, that it is the best procedure which  we

can  have  at  the present time. As I  have  said,

perhaps  in the future we will adopt the House  of

Commons procedure.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, I do feel

that  the  answer given by the Financial Secretary

has  not  entirely convinced me. He  has  admitted

that there was an oversight in the case of Head  7

and  I  suspect that it may have been the case  in

respect  of Head 8 and Head D 49. I do feel  there

is  something  wrong  with a  procedure  by  which

within one fortnight of the Budget sittings we are

asked to pass a further $150,000 for 1957.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> With regard to the cases which my hon.

Friend the Member for Tanglin has mentioned, apart

from  that  dealing  with the appointment  of  Dr

Benham,  it  was really a matter of  printing  the

Estimates.  If  my  memory  serves,  I  think   my

colleague  the  Assistant Minister  in  the  Chief

Secretary's  Ministry  was appointed  sometime  in

October.  By  that time, we realised,  of  course,

that funds would be required to pay his salary for

1957   and  it  was  suggested  to  me  that   the

provision   might  be  included  in   the   Draft

Estimates. In fact, it was suggested that we might

move  in  Committee of Supply that an addition  be

made to the Estimates, and it was my decision then

that  we  would  come  with  an  application  for

supplementary  provision at the  last  sitting  of

this year to obtain funds rather than to alter the

Estimates  and  cause  the  Printer  yet   further

trouble.  Sir,  the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar  is

gasping with astonishment! No doubt when his  turn

comes  to  prepare the Estimates he will  find  it

just as difficult as we now find it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the debate

over  the  purge carried out by the  Labour  Front

Coalition  Government, I indicated  to  the  House

that  private employers were carrying  out  little

purges  of their own. The Chief Minister,  in  his

reply, sought to minimise the actions that private

employers  were taking against their  workers.  In

the five weeks since that debate, I regret to have

to  inform  the  House that there have  been  more

cases  of  flagrant  abuse by employers  of  their

position   of   strength  as  a  result   of   the

Government's purge. Those affected are  mostly  in

the  Bus  Workers Union and the Shop  and  Factory

Workers  Union.  In the case of  the  Bus  Workers

Union, Members in this House will recall that  the

Bus  Owners Association, shortly after our debate,

decided that the agreement with their union was no

longer  valid  because, technically, they  claimed

the  workers  had  broken  a  condition  of  their

agreement  by going on a lightning strike  without

notice.  Fortunately,  the  intervention  of   the

Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan) with  the

President  of the Bus Owners Association prevented

the bus owners from going through with this folly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But individual members of the Bus Owners

Association are, to the knowledge of the  Ministry

of  Labour,  carrying  out a vicious  purge  quite

contrary to what the Government itself wants  them

to do. In the case of the Hock Lee bus owners, the

Minister  for  Labour  is  aware  that   his   own

Government  released some ten persons working  for

Hock  Lee  whom  the Government had  detained  for

suspected  subversive activities. When  they  were

released, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



Special  Branch took the trouble of informing  the

Ministry  of  Labour  that there  was  nothing  to

prevent  these men from being re-employed by  Hock

Lee. The Ministry of Labour tried to persuade  the

Hock  Lee  bus owners to take them back, but  they

refused, because it would appear that the  5th  of

November  was  the  expiry  of  the  bus   owners'

deadline  by  which  time everybody  who  had  not

returned to work was considered dismissed. As  the

adviser to the Bus Workers Union, I then wrote  to

the  bus  owners  and asked them  whether  it  was

reasonable  to expect people who were detained  in

one  of Her Majesty's prisons to report for  duty.

No satisfactory conclusion has been reached and  a

very  bitter situation is fast developing in  that

company.  It  may be that nothing  explosive  will

happen  in  the  next  six to twelve  months;  but

surely  the Government, even if the owners do  not

realise it, must expect that this bitterness  will

lead to another explosion one of these days?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is in a position to apply not only

moral  but economic pressure on the company, apart

from legal pressure by passing new legislation  if

necessary,  to  see that there is no  intimidation

and victimisation of workers by private employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other bus company which took the opportunity

to  carry out a punitive expedition of its own was

the Tay Koh Yat Bus Company. I told the House then

that members of the old union were being penalised

by  being made to work two-hour shifts. The  Chief

Minister  was  advised by his permanent  officials

that  that  was  not so. That it was  not  so  was

because  immediately after the disclosure in  this

House  the old workers were put back on eight-hour

shifts;  but  soon after, the employers,  for  the

first  time, told all the workers that  they  must

stop working for one day each week, as required by

the  new  Labour Ordinance - a compulsory  rest  day

without  pay - in order that they can be  penalised;

and  that the spare pool which the employers  have

gathered for themselves in readiness for  such  an

event could be given gainful employment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks later, 15 conductors, because they had

not  collected  more  than  a  certain  number  of

dollars per day, which the employers expected them

to  collect, were suspended from duty.  Again  the

intervention  of  the  Member  for   Tiong   Bahru

resolved what might have become an ugly situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Shop and Factory Workers Union

branches   had   similar   skirmishes   with   the

employers,  and  again  these  are  known  to  the

Ministry of Labour. The Thye Hong Biscuit  Factory

took  the  opportunity to repudiate  an  agreement

with  the Union and to reduce wages by about  one-third.  Intervention  by the  Ministry  of  Labour

persuaded  the  employers not  to  implement  this

downgrading  of  wage rates. One  week  later  the

employers  proceeded  again  to  downgrade  wages.

Again  intervention  by  the  Ministry  of  Labour

managed  to  get the employers to promise - no  more

than promise - that they will wait until the Chinese

New Year before they reduce wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some European employers, too, have decided to

take  advantage of the situation.  There  was  one

case  of  Thorny-croft's.  There  again,  on   the

pretext  that the workers had gone on a  lightning

strike  and  therefore repudiated  the  agreement,

they  sacked  over ten workers,  although  in  the

agreement  with  the workers it  was  agreed  that

there   would  be  no  dismissals   in   case   of

redundancy,  but  that there  would  be  a  roster

system  so that everybody will be given some  work

and  not  retrenched.  Fortunately,  intervention,

again  by the Ministry of Labour, and negotiations

between the union and the management produced some

amicable  settlement by way of severance  pay  for

the  ten  odd persons who were dismissed. But  the

management gave notice that in the not too distant

future  they proposed to change the clause in  the

agreement,  which  they said was  not  valid,  but

which  they  were finally persuaded to  accept  as

still valid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the most flagrant of all the

employers  was  Messrs. George Lee  Motors,  whose

proprietor  is also the proprietor of the  Nanyang

Siang  Pau. As a result of the activities of  this

particular entrepreneur, the regular reporter from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



the  Nanyang Siang Pau is missing because  he  has

been given the sack. The Government should realise

what   some   Chinese   towkays   interpret    the

Government's  action to mean. Some 20  workers  in

Messrs. George Lee Enterprises were sacked for  no

reason whatsoever. According to the workers,  they

were  sacked  because they had been  active  in  a

trade  union  which was a branch of the  Singapore

Shop  and Factory Workers Union. When the  workers

asked  Mr  George Lee why they were sacked,  they

were  told to see Mr Lim Ching Siong, who was  in

jail. The workers unfortunately did not go to  the

Ministry of Labour; nothing happened and they were

dismissed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Mr George Lee and the Nanyang

Siang  Pau, the Minister for Labour must  be  well

aware of the private purge that this gentleman has

embarked on. When Mr Seah Yong was released,  Mr

George Lee told the Singapore Union of Journalists

that  he was delighted and that he would take  Mr

Seah  Yong back. One hour later, he issued a press

statement saying that it was not the policy of his

newspaper  "to  have anyone on the staff  who  had

been   detained   rightly  or   wrongly   by   the

Government." Now there was a patriotic  and  loyal

supporter  of the anti-subversionist  campaign  of

the   Government.  "Anyone  detained  rightly   or

wrongly  by  the Government" is,  as  far  as  Mr

George  Lee  is concerned, persona non grata.  Mr

Seah  Yong  was not reengaged, but  worse  was  to

follow. Mr George Lee's reporters and translators

had  decided that they would be prudent. They left

the  Nanyang Staff Union, which was affiliated  to

the  Singapore Factory and Shop Workers Union, and

decided  to join a moderate, reasonable,  English-speaking,   safe   and  respectable   union,   the

Singapore  Union of Journalists. The reporter  who

used to cover our proceedings in the Assembly, one

Mr  K.  C.  Lee, was the Vice-President  of  this

Union. Mr K. C. Lee was active in Mr Seah Yong's

interests  and  had moved the Singapore  Union  of

Journalists to see the Chief Minister on  no  less

than two occasions. This action, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



believe,  somewhat displeased Mr George Lee.  The

result  was that on one occasion, at an  editorial

conference,  Mr George Lee informed all  present,

including  Mr  K. C. Lee, that it would  be  very

good  for  them  to leave the Singapore  Union  of

Journalists. Mr George Lee was told that it would

be very bad for Mr George Lee to be known as anti-union,  anti  even  a respectable  and  reasonable

union like the Singapore Union of Journalists.  He

exploded  and said, "Yes, I am anti-union  and  so

what?"  On the 30th of October he sacked  five  of

his  workers - one chief reporter, two reporters and

two  translators - who had not been detained by  the

Government and therefore, we must assume, had  not

been  considered  subversive. When  the  Union  of

Journalists asked him what was the reason for this

precipitate action, he banged down the  telephone,

like the democrat that he is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position is not yet acute except for

those who have been personally victimised by these

employers.  But  with the impending  fate  of  the

Singapore Factory and Shop Workers Union - I think I

will  not  be  prejudicing the intentions  of  the

Minister  for  Labour  if I  say  that  we  expect

something  to happen to that union - 35,000  workers

will  be  disenfranchised trade unionists.  Unless

the  Government takes preparatory measures, 35,000

workers  are going to suffer at the hands  of  the

employers,  because when the union  is  dissolved,

all their contracts with these employers are swept

away.  Before there is time for these  workers  to

organise  new  unions  or join  some  other  union

affiliated  to  the T.U.C., they  will  have  lost

whatever  benefits they had won  through  the  old

union.  It  is imperative, if the Government  does

not  want these men to suffer because it has,  for

whatever reasons, incarcerated their leaders, that

interim  legislation be introduced to prevent  any

employer from repudiating any term or condition of

service  which prevails between him and the  union

for  a period of six or twelve months. During this

period  the employer should not alter any term  or

condition  of service without the consent  of  the

Commissioner of Labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>



Within  this period the workers will be  given  an

opportunity to regroup and form new unions or join

other  existing unions. Unless this is  done,  the

responsibility for widespread discontent  that  is

bound  to  follow  the action  of  the  individual

employers  in  taking advantage of  the  situation

must  be the Government's. Whatever the Government

can  say  about its intentions - that they are  just

punishing  the "subversive" leaders  and  not  the

workers  themselves - the workers will come  to  the

conclusion that the action of the Government  has,

in   fact,  resulted  to  the  detriment  of   the

interests  of the workers themselves. I  therefore

give  notice  to  the Minister  for  Labour  that,

unless the Government takes the initiative,  as  I

hope  it will, I shall at the next sitting of  the

Assembly   propose   that  such   legislation   be

introduced  to  tide over the necessary  time  lag

between the dissolution of the existing unions and

the  formation of new ones, so that in  this  time

lag no employer will be able to take advantage  of

the  situation and get his own back on the workers

and their organisations.



<br><br>4.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, out of an adjournment

speech  of  about  18 minutes by  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar,  I find that about  seven  minutes

were  spent  on the triangle of the  Lees - my  good

friend the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee  Kuan

Yew),  Mr George Lee and Mr K. C. Lee! It  would

appear  that I am being held responsible  for  the

misdeeds of Mr George Lee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has been keeping a very watchful

eye  on  the  situation. Ever since the Government

took  action  against subversive activities  as  a

result  of  which a number of trade union  leaders

were  arrested and detained, not because of  their

trade   union  activities  but  because  of  their

subversive activities, reports have been  received

by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



Labour  Ministry  of  alleged  victimisation;  and

whenever   reports  were  received,   the   Labour

Ministry  officials endeavoured  to  call  in  the

employer as well as the workers concerned  with  a

view  to finding a solution to their difficulties.

The  Member for Tanjong Pagar has touched  on  the

work done by the Ministry of Labour and he himself

has  been very closely connected with two or three

such negotiations. He has suggested, Sir, that the

Government  should  give  consideration   to   the

question of interim legislation in order to freeze

the  increased  wages  and  better  conditions  of

employment that have been obtained for workers  as

a  result  of  the  activities  of  the  Singapore

Factory and Shop Workers Union. This matter,  Sir,

has  been occupying my mind for some time and,  as

hon.  Members know, I will be proceeding to London

shortly,  but  I  will leave  instructions  in  my

Ministry   to   explore   the   desirability    or

undesirability  of  introducing such  legislation.

But  I  must ask all workers in Singapore to  come

and  report to the Ministry of Labour where  there

are,  according  to them, cases of  victimisation.

Unless   we  receive  reports  from  the   workers

concerned, we will not be in a position to  render

whatever assistance we could give. The Member  for

Tanjong Pagar has said that, unless the Government

agrees to introduce such interim legislation,  his

Party  proposes to move a motion in this  Assembly

to  achieve  it.  All I can say  at  this  present

juncture,  Sir,  is that I will cause  a  detailed

investigation to be made into the desirability  of

introducing  such legislation and the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar will be informed, at the latest  by

the  next  sitting  of  the Assembly  in  January,

whether   or  not  the  Government  considers   it

desirable to introduce such interim legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.
