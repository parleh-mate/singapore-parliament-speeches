<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in my speech

yesterday I cautioned the authorities concerned to

be  more careful in the implementation of the  new

Road Traffic Act next month. I expressed my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



hope that the members of the Police Force will  be

as  fair  as possible in the performance of  their

duties  and  will not abuse their wide  power  and

cause   unnecessary   hardship   to   the   public

particularly the transport workers. On this  point

I  would like to mention something in relation  to

the cooperation between the Police and the people.

I  feel  that the improvement of relations between

the  Police and the people does not depend on just

a  few  exhibitions, seminars or Police  Weeks  to

achieve the purpose. In actual fact it depends  on

the  impression that the Police has  made  on  the

people.  Usually  when all these  exhibitions  and

seminars are over, everything is forgotten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been complaints from transport workers

that  whenever  they have to make reports  to  the

Police,  the  Police Officers  on  duty  are  more

interested in covering up for their colleagues who

are  implicated in the reports than in taking down

factual statements from the complainants. In other

cases  when  their colleagues are not  implicated,

the  Police  Officers are rude  and  even  hostile

towards  the complainants. They treat  the  people

like  criminals  or  as  their  personal  enemies.

Sometimes a policeman simply stops a taxi only  to

look  into  this  or that matter  in  the  obvious

expectation  of finding some faults to  report  to

his  superior. The cooperation between the  Police

and  the  people is mutual. If Police Officers  do

not  improve  their attitude towards  the  public,

then  how  can they expect the public to cooperate

with them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now come back to what I have said just

now.  When the new Road Traffic Act is implemented

next month, the Police will be issuing tickets  on

the spot for traffic offences. I fear that certain

policemen  might  abuse  their  power  by  issuing

tickets  at random and so prosecute the public  on

the   slightest   pretext.  The  general   public,

particularly the transport workers who  depend  on

the use of vehicles as a means of livelihood, will

be  burdened with inconvenience. On the one  hand,

they have no money to engage lawyers. On the other

hand, they will have to try to avoid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



the trouble or inconvenience of having to go to

court.  Since they are not prepared to  appear  in

court,  they have no choice but to accept whatever

offers   made  by  the  Police  to  compound   the

offences.  If this continues, the misunderstanding

between the Police and the people will be worsened

and  their  impression of the Police  will  become

more   unfavourable.  The  authorities  must   pay

special  attention to all these  problems  I  have

just raised when implementing the new Act which is

meant  to  improve  road safety.  The  authorities

should  be  more  stringent in the supervision  of

subordinates  who,  in  executing  their   duties,

should conduct themselves properly in order to win

the  cooperation of the public and so make the new

Act a success.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Motion in  the

name of the Member for Kim Keat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his policy speech to this House the

President has stressed the importance of arresting

the   trend  of  mounting  crime  rate.  This   is

something  which we must marshall all efforts.  In

our new generation, there are young and irrational

people   who   do  not  realise  the  effects   of

unemployment. They are not willing  to  work  hard

for  the  good things in life which they  want  to

enjoy. They are unable to resist the temptation of

pursuing material enjoyment. But whether  we  like

it   or  not,  these  people  are  living   in   a

comparatively more affluent society where there is

much  more  material wealth to  be  spoliated.  So

rightly or wrongly they have been misled and  have

gone astray.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosperity and progress can also bring about a

mounting crime rate. For example, in recent  years

there  have  been  more  and  more  house-breaking

cases.  The more Housing Board flats we build  the

more   opportunity  there  is  for  house-breaking

activities. As a result, if I may so, should there

be  any appreciable decrease in the crime rate  it

will be something difficult to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>





understand.  On the question of how to  deal  with

criminal  activities we often  hear  the  view  of

those  who  advocate  "fundamental  solution"   or

"treating the root-cause" solution, neglecting the

"treating  the symptom" solution of  the  problem.

Although  "fundamental solution" is  an  important

step  in  the  process, but to think that  if  you

resort  only  to "fundamental solution"  then  the

whole  problem can be solved once and for  all  is

indeed a half-baked wishful thinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of social and recreational amenities,

and  even  on  education, we have  seen  a  marked

improvement   in  recent  years.  We   have   more

recreational facilities and places made  available

in the various Housing Board estates. The People's

Association   is  also  actively   promoting   the

activities  of  the "Youth Corps". All  these  are

positive measures which will lead our youths  onto

the  right  path. School education has  also  been

emphasising  on  the  concepts  and  contents   of

Education  for  Living, which is a very  important

link in our Education system. As such, it is hoped

that  it  will exercise a positive effect  in  the

moulding of the character and personality  of  the

new generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that Education should

also   emphasise  on  vocational  or  professional

training.  We cannot just emphasise on  moral  and

character  cultivation  alone  right  through  the

entire  process of school education, from  primary

to university. In fact, at this stage, we can only

lay  the  foundation for the cultivation of  moral

character  in  our schools. It is only  after  our

young generation has entered the society which  is

described  as "a university for social  education"

that  they  will  be able to really  complete  the

process of the moulding of moral character against

odds  and  trials and all kinds of evil influences

prevailing  in the society. Furthermore,  just  as

Rome  was  not  built in a day,  we  can  see  the

results of a good educational policy only after it

was  formulated and put into practice for a decade

or so. But in the meantime, in the task of curbing

criminal activities, we  could not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



just do nothing but wait for  the

good  results  to appear after a long  period.  So

short-term remedies or measures should be taken to

ensure that there is a decrease in the crime rate.

In  my  opinion, rather than making a  distinction

between  the positive educational process and  the

passive  punitive process as "treating  the  root-cause" and "treating the symptom" respectively, it

would be better to distinguish the two, one  as  a

long-term  educational  guidance  method  and  the

other as a short-term direct therapeutic, treating

the  symptom  method.  These two  measures  should

complement  each  other. We cannot  over-emphasise

one  at  the expense of the other. In the case  of

those  who  have  not received long-term  national

education  or  benefited  from  training  in   the

national  service, who have made  the  mistake  of

going  astray and indulged in criminal  activities

at  their own cost, these are the people who  have

missed  the opportunity for education and for  the

formulation of correct attitude of life  and  good

character.  In my opinion, they are "gone  cases".

They are rotten wood which cannot he carved. It is

therefore  impossible  to expect  such  people  to

become  good  overnight. It is  only  through  the

process  of adequate punishment that these  rogues

can  he made to repent their sins after their deep

embroilment in criminal activities, and it  is  my

contention that such people will only turn over  a

new leaf through the painful process of punishment

to  make  them  abjure their past. The  effect  of

legal  sanction  against criminal activities  does

not  stop at punishment. Its positive effect  will

be  a  deterrent to the criminal-minded. It serves

to   remind   and  caution  those  with   criminal

tendencies  that crime does not pay and  to  check

themselves at the brink of the precipice to  avoid

tripping themselves into the irretrievable  abyss.

This is the positive aspect of legal sanction.  In

order  that legal sanction may produce a deterrent

effect  as expected, to win a war without a fight,

so  to  speak in the military jargon, or  to  stop

theft  and  pilferage without  the  imposition  of

punishment,  it is necessary to forgo  the  feeble

and ineffective light penalties and resort to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



heavier  penalties appropriate to crimes  such  as

armed  robbery. Enhanced punishment will  in  many

cases  provide  the law enforcement officers  with

the  necessary  weapon  to combat  crime,  and  to

forewarn and forestall those with criminal intents

by  nipping  their venturesome motive in  the  bud

before  they commit a crime. In this manner  there

will  be  less  and less crime and less  and  less

criminals  punished, and this is  what  the  kind-hearted would wish to see.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the characteristics of a

criminal mind is the assessment of his loss should

he  trip  in the commission of a crime. Only  with

adequate punishment will it tell on him that crime

does  not pay. If the gain from crime is  set  off

against   the  loss  in  the  form  of  punishment

inflicted on him, and this still leaves sufficient

"residual value", then the thought will  occur  to

him  that  it  is worth taking the risk.  In  some

western  countries, a soft line has been taken  in

regard  to security. Capital punishment  has  been

abolished,  but this will not make  the  criminals

give  up  crimes  or repent. Such  a  society,  if

careless,  may  turn  into  a  dark  world   where

criminals, big or small, will emerge as heroes. So

the  mitigation of punishment will depend  on  the

effect it will have on criminals, i.e, whether  or

not they respond to mitigation. If they do, it  is

fine.  But,  facts and experience have shown  that

the  fight against crime is like a tug-of-war.  If

one  side  relaxes, the other side will  have  the

advantage and will not yield. This is something we

should  guard  ourselves  against.  In  order   to

strengthen  legal  sanction in  this  regard,  the

Minister   for  Home  Affairs  had  sometime   ago

introduced several Bills in this House which  were

passed with the full support of hon. Members. They

reflect  the correct and firm attitude  which  the

House  had  taken in dealing with the question  of

security.  The  Police  will  also,  in  the  same

spirit, adopt a more exacting and effective method

of  work,  mode of organisation and  strategy  for

security  in  order  to  ensure  that  our  people

continue  to live in peace without any unnecessary

harassment  from criminals. With proper deployment

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



marshalling  of  Police manpower to  be  augmented

with  full-time national servicemen,  we  will  be

able to achieve quantitative expansion in addition

to  qualitative improvement, and this will put our

future  task  of  security  on  a  better  vantage

ground.  I am in full agreement with the  part  of

the  President's speech touching on the policy  in

respect of security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion in the name of the

Member for Kim Keat.



<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampung Kapur)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the President, in

his  policy speech on the 21st February, has  said

that  in  1974  the birth rate had gone  down,  to

about  1.5%.  Although experts had predicted  that

because many people had reached the fertility  age

there  would  be  an increase in  population,  our

birth  rate in 1974 was lower than that for  1973.

This  shows  the  success of our  family  planning

campaign.  We  have  to  continue  to   curb   our

population growth. Only then can we carry Out  the

various  economic development projects. Only  then

can  we ensure that our standard of living and the

quality of our people in the next generation  will

be  raised.  From newspaper reports we learn  that

because of population explosion in many developing

countries  the  people are living in  poverty  and

filth and are starving by the roadside. Therefore,

we  in  Singapore have to continue to  work  hard.

This is especially so because we are only able  to

achieve a growth rate of 5-7%. In order to produce

good   citizens  we  have  to  provide  them  with

adequate  food, a decade of education and training

and  care by the family and the society.  The  old

concept  of  "more children means more  happiness"

has  no  place in our new society, and  those  who

bring up big families have themselves to blame. In

fact,  they are a burden and a stumbling block  to

the progress of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is comforting to note that the

Government  has  been  successful  in  its  family

planning  campaign,  and with equality  for  women

there is an increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



in  the  employment of female citizens. There  are

more and more young unmarried women going to work.

They  know  the disadvantages of bringing  up  big

families.  All  these  are a  decisive  factor  in

bringing down our birth rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his speech the President has

said that the Government is going to take measures

to  encourage  young couples to  have  their  aged

parents   live  with  them.  Firstly,  this   will

minimise  the problem of care for the old  people.

Secondly, it will enable the young couples  to  go

out  to  work so that their children can be looked

after  by  their grandparents. This has been  well

received by the young married couples. But I  hope

the  Government will provide other  facilities  to

encourage young couples to have their parents live

with  them. For example, there could be a priority

in  HDB fiat allocation, better designed flats and

increasing  the income tax relief for  maintenance

of aged parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, most big and busy cities are

faced   with   the  severe  problem   of   traffic

congestion. Singapore is no exception. As a result

of  rapid  economic  growth  and  high-rise  urban

redevelopment in the past few years, more and more

high-rise  buildings have been built in  the  City

areas,  thus  attracting more business enterprises

and  workers  into the CBD so that more  and  more

people  and  cars fill up the road  space  in  the

City.  But our road space is limited. During  peak

hours  when both human and vehicular traffic  flow

in  the  same direction, this results  in  serious

traffic  congestion, waste of manpower,  time  and

great   financial  loss.  In  view  of  this   the

Government will spare no effort to alleviate  such

pressing traffic problems and to achieve the final

objective  of  setting  up a  Mass  Rapid  Transit

system  in  order  to solve our transport  problem

once and for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we allow more and more high-rise buildings to go up in the central city area

of  4  sq, km., the staggered times for peak-hour

travel  and other traffic reforms will not provide a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



long-term  solution  to  the  transport   problem.

Therefore, I suggest that such high-rise buildings

should be decentralised. Business enterprises  and

industries should be located in other parts 0' the

island and not centralised in one small area.  And

in keeping with our long-term development aims, we

should plan carefully for a better distribution of

centres   for   Education,   Commerce,   Industry,

Servicing, etc, so that the people may live, work,

study  and  travel in the same centre or vicinity.

This would save time and energy, so that they need

not  have to travel from east to west or from west

to east to work, study or shopping. I believe such

measures  will  help to solve our serious  traffic

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Defence, it is

stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The defence build-up is levelling off. Further

improvement  in  our  defence  capacity  will   be

achieved  not  by greater numbers  but  by  higher

quality.'



<br><br>In  the  past few years, the major portion of  our

Budget  went to Armed Forces, enabling a  build-up

of  our  Armed Forces so that it can play a better

role in defending and safeguarding our territorial

integrity, our citizens and our property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service has become a way of life of our

young citizens. Although they undergo a service of

only  two  years,  the  vigorous  and  disciplined

military  training has brought a  moral  sense  of

duty in our youngsters and has made them healthier

citizens.  They  have  been able  to  acquire  the

necessary  know-how  and  expertise  in   military

warfare. This will stand them in good stead in the

event  of war, when they will be able to  take  up

arms   to  defend  their  country.  This  is  very

important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps we have been lucky. We have been

living  in  peace for so many years. We  have  not

been  affected by the ravages of war.  Instead  we

have been able to live in peace and enjoy life  so

much  so that the skill acquired during two  years

of  national  service has not been  sufficient  to

meet the demand of our youngsters. Therefore,  our

youngsters  would  rather  not  undergo   national

service. Moreover, some parents are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



selfish  and shortsighted. They feel  that  it  is

better not to have national service at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Addendum on the Ministry of Defence

states  that  emphasis  will  be  placed  on   the

improvement  on training, logistics administration

and  the  better  use of manpower.  This  is  very

correct.  In  the  last  few  years,  rapid  urban

renewal and other developments have resulted in  a

shortage of technical labour. We had to import all

kinds of labour from abroad; hence the workers who

were  involved in industrial accidents were mostly

foreigners. There is also an indication that  most

of the labour engaged in our construction industry

have  come from abroad, and that very few  of  our

young citizens are interested in such work. In the

event  that foreign countries place a ban  on  the

exit  of this labour to Singapore because of their

own need for construction workers or for political

or   national   reasons,  then  our   construction

industry  will  come to a grinding  halt  or  even

paralysed. Sir, perhaps during the period of their

national  service, in addition to the  six  months

basic  military and combat training, our  national

servicemen  should  be trained  in  all  kinds  of

technology or in certain kinds of trade  to  match

our development needs, so that upon the completion

of their national service, these young people will

be  able  to earn their livelihood or to  work  in

certain  activities  of our  economy,  whether  on

their own volition or by deployment by the Central

Manpower  Base  of the Ministry of  Defence.  This

will prevent a waste of manpower, time and money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the enlightened leadership

in  our  Government and their rich experience,  we

have been able to achieve a growth rate of 7% last

year,   and   in  spite  of  world-wide   economic

recession our foreign reserves have been increased

to  $6~  billion.  This indicates  that  with  the

support and unity of the people under a climate of

political stability, we shall be able to  continue

to surmount all kinds of difficulties to ensure  a

healthy  economy. In the coming year, in order  to

achieve a growth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



rate of 5-7% so as to build a stable society where

every  citizen  will have an equal opportunity  to

live, learn, train and work according to his  best

and  to his need, it is necessary to mobilise  our

people  to  continue to work  hard,  to  be  self-disciplined, thrifty and enterprising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of my Constituency, namely,

Kampung Kapur, I would like to thank the President

for his speech.



<br><br>3.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since

Tuesday   hon.   Members  of   this   House   have

deliberated   very  shrewdly  on  the  President's

Speech.  I  do  not  wish to waste  much  time  by

repeating  what has been said but  would  like  to

make  a short observation on the current political

stability   of   South-East  Asia   with   special

reference to the Republic of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members are aware that with the accelerated

disengagement of American forces in South  Vietnam

and  other parts of South-East Asia, together with

the   break-up  of  ANZUK  due  to  the   economic

difficulties  of  the participant  countries,  and

with   world   recession  on  the   uptrend,   the

underdeveloped countries have been badly hit. With

such  a  situation before us, I am concerned  with

the  possibility that local Communists would  cash

in  on  the situation and renew their attempts  at

subversion,  and  that  the  right-wing  political

opportunists would make an attempt to come back to

the political arena.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recent events in neighbouring countries have

shown  that  the  Communists have built  up  their

offensive.   This  may  be  a  signal   to   local

Communists  to exploit the unemployment  situation

and  to mount campaigns on unpopular measures that

the  Government may have to take for the  survival

of our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Whampoa yesterday predicted

that  there will be further inflation and economic

hardship,  which means that more and more  workers

will   be   retrenched.  This  could   offer   the

Communists   the   best  opportunity   to   create

political unrest and other violent activities.  If

we are not vigilant, we may face



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



a  situation not unlike the fifties, and  militant

trade  unionism may once again rear its ugly head.

If  this  happens, all that we have built  in  the

last 16 years may be destroyed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not trying to paint a grave picture of

the  situation. But I feel that the point must  be

driven  home  to  our people that what  they  have

enjoyed and hope to continue to enjoy must be paid

for by constant vigilance and no one can afford to

be  complacent, which would make it easier for the

Communists to make a comeback. I am sure that this

House  would  like to be informed of the  measures

which   are  being  considered  to  meet  such   a

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion moved by the Member for

Kim Keat thanking the President for his speech.



<br><br>3.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to join my

colleagues   in   expressing   support   to    the

President's Address on the opening of  the  Second

Session of the Third Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said on the various matters raised

in  the speech. However, I would like to focus  my

attention  on  that  aspect of  the  speech  which

touches  on  the  increasing  crime  rate  in  the

country,  particularly among youths.  I  think  it

proper that I should provide a few definitions and

data  before I proceed further. The United Nations

has  defined "youth" as a person under the age  of

35. According  to  this definition,  all  persons

above  the  age  of 35 are automatically  excluded

from the category of youths. Of course, there  are

many  people  who  claim that  youthfulness  is  a

quality  of  the mind and has little  to  do  with

chronological age. However, this is a  controversy

which  I  am  not  willing to enter  into  at  the

moment.  According to the last census figures,  it

appears  that 62% of the population are  under  25

years of age while 51% are under 21.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



If  the definitive age for youths is 35 years  and

under, then the percentage of youths will be  much

higher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the point, Sir, what concerns me, and

I am sure a lot of other people, is the increasing

rate  of  crime such as robbery, theft and murder.

The problem is aggravated further by the fact that

most  of those involved in such crimes are persons

in  their  teens and early twenties. The President

has observed that in the past high crime rate used

to  correspond with high unemployment figures.  In

Singapore,  in  spite of inflation and  recession,

which  have  resulted in some retrenchment,  there

are  still opportunities for the jobless in  other

industries,   such  as  construction   and   ship-repairing,  provided  they  are  not  too  choosy.

Hence,   there   is  the  capacity   to   maintain

unemployment  figures  at a relatively  low  rate.

Despite all this there is an increasing crime rate

in  the Republic. Clearly, the simplistic equation

of  crime  with poverty no longer holds true.  The

problem  of  crime  in  the  Republic  is  further

accentuated  by  the  fact that,  sometimes,  even

officers   of   the  law  have  been   guilty   of

contravening  the  law. Their offences  have  been

sufficiently sensationalised by the Press, and  it

is not necessary for me to enlarge upon it here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high crime rate is part of the price we have

to  pay for affluence, hut that does not mean that

crime is ineradicable in an affluent society.  The

problem   can  be  solved.  However,  before   the

appropriate  remedies can be  prescribed,  an  in-depth   study   of  the  problem   is   necessary.

Accordingly, appropriate agencies must be  set  up

to study the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am trying to drive at Sir, is that a

lot  of social ills can be cured if new approaches

are  adopted.  In  this  particular  problem,  the

solution lies in adopting fresh approaches  in  an

effort  to  understand our young people and  their

problems.  The  People's  Association  should   be

commended  for  having  taken  the  initiative  in

giving  the newly-formed Youth Executive Committee

a greater say in the running of their programmes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



and  activities.  However, the  number  of  youths

involved   in  the  activities  of  the  community

centres  are  lamentably small. The  rest  of  our

young people who are not usefully employed may  be

indulging  in  useless, if not harmful,  pursuits.

The  waste  of youthful talents is an  eventuality

that  should  be avoided at all cost, particularly

as  our  only  enduring resource is  our  manpower

resource.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that schools and colleges

work  closely with People's Association and  other

such bodies, particularly sports organisations, in

an  effort  to intensify vigilance over our  young

people. Such close cooperation would enable school

leavers  to  be easily channelled into  activities

that would develop their talents to the fullest. I

am  of the view that young people should undertake

a   proper   balance  of  cultural  and   sporting

activities. This would be one of the best means of

ensuring  that  young people have a competence  in

both  sports  and  the arts. I believe,  Sir,  the

recent  restructuring of our primary school system

is  an effort in the right direction in so far  as

it enables young people to choose their careers in

accordance  with  their aptitudes  and  interests.

Appropriate career guidance is essential  so  that

everyone  can  find  their  appropriate  niche  in

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those young people who have succumbed to

drug-addiction,  I  believe  their  addiction   is

symptomatic of their rebellion against society and

is  part  of  their  general  stance  against  the

Establishment.  Although many  studies  have  been

conducted   to   discover  the  cause   for   such

attitudes, I do not think we have arrived  at  any

authoritative conclusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my view that the crux of the matter lies in

the   lack   of  sufficient  spiritual  or   moral

education of our young. It is true that the origin

of  the drug problem and the evolution of the drug

sub-culture   partly  lies  in  the  openness   of

Singapore  society to external influence.  As  the

gateway  to  the  East, we  receive  a  number  of

tourists. While they contribute to an increase  in

our  foreign  exchange earnings, they  also  leave

behind a legacy of their particular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



influence  and life-style. The solution  does  not

lie  in building a "wall" around us but rather  in

strengthening   our  resources   against   harmful

external influences. The Government's efforts have

to   be   supplemented   by   that   of   parents,

organisations  and society. The various  resources

of  the country have to be galvanised in combating

the drug problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the President has observed,

we  have  a generation of young people growing  up

with  little knowledge of the hardships  of  their

parents. These young people are part of the  post-war  generation. Most of their mature  years  were

spent  in the affluent climate ushered in  by  the

People's  Action  Party.  They  have  enjoyed  the

fruits of the new affluence but contributed little

towards  achieving  it.  There  is,  therefore,  a

tendency  among the young to take the achievements

of the older generation for granted. Sometimes the

complacency and insensitivity of the young  exceed

decent  boundaries, particularly when they  resort

to all manner of crime. Some of my colleagues have

advised the imposition of more severe penalties on

offenders.   While  they  serve   as   a   partial

deterrent,  it would not contribute a solution.  I

believe  that the complementary solution  lies  in

establishing  an  effective  dialogue  and  better

rapport   with   the  young   with   a   view   to

understanding  their  problems.  This   is   where

parents and organisations can come to the aid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, leadership among young people may be

provided  by  national service reservists.  Having

undergone rigorous training in the service of  the

nation,  they  are better able to  appreciate  its

needs.  Thus,  national servicemen  can  serve  as

effective digits in society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As rightly pointed out by the Member for Ulu

Pandan, the values which our young are growing  up

with, occasion some concern. There seems to  be  a

growing   rootlessness  as   the   young   divorce

themselves  from  the  values  that  govern  their

parents'  lives. I believe that youths can  imbibe

those  values  traditional to Asian  society  only

through a closely-knit family life. The home will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



be  the  appropriate  place for  learning  correct

values.  Close  family  life  would  also   enable

problem-fraught   teenagers   to   address   their

problems to their parents, instead of looking  for

advice from their peers. I would like to urge  all

parents  to  make every effort to  achieve  better

communication  with their children.  It  is  often

observed  that  the  problems of  the  nation  are

essentially  the problems of the family.  This  is

certainly  true of the problems related  to  youth

and,  clearly, the best solution lies  within  the

family unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on

the Addendum that has reference to the Ministry of

Culture. Amongst other things, the President  said

that  "social  and  cultural  development  is   an

integral  part of the overall development  of  the

nation".  Taken  at  the  microcosmic  level,   it

follows  that  the  cultural  development  of  the

person   is   an  integral  part  of  his   entire

development. The truly educated man must evince an

appreciation   for   the   beautiful   in    life.

Appreciation   of  the  arts  must  constitute   a

necessary  part of education if we are to  produce

fully-developed individuals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I conclude my observations. I thank

the  House  for the patience with which they  have

heard me out.



<br><br>3.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in   rising  to  associate  myself  with  my  most

esteemed  colleagues, the hon.  Members  from  the

Back-bench  and the hon. Member for Kim  Keat,  in

expressing appreciation to the President  for  his

most  distinct Address to Parliament on  the  21st

instant,  may I spend some moments elaborating  on

some of Singapore's problems. Answers will have to

be  obtained  and  soon to fulfil  the  long  term

interests of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem to have started 1975, and a little later

the  year  of  the  Rabbit,  pretty  well  indeed.

Provided   there   is   a   continuing   resilient

population and work force, and a continuous  drive

for productivity, quality and reliability from all

quarters,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



we  should  see more improvement in the months  to

come, barring any unfortunate global crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, what are we doing about the

deficiencies in our Education system  which  needs

immediate attention to fulfil long term  goals?  I

hope  that  the  Education Act  will  correct  the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of education, as I see it, is to

develop  future citizens capable of earning  money

and  fulfilling  their jobs in  an  atmosphere  of

opportunity,  dignity and justice.  In  the  main,

Education  is  to get students to  understand  why

they  must  be clever enough to do specific  jobs,

and  to give them factual knowledge to enable them

to  do  these jobs. In fact, our formal  education

plays  a  significant role in preparing the  young

for  their  future roles in the economic processes

by   inculcating   in  the  young   qualities   of

punctuality, orderliness, regularity, the  ability

to obey orders and to carry out defined tasks in a

set  time. Citizens qualified to maintain  a  good

profitable  industry assist the economy  of  their

country.   They  are  then  rewarded   with   high

purchasing  powers and high standards  of  living.

However,  the Education system, as it is, neglects

to  inform  the  young that the way  they  utilise

their  purchasing power could influence the  means

and  speed  by  which  their  standard  of  living

improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the real interest of democracy to create

knowledgeable  and  proficient consumers  who  are

able  to influence and improve production, boycott

shoddy  goods,  and  help  establish  the  correct

balance  between supply and demand for  goods  and

services, including cultural and social ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our present Education system, we have mere

apologies  for Consumer Education in the  form  of

"Education  for Living" taught in primary  schools

and  "Home Economics" taught to girls in Secondary

Schools.  Consumer  Education  is  needed  without

regard  to  sex  both boys and  girls  are  future

consumers.  We  need  to be taught  in  school  to

ensure  an  appreciation of how the needs  of  the

community are met, an understanding of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



the levying and allocation of taxes, and a clearer

concept of the national budget. Consumer education

if  carried  out  properly in  schools  will  help

students  evolve their own value systems,  develop

sound  decision-making procedures based  on  their

values, evaluate alternatives in the market  place

and  get the best buys for money, understand their

rights  and responsibilities as consumers  in  our

society,  and  fulfil their roles in  directing  a

free enterprise system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, undoubtedly the ever-rising toll

of  accidents  in factories, some  ending  in  the

maiming and even death of productive workers, more

than   merits  the  determination  of  the  Labour

Ministry  to raise standards of industrial  health

and safety especially in the more vulnerable areas

of  building construction, shipbuilding and  ship-repairing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of the Study Group on accident

prevention  in  ship-building  and  ship-repairing

will  also  alleviate  some  of  the  problems  in

Industrial   Health  and  Safety.   The   intended

inclusion  of  Industrial  dermatitis  and  noise-induced  deafness to the Second  Schedule  of  the

Workmen's Compensation Act as compensable diseases

is  another  step forward and so are the  proposed

increases  in quantum of compensation payable.  In

addition, intended amendments to the Factories Act

to  further include more stringent safety measures

are commendable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as safety is everybody's concern, more

stress should be laid on the necessity for further

strengthening the tripartite cooperation  in  this

field.   In  addition,  there  should  be  serious

consideration   by   all  these   three   parties,

especially by Government, to look deeply into  our

system  of Accident Prevention in order to derive,

possibly,  a  solution that would in  actual  fact

reduce   the  accident  incidence  rate  and   the

dangerous occurrences rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take, for instance, the developments in

this  field at present taking place in the  United

States and the United Kingdom which, superficially

at  least, seem to be pursuing opposite paths.  In

the United States, under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



Occupational  Safety  and Health  Act  (OSHA)  the

emphasis  is on enforcement- thousands of esoteric

standards that bewilder and confuse employers.  In

fact, only 5% of the Federal job safety and health

standards  account for 80% of tile OSHA  citations

for  violations.  Further, more than  40%  of  all

serious violations are due to non-compliance  with

just   15  job  safety  and  health  rules,  basic

commonsense rules dealing with the obvious. In the

United  Kingdom, however, there is a move  towards

less  legislation and regulation and greater self-regulation  by  both  management  and  labour.  In

Sweden, recent legislation provides for management-labour  cooperation in safety and health  and  for

trade  unions to become involved in the assessment

of  safety and health risks to which their members

are  exposed. In countries as different as Germany

and  Russia,  substantial  developments  are  also

taking place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have an in-depth study of our system

in  order  to improve and evolve a new and  better

system.  The  need for it is clearly indicated  in

our  accident statistics. In formulating this  new

and  better  system,  the philosophy  must  be  to

ensure  that no worker shall suffer impairment  or

dimunition in health, functional capacity, or life

expectancy  as  a result of his work  and  working

conditions.  Especially  important  must  be   the

development  of long-term programmes to  establish

guidelines  for  the  early  detection  of  health

impairment as a result of work hazards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that crime merits punishment and

that it is the duty of Government to ensure a safe

country  for  our  people apart from  the  country

being conducive for investors, tourists and so on,

to  visit,  is  expected. But in  Singapore  today

employment  is not such a problem, if one  is  not

unduly  fastidious, and even then crime rates  are

on  the  increase. This is more than alarming  and

needs to be urgently checked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we are interested in the long term

interests   of   our  people,   we   cannot   only

concentrate in building our Police Force to combat

crime with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



threat  of  detection and punishment.  Government

needs  to  have a comprehensive policy which  will

enable  it  to determine the reasons behind  these

growing  crime  rates. Once the `whys'  have  been

removed, less of our citizens will turn to  crime.

This  is  a positive step towards crime prevention

and  must  be implemented at the earliest possible

juncture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing crime rate has a tendency to be

tied  up with drug abuse. The ever-increasing cost

of  drugs and the advancement from a lesser  to  a

more  potent  drug, which costs more, necessitates

an  ever-increasing supply of funds, legitimate or

otherwise.  Tile  quickest  way,  unless  you  are

caught,  to  obtain these funds is  to  steal.  If

there  is a threat of discovery, petty theft could

end in murder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To curb crimes of this nature would mean the

developing  of a better and more skilfully  manned

Central  Narcotics Bureau. Surveillance work  will

need to be undertaken to keep an ever watchful eye

on  suspect drug traffickers with the objective of

ultimately  arresting and prosecuting  them.  More

confidence  will  need to be built  up  with  drug

abusers  caught so as to persuade them to  divulge

the sources of their drug supplies. This would  of

course  mean  attaching  CNB  officers  to   fewer

culprits to enable the officers to create a better

rapport with these abusers in order to obtain  the

essential information.

<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

President's   Address   to   Parliament   cogently

outlines the policies of the Government with which

I  wholeheartedly agree. The Second Session of the

Third Parliament sees us facing problems of a very

difficult nature. The problems that we are  facing

today   in  the  wake  of  global  inflation   and

recession are beyond our control and yet the  tone

and   tenor  of  the  President's  Speech   exudes

confidence  in  our ability as a  hard-headed  and

pragmatic  people to cope with these problems  and

at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



same time to plan economic and social development

in  many  spheres. In the field of foreign  policy

the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated in its

Addendum  to the Presidential Address that  "ASEAN

can  help  member states adjust to the rapid  geo-political changes in the region", it is gratifying

to  note  in  this  connection  that  our  Foreign

Minister has been invited to the Peoples' Republic

of China. There is no doubt that his visit will be

the   prelude  to  new  adjustments  in  the  geo-political scene, adjustments which will contribute

to  the  strengthening of stability and  peace  in

this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other points I would like

to  raise.  The  economic recession  that  we  are

facing  today is, perhaps, a blessing in disguise.

The President has very rightly pointed out that we

should  not  be  swayed  by  short-term  political

considerations, and that we should  be  guided  by

the  long-term interests of our people. This means

that we have to take strong measures to remedy the

present ills in our long-term interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen, in the recent past, retrenchment of

workers and the chances are that we will see  more

retrenchments before the situation  takes  a  turn

for  the better. For one thing, these developments

have  taught us a telling lesson. We can no longer

take  things for granted and stick on to lingering

old  habits  and  attitudes.  Many  of  our  young

workers   who   have  no  family  commitments   or

responsibilities  fritter away their  retrenchment

and  other  terminal  benefits,  which  are  quite

substantial  in some cases, by care-free  spending

in coffee houses and in other imprudent and unwise

ways, instead of setting aside the money they have

received  to  tide  them  over  until  they   find

alternative employment. I suggest that,  in  order

to  help them, the NTUC together with the Ministry

of  Labour,  might set up a Fund  into  which  all

monies received as retrenchment benefits should be

paid.  From this Fund, a stipulated percentage  of

the normal monthly wages of these workers could be

paid out to them each month. In my view, Sir, this

is possibly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



one of the best ways to help these workers to help

themselves. On the other hand, Sir, there  is  the

special  problem of the older workers who  are  50

years  old  and over. The chances of  these  older

workers  to  find  alternative  employment   after

retrenchment  are somewhat bleak. I would  suggest

that  in  the  case of such workers,  particularly

those  who  do not get retrenchment benefits,  and

who  have  families  with  school-going  children,

special  consideration should be given.  Some  may

have  the  notion that the Central Provident  Fund

could  be  used to help them but I would say  that

the  CPF should not be used as the purpose of this

Fund  is  to provide retirement benefits. I  would

suggest  that  assistance  be  provided  to   them

through the formulation of a special scheme by the

Social  Welfare Department. Such a  scheme,  apart

from  providing  monetary assistance,  could  also

embrace  the  payment  of school  fees  for  their

children  where this is necessary or the provision

of  free  education, the supply of free  textbooks

and  the  waiving of medical charges at outpatient

clinics.  I  am  not  suggesting  that  a   social

security  scheme  should be  introduced  but  that

rather  any assistance provided should be  treated

as  a  loan  which  would be reimbursable  by  the

worker when he withdraws his CPF contributions  at

the age of 55.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to touch upon is a

matter   which   is   gravely  disconcerting   and

disturbing.   Recent  developments  in   Singapore

clearly  indicate  that  there  are  elements   in

Singapore, many of whom are non-citizens  who  are

silently and surreptitiously, and some very openly

-  dabbling in our internal affairs. Some of these

ugly   adventurers,  who  have  no   loyalty   for

Singapore and who, in any case, we are not obliged

to  look after, hold offices of responsibility  in

associations or clubs of an indigenous  nature.  I

concede   that   where   associations   or   clubs

predominantly  or  solely cater  for  the  special

social  needs  of  a transient overseas  group  of

people different considerations should apply.  But

in the case of indigenous associations or clubs it

is only fit and proper that restrictions should be

imposed to ensure that only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



Singapore citizens should hold office. As  far  as

trade unions are concerned, such restrictions  are

imposed under the Trade Unions Act. I therefore do

not  see  why similar restrictions should  not  be

imposed  on  associations and clubs.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  I  would  stress  that urgent  consideration

should be given to this matter.



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, our President in

his opening Address to the House warned us not  to

expect  real growth rates of 10-12% which we  have

enjoyed  over the past five years up to  1973.  He

has  also  cautioned that we  have  to  adjust  to

slower  growth rates provided there is no war  and

another  oil  embargo or other major  catastrophe.

Our real growth last year was around 7%, which  is

not a poor performance considering the effects  of

world-wide inflation and recession. Singapore will

continue  to  face these problems so long  as  the

international economy is in disorder. We  have  to

learn  to live with these problems and to  do  our

best  to  minimise  the effects of  inflation  and

recession.  All  we need to do  right  now  is  to

consolidate what we have achieved, strengthen  our

organisation  and prepare ourselves  for  economic

recovery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support and welcome the move to encourage

young couples to have their aged parents live with

them. The Government will take attractive measures

to  achieve  this. To have our aged  parents  live

with us and to look after them is a return of  our

gratitude  to  them for bringing us  up.  To  show

filial piety to our parents and honour them  is  a

virtue  of  Asian  tradition. We should  therefore

give  full  support  to  uphold  this  traditional

value.   I  think  the  Government  should   offer

incentives   to  encourage  such   a   move.   One

attractive  incentive  will  be  to  increase  the

amount of relief in income tax for the maintenance

of  aged parents and grandparents. However good an

incentive  this is, in my view filial piety  would

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



meaningless  if  it  is  exchanged  for   monetary

benefit.  Also,  income  tax  relief  would   mean

nothing  to  people  in the lower-income  bracket.

However, I do not oppose this proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another incentive which I can think of is

priority  in housing. Inadequate accommodation  or

overcrowding  often influences  young  couples  to

live  separately from their parents.  Priority  in

allocation  of housing to young couples  who  will

have  parents  live  with them will  reverse  this

trend.   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,   the   Housing   and

Development  Board can also consider giving  early

consideration  to applicants who live  with  their

parents   or  applicants  with  married  children.

Similarly,  applications for  transfer  to  bigger

fiats  should be expeditiously dealt with  by  the

Housing  and  Development Board if the  applicants

can  have their parents live with them, or if they

are  single  and are to be married soon,  then  of

course documentary proof is necessary. I hope  the

HDB will consider my proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Housing and Development

Board must be complimented for its achievement  in

having completed 26,000 units of flats in 1974. It

is  gratifying to note that the 1-1DB will further

accelerate  its  building  programme  towards  new

targets  of  30,000  units and  eventually  40,000

units per year. This is certainly good news to the

applicants on the long waiting list. Almost  every

applicant is craving for early allocation  of  HDB

flats.  With its past records of achievement,  the

HDB will not have much difficulty in achieving its

new targets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since there is an HDB housing

estate  in your constituency, you may be aware  of

numerous   complaints   about   defects   in   the

construction of fiats sold or rented  out  by  the

HDB.  The  Member for Telok Blangah also mentioned

this point yesterday. I believe you are also faced

with  this  problem. The finish of  the  flats  is

generally  poor  and  some  of  the  fixtures  and

fittings  in  the  fiats have  been  found  to  be

defective.  Something must be done to improve  the

quality of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



construction  work.  The HDB and  its  contractors

should  work  hand  in hand to  ensure  that  poor

quality work is reduced to the minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have placed emphasis oil the quality of

everything  we  make, buy or  serve.  However,  in

private  or public housing, it seems that  quality

is  not taken into consideration. The problem,  of

course, is the shortage of experienced and skilled

workers.   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  the  Housing   and

Development  Board  which is the  biggest  housing

employer, may like to consider setting up its  own

training scheme under which trainees are recruited

and  paid  to undergo training at an institute  or

vocational school to learn skills in construction.

On completion of their training, they will form  a

pool   of   artisans   from  which   the   Board's

contractors can draw upon. The Board will continue

to pay a wage subsidy to these trained artisans to

induce  them  to  remain on  employment  with  the

Board's  contractors.  The  Board  can  make   the

trainees  sign  a  service bond  to  prevent  them

quitting half-way through their artisanship. It is

believed  that a certain contractors'  association

is  contemplating  such  a training  scheme.  This

should  be given every encouragement. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  the HDB already has its own granite  quarry,

brick factory and sand quarry to ease the shortage

or even achieve self-sufficiency in tile supply of

building  materials.  Likewise,  if  the  training

scheme  is  found feasible, the HDB is assured  of

its   own  supply  of  trained  workers  and   the

standards   of   construction  will   be   greatly

enhanced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the subject, of "Employment of

Young  Persons" under the Ministry  of  Labour,  I

wish  to make brief remarks. Young persons between

the  ages  of 14 and 16 years will he  allowed  to

work  in  industrial  establishments  without  the

prior  approval  of the Commissioner  for  Labour.

Sir, I consider such a move a retrogressive one if

it were not for the fact that this was recommended

by  the Committee on Crimes and Delinquency  as  a

measure  to reduce delinquency among school  drop-outs. Sir, I hope there will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



adequate  provisions to ensure  that  these  young

workers  will  not  be exploited  by  unscrupulous

employers.  The  Ministry of  Labour  should  also

categorise  the  type of jobs suitable  for  these

young persons so that their physical capacity will

not  be  overtaxed. Regular inspection and  strict

enforcement of the law must be carried out by  the

Factory Inspectorate to ensure compliance of these

regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion moved by the Member for

Kim Keat.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Ong Soo Chuan):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise to support the Motion moved  by  the

hon. Member for Kim Keat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will recall that the President,  in

the  Addendum to his Address at the Opening of the

Second  Session of the Third Parliament on Friday,

21st February, 1975, stated that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our foreign policy must take into consideration

the new situation arising from the gradual scaling

down of American and Western military presence  in

the region. The overwhelming Western influence  in

the region has been correspondingly reduced.'



<br><br>The  President has alerted us that this  situation

"will  lead other powers to seek greater influence

for themselves in the area".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members are aware that detente has replaced

the  cold  war,  but detente does not  necessarily

mean ending of tensions and conflicts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the cold war, small nations steered clear

of  the conflicts between tile two blocs by simply

taking a neutral stand, and for the most part  the

great powers tolerated this neutralism. Also, some

small  nations  joined one of the  two  camps  for

shelter and protection. The great powers were also

willing to take risks and even military adventures

on  behalf  of their small allies. In  future  the

contest  for  influence  among  the  great  powers

continues, despite detente. But with detente,  the

rivalry  among  the  great  powers  has  become  a

complex   web   of   simultaneous   rivalry    and

cooperation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the onset of the energy crisis, the United

States  and  their allies had a  slight  edge,  in

terms  of  economic and military power,  over  the

Socialist  bloc.  However, the energy  crisis  has

adversely affected the Western countries more than

their Socialist counterparts. In other words,  the

energy crisis has slowed down the economies of the

Western  countries, and this  has  the  effect  of

weakening  their will to maintain  their  dominant

presence in Asia and elsewhere in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in South-east Asia the contest for

influence  and  supremacy  by  the  great   powers

continues.  Until  a  new  balance  of  power   is

established   in  our  region,   there   will   be

uncertainty and instability in our area. While the

US  has disengaged herself militarily from Vietnam

and continues to be under domestic pressure to cut

down   her   military  commitments  in  Asia   and

elsewhere,  the  Soviet presence has  become  more

pronounced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China and Japan will, with the passage of time,

become  factors likely to influence events in  our

part  of  the world. If the contest for  influence

and  power is conducted peacefully and rationally,

then  we  need have no great fears and  even  some

benefits could come out of it all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, "ASEAN can and must play" as the

President   has   stated  in  his  Addendum,   "an

important role in lessening the leverage the great

powers    can   otherwise   have   in   exploiting

differences and conflicts within the region."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was due to the foresight of the leaders of

ASEAN  countries that ASEAN was formed eight years

ago. ASEAN has grown from its modest beginnings to

an effective and lively regional body able to meet

the   challenges  of  changing  times.  With   its

combined  population  of more  than  200  million,

abundant  natural  resources, political  stability

and     an     ever     improving    developmental

infrastructure,  ASEAN  has  the   potential   for

increased economic development which in turn  will

help  to  promote  peace  and  prosperity  in  the

region.  It  is hoped that ASEAN will continue  to

receive goodwill from the great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



powers. And I believe that a stable and prosperous

ASEAN  is  in the ultimate interests of the  great

powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that ASEAN has come to stay.

But for ASEAN to remain viable there is a need  to

adjust  to the rapid geopolitical changes  in  the

region.  It appears to me therefore that the  more

immediate  and  major  task  for  ASEAN  is   tile

undertaking of an overall review and evaluation of

all  the projects which have been proposed to date

in  order  that these can be implemented according

to their priorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present international economic situation

where   the   threat  of  a  worldwide   recession

accompanied by seemingly uncontrollable  inflation

may undermine the stability of ASEAN societies, it

is  necessary that governments of the region  make

greater   efforts  to  strengthen  their  national

economies. There can be no sound regional  economy

if  its  component  elements  are  weak.  Regional

cooperation   can,   if  wisely   and   rationally

approached,  accelerate  and  ease  the  task   of

national economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way would be the encouragement of mutual

investments  among ASEAN countries.  Mutual  ASEAN

investments  will definitely serve  to  complement

those  of the major powers. ASEAN should also  aim

for  self-reliance  as  a  regional  unit.  It  is

therefore  fitting  to  mention  here   that   the

decision of ASEAN Foreign Ministers to establish a

permanent   Secretariat  for  ASEAN   is   another

indicator  of  the  viability  and  permanency  of

ASEAN.  The  ASEAN Secretariat will be  a  compact

structure  designed  to streamline  and  plan  the

growing   activities   of   ASEAN   with   greater

efficiency. The ASEAN Secretariat will not only be

a  concrete evidence of ASEAN solidarity but  will

also,  in  deeds and actions, hasten the  pace  of

economic development in the region.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, to begin with, I would

like to thank my colleagues



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



for  their warm support of my Motion of thanks  to

the  President for his speech. They have expressed

their  views not only on the achievements  of  the

various Ministries as revealed in the Addendum  to

the   Presidential  Address  but   also   on   the

shortcomings.  They  have also  made  constructive

criticisms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my colleagues have criticised that there

have  been  far too many frequent changes  in  our

Education system and they expressed the hope  that

in    the   process   of   further   changes   and

restructuring of our Education system,  the  views

of those concerned with education should be sought

to  ensure that the new Education Act will be able

to  meet  the present requirements of our country.

They  have also emphasised the importance  of  the

contents of education in order to more effectively

inculcate  the correct social values and  concepts

amongst our children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my colleagues have also spoken on the tax-free incentives for pioneer industries. They

support  these  incentives  and  they  have   also

expressed   the   hope  that  for   the   existing

industries with high potential, whether  they  are

medium-sized or small-sized industries, assistance

should be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues have also shown their concern over

the increasing crime rate in Singapore over recent

years.  The general consensus of opinion among  my

colleagues  is that our Police Force  has  serious

shortcomings both quantitatively and qualitatively

which  have caused some aberration and defects  in

our  security field. They have expressed the  hope

that the Ministry concerned will soon improve  the

situation  of  the  Force and educate  the  police

personnel  particularly to improve their  attitude

in dealing with the public and in respect of their

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my colleagues have also shown particular

concern  for  the difficulties of the people  over

the  services provided by the Ministry of  Health.

They   have   appealed  that  hospital  outpatient

charges  and charges for third class wards  should

not  be  increased, and at the same time expressed

the hope that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



efforts would be made by the Government to attract

and retain experienced specialists and doctors  in

our medical services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my colleagues have expressed the

view  that  in our long-term interest there  is  a

need   for   some  kind  of  cultural  and   basic

philosophical reform among our people coupled with

proper  financial measures in order to change  the

traditional attitude of male chauvinism respecting

the  male  and despising the female,  amongst  our

people   and  to  implement  and  achieve   family

planning objectives so as to raise the quality  of

our  people with each generation better  off  than

the previous one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these criticisms and views are valuable

and  constructive. Unfortunately, I am  not  in  a

position  to speak on behalf of various Government

Ministries   to   answer   such   criticisms   and

suggestions.  But I am sure that these  views  and

suggestions will be noted and considered  or  even

accepted  by  the  Ministries  concerned  so  that

Singapore may soon become a more progressive, more

prosperous and a more stable country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of my colleagues have felt that

there   is   a  need  to  review  critically   the

administrative   organisations  of   the   various

Government  Ministries. They have  also  expressed

dissatisfaction  with  the  present   relationship

between the Government servants and members of the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has pointed out several

shortcomings   in   some  of  our   administrative

organisations. These are evident shortcomings  and

what   he   has  said  is  very  timely   and   is

representative  of what is in  the  minds  of  our

people.  The various shortcomings that he  pointed

out include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) each Ministry acting on its own;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) wastage of manpower and resources;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) over-commercialisation; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) growth of bureaucratism.



<br><br>He has got a lot of facts to bear himself out when

he made these criticisms,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



and  nobody  can deny that. The administration  in

our  Government  and statutory  boards,  generally

speaking,  is  efficient, clean  and  honest.  But

there  are  of  course shortcomings which  may  be

unavoidable  and which are capable of improvement.

Without   early   rectification,   the   political

confidence  that  the people have  in  the  ruling

party  over the past 10 years, as pointed  out  by

the  Member  for  Jalan Kayu,  will  be  seriously

damaged and undermined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the issue of land use, for

example,  apart  from  the  Land  Office  or   the

Commissioner  of Lands, as he pointed  out,  there

are other Ministries or quasi-Government statutory

bodies  which  have the powers  to  acquire  land.

Among  them  there  are signs of  competition  and

rivalry  in  dealing with policies  on  land  use,

resulting  in  unnecessary friction  and  conflict

internally. I feel that there is a need to set  up

a  high  level  committee,  similar  to  the  Road

Transport  Action Committee, to ensure that  there

is  comprehensive  and  coordinated  planning  and

formulation  of  land use policies,  so  that  our

limited  land  resources may  be  distributed  and

utilized appropriately and efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our pragmatic leadership is not

afraid  of  deviating  from  the  traditional  and

conservative   political   practice.   They    are

pragmatic  and down-to-earth and it  is  for  this

reason that our leaders have encouraged the  Back-benchers  to comment and criticise boldly  on  any

shortcomings  or  faults  in  all  the  Government

policies  and  measures. It is therefore  my  hope

that   our   public  servants  will  emulate   our

political  leaders  and  adopt  the  principle  of

"winning the minds and hearts of the people  in  a

princely  way, instead of driving them away  in  a

despotic manner". It is only in this way that they

are able to establish an efficient service and the

right  attitude  in serving the  interest  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to thank my colleagues

once  again for supporting my Motion thanking  the

President for his speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the

Speech of the President be agreed to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore,

express our thanks to the President for the

Speech which he delivered on behalf of the

Government at the opening of the Second Session

of this Parliament."
