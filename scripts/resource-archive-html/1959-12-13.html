<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I do not think we should  carry  on

with  the debate today without mentioning the  fact

that  we are sitting on a Sunday - a day of rest  for

the  Christians. And that is, in passing, a  useful

reminder  to  us  that  in a  multi-racial,  multi-cultural  and  multi-religious  society,  different

cultural,  linguistic  and  religious  groups  have

their  different days of rest. It is a  tribute  to

the  tolerance, liberal approach, and understanding

of  one  another's  peculiar  likes  and  dislikes,

standards  and  patterns of conduct that  you,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, a Christian, have raised no objection

to  working  on Sunday, that our Muslim friends  in

this  House have willingly come to join us in  this

debate,  and our Hindu friends have not raised  any

protest. I think it augurs well for the work of  my

colleague,  the Minister for Culture,  that  he,  a

member  of  a minority group in Malaya - not  even  a

real  Singhalese  but  a  Tamil,  an  immigrant  of

Ceylon,  who  became an immigrant of  Malaya - should

have been entrusted with the nurturing of a Malayan

consciousness and a Malayan culture. Just  in  case

we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



talking of different things in different languages,

I  looked  up the dictionary which you have  kindly

placed at our disposal, but which is now under lock

and  key in the Library, because a few copies  have

been  somewhat too ardently sought after and  never

re-discovered.  I  found  that  the  English   word

"culture"   as   defined  in  the  Shorter   Oxford

Dictionary means:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Improvement or refinement by education and

training. Otherwise the training and refinement  of

the mind, taste and manners. The condition of being

thus trained and refined, the intellectual side  of

civilisation."



<br><br>I  then  looked up the Chinese dictionary that  you

have provided us with and it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wen hwa-ching shen san te wen ming-"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Chairman</b>:  Order. Actually,  of  course,  the

Prime  Minister  must continue in  English.  But  I

permit him to read the extract from the dictionary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not

trying to befog you. All I was trying to do was  to

make sure that the things that our translators  are

talking about are the same, and it is translated in

Chinese,  as  I  was  saying, in exactly  identical

terms in content. Culture-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman</b>: Let us have the Mandarin version.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It says: "Wen" means

literature; "hwa" means transformation; and it then

goes  on  to  elaborate, "ching  shen  san  te" - the

spiritual: "wen-ming", i.e. the spiritual  side  of

civilisation.   So  I  think,   in   English,   the

definition of the intellectual side of civilisation

is  fairly akin to the Chinese definition. I looked

up  Winstedt's English! Malay dictionary and I  was

greatly   disappointed  to  see  that   the   great

authority was wrong. He has got culture as  meaning

"Bahasa".  A primary schoolboy learning Malay  with

our new language training facilities in the schools

will  know that "bahasa" does not mean culture.  It

means  language. But obviously dear Sir Richard  in

the old days believed that culture is equivalent to

language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am happy that I can use this lever to point

out that culture, although akin to language, is not

the same with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



language.  My colleague, the Minister  for  Health,

has   brought  me  what  he  says  is  the  correct

definition of culture, again in Winstedt's, reading

"kebudayaan"  which  I  understand  is  the   usual

translation given by the Ministry of Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing sticks out, namely, it is something

which is not innate and inborn in a person. One  is

not  born with culture and one is not born  with  a

language. It is not part of the chromosomes and the

genes  that  are  transmitted.  That  is  race   as

distinct   from  what  is  learned.  The   inherent

characteristics - the colour of your hair, the colour

of  your skin, your nose, your eyes and your build;

the  fact  that  you  have  five  fingers  on  each

hand - are  things which are predetermined.  But  the

kind  of  person  you grow up to be,  the  kind  of

society  that  we  make of ourselves  collectively,

depend  basically upon learning - as  the  words  go:

"training   and   refining".  We  have   placed   a

tremendous  emphasis on education  because  outside

the home, outside the automatic learning that takes

place when any infant is being reared by the mother

and father, there is in the human civilisation, the

other   factor - the  systematic  training   of   our

children in schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be the first to admit - and I think we

should  all  bear this in mind - that, however  much

haste  we make, we will never be able to produce  a

Malayan culture in less than one generation. It  is

unlikely that we could make the Member for  Kampong

Kembangan  think and respond like  the  Member  for

Tanglin. They do not think and they do not  respond

in  the same way, because of past training and past

refinement. Whilst the Member for Tanglin was taken

up  with  Moral Rearmament - how one should emphasise

what  is right and what is wrong, and who is  right

and  who  is wrong - the Member for Kampong Kembangan

is nurtured in a different tradition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most graphic memories in my mind was a

little  court scene in which the witness, a  police

detective,   was   giving   evidence   through    a

translator, and he said,"...and the bus came to the

junction of Joo Chiat Road and Changi Road and they

shouted `Allah



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



Akbar' as they mounted the bus." So the Judge said,

"Oh,  what is that?". He said, "My Lord, that means

God  is  great!"  But he also said that  those  two

words did not mean just "God is great!" It is  also

the  Muslim battle cry. Just like the Japanese when

they  say  "Banzai!" and they come charging  across

the field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that is the problem with our society. Anyone

who  has  had  the  opportunity  of  watching  mass

activity  over the last five years cannot but  fail

to  note that the different cultural groups do  not

necessarily laugh at the same things. They  do  not

cry  over  the  same  things.  What  is  considered

extremely  witty  and funny in one  sector  may  be

considered a sacrilege in the other. We do not even

have  absolutely  the same standard  of  right  and

wrong  and of good and bad behaviour. All the  non-Muslims  and non-Hindus and a good number  of  non-Buddhists think that it is not correct for a man to

have  more than one wife. But there are others  who

think  that  it is perfectly legitimate and  proper

and  indeed highly desirable to have more than  one

spouse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this balancing of the sensitivity of the

various  cultural  groups  which  is  the  art   of

communal    harmony    through    compromise    and

understanding, which we will have to  put  up  with

until  such time as in the next generation, if  not

in  one  then  in two generations, we are  able  to

produce  a relatively homogeneous society. Now  the

Member  for  Farrer Park quoted me and said:  "Yes,

that  is  right. The English-educated were distinct

products." When the Member for Farrer Park  was  in

England  during the years before the war,  he  also

discovered  the same thing - that the Malayan  was  a

distinct  product - the English-educated - and  so  it

is.  But  he is not going to be the final  product.

Let  us face it. He was the product of a particular

era.  We  can  cite examples of it  throughout  the

whole of South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No colony of Britain in the Far East was more

anglicised  and  was more deemed to  be  stabilised

than  Ceylon.  There was the acme  of  the  British

theory  of gradualism - the gradual Ceylonisation  of

the Civil Service, and the gradual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



transfer  of  power. And no country  in  South-East

Asia  today  is more in the throes of cultural  and

linguistic conflicts and religious intolerance than

Ceylon. Something has gone wrong there because  the

veneer  was  thin.  It  was wiped  out,  and  stark

realities came up from beneath. Once you appeal  to

your  mass  base,  and your mass base  consists  of

Buddhists,  Christians and Hindus or Tamil-speaking

or  Singhalese-speaking  and  English-speaking,  or

Christians   and  non-Christians,  then   everybody

begins  to  adjust and make different  appeals  and

shout different slogans.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever we do, let us be thankful for small

mercies:  that we have got the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan  who  in one of the debates  referred  to

members  of  the non-Malay race as orang  asing - the

foreigner.  He  now admits that we  are  not  orang

asing.  That is fundamental. It is an admission  of

basic  premises.  For  it means acceptance - although

there  is  not much in a name - that the Member  for

Farrer Park is not orang using vis-a-vis the Member

for  Kampong Kembangan nor I am an orang  asing - for

otherwise there will be trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we start on a major premise, that we are

together going to build up something new, something

coherent, something which will be part of  everyone

of  us, but not necessarily all of everyone of  us,

then I say we shall begin the journey, however long

and  difficult, towards a more stable  and  a  more

closely-knit society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall probably have more of this when we come

to debate the next Head namely, that of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are trying to do is not to produce in five

years, as the Member for Farrer Park suggests,  one

culture,  because it is not possible. But  in  five

years,  we  can bring home the lesson that  if  you

shout  old  slogans,  make appeals  to  instinctive

emotional  responses of each particular  sector  of

your society, each one shouting a different slogan,

pumping  in  different  political  and  ideological

beliefs,  then  the  net result  must  be  absolute

chaos.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Malaya - I prefer to talk of Malaya and not of

Singapore because in the long run our destinies are

settled by what happens in Malaya as a whole - Malaya

is  unique because of the almost perfect balance of

numerical  strength between the indigenous  people,

who  have been here a few hundred years longer than

anybody else, and the Chinese, with the Indians  as

a  balancing  force - 40 odd per cent on  each  side,

balancing with 10 per cent in the middle,  and  the

Ceylonese  and the Eurasians and others thrown  in.

Once the wraps come off, then I say hell would have

broken loose. It is our business, as leaders, never

to let the wraps come off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members on the Opposition side, from U.M.N.O.,

I  am  glad to say, have taken a sensible  approach

since  the  very early days immediately  after  the

elections.  This is fundamental and basic.  If  you

have  urgent and acute problems pertaining to  your

community,  you  settle on  the  basis  of  Malayan

unity.  You  do not start shouting slogans  in  the

newspapers  because, if the Government retreats  in

the  face of slogan-shouting, that Government  must

abdicate and give way to anarchy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bertha Hertogh prisoners were sentenced

to  death, it was an emotional issue - and let us not

kid  ourselves. But if it turned into  a  political

issue, we must fight and stand firm, not on account

of  the  merits, but because no Government,  if  it

intends  to govern in a dispassionate and  unbiased

manner  between races, cultural groups and  creeds,

can  retreat  in  the  face of  slogan-shouting  by

communalists. So in our own good time  and  at  the

right  juncture, we made the right  move.  That  is

important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, with regard to our State flag, State

anthem,  crest and so on. There are certain  things

over which it would be unwise to beat drums in  the

open.  I  ask Members of the Opposition to remember

always   that   they,  particularly  the   U.M.N.O.

Members,  share  as great a responsibility  as  the

Government in seeing that the wraps never come off,

and  that arguments and differences of opinions are

kept within bounds. Once



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



appeals   are   made  to  the  animal   instinctive

responses  of an individual, once battle cries  and

not  arguments are used, then the answer is the gun

and no other. That is the case with any Government,

but certainly intensely so with this Government. So

I  hope  the  Member for Farrer Park,  despite  his

training and refinement of mind to a certain extent

on  the Western pattern, will not forget that, when

we talk of culture here, we talk of the Ministry of

Culture with a capital "C", but when we are talking

of ourselves, the people, we are talking of culture

with a small "c". And it does not help to poke  fun

at  these things and talk of culture with a capital

"K",  because that leads once more to battle cries,

and slogans and not arguments and sanity.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would first like to  take  up  the

complaints  by  the  Member for  Kampong  Kembangan

about  the reporting of Assembly debates over Radio

Singapore's  Malay  network. He was  not  satisfied

with it, but unfortunately, he was not precise.  He

did not give specific instances of where he thought

Radio Singapore had fallen down on its job. Does he

mean that there had been misreporting of what he or

his  colleagues had said? If that  was  so,  if  he

could  specify  instances, I shall  certainly  look

into the matter. But if the charge is that speeches

of  certain Members have not been as fully reported

as  they would have liked, then that is a different

matter.  In  fact, I would ask him to consider  the

problem  of having to compress within the space  of

ten minutes what was said during the course of five

and  a  half hours. Obviously there must be drastic

selection, and much of the torrent of oratory  must

forever be lost to posterity and only a few tinfuls

of  what  was  said here could be  reproduced  over

Radio  Singapore after the 9.30 p.m. news  for  the

edification of voters in the various constituencies

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman</b>: But the Minister was mentioning

something about posterity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Thank you very much, Sir, for your

correction,  and  I  shall certainly  convey  those

sentiments to the Member for Kampong Kembangan just

in  case.  In fact, I would like to point out  that

the  problem  of trying to compress  all  these  no

doubt   exhaustive  protestations  made   in   this

Assembly  into a ten-minute commentary  is  a  very

difficult  task. Not only that, but the report  has

got to be ready within the course of about an hour.

The  debate finishes at 8.00 p.m. The reporter  has

to  go  to  Radio Singapore, and after writing  the

report  he has to put it over the air by 9.30  p.m.

So  if  there  has to be selection,  obviously  the

reporter has to leave out certain things which  are

said  here.  But if there is misreporting,  then  I

shall certainly be glad to look into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to make a few observations on

the subject of Malayan culture, about which a great

deal  was  said yesterday and today. One Member  of

the  Opposition asked the Minister for  Culture  to

define  the  nature and character  of  the  Malayan

culture we are proposing to create. I could give  a

few  personal opinions on the subject. No  one  has

the  intelligence, the imagination and the  breadth

of  knowledge to indicate precisely what the nature

of  Malayan  culture should be, and  what  in  fact

Malayan  culture would be like. It is not a  matter

for  any one person to determine, because that will

be  decided  by the people who create the  culture - the  artists,  the dramatists and the  painters - and

nobody   can   lay   down   the   law   either   by

administrative actions or by speeches. Therefore, I

do not propose here to express my personal views on

the   matter,  since  I  have  already  done   this

elsewhere.  If the Member for Kampong Kembangan  is

interested I can send him a few copies of my  talk.

But  I can tell him the way in which the Government

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



trying to stimulate the growth of a Malayan culture

and provide its emotional and cultural base what is

called a Malayan consciousness. I can only tell him

of  some of the ways in which we have attempted  to

do  this during the last six months. I believe that

the  first  step towards the creation of a  Malayan

consciousness  which is necessary  to  establish  a

Malayan  culture is to create what I would call  an

awareness of and respect for the cultures of  other

communities.  That  is what we mean  when  we  talk

about  breaking down cultural barriers. Without  an

awareness of and respect for the cultures of  other

peoples,  there cannot be even the beginning  of  a

Malayan  consciousness. I shall only name two  ways

in  which  we  are  trying to do this.  One  is  by

breaking down the cultural walls that exist or have

existed in Radio Singapore. The Radio is a powerful

mass  media for influencing people's attitudes  and

opinions.  Hitherto  we  have  had  four   language

sections operating more or less as isolated  units.

The Chinese section of the Radio catered purely for

Chinese  tastes, the Malay section for the  Malays,

and  so on. The result was to make the Chinese more

Chinese;  to encourage them to believe  that  Radio

Singapore  was  embodied  wholly  in  the   Chinese

section of Radio Singapore.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as they are concerned, the other programmes

do  not exist. It is the same with the Indians, the

Malays and the English-speaking. What we have  done

during  the  last  six months was  to  change  this

attitude;  to  get  people to  realise  that  Radio

Singapore  cannot  be  defined  in  terms  of   the

particular section of Radio Singapore to which they

listen.  So  today what is happening  is  that  the

things  that are said to interest only the English-speaking, which are considered interesting only  to

the  English-speaking  find their  way  into  other

programmes.  Malay  music, talks  about  the  Malay

language and culture, are channelled into the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



English,  Indian  and Chinese programmes.  We  hear

Chinese music in English programmes. In other words

for  the  first time, radio listeners  have  become

aware  of  this-that the Chinese programme  is  not

completely  Chinese  nor  is  the  Malay  programme

completely  Malay,  and that the cultural  barriers

are  no  longer as precise and as definite as  they

used  to  be once upon a time. So very often  today

when  a listener tunes on to the Chinese programme,

he is not quite sure whether he is listening to the

Chinese programme or the English programme  or  the

Malay  programme  or Indian programme,  because  he

might  tune to the Chinese programme and listen  to

Malay music or Western music. This is what we  mean

when  we  say we are creating an awareness  of  and

respect  for other cultures. An interesting  thing,

Sir,  is  that  this mixing of programmes  has  not

brought  forth any indignant protests, primarily  I

think  because  we  have succeeded  in  creating  a

psychological  climate favourably disposed  towards

the  sharing  of  the cultural  heritage  of  other

communities.  It  is no longer  an  affront  to  an

English-speaking  listener to be  exposed  to  what

used to be called "native" music. Today, he accepts

it.  So by gradually exposing one community to  the

music,  talks and discussions of other communities,

we  first make them aware of the existence of other

cultures and then, by prolonged exposure, they will

probably  begin  to appreciate that other  cultural

communities have a great deal to contribute. In the

past,  there  was  contempt  on  the  part  of  one

cultural  group towards other cultural groups.  The

English-educated always thought that the Chinese or

the  Malay-educated were ignorant and that they had

nothing  to  contribute or anything interesting  to

say.  It was the same with the Chinese and Indians.

Today  we  have  talks  put  over  on  the  Chinese

programmes  being translated and put  over  in  the

English or Malay programmes, so that for the  first

time,  the  English-speaking  listener  says,  "Oh,

there   are  Chinese  intellectuals  who  can   say

interesting things." So thus we create awareness of

and respect for other people's culture.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, the open-air concerts are

organised  attempts to do more  or  less  the  same

thing - to bring before very large mass audiences the

cultural achievements of other communities. I would

like,  in  this connection, Sir, to pay tribute  to

the   various   cultural   bodies   who   have   so

enthusiastically  and generously responded  to  our

call  to  come forward and help us in this positive

and    practical   step   to   create   a   Malayan

consciousness. Today, all we have to do, Sir, is to

say  we  are going to put on an Aneka Ragam Ra'ayat

somewhere  in  the City or in the rural  area,  and

immediately  hundreds of artistes come forward  and

say,  "We will put up items," normally, for a  very

nominal fee. In the past these cultural bodies felt

they  had  no status and no recognition; they  were

not  wanted.  But  today they feel  that  they  are

wanted  and called upon to participate in  a  very

great   task   and  therefore  they  come   forward

generously - sometimes  for nothing  - to  perform  at

these  concerts.  That is why we are  able  to  put

these  concerts on regularly and, as I said earlier

on,  on a large scale, simply because there are now

people who are ready to respond to our call.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another way in which we are trying to create

a Malayan consciousness is by creating a feeling of

identification  with  Singapore  and  its   people.

First,  awareness  of the other people's  cultures,

and  now  identification  with  Singapore  and  its

people. We must, I believe, create in our people an

awareness  that they belong to Singapore  and  that

Singapore  belongs to them. National  Loyalty  Week

which has just finished was a massive experiment in

this direction. The new State flag, the new anthem,

the  appointment of a Malayan-born Negara were  all

attempts  to create symbols which would  facilitate

this   identification.  However,   the   sense   of

identification cannot and should not remain  purely

at  the level of symbols. It must be created  in  a

more  positive  manner  by getting  people  of  all

classes, creeds and races to co-operate in order to

realise the fundamental principle on which the  new

State of Singapore is founded. National Loyalty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



Week,  as I said, Sir, was a massive experiment  in

co-operation  and  self-reliance. That  experiment,

Sir,  has  been  a  great success.  People  of  all

classes,  races  and  creeds  co-operated  to  make

Loyalty  Week  a week to remember. We decided  that

much  of the work of organising Loyalty Week should

not fall on the Government. In fact, the Government

should, as far as possible, stay in the background.

So  much of the work of organising National Loyalty

Week  was delegated to the people themselves. As  a

result, we were able to make National Loyalty  Week

celebrations practically island-wide and sustained.

Civil   servants,  trade  unionists,   members   of

political parties, employers, newspapers,  cultural

organisations,    school    children,    University

students,  the police, volunteer organisations  and

many  others too numerous to mention were all given

specific  functions and were all asked  to  go  and

organise  functions  themselves.  We  involved  all

sections  of  the people by inviting them  to  make

their   contributions  to  National  Loyalty  Week.

Again, Sir, I would like, with your permission,  to

convey  the Assembly's gratitude and thanks to  all

these  people for having at so short notice  helped

to  organise successfully so massive an  operation.

This  co-operation of so diverse groups  would  not

have   been  possible  but  for  one  psychological

fact - the  sense  of identification.  Somehow  these

groups    forgot    that   they   held    different

opinions - political, cultural, racial and religious.

They had some other link to hold them together, and

that  link  was that they suddenly felt  that  they

were  all  part of Singapore - as I said, they  felt

they  belonged to Singapore and Singapore  belonged

to  them.  That  created what we call  a  sense  of

identification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these, I admit, Sir, are only the beginnings

of  a  Malayan consciousness. We have still a  long

way to go before a Malayan consciousness can become

second  nature - an  instinctive  feeling  among  our

people.  But  we believe that we should  reach  our

goal  of  a  Malayan consciousness  as  quickly  as

possible.  We shall do this by calculated,  if  you

like,  conscious,  acts which will  stimulate  this

Malayan consciousness,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



make  it  develop  faster. Therefore,  we  are  not

concerned  with the sceptics outside this  Assembly

who leer at our efforts, who say that we are trying

to  create a hot-house Malayan culture, that we are

forcing the pace. We are not concerned at all  with

the  leers and jeers of the people who say that  we

are being very foolish in trying to force the pace.

We  believe,  Sir, that the creation of  a  Malayan

consciousness cannot be left to the ordinary course

of  events, to nature, or to history - to allow it to

develop gradually of its own accord - because this is

too important and vital a problem to be left to the

hit-and-miss methods of history, or nature, or what

you will. We know what happened in Ceylon and India

and other countries where the integration of people

of  various  cultures was left to the  hit-and-miss

methods of history. Certainly we do not wish to see

such  tragedies envelope this island. Therefore  we

say  quite  openly  that we shall  persist  in  our

efforts  to  create  a  Malayan  consciousness   by

deliberate and conscious acts which we think  would

facilitate  or quicken the emergence of  a  Malayan

consciousness - call  it  national  consciousness  by

planning  if  you like. We have to do it  this  way

because there is no alternative. Leaving it to  the

natural  course  of events means eventually  racial

conflict  and  cultural conflict; and  carnage  and

chaos might eventually result from it. May I,  Sir,

in  this  connection say that  the  creation  of  a

Malayan consciousness is not a job for this or that

political  party,  and  we have  tried  as  far  as

possible,  during National Loyalty Week, to  convey

the  message  that  it is not a  job  for  any  one

political  party? It is a job for everybody,  every

group,  every political party and every social  and

cultural  group  in  this country.  We  must  first

accept the premise that it is an act of faith; that

a  Malayan consciousness is desirable, possible and

inevitable. We must accept that premise because, if

we  do  not,  then  the job of creating  a  Malayan

culture  becomes difficult and perhaps  might  even

end not in a Malayan culture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



or  Malayan consciousness, but in communal anarchy.

Therefore,  Sir,  on this basic need  to  create  a

Malayan  culture and in the belief that  a  Malayan

culture is possible, I think we should not have any

doubt  or  any qualms. We should not sit  back  and

say,   "Well,  this  is  a  job  which  we   cannot

accomplish   in  this  generation   or   the   next

generation." We must believe we can do it soon  and

that we can do it by a deliberate act of will.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong. Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I rise not in reply, but to

give  my  views concerning the speech made  by  the

Hon. the  Prime Minister and also by the  Minister

for  Culture. Frankly what I said yesterday  merely

concerned one or two things. But the Prime Minister

had  taken the trouble to go further on the subject

of `culture'. I am thankful that the Prime Minister

has given a true and clear explanation of `culture'

and  only  time is needed, between this  generation

and  the next, when it will be accomplished to suit

our needs. But today, Mr Speaker, I feel fortunate

that from the Opposition side here, I can speak  my

mind  freely  and  that you, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  as

Chairman, have been able to conduct this meeting so

capably.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also can be considered as one aspect of

'culture'  or a chapter of our `culture'  which  we

can  put  to  use  to look after matters  affecting

culture.  I am fortunate, Mr Speaker, particularly

for  being  able to express my views. It  is  hoped

that  we  will  be able to accomplish the  `Malayan

culture' which we are striving to accomplish.  Like

the Prime Minister, I am also against anything that

makes  undue appeal to emotion. Therefore,  on  the

question  of `culture' the views of the  Government

are  laudable, but because the Prime  Minister  has

stated  his  views, I would not say that  they  are

correct  or  incorrect. I wish to  assert  that  my

ideology  is  not communalism, nor do I  adopt  the

attitude  of being `anti' other communities.  I  do

not discriminate between Chinese and the Malays. In

Singapore we have many organisations. For instance,

the  Chinese  who  are  in  the  P.A.P. - we  do  not

consider them as our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



enemies.  Nor  do we consider as our  friends  only

those  who  are  from  the S.P.A.  It  is  not  our

intention  to appeal to communal passions.  On  the

question  of  ideology we fear that  there  may  be

ideologies which are diametrically opposed to  that

of  ours and which some may wish to make the  basis

of  `culture' which we are going to create. What we

are  against  is  the Communist ideology.  We  fear

undesirable  ideologies being introduced  into  the

creation  of  a  Malayan culture.  I  welcome  the

programmes  put up by the Ministry of Culture,  but

what  I  am  not satisfied with, is  not  with  the

entire  work of Radio Singapore but only  with  one

branch of the Ministry of Culture which deals  with

giving  reports  of the sittings of  this  Assembly

over  the  radio. Normally this is heard  at  10.45

p.m.  I  am  not  after personal aggrandisement  or

looking for publicity. The object of my comment  is

to ensure that as far as possible a true summary of

the proceedings in this Assembly is conveyed to the

public. I am also a tax-payer. I own a radio and  I

pay  tax for that. If I pay $12 but I do not get  a

proper  account of the Assembly proceedings in  the

news  summary, I will not be satisfied. It  is  not

because  my  name  is  not mentioned  in  the  news

summary  over Radio Singapore that I am  commenting

on  this matter. My attitude on this matter is  the

same as that of the other tax-payers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, Mr Speaker, I was also referred

to  by the Prime Minister in another respect. I  do

not  deny  that there is a difference  between  the

Member  for Farrer Park and the Member for  Kampong

Kembangan,  that is, myself. But I  would  like  to

stress here that I have mixed with people of  other

races  and other classes. For instance, I know  how

to  use chopsticks. I learnt the art for 3½ years

during  the  Japanese  occupation  when  I  was  an

employee  at the Japanese Naval Air Force,  and  my

head  had  to  be shaven bald. But this  was  false

culture  and we could not accept this. I  hope  the

Government  will  be  cautious  in  the  matter  of

exercising   their  authority   with   respect   to

'culture'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point on which I wish to

criticise the Government. I am not complaining  but

sometimes  I feel offended because I do  not  quite

understand the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



Mandarin  language. When the expenses for  language

training facilities for Assemblymen was approved, I

could  not get a teacher who was prepared to accept

the pay at the approved Government rate. I hope the

Government will make available to U.M.N.O. members

facilities  for  them to learn Mandarin.  I  learnt

Katakana, Hiragana and Kanji or `Nippon-Go'  during

the   Japanese  occupation  for  3½ years.  That

question does not arise now. We would now  like  to

compete  with the Government members. If  they  can

speak  Malay,  we  want to be fluent  in  Mandarin.

Sometimes  I feel envious when they speak  Mandarin

amongst  themselves. One day when  we  have  learnt

Mandarin, we will catch up with them. This, indeed,

is  a  matter of culture, and I would  like  to  be

frank  and  straightforward. We  have  no  communal

hatred as I said earlier on. But where we differ is

on  the question of `ideology'. I want to be  frank

with  the  Prime Minister. Sometimes  outside  this

House  when the Prime Minister speaks he  seems  to

belittle us and make fun of us. We do not subscribe

to the view that because you speak Malay you should

be   converted  into  the  Muslim  faith   and   be

circumcised! So I hope that the Government  Members

will  not  consider  that our thinking  is  narrow-minded.  We  are  guided  by  our  party  political

principles.  We  know  that  we  must  protect  the

interests of our race. I must admit that we want  a

merger with the Federation of Malaya. We know  that

in  the  Federation of Malaya there are many people

who  are experts in various fields and the combined

population total more than 8 million. But before we

can  create a common aim, I am afraid we shall have

to  resolve  all major matters that  are  at  issue

between  us, so that both sides will be  satisfied,

particularly the Federation of Malaya. Our approach

to   such  matters  should  be  acceptable  to  the

Federation.   The   Government   is   skilful    at

criticising and attacking us; that does not matter.

We  do  not  depend on criticisms  from  Government

Members,  for  we  get them in  good  measure  from

outside  this  House too. That is inherent  in  our

struggle. It may be that at the next election,  the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan will not be  here  to

speak, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



that  is  unimportant. What I have said comes  from

the bottom of my heart. What I have explained is my

view  and conviction. It is not communal.  What  we

positively  do not wish to see is an `ism'  adopted

which  will  be  to  the detriment  of  our  State.

Although Singapore is small we cannot afford to  be

separate,  either  now or in the future,  from  the

Federation  of Malaya but rather we must  agree  on

the subject of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, another aspect on culture. I wonder, Mr

Speaker, is this a normal thing in culture or  not?

Today, there are limitations and restrictions - I  do

not  know  whether this concerns  culture  or  not,

whether   the  Government  proposes  to   introduce

legislation about it - but normally, business circles

restrict  other  communities  from  joining   their

business  ring.  No opportunity is being  given  to

others.  There  should be a spirit  of  compromise.

Ideally, there should be situations where Inche Ali

is  invited  to  come along and Mr Ah  Chong  also

invites  Mr Sammy and so on. In this way, we  will

not  only  protect our interests but also foster  a

common  culture which we can put into  practice  as

from  today. That is all, Mr Speaker, that I  wish

to  bring home to Members of the Government in this

Assembly. Although I feel a little ashamed when the

Prime  Minister made comparisons and  said  that  I

only  have  a  Malay education and the  Member  for

Farrer  Park  is English-educated, I would  however

like  to emphasise that as a Malay I know not  only

the  Malay  language, but also a little of  foreign

languages. I went to a Malay school for four  years

and  then I went to an English school until the war

came. If it had not been for the war, I would  have

become  a  lawyer - for that was  my  ambition - and  I

would compete with the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I have been a Member of

this  House  for  4½ years. Similarly  our  Prime

Minister, too, has been in this House for a similar

period.  But it is only today that I have  heard  a

responsible  speech  from a Member  of  this  House

which,  if it can be said that we are truly sincere

in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



objective  of  achieving communal harmony,  is  the

right thing to do. Originally I had no intention to

speak,  but when the Prime Minister spoke at length

and   mentioned  my  organisation,  that   is   the

U.M.N.O.,  I decided that as Chairman of  Singapore

U.M.N.O., I must say a few words and give my  views

on  the  matter  which  has been  debated  in  this

Assembly. We from U.M.N.O., Mr Speaker,  know  our

responsibilities.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Malays in Singapore come from a

minority   group -   about   13.7   per   cent   are

Malays - compared to other communities in this State.

Therefore,  we are aware of our responsibility  and

because  we  know it, we are anxious to  co-operate

with any Party - whether it is the Government or the

S.P.A. - in  order to protect the people of Singapore

and in the interest of peace and prosperity for all

the  people of Singapore. But - and here I  hope  the

Government  Ministers on the other  side  will  pay

attention  to  this - when we from  U.M.N.O. propose

something  which affects the Malays,  I  hope  they

will  not accuse us of being communalists. That  is

wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to explain further with regard to the position of the Malays. Our number is

small, and in many spheres, we are backward. If  we

look  from the economic point of view or if we look

at their social status as compared with that of the

other communities, I can say in all frankness  that

our  position  is  very  weak.  For  instance,  Mr

Speaker, the Chinese and Indians and the Eurasians;

in  their  communities, there are  capitalists  and

professional people like lawyers, doctors,  and  so

on; then there are the middle class groups and then

the  lower  middle class, and, fifthly, the  labour

class.  It can be said that in the society  of  our

brothers  from  the  Chinese,  Indian  or  Eurasian

communities, the division into the five  strata  is

complete. But when we take the Malays, it is really

a  sorry  state  of affairs. I am  quite  sure  the

Government  will  also be sympathetic  towards  the

position  of  the Malays, and I hope they  will  be

sincere in their efforts to raise the standard of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



living  of  the  Malays. There are  no  capitalists

amongst them, no professional people; as far  as  I

know,  among doctors and lawyers there is only  one

Malay  doctor and there are two Malay lawyers;  the

middle  class and the lower middle class are almost

non-existent.  The  fact is, 99  per  cent  of  the

Malays in Singapore come from the lower strata. So,

Mr  Speaker,  I  request that the Government  give

special attention and, in this respect, not  accuse

us  U.M.N.O. members - as often happens - whenever we

put  up proposals concerning the livehood of  Malay

members of our society of being communalists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

feel that at this juncture I should say a few words

and  express agreement with the Government side  in

their  desire to build a new Malayan nation through

the  promotion  of a common culture  and  a  common

Malay  language.  We  realise that,  with  all  our

problems  and special difficulties, unless  we  can

unite  the various communities into one or  develop

one way of thinking and one way of feeling, then we

lay up trouble for our future children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe that we may miss the point.

While  dwelling  on just language and  culture,  we

forget  that  the  most important thing  which  can

build unity faster is the language of the heart. We

know  that when people fall in love, regardless  of

the difference in language and culture, they desire

to be together earlier. But the moment that love becomes  hatred, as sometimes happens, then  we  have

divorce proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference has been made, Sir, to the Member for

Kampong   Kembangan  and  myself  having  different

cultural  backgrounds. That is true. But,  Sir,  we

have found that when we develop a common basis  for

goodwill  with identity of aims, we can  co-operate

very  easily and we have no difficulty at all. Sir,

there is a language of the heart which I hope  will

develop in Singapore. For that reason, I believe it

is  important  that no matter how we  disagree,  we

must  show goodwill to one another because in  this

House,  if  Members  of  the Assembly  cannot  show

goodwill,  how  can  we  expect  the  citizens   of

Singapore to show



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



goodwill? The language of the heart, Sir,  I  hope,

will  underlie our deliberations and also help  the

promotion of a common culture and a common language

to build a united Malayan nation.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am just going to ask a question, if you will

permit me, of the Minister for Culture for the sake

of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am connected with several organisations whose

constitution  says "to help cultural  development".

We  have  had  controversial opinions on  "What  is

Malayan culture?" For instance, I will give a  very

extreme  example.  If an Indian  troupe  dances  an

Indian dance depicting a Chinese legend, which  has

taken  place in the Victoria Theatre, and if it  is

done   to   continental  music  played   by   Malay

instruments,   is  that  a  step  towards   Malayan

culture?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that is

a step towards madness!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman</b>: Mrs Seow? Would you like to pursue

such `madness' further?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> It is not that I wish to

pursue  it.  I  want  to inform  the  Minister  for

Culture   that  when  the  Minister  for   National

Development had the Victoria Theatre opened, we had

an  Indian  dance depicting a Chinese story.  There

was  controversial appreciation. Some thought  that

it  was  a  step  towards Malayan culture.  I  just

wanted to have an authoritative criticism from  the

Minister himself as to what he thought about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, I am afraid that to some people

Indian  music  sounds like continental  music,  and

Indian  culture is like Chinese culture,  and  vice

versa.  I  remember  last year  when  the  Victoria

Theatre  was  opened,  we  had  an  Indian  dancing

troupe,   the  best  of  its  kind  in   Singapore,

performing an Indian dance based on a Chinese theme

which  I  remember  was Sam Pek  Eng  Tai,  a  very

popular film screened in Singapore previously.  The

show,  I  can  remember, was  performed  by  Indian

dancers, and the theme was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



Chinese, that is all. All the rest was

Indian - Indian music, Indian musicians, etc. - except

that the dancers were dressed in Chinese costumes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I believe that that is a form of culture in which an attempt was made, even as early

as  last year, whereby a better understanding among

the  races  in  Singapore could  be  fostered.  Mr

Speaker, we have made a good start, where  for  the

first time the Indians present a Chinese theme, the

Chinese present an Indian theme, the Malays present

a  Chinese theme, and the Chinese present  a  Malay

theme. We congratulate our Minister for Culture  on

his   success,  particularly  during  the  National

Loyalty  Week,  where  a lot of  such  themes  were

presented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that in the field of culture we

should  try  to bring together the four streams  of

culture  in this country - the English-speaking,  the

Chinese-speaking, the Malay-speaking and the Tamil-speaking, so that we in Singapore will be  able  to

understand  that  the cultural differences  we  may

have,  are  not really differences. It  is  because

they  are  a part of our cultural heritage  of  the

past.  Therefore, the people in this  part  of  the

world  can  know that the real difference  existing

among us is a difference more fundamental than  the

so-called  cultural differences, and  for  that  we

must  congratulate  our Minister  for  Culture  for

having  promoted  to  a great extent,  particularly

during National Loyalty Week, this type of work.

Farrer  Park, these are meant for officers born  in

India,  Pakistan, domiciled in Malaya or otherwise.

They are also for rail passages for those recruited

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few days ago, the Hon. the Minister for

Education,  speaking  on  the  subject  of  Special

Language  Schools, assured the House  that  parents

who do not want their children to be transferred to

these  Special Language Schools would be given  the

freedom of choice and be allowed to ask that  their

children  remain  in their former schools.  Sir,  I

think that was a wise decision. The problem that  I

am  raising  under  this  item  involves  the  same

principle.  Hitherto,  graduate  teachers  who  are

undergoing the diploma course in Education  at  the

University, holding Government teaching  bursaries,

were given the freedom of choice to decide to serve

either  in Government schools or in aided  schools.

Most  of  them,  of  course, decided  to  join  the

Government   service   because   of   the   special

attractions  in  that  service.  They  would   have

pensions    and   free   medical   treatment    and

hospitalisation  at  very low rates.  But  some  of

these bursary holders decided to join aided schools

for,  sometimes, religious reasons, others  because

of  loyalty  to  their  old schools;  and  hitherto

Government policy has been to give them the freedom

of choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time last week, Sir, I was informed that one

teacher  who  had desired to join a  certain  aided

school  was  told that he could not do so,  because

all graduates graduating from the diploma course in

Education holding teaching bursaries would now have

to   join  Government  schools.  Already  there  is

inequality   in   the  competition,   because   the

Government  service could offer better attractions.

In  the case of my school, I have lost the top boy,

a  science  graduate, because he said that  in  the

long  run  it  was better to be in  the  Government

service  so that in case the members of his  family

fell   sick,  they  would  be  given  free  medical

treatment or subsidisation at special rates. If, at

this  particular juncture, when specialist teachers

are  difficult to find, this policy of  freedom  of

choice and equality of treatment were not observed,

I  am sure that is going against the policy already

laid down by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister  for Education himself in  regard  to

schools  in the State - that there should be equality

in  treatment  for  all schools,  whether  Chinese,

Malay,  English  or  Tamil, whether  Government  or

Government-aided. I believe that  this  matter  was

never  brought to his attention. It was done as  an

act  of  administration. But I feel, Sir,  that  if

this   is  not  reconsidered,  then  it  makes   it

difficult  for  aided  schools  to  give   adequate

competition  to Government schools. I believe  that

competition is most important in order to keep  the

different  sections, as it were, on their  toes.  I

hope, Sir, that the Minister will kindly look  into

this  matter so that bursary holders would be given

the  same freedom of choice and those - I think there

are  only  a few of them - who opt to serve in  aided

schools would also be given the chance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter under this heading concerns

their  allowances or their pay. Sir, I happened  to

be  involved in drawing up this pay scheme  before,

and  I  believe  the  Political  Secretary  in  the

Ministry  of  Education was also present  at  these

discussions. When these Honours graduates were made

to  start  in the Education Ministry on an  initial

$75  less  than  the initial in the  administrative

service,  it  was on the understanding  that  there

would be specialist allowances. So the moment these

graduate teachers became specialist teachers,  they

would  be given an allowance so that they would  be

if not equal to, at least not too far behind, their

counterparts in the other services. The same  thing

holds  for their maximum. The salary scale  of  the

specialist  graduates in the Ministry of  Education

ends  at $1,100, whereas their counterparts in  the

administrative  service end at $1,420.  I  believe,

Sir,  about a year ago, the Government decided that

there  must be a new scheme, and no further payment

was  made  as  regards  specialist  allowances   to

specialist teachers joining the service. They  have

been  waiting  all this time, and I would  like  to

know what the position is - whether a new scheme  is

coming  out  or whether the Ministry has  got  some

other   way  of  solving  this  problem  to  induce

graduates not to regard the teaching profession  as

a cinderella profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Tanglin, I only wonder

whether  this amendment is in order, asking  for  a

reduction,  in view of the fact that the  vote  for

item  (39) is less than last year's figure. I think

normally  Members of the Opposition would criticise

the  Ministry if the expenditure of the  Government

is increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman</b>: Order. I think I had better cure

notices   of  amendments  are  really  notices   of

conventional  amendments. They  are  amendments  to

related to the item.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for

clarifying the point before I begin to reply to the

Member for Tanglin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has raised the point that aided schools are

having  difficulty  competing  with  Government  in

recruiting  graduates for service. I  would  regard

that as a very good piece of news for me, because I

heard  from my officials that it is the  other  way

round  because the best boys are usually nabbed  by

aided schools instead. To counter that, I did  give

instructions that to obviate the delay in having to

process  all  appointees to the Government  service

through  the  usual channels of the Public  Service

Commission,  we do make temporary appointments  and

then   process   it  through  the  Public   Service

Commission. I do not think I am particularly  aware

of  the  case, mentioned by the Member for Tanglin,

but  I  would be pleased if he would be good enough

to   let  me  know,  and  I  will  look  into   the

circumstances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I must make this clear to the

hon.  Member  for  Tanglin  who  mentioned  in  the

proceedings yesterday about Government schools  and

aided schools receiving different treatment by  the

Education Ministry, that it will not be so  in  the

Ministry of Education of this Government. In  fact,

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister, when  he  opened  the

exhibition  for  National Loyalty  Week,  mentioned

that the Minister for Finance and the Minister  for

Education were like the old woman in the  shoe  who

had so many children that she did not know what  to

do.  I  would  have preferred that he  amended  the

saying  to  the  effect that,  "as  the  father  of

300,000  children in schools, he knows what  to  do

with them". So I will regard everyone in school, be

he  in Government or aided school, as deserving  of

the same treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then raised the question of specialist

allowances,   and   whether  it   is   Government's

intention  to  bring about a new scheme,  and  that

there were discussions in the past - and he mentioned

the  name of my Political Secretary as having taken

part in such discussions.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am not quite well up in history on that

point,  I  have a faint suspicion that my Political

Secretary was learning Malay in Changi Prison round

about  that  time. If I am wrong,  perhaps  he  was

participating  in  negotiations with  the  previous

Government  on this matter of specialist allowances

for  teachers. I wish to make it clear however that

this  Government has decided that there will be  no

additional  allowances  for  secondary  or   middle

school  teachers who are not already in receipt  of

such  allowances. The previous Government may  have

agreed  to  this,  just like the promise  of  a  $5

million  grant  to  the  Nanyang  University  which

failed  to  materialise. If the previous Government

was  sincere  in  implementing this  promise,  they

would  have found the money to meet it and included

provisions  in  the 1958 or 1959  Estimates,  which

they did not. If the former Chief Minister and  now

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman</b>: Order. These similes sometimes

puzzle  me.  I do not know whether the Minister  is

alleging  that the Member for Cairnhill issued  dud

cheques  metaphorically or  literally.  Perhaps  he

could explain before I rule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, it is

metaphorically speaking because, as you are  aware,

when   he  was  the  Chief  Minister  of  the  last

Government, mention was made of a $5 million  grant

which  received  his  support,  and  I  think   the

sponsors of Nanyang University are now begging  for

the $5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman</b>: Order. But I understood we are on

allowances  for  specialist  teachers  and  not  on

Nanyang University at the moment. We might come  to

that later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, I shall proceed.

It  can  be  argued that if some  teachers  are  in

receipt of such specialist allowances, then  others

should receive them too. However, two wrongs do not

make one right. It was wrong to pay these so-called

specialist  allowances to teachers. But  this  took

place  during the days of the Colonial  Government.

Anyway since January 1958, no new appointees in the

Education  service have been paid these  specialist

allowances,  and  those  now  in  receipt  of  such

allowances  are personal to them. However,  I  have

the agreement of the Minister for Finance, although

he  is not present in this House, to say that since

the Government is to encourage the study of science

in  schools,  which  will be in  keeping  with  our

policy  either  to industrialise or  perish,  those

teachers  who  hold science degrees  (Honours)  and

teaching  science  subjects  in  our  secondary  or

middle  schools  may apply for consideration  under

the  technical  or  professional  allowance  scheme

mentioned  earlier  by  the  Minister  for  Finance

during  this debate. I hope I have now answered  in

full the queries of the Member for Tanglin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to

thank  the Minister for Education for his assurance

that   henceforth  all  school  children  will   be

regarded  as members of one family, and, therefore,

there will not be any discrimination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of specialist allowances, he does

not  realise that they are not variable allowances.

They are regarded as basic and pensionable, and are

given  in  order  to  make up  for  the  difference

between  the specialists who go into the  education

service  and  those who go into the  administrative

service. Therefore, Sir, when the Government made a

ruling  that there should be no more allowances,  I

am  sure  they referred to variable allowances  and

not to basic allowances equivalent to salaries.  If

these allowances are not to be paid any more, or if

they are only to be paid to specialist teachers who

teach  science, there is a case for something else - may be a new scheme to be provided for the graduate

teachers   going   into  the   education   service.

Otherwise, Sir, this is what will happen. A teacher

joins  the  education service. He  joins  an  aided

school.   He   then  applies  to   the   Government

administrative   service.  He  is   appointed   and

immediately gives one month's notice to  the  aided

school  and goes into Government service, with  the

same  qualification; and right away he starts on  a

salary  of $75 more. So, unless there is some  kind

of stability in the education service, we shall all

the  time  have a fluid staff of graduate  teachers

looking   around  for  better  salaries  in   other

departments. As soon as they get something  better,

they drop out of the education service and go on to

the  administrative service, or Chemistry  service,

and  this makes it very difficult for our education

programme  to  be  carried out when  the  staff  is

fluid.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, I am fully aware

that  the specialist allowances that are being paid

are  pensionable. That is why they are  being  made

personal  to  those who are already in  receipt  of

them.  If they are not pensionable, I can  see  the

Minister  for Finance using his big knife  and  his

broad  axe on them too. I think it is time to  stop

quibbling and stabilising



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



our   salary  structure.  This  thing  can  go   on

perennially. That is why it has been necessary  for

me   today  to  make  the  statement,  that   these

specialist allowances will not be considered by the

Ministry of Education with effect from 1st January,

1960.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (48) of sub-head

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (48) says, "Underqualified Teachers of

Vernacular Languages; Chinese Teachers",  and  they

give  one scale for men and one for women. But  for

Malay  and  Tamil teachers there is only one  scale

provided for both men and women. As far as I  know,

there is no parity among men and women teachers  in

almost  all  categories  except  this  one  in  the

Education Department. I was surprised to find  that

there  is  parity  in  this  instance.  I  am   not

suggesting,  Sir,  that this women's  salary  scale

should  be  brought down. On the other hand,  I  am

suggesting  that parity be given to all  categories

of  teachers,  since it has been  fought  for  ever

since  1940  by the Singapore Teachers' Union.  The

women  have  had  great hopes that parity  will  be

given when they read in "The Tasks Ahead" (the Five-Year Plan of the P.A.P.) the following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the People's Action Party comes into power

immediate  steps will be taken to raise the  status

of the women to where It should be."



<br><br>This is on page 17, and it goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a full socialist society, for which the P.A.P.

will  work  for, all people will have equal  rights

and  opportunities, irrespective of  sex,  race  or

religion. There is no place in a socialist  society

for  exploitation of women. The P.A.P. believes  in

the principle of equal pay for equal work."



<br><br>It did, however, say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This may not be possible immediately. It must be

achieved  step  by  step  without  dislocating  our

economy."



<br><br>I  quite  understand that, Sir, but my argument  is

that steps could be taken to make the gap narrower.

In some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



countries the women have been promised that  within

ten   years   they  will  be  given   parity,   and

arrangements  are being made, by  a  slow  process,

that  after ten years they will get the  parity.  I

understand that with the present Budget deficit and

the  economy drive, Government will not be able  to

give  parity to women. But all I am asking  for  is

that  a  first gesture be shown - that the Government

is  in  sympathy with the women, and that within  a

number of years this parity will come to pass.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, it is sometimes

difficult  to  anticipate what the Members  of  the

Opposition  are going to ask. This is  certainly  a

point  which only a woman Member of the  Opposition

is able to pick out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the six months that the new Government has

been  in  office,  I  can  assure  the  Member  for

Mountbatten that we have not tried to monkey around

with  salary structures and that this is  something

which  is a carry-over from the previous estimates.

I understand the 1959 Estimates were the standstill

Estimates  of 1958. I am not in a position  to  say

whether  the women do get the same pay as  the  men

under  the  scheme of $220-325 for Malay and  Tamil

teachers. I wonder whether my friend, the  Minister

for  Finance, might be able to say more about  this

because establishment comes under his wing. Anyway,

we have not interfered with this salary scheme.

work  towards the position of parity in the  salary

of  women and men officers. There are two  ways  of

bringing  about parity. One is to raise the  salary

of women up to the men's. The other is to bring the

salary of the men down to that of the women.  I  am

not sure which method the Member for Mountbatten is

point  out  that  we  are  fortunate  in  that  the

Government  General Orders, I think, say  that  the

total emoluments of Government servants are not  to

be  reduced unless they have committed an  offence,

and  deserve to have their salary reduced. That  is

one  protection. The other point is  that  even  if

they  do not have this protection, since the P.A.P.

claims  to  be the government of the people,  I  am

sure  they  should try to be just. Since they  have

promised to uplift the women should not bring  down

the  salary of the and not bring down the men, they

men to the level of the salary of the women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (51) of sub-head

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (51) , Sir, is about watchmen. I am sure that

the   Minister  for  Education,  having  heard   my

argument about women, must be wondering what I have

to say about watchmen now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he does not already know, I may be able to

bring to his knowledge, from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



my own experience, some of the hardships of some of

the  school principals. There are some places where

two  schools are built on one piece of  ground  and

there  is  only one watchman. But the schools  have

not  yet built servants' quarters for four or  five

years.  I  do  not  know  whether  they  have   any

intention of building servants' quarters, because I

do  not  see  any  ground there  which  could  hold

servants'  quarters. Anyway, it  looks  as  if  the

schools   will  be  permanently  without  servants'

quarters and if you have one watchman looking after

two  schools without servants' quarters, and  since

he  has  to  go out for food sometime or other,  it

does not make any sense to have a school guarded at

certain  times of the day but at other  hours  left

unguarded  and open to robbery. I am just  bringing

this  fact to the Minister's attention so  that  in

his planning for watchmen, he could do something to

see  that some sort of scheme is worked out so that

the  schools are guarded all the time in  spite  of

the fact that they have no servants' quarters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, I am grateful to

the  Member for Mountbatten for her kind suggestion

regarding the safeguarding of property in  schools,

both Government and aided. But even if I could meet

her   suggestion   of   providing   a   watchman-or

watchwomen in the case of girls' schools - for  every

school  in Singapore, I shall have great difficulty

in   persuading  my  colleague,  the  Minister  for

Finance, to agree. So what we have to do is to have

a  regular  watchman,  who will  be  provided  with

quarters, in certain large schools. But in  smaller

schools,  we will have to make do somehow with  the

school servants. Generally speaking, it is possible

to  get  a school servant to do it because he  then

gets free quarters to stay in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking from experience - not from my personal

experience, however, but from the experience of  my

officials - it would appear to be cheaper not to have

a  watchman  because  then the loss  through  theft

would  only  amount  to a few hundred  dollars  per

year,  whereas the wages of watchmen would come  to

thousands of dollars per annum.

arrangements with school servants are to  be  made,

could   I   request  the  Minister  to   make   the

arrangements through the Ministry, because  in  the

past when the principals have been left to make the

arrangements, the school servants have argued that,

according  to  the Labour Ordinance, they  are  not

supposed  to  work more hours, and  so  on  and  so

forth,   and   the  principals  have  found   great

difficulty in making such arrangements?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, ever since The new

Government    took   office,    the    spirit    of

administration  has  changed  considerably,  and  I

think  there has been a great deal of consultations

between  officials and principals. I am  sure  that

this  point has not been forgotten and that as much

consultation as possible will take place to  ensure

that  school  properties  will  be  safeguarded  by

detailing some school servants to take over part of

the duties of the watchman.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (99) of sub-head

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (99) (viii) of sub-head I says

"Principals",    and,   deals   with    appointment

allowances.  I  know from experience  that  English

primary   school  principals  get  $150  as   their

allowance  for one school, and those who  take  two

schools get another $75 as acting allowance for the

second school. There are two questions I would like

to ask. One is whether the principals of vernacular

schools get the same privilege. The second question

is  this: I think most principals will be asked  to

take  two  sessions from next year. Is  the  acting

allowance of $75 still going to be paid?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, regarding payments

of  allowances to principals who are now being paid

$150  for looking after one session and the present

practice of giving another $75 in case they do  two

sessions,  I would say that one of the reasons  why

principals  will  have to look after  two  sessions

from  1960  is that of saving of expenditure.  That

being  so,  as a rule, the principal  of  a  school

would  be principal for two sessions, and  he  will

receive  only  $150.  There are,  however,  certain

cases  where, because schools are far away  in  the

rural  areas,  the  principals would  still  be  in

receipt  of  $150, but they would  be  required  to

assist   in  the  general  administration  in   the

Ministry   when  needed.  Therefore,   the   acting

allowance of $75 for looking after a double-session

school will not be paid as from 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the larger issue of payments of

allowances  to  principals in  streams  other  than

English, this caused considerable heart-burning  in

the  past, because the Government had talked  about

equal  treatment  for the four streams.  They  kept

saying: "What about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



us  who are not in the English streams? When are we

going to get those allowances?" I am happy to  say,

Mr Speaker, that the 1960 Estimates do provide for

principals' charge or responsibility allowances  in

the  non-English streams, which means the  Chinese,

Malay  and  Tamil  streams, with  effect  from  1st

January,  1960. This decision, I am sure,  will  be

greeted with pleasure even though there is to be no

backdating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the scale of payments, I must warn that

it  would not be the same, because having inherited

four  streams of education, which have gone through

four  different stages of development,  it  is  not

possible to have actual equality. I understand, for

example,  in  the English stream you have  so  many

streams  of classes, whereas in the Chinese stream,

you do not have streams of classes. You may have in

the  middle school, four middle one classes.  There

will not be four middle two classes nor four middle

three  classes, and so on to qualify  as  a  "four-stream"  middle  school. But we  do  have  that  in

Government institutions in the English stream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it has been necessary to amend that

formula  somewhat, and by doing some multiplication

and  division,  we arrive at certain responsibility

or  charge  allowances for principals in  the  non-English stream. I think the scale has already  been

circularised  to the various streams of  education.

They  are  aware of what they can expect.  I  must,

however, say a few words more especially for  those

in   the  Chinese  stream,  since  the  payment  of

responsibility allowance to principals implies that

there   must   be  an  amendment  to  the   present

organisational  set-up in the Chinese  schools.  In

Chinese  schools,  besides  the  principal  of  the

school,  there are the so-called Deans  of  Studies

and  Deans  of  Discipline.  These  posts  must  be

abolished because it is expected that the principal

should himself take full responsibility for running

the  school and not to delegate four or five  other

people  to  assist  in  the administration  of  the

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present Deans of Studies or Deans of Discipline

in  Chinese  schools generally have  a  very  light

share  of  teaching duties, and I expect that  from

1960  when  these Deans are no longer  Deans,  they

will  continue to work like other teachers  and  do

their full share of work in schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now give an example of a Dean of Study - one

Mr  Lee  Hwee  Yiow  of Yock See  School,  Prinsep

Street.   He   was,  I  believe,  a   former   City

Councillor,  and a close friend of our  Member  for

Cairnhill. Soon after I took office in the Ministry

of  Education,  I  received a letter  of  complaint

saying  that Mr Lee Hwee Yiow of Yock  See  School

was doing only one-third of teaching duties in this

particular  school - that  is  about  400  minutes  a

week - and   that  he  was  a  Dean  of  Studies.   I

accordingly   sent  an  inspector  to   investigate

whether this complaint was true. True enough,  here

was a man doing one-third of the duties of a normal

teacher, and getting away with it. Before  long  he

tendered  in his resignation and I hear he  is  now

undertaking legal studies in London.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do

not  know whether I understand rightly that in  the

case of the Chinese school principals, they will be

paid a responsibility allowance. Is that on top  of

the principal's allowance, or does that make up for

the principal's allowance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, it has long been known as a principal's allowance. But I think

it   is   preferable  to  call  it  a   charge   or

responsibility allowance of a principal.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I have a note here to

say that I must address you as Mr Kandasamy, so  I

shall  have  to  address you as such.  Because  all

principals  will have to do two sessions - especially

when  some  of  them have been enjoying  an  acting

allowance - and because if they do two sessions they

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



have  to  go back for lunch and come back again,  I

wonder whether any consideration could be given  as

regards transport allowance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am afraid

everyone  who  works has to go back for  lunch  and

nobody  talks  about asking for an extra  transport

allowance.  So, the question of a principal  having

to  do  two  sessions would only imply  this:  that

there would be a change in the office hours of  the

particular  principal. He is  not  expected  to  be

there  from  7.45  a.m. to 6.45  p.m.  I  think  an

adjustment could be made where the principal  would

perhaps turn up at 9.30 a.m. or 10 a.m., then go on

to  4.30  p.m. In between, of course, every session

would  have a senior assistant who would look after

the  school  whilst the principal, the  substantive

holder, is not around there. After all, we  do  not

expect things to happen every day of the year which

would  require the principal's presence right  from 7.45 a.m. to 6.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 29.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 29, Sir, deals with Domestic Science.

Sir,  you cannot imagine what pleasure it  gave  me

when  I  saw  that domestic science  has  not  been

abolished.  It has been my fear that  it  would  be

abolished,  in view of what has been  said  by  the

Deputy Prime Minister, to free working-class  women

from  domestic  drudgery and household  slavery.  I

thought that the P.A.P. Government does not believe

in  training  women  to be good housewives.  I  was

afraid  that  domestic science would be  abolished,

Sir.  When  I saw that it was retained, you  cannot

imagine  my joy. However, I would have been happier

if  I  had  seen  provision made for expanding  it.

Probably  the economic situation of Singapore  does

not  allow it, but I do wish that, since there will

be  an  increase of young girls as  well  as  young

boys,  provision should also be made for facilities

for girls to be expanded also.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Kandasamy,  concerning  this  problem,  I  wish  to

inform the Opposition Member that the object of our

Government   is  to  train  women  to   be   better

housewives since, by becoming so, they can also  be

useful to our State. In this respect, when we  feel

it  is  necessary, we will increase or  expand  the

facilities  for training these women.  At  present,

there  are five Government secondary schools: Bukit

Panjang  Secondary  School,  Cedar  Girls'  School,

Crescent  Girls' School, Raffles Girls School,  and

Tanjong  Katong  Girls School,  and  there  are  13

Government-aided  schools.  There  are   21   Malay

schools.  This,  I believe, is the present  number;

next  year  we will cater for the increase  in  the

number of girls attending schools.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Kandasamy, I

wish   to   explain  further  to  the  Member   for

Mountbatten  on  domestic  science.  In  the  Malay

schools at present cooking is being taught together

with domestic science, knitting, sewing, etc. These

are taught from Std. IV to Std. VII in all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



Malay  girls' schools. In the Geylang Craft  Centre

these  subjects are also taught to  pupils  in  the

higher  standards. Also at the Geylang Craft Centre

the pupils are taught subjects like typewriting and

others. With domestic science subjects being widely

taught,  I  am  sure the pupils  who  receive  such

training  will be benefited, and this  will  enable

Malay  girls to fit themselves as better housewives

when  they  leave school. I am convinced  that  the

domestic science subjects that are being taught  in

the  lower  Malay schools and also at  the  Geylang

Craft Centre are very satisfactory.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, I agree

with  the  speaker  that the standard  of  domestic

science in Malay schools is very high. I myself was

a  teacher in a Malay school for about two or three

years. In fact, that is where I learnt my Malay.  I

have also been working in many Malay boys' schools,

where I taught English. I spent quite a big part of

my  teaching  career  teaching Malay  teachers  and

Malay  children in Malay schools, English.  I  have

experience   of   their  domestic  science,   their

embroidery and their cooking. I do appreciate  that

their standards are very high. My question is  just

whether  any provision has been made for expansion,

as  I  see  that the Estimates remain the same  for

1960.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of information. I

would  just  like to ask the Member for Mountbatten

whether  the  domestic scientists  in  schools  can

produce a good meal or not?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Kandasamy, if the Deputy

Prime  Minister  goes to Scotts Road  Malay  Girls'

School,   he   will  be  entertained.   They   have

entertained  officials before with the food  cooked

by  the children. And I know the children there  do

very good cooking.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Kandasamy, since Government

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, I have

partaken  of the feast in Scotts Road Malay  Girls'

School,   and   certainly  they  do  produce   most

delectable cakes and dishes, and I think I envy the

young  Malay  men who will be able to  marry  these

girls in time to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the Member for Mountbatten regarding

the  provision for 1960, we feel that those schools

which  have  already been furnished - in  fact,  they

have  been  too  luxuriously  furnished -  would  be

adequate for the purpose for next year. That is why

there  is no increase in the provision. In fact,  I

would  want  a  revision of  the  manner  in  which

domestic  science is being taught to our  girls.  I

think  we  should be more realistic  in  regard  to

future  syllabuses  and  not  think  in  terms   of

pressure  cookers or electric cookers, because  the

majority of the people will have to be content with

charcoal burners or firewood "anglows" plus  frying

pans  and smoky kitchens! We would like to make  it

possible  for girls to go out to be ready  to  look

after homes and husbands and, well, feed the babies

and keep the home fires burning!



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Kandasamy, for the

information of the Minister for Education, that  is

the  very  reason  why  I said  I  appreciated  the

standard  of  domestic science  in  Malay  schools,

because  they  do  not  teach  with  only  pressure

cookers,  but they do give the children an  inkling

of  how  other people cook. They have from electric

cookers  to gas, to charcoal, to firewood and  from

electric  ovens they go right down to  little  tins

where  you have to put charcoal below and  charcoal

on  top  to  pretend that it is an  oven  and  bake

cakes.  They do have utensils as primitive  as  all

that,  because they know that in the homes of  some

of  the  poorer  people, they do not have  electric

ovens.  That  was  why  I said  I  appreciated  the

domestic science in Malay schools. But in  view  of

all  the information that has been given, may I  be

given leave to withdraw the amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 58.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item is on Contribution to Central

Provident Fund - I suppose the angle I am taking  on

the subject will take the Minister by surprise, but

he  knows me by now, that I will be taking it  from

the  angle of my own sex. Whereas a man works  till

he is 55, and then retires, and if he does not have

a pension then he draws a provident fund, a woman's

retiring age is as low as 45. But when she retires,

she  is  not  eligible to draw the provident  fund,

because  in  the retirement age for  the  different

sexes  there  is a difference of 10 years,  but  in

regard  to  the  date  of  the  qualification   for

withdrawing   the  provident  fund  there   is   no

difference  between  her and  a  man.  A  woman  is

retired  at  45, presumably because  the  employers

feel  that  she cannot work any more.  So,  if  she

cannot  work  any  more,  why  should  she  not  be

permitted to draw the money that was intended to be

given  to her to help her out when she cannot  work

any  more? Why must she wait for 10 more years? She

might not live that long, in spite of the fact that

women  are supposed to live five years longer  than

men!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, I feel that

if I go on answering the Member for Mountbatten,  I

might find myself championing the cause of the down-trodden  women! This, however, raises the  question

of  the established practice of men retiring at the

age of 55 and women at 45. I believe there has been

some  amendment  for new appointees  in  Government

service, who would be required to retire at  60.  I

have,  I  think, the agreement of the Minister  for

Finance  in  this - that for the teaching service  we

would  wish teachers to carry on, despite  the  age

limit,  until  around 60. There is no  question  of

compulsion  but  we do hope that teachers  who  are

bordering on retirement (if they are men at 55, and

if  they  are  women  at present  45),  should  not

hesitate  to  pursue their careers further  and  we

shall  be very pleased to extend their appointments

until  they  are  60, unless of course,  physically

they are not fit to carry on as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



teachers  in  service. So it is a matter  which  is

really  beyond my control, whether a women  teacher

retiring from service at 45, may be able to get her

money back from the provident fund. It is beyond my

control.  But  I  should  be  pleased  to  add   my

recommendation that they should be allowed to  take

away  their  contributions. But as  I  say,  it  is

outside my control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to take this opportunity to

say  a  few  words on the question of teachers  who

have  retired  and  have been  re-employed,  either

after  retiring  as  pensioners  if  they  were  in

Government service, or after retirement from  aided

schools,  and  who have collected  their  provident

fund  proceeds.  During  the  last  few  months,  I

personally  have interviewed about 70 teachers  who

were  aged  60 and over. There were some even  aged

72. Of this number, three in the English stream and

three in the Chinese stream have been given special

permission  to  continue, but  36  in  the  English

stream have not been allowed to continue. Eight  in

the  Chinese stream have been asked to leave at the

end  of the year, and there are 19 cases yet to  be

decided. The purpose behind this is that there have

been  complaints from younger people to the  effect

that  retired teachers who have already  got  their

pensions   or  who  have  already  received   their

provident  funds  are  still in  service  and  this

prevents  younger  people from  being  employed  as

teachers. However, these elderly teachers have been

allowed  to  register on a reserved  list  for  re-employment,  if necessary. But it is the  intention

of the Ministry to offer all vacant jobs to younger

people  if they care to apply. Should it  be  found

that  in  certain schools there is still a shortage

of  teachers, then all these retired teachers of 60

and over, if they are still interested, would be re-employed.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Kandasamy, the Minister

for  Education has very aptly used the word  "down-trodden"  women. They are down-trodden,  especially

when  they are legally married. I shall prove  this

to  him.  If they are not legally married, then  it

does not come to the notice of the Government! They

are  not married, so they are quite all right.  But

if they are legally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



married,  they  are  penalised.  With  the  Central

Provident  Fund,  they  are  penalised  this   way.

Unmarried women, if they retire at 45, have only to

wait  for  10 more years before they collect  their

money.  But  married women have what  is  called  a

retiring benefit, which is not quite a pension,  so

that  they  will  have to contribute  also  to  the

Provident Fund: and when they retire they not  only

have  paid  the money into the Provident Fund,  but

out  of whatever gratuity they get they have to pay

the  Government's share into the Provident Fund and

leave  both their share and Government's share  for

10 more years in the provident fund before they can

draw it. You can see the difficulty that a woman is

faced with, in not only having her share kept  back

for 10 more years, but she will have to pay out  of

whatever  little  money she gets  as  gratuity  the

Government's share also. So that is why I say, Sir,

that  the  Minister has very aptly  used  the  word

"down-trodden". I would appeal to  him,  since  his

women   teachers   are  thus  affected,   to   make

appropriate  recommendations to amend  the  Central

Provident Fund Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, I think the problem

posed  by  the Member for Mountbatten  is  not  one

really   for   the  Minister  for  Education.   The

difficulty   experienced  by,  married   women   in

Government service in the circumstances detailed by

the  Member  for  Mountbatten  arises  out  of  the

wording  of  the Central Provident Fund  Ordinance.

When  a  woman  gets  married while  in  Government

service,  she ceases to be permanent and  therefore

she  ceases to be pensionable. Thereafter, she goes

on  a  contribution scheme to the Central Provident

Fund.  Now,  the  Central Provident Fund  Ordinance

says  that  no  member of the  Provident  Fund  may

withdraw his money until he reaches the age of  55,

or leaves the country, or satisfies the Chairman of

the  Board  that he is unable to work any  further.

When  a woman teacher is asked to leave at 45,  she

cannot  get  paid because she is not  yet  55;  and

because she does not leave the country, she  cannot

get paid;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



and  because  she cannot satisfy the Chairman  that

she  is  incapable of any further work, she  cannot

get  paid. Therefore, she has to wait for 10 years.

The  question, of course, is whether  the  Minister

for  Finance  would consider that the circumstances

justify an amendment to the Ordinance to meet cases

such as these.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Kandasamy, I just want to

make  one  correction. Even if  she  satisfies  the

Chairman  of the Provident Fund Board that  she  is

unable  to  work, she is not allowed  to  draw  the

money  immediately. It must be after two  years  of

retirement that she can draw the money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman</b>: Members will

moved  to  tears by the terrible plight of  married

they  are married and retire at the age of 45, they

would have got their husbands to support them until

such  time  as they can withdraw the contributions.

However, the whole business is really not under  my

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I see a

little  sparkle in the eye of the Member for Farrer

Park  when  he  asks those questions  to  which  he

already knows the answers, because both of us  were

Members  of  the University of Malaya  Council  way

back   in  1958  when  it  was  decided  that   the

University  of  Malaya would start  a  division  at

Kuala  Lumpur. As a result of that, there were  two

Committees: one to decide on the constitution,  and

another  on the finance. Both reports were  adopted

subsequently,  and  arising  out   of   the   Joint

Committee  on  Finance Report a recommendation  was

submitted  to the two Governments whereby  for  the

triennium  1959-60-61 the two  Governments  of  the

Federation  and Singapore would contribute  towards

the  Annually  Recurrent Expenditure  for  the  two

divisions of the University - that of Singapore  and

Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the contributions made by the

Governments of the Federation and Singapore for the

Annually  Recurrent Expenditure for the  University

of Malaya was in the ratio of 60 per cent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



Federation  and  40 per cent Singapore.  But  as  a

result of the Finance Committee's Report, there has

been   a   readjustment  of   the   percentage   of

contributions - we   have  the  Government   of   the

Federation paying the equivalent of two as  against

one from the Government of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Estimates for the three years 1959-60-61 were

presented in two forms - actual per capita  cost  or

estimated  cost, assuming the worst  to  allow  for

development  at  Kuala  Lumpur.  The  two  previous

Governments  accepted  the  recommendation  of  the

Finance  Committee on estimated cost  less  10  per

cent.  Therefore,  for  the years  1959-60-61,  the

joint  contributions of the two Governments to  the

University of Malaya were $8.92 million  for  1959,

$10.2  million for 1960 and $11.9 million for 1961,

less 10 per cent. So the provision for 1960 is one-third of $10.2 million, which is $3.4 million, less

10  per cent, making the figure of $3.06 million in

the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Am I to understand that this vote is in

respect  of Annually Recurrent Charges incurred  by

the  University  of Malaya in both  the  divisions?

Should  it become necessary for capital grants  for

the  University of Malaya to be obtained from  both

the  Governments  for  the  year  1960,  would  the

Singapore Government lend itself favourably to such

proposals,  or is the matter of capital grants  for

1960  for  capital developments out of the question

at this stage?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question

of a capital grant does not appear to arise for the

time   being,  because  even  for  1959  there   is

discussion  in progress between the Governments  of

the  Federation and Singapore over the  formula  to

meet the increased needs for capital expenditure in

the expansion of the division of the University  at

Kuala   Lumpur.  That,  I  think,  has   not   been

finalised.   I  believe  the  Government   of   the

Federation  would like Singapore to contribute  the

equivalent of 50 per cent, but I think the Minister

for Finance is aware that we are standing firm



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>



over  this question of contribution towards capital

expenditure at Kuala Lumpur. The previous  decision

of Government was that any savings brought about by

a  deferment  of capital expenditure  in  Singapore

could then be diverted towards Kuala Lumpur. In the

meantime, therefore, there is no new development in

Singapore, but there is increased activity at Kuala

Lumpur.

Speaker,  Sir, I remember, when I was in  the  City

Council,  that the question of what was  to  happen

to,  or  who should develop the Shenton Way Playing

Fields arose; I believe it was decided by the  City

Council  then  that the playing  fields  should  be

handed  over to the Ministry of Education in  order

that the Ministry might provide playing fields  for

schools which have themselves no playing fields.  I

happened to pass Shenton Way Playing Fields when  I

went   to  see  the  exhibition  at  the  Singapore

Polytechnic,  and  I  found  that  the  field   was

somewhat overgrown. The condition in which I  found

the fields did not give me the impression that they

were being used by anybody as playing fields.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 64.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maintenance of Shenton Way Playing Fields." I was

under  the  impression that that playing field  was

given to the Prince Edward Road Boys' Club. When  I

saw  this  item  in the Estimates  under  the  Head

"Education", I was wondering whether it  was  meant

for  school children or for the Prince Edward  Road

Boys' Club children. I was given to understand that

it  was meant for the Prince Edward Road Boys' Club

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this because, as Principal ot the Cantonment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



classes  with  a playground the size  of  which  is

smaller than a football field. And I tried my  best

to  borrow  the playing field of other schools  for

football  games, but they were all booked  for  one

purpose or another. I never knew that there  was  a

field  available for schools. So when  I  saw  this

item, I was wondering whether it is for schools. If

it  is, none of the principals in that area who are

very badly in need of playing fields know about it.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I would

like to clarify to the Member for Mountbatten about

the   playing  field  at  Shenton  Way,   for   the

maintenance of which provision has been made.  This

playing field was handed over to the charge of  the

Minister  for Education in August 1958. This  field

is  for  the use of schools in the City area  which

have  no  playing  fields of their  own,  or  whose

playing fields are not big enough. The Ministry  of

Education  is  responsible for its maintenance,  to

see that it is kept in good condition to enable the

boys to make use of it. This field is now specially

used for primary schools only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member for Farrer Park, I would like to

explain, in connection with this field, that  after

its  taking  over  by  the Ministry  of  Education,

temporary   arrangements   have   been   made   for

caretakers of schools in the vicinity to  cut  down

the grass and to maintain the field so that it will

be fit for use by school children.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I hope that the Press

will  give wide publicity that that ground is meant

for   school  children,  so  that  schools  in  the

Chinatown area which are very congested and have no

playing  fields will know that they can  now  apply

for that playing field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to take the advice of the Minister for

Culture  and  be  on  the  defensive  before  I  am

attacked.  I would like to make it very clear  that

whatever  I say on Education today is not meant  to

be destructive criticism nor have I any destructive

ulterior  motives. Whatever I say will  be  with  a

sincere  desire  to  give  my  opinion  on  certain

matters pertaining to Education and to offer a  few

suggestions, some of which I hope, if the  Minister

views them with an open mind, he will agree with. I

hope that at least some of my suggestions will find

their way through his open mind into his heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to compliment him for his enthusiasm

over the improvement of education in Singapore. But

probably due to his over-enthusiasm, he might  have

overlooked  a few facts. Sir, the Labour  Ordinance

permits  44  hours of work a week.  Office  workers

usually do not do the maximum. They work from  8.30

a.m. to 4.30 p.m. minus one hour for lunch - it comes

to  7  hours - and with 4½ hours on Saturday,  that

makes  39½ hours. Out of 52 weeks a year, deducting 12  Public and Bank holidays

with 24 days  leave  a

year,  that  leaves approximately 47  weeks.  39½

hours times 47 weeks gives 1,856½ hours per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for teachers in schools. Let us take, for

example, Primary V and VI teachers. They have to do

26½  hours  of school work. They have at  least  to

correct  one set of Arithmetic papers, one  set  of

English papers, and one set of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



either  Hygiene,  Geography,  History,  or  Science

papers, and then do one set of homework. That makes

four sets. And with the Increase of the maximum  in

a  class to 45 pupils, that gives them 180 books to

correct  every day. Giving the teacher 1½ minutes

per  book on an average - Arithmetic takes less  than

Composition - but let us say 1½ minutes each  book,

that  works out to 270 minutes, or 4½  hours.  An

industrious teacher should prepare his work for the

next  day.  He will take an hour to do  that,  i.e.

5½ hours times 6 days, that makes 33 hours. Twice

a  week,  a teacher will be expected to go down  to

school  either  for games, scouting, Cubs,  Guides.

Brownies.  St.  John's,  Red  Cross,  Sea   Cadets.

Traffic  duty before school and during recess,  and

preparing for school concerts, exhibitions, sports,

and other extra mural activities. Let us put it all

down  to twice a week of 2 hours - that gives 4 hours

a week. If you add them up, it comes to 63½ hours

a  week.  Next year. 1960. I believe there will  be

245 school days. Divide that by six school days; it

comes  to 41 weeks, and multiply it by 63½ hours,

we get 2,603 hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whereas the Labour Ordinance allows 44 hours

times 47 weeks, which is 2,068 hours a year, office

workers  do  1,856 hours a year,  and  teachers  do

2,603  hours a year. So teachers, in spite of their

long  holidays,  are  already doing  535  hours  in

excess of the maximum permitted for one year.  That

is  why when the Minister intends to make them work

another half-session, I approached him and spoke to

him.  I was very glad that he assured me that  this

extra - it  is not really an extra but it will  be  a

substitute for the free period given to them during

school hours. The free period will be added up, and

they will have to do that period within the week on

alternate  days,  which will be  about  3  days,  I

suppose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although that solves the question with regard to

the  number  of  hours, I still do not  quite  know

whether it is really necessary in view of the  fact

that  they have already had a recent pay  cut.  And

that  means  another item of expense of about  $12,

this   coming  back  to  work  during  a  different

session;  whereas they used to do  it  all  in  one

session.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



Now  they have to go back 3 times a week. I suppose

they have to go back to school 3 times a week, plus

what  they  used to do; i.e. coming  twice  in  the

afternoon  for either games or other activities.  I

feel that this may lead us to contravene the Labour

Ordinance.  The teachers might feel that  they  are

being deprived of their human rights and that  this

is  forced labour, because it is in excess of  what

the Labour Ordinance allows. Who will suffer in the

long run? The teachers? Yes! Whenever they argue on

the  point that the children will suffer, they have

been laughed at, because the answer is, "Oh, it  is

for  their own good!" That may be, but nevertheless

the  children will suffer, Sir. No unhappy  teacher

can create an atmosphere of happiness in the class.

No  bad teacher can have good results in the class.

The  life  of  the teacher is very much  interwoven

with  the life of the children. That is why  if  it

affects  teachers  adversely,  it  will  indirectly

affect  the children too. What will be the fate  of

Singapore   if   our  teachers,  discontented   and

unhappy, bring up a generation of discontented  and

unhappy children for the next generation? The Prime

Minister  himself,  when  addressing  a  rally   of

teachers and principals, said in the Straits  Times

of Wednesday, 9th December:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In your care is entrusted the impressionable

minds  of our young people. How you discharge  this

trust  decides  whether in the next ten  years,  we

have  a  united  and  coherent people,  or  a  more

divided and confused one."



<br><br>And  the Minister for Education, in the same rally,

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If teachers play their part well and dedicate

themselves  to  the service of their  country,  the

future of Singapore will be bright."



<br><br>Sir, if so much depends on teachers, if so much  is

expected  of them, then in the name of sanity,  are

we  giving  them this treatment? Why are we  making

them  so  discontented? If anyone  thinks  that  my

calculation is inclined to be overgenerous. I would

like  to  point  out that I have not included  such

activities as the registration of Primary I pupils,

when  teachers come during the holidays to register

children; during the entrance examination  they  do

extra correcting of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



examination  papers; during the school  examination

extra work on correcting examination papers. Report

books  and  closing  of  registers  are  also  done

outside of school hours. All those are not included

in  my calculation. If even then, some feel that my

calculation is still over-generous, take off 20 per

cent of the total, we still have the teachers doing

the maximum that the Labour Ordinance allows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the six-day week on children, Sir,

in the number of hours, does not give them an extra

day,  except for Primary I pupils who get  4  hours

extra  a  week;  Primary II, 1½; Primary  III,  3

hours;  Primary  IV,  3  hours;  Primary  V,  1¾;

Primary  VI, 1¾ hours. Physically, it should  not

be  impossible for the children to take this  extra

strain. They will not be physically affected, I  am

sure,  except  for Primary I, not so  much  because

they are young but because they are new to the type

of  life that is thrusted upon them. From birth  up

to  six  years  old,  a child lives  in  the  home,

sheltered by his mother. He runs to her when he  is

going  to  be bullied by the neighbour's  child  or

bitten   by  the  neighbour's  dog.  He  is  always

sheltered and has someone to care for him  all  the

time.  All of a sudden he finds himself in a school

with  a  strange  man or woman who  is  called  the

teacher to whom he has to run for protection, and a

strange crowd for him to mix with. And this kind of

treatment causes more strain on him than  does  the

teaching of the school. This strain will be hard on

the  child  of six if he is made to do  4½  extra

hours  and  made to carry the same  strain  as  the

child  in Primary II, who has already had one  year

to  reconcile himself with his new mode of life. As

I  have  said,  this should not be an unduly  heavy

strain physically on the children of other classes.

But  the  question still remains: is it  absolutely

necessary,   and  is  it  beneficial,  all   things

considered?  We  must  not forget,  Sir,  that,  as

mentioned when we were talking about school playing

grounds   just  now,  the  six-day  week   deprives

children of extra mural activities, even if  it  is

not  due  to  anything else, it is due to  lack  of

premises.  The morning school takes the  first  two

hours to do their physical education; the afternoon

school takes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



the last two hours; the rest of the time is too hot

for  the children to play or to do exercises in the

fields. On top of that, the afternoon school  comes

in  the morning during the first two hours to  have

their house practices, and the morning school comes

during  the  last  two hours to  have  their  house

practices.  As I mentioned just now,  some  schools

are unfortunate enough to have a field smaller than

the  size of a football field, for 32 classes. That

will bring an average of, with the new calculation,

I  believe about 1,300 or 1,500. Except for schools

with exceptionally large grounds, there will be  no

space  for extra mural activities for the children.

Even if the school does have a big playground, when

it  rains,  these children who come to  school  for

extra,  mural  activities will run  to  the  school

premises   and   disturb  the  classes   that   are

functioning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir - this concerns most families - the

week-end  is  the only time the parents  have  with

their  children, especially if both parents  happen

to be wage-earners. And with Sunday sometimes being

a  voluntary  corps  day,  parents  have  only  the

Saturday   afternoon  with  their  children.   With

children  going to school on a Saturday  afternoon,

they  will  have practically no time  at  all  with

their parents, especially the smaller children  who

are put to bed by the time the parents come home or

they  have just had dinner and they see very little

of their parents by being put to bed.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this world can be important enough to

replace   the   family  get-together  on   Saturday

afternoon  or  once  a  week.  We  have  seen   the

disastrous  effect on the children who do  not  get

enough attention from the parents. The relationship

between  children and parents diminishes when  they

practically  do  not  see one  another.  With  this

relationship goes the parent's influence  over  the

children.  Sir,  instead of remedying  delinquency,

this might be helping to create more delinquency by

parents losing control over their children, Sir, I

am not against the principle of a six-day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



week,  provided Saturday activities are  for  those

who  need  them. After all, before the P.A.P. came

into   power,  as  a  principal,  my   school   was

functioning  on  a  six-day week system.  When  the

newspapers  first approached me for my comments  on

the  six-day week school. I hailed it because I did

not understand then how the Government intended  it

to  be carried out. I actually hailed it! I did not

understand that the Government was planning to make

it  compulsory, and thrust it on everybody, whether

it was good or bad for them. I hailed it because  a

six-day  week  can be a blessing  to  children  who

would  otherwise be spending their Saturday playing

in  the  drains and in the company of undesirables,

or cooped up miserably in unhealthy cubicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those children, a few hours spent on Saturday

mornings weaving baskets, singing songs and playing

games  with teachers who have voluntarily given  up

their  Saturday  mornings for the benefit  of  such

children,  will  bring a ray of sunshine  into  the

life of both the children and the teachers. It  can

create  an  atmosphere  of friendliness  and  civic

consciousness  among teachers and pupils.  But  not

when  it  is  done  against  the  protests  of  the

teachers  and  against parents grumbling  and  with

some children actually torn away from their parents

on the only day they have with their parents. May I

venture to suggest, Sir, that Government carries on

with  the  six-day week, but reserve Saturdays  for

extra  mural  activities which  children  who  will

benefit  from  them will otherwise be deprived  of?

Let  the teachers, who have sufficient civic  sense

to volunteer, conduct these extra mural activities.

This  will  bring  joy  and  satisfaction  to   all

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the centralisation of vernacular

language  groups, the Minister is quite right  when

he  talked about the lack of premises and  shortage

of  teachers. I must admit that it was a  nightmare

for  me  when I was a principal to try and run  the

vernacular classes as I thought they should be run.

It was a nightmare for my teacher teaching the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



Tamil   language,  trying  to  teach  children   of

different   ages   from  different   standards   at

different levels in the Tamil language. And it  was

a  nightmare to the class teacher who,  because  of

the  shortage  of teachers, had to go into  another

class   while  his  Chinese  pupils  were  learning

Chinese, the Tamil children learning Tamil, and the

Malay  children, because of the smallness of  their

number, had nothing to do because they had no Malay

teachers  in  the  school. It was a  nightmare  for

everyone concerned. This step that the Minister  is

taking,  I  quite  appreciate is  an  evil,  but  a

necessary  and  unavoidable  evil.  This  state  of

affairs  is  not the fault of anybody. It  is  just

that  multi-lingual classes in the primary  schools

are  new and are in their infancy. And now,  having

come  to  the stage where it is ready to be  weaned

from  the fluid arrangements, the Minister has very

aptly  brought  it  to the semi-solid  stage,  "the

centralisation of language groups". I hope we  will

soon   reach   the   solid  stage   when   concrete

arrangements  could  be made to  make  all  schools

Malayan  schools.  However,  had  the  first  Press

release  stated  that children who  wish  to  learn

Tamil  will go to one school, children who wish  to

learn  Chinese  will  go  to  another  school,  and

children  who wish to learn Malay will  go  to  yet

another school, probably it might not have hit  the

parents so hard. I can quite understand them.  They

felt  that the P.A.P. Government has said  so  much

against communalism and when, all of a sudden,  not

knowing  the situation in school, they  heard  that

Tamil  children were to be segregated, and  Chinese

children   were   to  be  segregated,   they   were

horrified. Later, of course, the Minister tried  to

explain that it was not Tamil children but children

who  wanted to learn Tamil that will be put in  one

school.  It  is natural, when the first  impression

has  been  formed, for explanations to  sound  like

excuses.  But  I,  who  have the  experience,  will

confirm that it is a necessary evil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning textbooks, Sir. In my conversation

with the Minister for Education, I was glad to hear

that  the Textbook Committee is still sitting,  and

the Minister hopes to publish new textbooks with  a

Malayan background soon. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



this  is  very laudable. It is a very good  scheme.

But I would like to say that we could make more use

of  these  new textbooks. I would like  to  make  a

suggestion,  and I hope the Minister will  view  it

with an open mind and give it his consideration. It

is  "atmosphere". It is difficult  to  make  myself

clear.  So I will give an extreme example  to  show

what  I  mean  by  the atmosphere of  the  book.  I

suppose  everyone will be horrified if I  say  that

family  planning can be taught even in  Primary  I.

But  let  me  explain. Instead  of  having  Readers

saying,  "Father has a hen and the hen  lays  eggs.

Father  sells the eggs in the market  and  he  gets

thirteen cents each for the eggs."; instead of just

giving sentences without any purpose, we give  them

a story like this: "Awang has two children, one boy

and  one  girl. Father earns so much and gives  the

child  so much. The boy helps the parents  to  rear

chickens." The father earns much, and because there

are  only two children, they go to school, and then

gradually  show up the prosperity of  their  family

because there are two to feed. Next to it, we  have

a  story of Ahmad who has 12 children, and in spite

of  the  fact  that  they have  enough  to  form  a

football  team  plus a referee,  the  children  are

miserable  because father cannot  earn  enough  and

mother has not enough time to look after them. They

are  ragged  and dirty and their life is miserable.

If  this  line  of  approach is adopted  throughout

school  life, then by the time the children  finish

school,  they  will  feel that  to  have  too  many

children  will be as undesirable as going to  their

neighbours' houses and robbing them of their money.

This atmosphere can be built. It does not necessary

mean  that  the  textbooks must  deal  with  family

planning.  I am just taking an extreme  example  to

show  that the atmosphere required to build up  the

citizen  in the child could be used as a background

to the books, instead of only thinking of a Malayan

background.  It  is left to the  ingenuity  of  the

people who are responsible for the textbooks to see

that they keep a happy medium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About civic tours in connection with the

schools! Yesterday we had a lot of talk about civic

tours.  I  am  fortunate enough to have experienced

it. I would like to inform the Minister for Culture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



that  I myself at first did not understand the aims

of  such  tours.  When I read in  the  papers  that

people were entertained to lunch and tea and  given

free  rides, my first reaction was to go up to  the

officer-in-charge and say. "What is it I am  paying

tax  for, to make the whole population of Singapore

tourists?" I was rather annoyed about it, but  when

I  was  told  the real reason why these tours  were

organised, I saw beyond what I was told. I was told

that  it  was to bring the people to the Government

departments to see how they are run. I began to see

and realise that there are many people in Singapore

who  suffer hardships just because they do not know

the  source of help. And if youth leaders and women

leaders or community leaders or whoever claim to be

leaders  could  be taken to places  like  the  Fire

Brigade,  they could learn something, and if  their

houses or their neighbour's houses catch fire, they

would  know exactly what should be done to get  the

assistance  of  the Fire Brigade. They  can  go  to

corrective  schools and see how children  could  be

prevented from being delinquents if they were  sent

to  the  corrective school early  enough.  If  they

could be taken to S.A.T.A. and shown the benefit of

S.A.T.A., they would influence their neighbours and

the less-informed people of the community to go  to

S.A.T.A. or Tan Tock Seng or wherever it  is  that

deal  with  T.B. in time and not to kill themselves

by  delaying. If the poor people know that there is

such  a  place as the Department of Social  Welfare

which gives public aid, maybe some of the deserving

cases  could  be attended to, instead  of,  as  the

Minister  told  us yesterday, non-deserving  people

getting aid. If they know how and when to get  help

from  the  Police,  and how  they  can  assist  the

Police,  it  will  be of benefit to  Singapore.  As

children seem to spread news the fastest,  it  will

be  very  beneficial if civic tours can be reserved

as  Saturday activity for them also. It  will  help

them very much.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we mention the word "education", it brings

to  mind  the  teaching  and learning  of  reading,

writing  or  counting. But, Sir, the  real  aim  of

education  is to supply the student with the  means

which will help him to live the best life that  his

powers   command   and  in  the   best   way   that

circumstances  permit. It is to teach  him  to  fit

himself  in  society. By society,  I  do  not  mean

sophisticated social groups. I mean "community". He

must  be  taught  to be useful to himself,  to  the

State  of  Singapore, and to the world in  general.

Therefore,  education  should  not  only   be   for

children but everyone in Singapore should learn  to

live  the best life his powers command and  in  the

best  way circumstances permit. Adult education,  I

feel,  should  have these aims too.  Mere  literacy

classes  are not sufficient. Adult students  should

be  put on the path before they are expected to  go

along  the  path and seek further knowledge.  Books

for  them  too,  I  think, should  be  revised  and

brought along the lines suggested for the children.

For  instance,  books  with  stories  depicting   a

parent's duty to children and the citizen's duty to

the  State.  The  atmosphere  that  the  Government

desires can be put into the books.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, it may be impossible for some people,

due  to old age, shyness or poverty, to come to the

adult  classes. These people must also  be  catered

for. This is where voluntary workers can be useful.

If  they will go to the slums, to the villages  and

kampongs and bring to these people the knowledge of

how to live the best life that their powers command

in  the  best  way  circumstances permit,  I  think

education will go a long way towards achieving  its

aims.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

the  Opposition  Member just now talked  about  the

problems of education. We must know that there  are

about  60,000 children who will be entering Primary

I in 1960. We know that the past Government did not

solve  this illiteracy. Therefore, among the youth,

there  are illiterates, and they go astray  in  the

streets.  In order to eradicate illiteracy  and  to

expand our education, we will give school places to

these 60,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



children   next  year.  We  know  that   the   past

Government did not pay attention to this.  We  lack

schools and classrooms. We hope that the number  of

schools  will be increased next year. In  order  to

accept  these  children into the schools,  we  will

have to hold two sessions - a morning session and  an

afternoon session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of financial difficulties, we cannot get

more   money  for  the  expenditure  on  education.

Therefore,  we  have to ask the  teachers  to  work

harder and longer. This is necessary, and we  ought

to  do  so.  Every teacher ought  to  take  up  his

responsibility. He must take a farsighted  view  in

the  interests of society and in the  interests  of

the   next  generation,  and  must  therefore  work

harder. We must have a sense of responsibility.  We

must  not do what the Opposition Member said.  When

she opened her mouth, she talked about the pay cuts

and  extra work, but she did not think about  these

young   people;  she  did  not  care  about   their

educational opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We give the teachers not more than 44 hours' work

every  week. If we analyse it carefully, the period

would  not  be  more  than 44 hours  because  every

teacher  has  one  free period to rest.  The  extra

mural  activities are day-time work. Also the music

period,   physical   training   period,   and   the

recreation period. Talking about Saturday sessions,

why  do we want to have lessons on Saturday? In the

past, the Chinese schools have a six-day week.  Why

cannot we unify all schools to have a six-day week?

Therefore, what the Members of the Opposition  said

was  contradictory. Sometimes they said  6  days  a

week  would  be all right. Later they would  say  6

days  a week would not be all right. We do not know

whether they are for it or against it. So they  are

very contradictory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do this in the interest of the pupils. If we do

not  have Saturday school, then these young  people

will  go  into the streets and go astray. What  the

Member for Mountbatten says is right. Therefore, we

must  have  Saturday teaching also. We cannot  stop

the majority of the poor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



pupils  from going to school on Saturdays  for  the

sake  of those who wish to go to the seaside or  to

church.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about textbooks, there is an Executive

Council  in the Education Ministry. In the  Council

there  are  sub-committees for the English,  Malay,

Chinese and Tamil sections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our purpose is to malayanise the textbooks. We

have local experts to take care of this compilation

of  Malayan  textbooks, to make  every  school  use

Malayan textbooks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about literacy classes. Many people have

enrolled  in  them.  We are going  to  expand  them

greatly  next year, so that city residents as  well

as  rural  residents will be able to  attend  them.

Unlike  the teachers of the former literacy classes

who  were  concerned about their pay and not  about

their  teaching,  all the present teachers  in  our

literacy  classes  will be responsible  people  and

will understand that what they are doing is to wipe

out  illiteracy.  We  want to make  these  literacy

classes  popular. Therefore, I hope the Members  of

the Opposition will not argue on pay cuts and extra

work any more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  originally I had  no  intention  of

speaking. But when I heard the speech of the Member

for  Mountbatten, I feel that I have to say  a  few

words  on  this issue. As you know, there  are  two

kinds  of people who are afraid of changes. One  is

those who are afraid of a good change. The other is

afraid of a change because, after the change,  they

will  not be able to enjoy the benefits which  they

enjoyed before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of education, if a country wants to

make   progress,  the  education  policy  must   be

reorientated. The Member for Mountbatten said  that

since  the  P.A.P. took office, the  teachers  have

been  overworked; they are busier than the workers;

they  work  more  than  8  hours  a  day.  In  this

connection,   I  believe  that  the   teachers   in

Singapore are hoping to get rid of the old kind  of

education  under the Colonial rule. They also  hope

that the children in this country will want to have

a  new kind of education. During the over 100 years

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



Colonial  rule, education became worse  and  worse.

Under  the  Rendel  Constitution  Government,   the

Minister  for  Education was the boss  of  a  night

cafe. That is why education became worse and worse.

That  is  why the school children then looked  like

Yankees.  If  we  want  to  bring  the  people   of

Singapore on to the right path, we must give up the

old  way of thinking and accept the modern  way  of

thinking and reorientate our education,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten said that if the pupils

attend six days in a week in school, then they will

be  away  from  their parents, and  they  are  more

likely to indulge in crimes. This view is wrong. As

a  matter of fact, if we make the teachers work six

days  a week, it is unlikely that the children will

go  to  the wrong path, for the former will educate

and  nourish  them properly. The  previous  way  of

thinking is wrong, but now our education policy  is

to  eradicate the old Colonial policy. That is  why

our education policy is correct and right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not heard

from  the Member for Tanglin for a very long  time.

We also know that he is not merely a teacher, but a

superior type of teacher. Mr Speaker, it looks  as

if  the  Opposition are not at one on this. Neither

has  the Member for Mountbatten nor the Member  for

Tanglin  this  evening first taken counsel  of  the

Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that I have ever heard that

a  teacher  regards himself or herself  as  a  mere

labourer. They have always behaved as if they  were

superior beings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know that there are only three laws which have been passed by the Legislative

Assembly  which affect the conditions  of  work  of

employees.   They   are   the   Clerks   Employment

Ordinance,  the Shop Assistants Ordinance  and  the

Labour  Ordinance. None of these Ordinances affects

the  working conditions of teachers. As  far  as  I

know, the teachers are a very privileged section



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



of  the community who work only a total of 236 days

in  one  year  of  365 days. I  do  not  think  any

Legislature would be misguided enough to  pass  any

law to improve their working conditions. We, on the

Government  side, are the workers who only  get  52

Sundays off plus 11 public holidays a year, so that

I  think  we qualify as labourers - not the teachers.

They  are  the  very  privileged  section  of   our

community.  It is about time something is  done  to

get  them  to  get a move on and do a  little  more

work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, I want to suggest some points here for

the  House  to  consider - whether  what  one  of  my

friends has said is correct. In the past, a  friend

told  me  that we could know whether a  person  was

selfish or not by observing his questions.  At  the

beginning,  he  will  ask  you,  "Where   are   you

working?"  Then you answer his question.  Then  the

second  question  will be about your  salary.  "How

much  is your salary?" This kind of person  can  be

considered  selfish.  Mr  Speaker.  I  raise  this

question   because  the  Member   for   Mountbatten

mentioned  at  one time the new Government's  broad

knife  and  big axe policy to cut off the  variable

allowances  of the public servants. But  today  she

talked  about  the Government's policy  which  will

increase the work of the teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in our society today we have entered a new stage and the Opposition Members do not know

our  point  of view. Our Government was elected  by

the majority of the people. Therefore, our point of

view is the same as that of most of the people.  We

want an incorruptible and efficient Government. But

the   Member  for  Mountbatten  thought  that,   by

incorruptibility,  Government  servants  must  have

high  salaries; by efficiency, she took  it  to  be

less work for them. For instance, less working time

for  teachers. Therefore, her one-hour  speech  was

based  on these two points. She emphasised that  we

must  not give extra work to the teachers. We  must

give  them  more time so that they  can  teach  the

pupils better. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



she  did  not  say whether the past Government  did

concern  themselves with the welfare of the pupils.

Did  the officers of the past Government go to  the

schools or the students' houses to see whether they

were  all right or not, or find out about the needs

of our society? But our Government consider this to

be very necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about textbooks, she said it would be best

if   we  could  put  stories  like  this  into  the

textbooks - mother  buying  vegetables,  and   father

going  out  to  work  and bringing  money  back  to

mother - and  from that stage and in  that  way,  the

pupils  will  be  made  to  understand  the  family

difficulties. We know that under the Colonial rule,

we  did  much educational work. The purpose was  to

produce  the  white-collar class, but  the  experts

were  few.  The  Member  for  Mountbatten  suddenly

raised  a suggestion that the Ministry of Education

should  teach  the pupils how to buy food  and  how

their  fathers work to bring money back home,  etc.

Now,  I want to ask her whether it is necessary  to

teach  the  pupils to become cooks  and  know  more

about  cooking and so on. Does she think that  this

is  real Malayan culture? It is no wonder that  she

is  very  interested in family affairs. She thought

that  if a family is good, then the Government will

be  good. It was not a surprise therefore  to  hear

that  the  former Minister for Education had  taken

away $700,000 to enrich his own family, but at  the

same time had sold our State.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, much of what the

Member  for  Mountbatten has  said  is  about  the

happiness   and  unhappiness  of  teachers,   their

content  and  discontent,  their  satisfaction  and

dissatisfaction.  It  all centres  on  the  six-day

week.   The   Minister   for  Education   yesterday

announced  that  one-third of  the  primary  school

students  have succeeded in passing their  entrance

examination to the secondary schools. Two-thirds of

these students have failed. The reason could be - and

I  think it is - that insufficient teaching has  been

given  to these students. What can be more  logical

than   to   ensure  that  the  teachers   who   are

responsible for the instruction should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



carry  out their responsibility fully and  well?  I

would  therefore expect the Member for Mountbatten,

and  the teachers too, to give support to the  six-day week. The six-day week has not been imposed  to

bring  about  hardships on teachers or to  separate

children  from their parents. There are seven  days

in the week, Mr Speaker, and on the seventh day we

expect the children to be at home with the parents.

It  is  rather remarkable, therefore, to  hear  the

Member  for  Mountbatten launching into a  vigorous

attack  on the six-day week. What I would say,  Mr

Speaker,   is   that  if  our  teachers   had   the

opportunity  to  go  beyond  Singapore  into  other

countries and study for themselves the labours  and

hardships   which   teachers  in  other   countries

undergo,  they  will  be thankful  for  the  little

mercies they have in Singapore. It is essentially a

readjustment  of  teachers and students  to  a  new

condition - this six-day week. Never in  the  history

of  education in Singapore, and for that matter  in

the Federation, has there been a six-day week. When

I  was a schoolboy, I remember going to school five

times  a week - Saturday being a holiday for me.  But

then  times  have moved on and the results  of  the

entrance examination to the secondary schools fully

support  our  policy  of introducing  this  six-day

week. What I would plead to teachers and to parents

as  well  is  to  try to give this six-day  week  a

chance to work. It is for the benefit of our future

generations to come. When we remember that  50  per

cent  of our population are 19 years old and under,

it  will  be a tragedy if we do not give sufficient

instruction  to  them.  The future  generations  of

Singapore will then be duffers and morons.  Let  us

face that serious responsibility and let us try  to

adjust  ourselves.  Adjusting  one's  self   is   a

question of conditioning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I be permitted, Mr Speaker, to explain what

is conditioning? For example, there are some people

who  cannot sleep when they change their  bedrooms.

After   some  time  they  get  used  to   the   new

surroundings,  they get used to the noise  outside,

and  then  they can sleep like a log.  That  is  an

example of conditioning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



Another  classical  example is that  you  can  even

train  a dog to salivate or to make it come  up  to

secrete stomach juice when it hears a bell, or when

a  light is shone into its eyes. It is just due  to

training  day after day until finally the dog  does

it.  Just as a circus trainer, for example,  trains

his  horses, tigers and elephants to do  tricks - the

horses  and  tigers to jump through  the  hoop,  to

gallop round the rings; the elephants to do waltzes

when   the  orchestra  strikes  up.  It   is   just

conditioning. And an elephant does not  distinguish

a six-day week from a seven-day week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, may I plead to teachers and parents, let us

give  this  six-day week a chance to work.  It  was

introduced  only in September - only last  term.  The

process  of conditioning takes time to work.  I  do

not  expect that all of us will accept this six-day

week  within  one  term or, let us  say,  even  two

terms. But I am quite confident that by the end  of

one academic year, the majority of the teachers and

the  students will have accepted this six-day  week

and  at  the  end  I  am fully convinced  that  the

results  of  the  entrance  examinations  into  the

secondary schools will have considerably improved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I am

surprised  that  the  Opposition  Members  do   not

realise  that in the Chinese schools, not  only  in

Singapore, but also in the Federation, we have been

having  a six-day week all along. I can assure  the

Member for Mountbatten that since my childhood when

I  was  in a Chinese school I was having a  six-day

week - and that was for 12 years. That did not affect

my brain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  just  now I heard  Members  of  the

Opposition  launch  an attack  on  the  educational

policy of the new Government in 1960. Education  is

a  question  of vital importance in a country.  The

present  Government of Singapore is democratic.  We

hope  that the Opposition Members can bring forward

constructive suggestions. But the suggestions  they

have brought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>



forward  just  now show that they are  not  of  the

opinion  that  Singapore is  getting  over  from  a

Colonial  government  to  a  self-governing  State.

Therefore, we maintain that the Opposition  Members

have  not  realised that our State is a  new  self-governing   State,  so  they  have   attacked   our

educational policy. At present, Singapore is  still

in  the  transitional period. We must put forth  an

effort to improve and revolutionise our educational

system. Since this Government took office, we  have

paid  attention to education. Under the  leadership

of  our  Minister for Education, we have found  out

that  we have inherited the old corrupt educational

policy.  We  learn from the Minister for  Education

that there was a number of teachers who went to see

blue  films.  These  are the products  of  the  old

colonial  society. Therefore, we must  improve  the

educational system. We must pay a certain price and

a  certain  amount  of effort must  be  put  forth,

especially  the teachers who shoulder the  task  of

nation-building.  Therefore,  next  year  we   will

increase the syllabuses and the amount of work  for

the teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Member of the Opposition said just now that

if  we  approve  this  Budget on  the  Ministry  of

Education, the teachers will suffer; but we are  of

the opinion that under the new Government of a self-governing State, it is the duty of the teachers  to

accept  a  six-day week. On Chinese  education,  we

have  all along had a six-day week and the teachers

in  the Chinese schools have never complained about

a lot of work and long teaching hours. Therefore, I

say that the attack from the Opposition Members  on

our education policy is not altogether correct.



<br><br>6.50 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER in the Chair.]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Kandasamy, on the subject of education

which  has  just  been  debated,  the  Member   for

Mountbatten  referred to the Labour Ordinance,  and

to  the  working  hours  as stipulated  therein.  I

believe  she  does  not know the  contents  of  the

Labour Ordinance as I am quite sure that teachers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



are  not  mentioned therein. However, there  is  no

need  for  me  to explain it in detail,  because  a

moment ago, the Minister for Labour and Law touched

on the Labour Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the working hours of the teachers, the

Member  for  Mountbatten stated  the  teachers  are

overworked, say, for instance, in the correction of

books,  preparation of lessons and so on, with  the

result  that they are dissatisfied with the present

education  system. It does not  occur  to  me  that

these  teachers  wilt  not agree  with  us  on  the

present   education  system.   Probably   with   an

additional half session the result may be that  the

teachers  may  have to do slightly more  work.  But

because these teachers had received many privileges

from  the previous Government, it is possible  that

on  account of too many free periods and because of

the system of automatic promotion, they had less to

do;  so  much  so  that  these  teachers  had  been

accustomed  to have less to do. After  the  present

Government took office, it gave them a little extra

work  to  do, and these teachers are now grumbling.

These  teachers had experienced an easy time during

the  past  Government. What I am surprised  is  why

these  teachers who had to prepare lessons, correct

books and so on, and who had been so accustomed  to

their privileges, could still find time to see blue

films?  It was alleged that these teachers required

time to prepare lessons. But there exist among  the

teachers  some who so availed themselves  of  their

leisure time on the beach that they became involved

in  an  unfortunate incident. I am quite  sure  the

Opposition  Members  know  about  this.  Lately   a

teacher  was busily enjoying his time on the  beach

with  the result that someone was drowned. In  view

of  this,  I  cannot see how we can say that  these

teachers  have  no  time at  all  to  fulfil  their

responsibilities just because of an additional half-session being introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on textbooks, I confess that the ones

used  at  present are unsuitable, especially  those

for  adults.  The Government is making  efforts  to

provide   textbooks  with  a  Malayan  outlook,   A

Textbooks Committee and also a Syllabuses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



Committee  have been formed with a view to  drawing

up   suitable  textbooks,  which  are  Malayan   in

outlook,  for  children  as  well  as  for  adults.

However, the Member for Mountbatten suggested  that

textbooks  dealing  with subjects  such  as  family

planning  should  be  introduced  right  from   the

primary   school.  I  am  apprehensive  lest   such

textbooks would be of the same quality as those  in

use  at present. Now, the pupils are unaware of the

subject, but when such textbooks on family planning

are introduced, the children of primary schools may

wish to know how family planning is practised. So I

think  such  textbooks are undesirable for  primary

school children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the six-day week, I would like to

explain to the Member for Mountbatten that  when  I

was schooling I attended a six-day week school.  At

that  time Malay school pupils attended school five

days  a  week  but  before  they  went  to  English

schools,  they had to attend special Malay  classes

on  Saturdays. The Member for Mountbatten said that

only  on Saturday and Sunday can pupils be reunited

with  their parents. When I was attending  a  Malay

school,  before I could further my studies  in  the

English  school,  I had to attend a  special  Malay

class  on Saturday, too; but still I found time  to

be  with my parents, although I could not have time

to get together with them on Saturdays.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Kandasamy,  the Opposition Members have  criticised

the  Government benches and most of the  criticisms

have been answered. I wish, however, to talk on one

subject  and that is about the children  who  learn

Tamil and Malay in English schools. There has  been

an   accusation  that  these  children  have   been

segregated  from  the others and  put  in  separate

places.  I  wish  to answer these  accusations.  In

Malaya  and  Singapore there are  many  schools  in

which  Tamil is being taught to the Tamil children.

But  the  standard of Tamil taught in these schools

is  not up to standard. There are many reasons  for

this. One reason is that there are very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



few  students who learn Tamil and the other  reason

is  that  there  are very few trained  teachers  to

teach  the  language. I am not, however,  going  to

list all the reasons.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhow, one of the very important reasons for such

a low standard is that, when a Tamil student learns

Tamil  in  an English school, the language  is  not

being taught in a suitable manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Education Minister, while talking on the

general  discussion of the Estimates, said  that  a

language cannot be studied by learning it only  one

day  in  a week, but it should be learnt daily.  At

present  there  are  very  few  Tamil  children  in

English  schools who learn Tamil. In a class  there

are four or five such children, and if we are going

to  have  a  class for each and every one  of  such

children, it will be quite impossible and  we  will

find that not only the 67 teachers of Tamil who are

at  present teaching Tamil in English schools  will

not  be sufficient, but even 670 teachers will  not

be  enough  to  teach the 9,000  children  who  are

learning Tamil. We are now having one common  Tamil

class for all the first four Primary classes.  They

are being taught on Saturdays. If we want to remedy

this,  we  could  do one thing,  that  is,  we  can

transfer  the children in four or five  schools  to

one  school where they can get instruction  from  a

teacher  who is appointed separately for them.  But

if they are going to level the accusation that such

arrangements mean segregation, then we cannot  help

it.  They have forgotten the fact that the minority

interests  should be and are looked after.  But  no

one  compels  that  a  Tamil student  should  learn

Tamil.  If  a  student does not want to  learn  his

mother  tongue, nobody is going to stop him and  no

one  forces  him  to  learn  his  language  in  the

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten appears to know these

complaints pretty well. She really spoke in support

of the Government plans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter that must be mentioned.

Under existing conditions, Chinese pupils form  the

majority in all schools. The children who  wish  to

learn  Tamil  and  Malay will be  transferred  from

about four or five schools to one school. Even  so,

in  any one school there will not be more than  200

Malay  or  Tamil pupils. But the average number  of

total  pupils in any English school is about 1,200.

What is the percentage constituted by this 200  out

of  1,200  pupils? Therefore, the  accusation  that

segregation  is  being  brought  about  cannot   be

accepted. There cannot be any sense in saying  that

segregation is being carried out on a racial basis.

If there are parents who consider that their vanity

will  be  injured  if  their children  learn  their

mother  tongue,  they can deny the  opportunity  to

their  children to learn their mother  tongue.  The

Minister for Education has explained both  in  this

Asembly  and  in  the newspapers exactly  what  the

position  is.  Despite  this  explanation,  it   is

regretted to note that this subject has been raised

and  the  real  situation has not  been  understood

despite this explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Baum)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, originally I had no  intention  to

speak,  but  the  Member for Mountbatten  has  been

attacking our education policy and it is completely

unfounded. In the past few days, at the Happy World

Stadium,  a  Teachers' Loyalty Rally was  held.  In

this rally, teachers of all races were represented.

Their  representatives stood up and made  speeches.

They  all  thought  that our  education  policy  is

correct and that there is no bias. But I do not see

any  reason  why  the  Member for  Mountbatten  has

deliberately  attacked our education  policy.  This

means  an obstruction to the future of our country.

The  Member for Mountbatten does not understand the

state  of  our  country.  We  have  achieved  self-government.  We  have become bosses ourselves.  But

being  a boss is not an easy job. We must suffer  a

bit. We must pay for our own lands, municipal bills

and  so  on.  We have to work a bit longer,  a  bit

harder,  otherwise we will not be  able  to  become

bosses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past colonial government, the former

Minister for Education was incapable. He was unable

to give school admission to our children. They have

therefore  become over-aged. If  we  fail  to  give

accommodation to them, how can we face  the  people

of  Singapore?  And yet Members of  the  Opposition

still do not know about our responsibilities. It is

in this sense that we have to suffer and work a bit

harder.  These  over-age  students - where  are  they

going? The schools will not absorb them. They  have

to go astray. They have become loafers. This is the

result  of  the  past colonial government,  because

they overlooked the education policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our Minister for Education has made

arrangements  and  adjustments  and  he  wants  the

teachers to work a bit longer for the sake of these

over-age students, and for the sake of our country.

This is right and this must be done. If we look  at

our  society, we will be able to realise  why  many

parents have said that the education policy of  the

new  Government  is very good, because  we  do  not

allow  school children to go and play  outside  and

make themselves dirty. Our Government is doing this

for  the  benefit of the school children. This  has

been reported to me by many parents. Therefore,  we

have received the support of the students' parents.

This  is proof that our education policy is correct

and  without  bias. If there are teachers  who  are

against  this  policy,  then  they  are  not  those

teachers  who  dedicate themselves to the  teaching

profession,  and we will have to advise  them.  The

Member  for Mountbatten should withdraw  what  she

has said just now, because all of it is unfounded.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Kandasamy,  will  you please  permit  me  to  bring

forward some instances in history to prove that the

increase in the teachers' work and the cut in their

salaries   is   correct?  During   the   industrial

revolution in the United Kingdom, there  were  many

people who had to move to the city areas to find  a

means  of  livelihood  because,  as  a  result   of

industrialisation, many people became unemployed. I

do not mean to prove that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



industrialisation is correct or not correct, but to

say  that  there  are  always difficulties  in  the

transitional period. Similarly in Russia and China,

and  even in the United States of America and Great

Britain,  during  any transitional  period,  people

have  to suffer more or less. The P.A.P. Government

has  just got rid of colonial rule and the  people,

of  course,  have to suffer a little hardship.  The

Member  for  Mountbatten has all day long  in  this

House talked about the pay cuts and the increase in

the  working hours of the teachers. Being a teacher

myself,  I  can  understand that this  transitional

period  is  a  period of hardship and therefore  we

have to serve the society and work for the country.

We are educated and if we are reluctant to work for

the  society and for the country, it would be  very

undesirable.  Since we have become the  Government,

we  cannot stand aside and see the majority of  the

people suffer and a small minority enjoy happiness.

To  increase the working hours of the teachers  and

to cut a little bit of their pay is to increase the

happiness and the well-being of the majority of the

poor people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member for Mountbatten has said that some teachers have resigned. But we must

understand  the important point. All  the  teachers

who  have resigned belong to the minority and  some

are  selfish.  Since  the  P.A.P.  Government  took

office, some teachers have resigned. We can  divide

them into three categories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) During the reorganisation in the Ministry, we

made a study and inquiry into unqualified teachers.

They were afraid and so they quickly tendered their

resignations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Probably owing to the pay cuts and the

increase  of work, they were unwilling to  continue

with their work. This is selfish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Probably they were not selfish but they had

some  better  job or because they thought  that  if

they  remained  in  the service  of  the  Education

Ministry,  they  might earn less,  and  maybe  they

could  get  a  better  job  outside  the  education

service.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present our work is very difficult, and because

of  this  difficulty,  the people  have  to  suffer

hardship. But the Member for Mountbatten  has  just

now  made  certain calculations, saying that  in  a

week the teachers' working hours have increased  by

more   than   10  hours.  Now  I  will  make   some

calculations, The Primary school teacher is working

about  4  to 5 hours a day with a ½ hour  recess.

The  Government at present has decided to  increase

their  working hours to about 3 to 4 hours a  week,

roughly at the average of ½ hour a day. How  does

she get more than 10 hours in a week? I do not know

how  she  gets  that  figure  or  whether  she  has

calculated wrongly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the increase of work and pay cuts.

This  is  psychological selfishness. Just  now  she

touched  on  extra  mural activities,  duty  before

school and duty after school on Saturday, but these

are only excuses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a point which is unworthy of mention

here. That is the teachers have to correct exercise

books  or examination papers, filling report  cards

or  registration books, etc. Does she mean that the

Government has to employ an extra clerk to  do  all

this work for them?

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning school playgrounds, she alleged that

the  playgrounds are too small. It  is  quite  true

that  the  playgrounds in certain schools  are  not

adequate, but since those schools' playgrounds  are

adjacent  to  big  buildings, it is  impossible  to

expand  them.  It is not the fault of  the  present

Government. The previous Government was responsible

for  this. But in the case of the new schools which

are going to be set up, the school playgrounds will

be  quite sufficient. And hon. Members can come and

have  a  look when the new schools are  built  next

year.  The  Member for Mountbatten  says  education

does  not mean for the children only. She is right.

Education  is to educate everybody. The  Government

wants  to educate the teachers, and others citizens

to serve our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>



people  and our country. We start adult classes  in

the community centres in order to educate adults to

be  good  citizens.  We  have  also  started  Malay

classes, Chinese classes, Tamil classes and English

classes  and  recreation in  the  branches  of  the

P.A.P.  We  have  done our duty. Is  not  all  this

education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are educated people. To build

a  good society is not possible if we talk all  day

long  about money or salary. In England during  the

German attack, Winston Churchill asked everybody to

mobilise in order to defend the country. The people

in  England  were  very  willing  to  defend  their

country.  At  present we are not suffering  similar

hardships as they did in England, and we hope  that

we should not bargain over this small matter of pay

cuts.

subject. It has become an almost free-for-all,  and

although only half of the battery of the P.A.P. has

started,  we  can see most of the Members  opposite

have already run away.







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman</b>: I quite appreciate that this debate

is  becoming heated, but I do not think it is right

for a Member to say that a Member of the Opposition

or  a Member of this Assembly has run away. He must

withdraw that expression.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have been advised to say that

they have retreated from this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, of all that we have heard, I only want

to  make  a very small point, and that is that  the

Member for Mountbatten has very laboriously worked

out  her arithmetic, and we could see that she  was

comparing  herself or the teachers to workers.  The

teachers  have  always prided themselves  on  their

profession and on the nobility of their profession.

If  they  want  to  do  so,  then  they  must  work

according  to  the rules of the profession.  I  can

tell  you, Sir, how a doctor works. A doctor  works

at all hours of the night and day. There is no talk

of overtime.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to make another point: that the

teachers, knowing their full responsibility, should

now  condition themselves to a certain  reflex,  an

example  of  which has already been  given  by  the

Deputy   Prime   Minister.  They   must   condition

themselves to work a six-day week and an extra half-session whenever the school bell rings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman</b>: We have had a number of repetitions.

I do not know whether the Minister would like to -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Wind up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman</b>: No, I cannot ask the Minister to

wind up the debate. Perhaps the Minister would like

to  put  the  debate on a level keel.  But  if  the

Member for Mountbatten would like to step into  the

breach, she may do so.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I just wish

to  make  clear  a  few points.  The  Minister  for

Culture has prided on the imagination that goes  on

in   his   Department  when  arranging  for  public

concerts, but I am afraid this imagination seems to

have  groped  about  a little too  far.  I  do  not

understand.   I   did   not  say   anything   about

segregation.  I was not even suggesting  it.  As  a

matter   of  fact,  I  was  relating  my   personal

experience  to back the Minister for Education  and

to  prove that it was not segregation, but that  it

was something very necessary and unavoidable. But I

was  accused of accusing him for segregation, which

I  never  did.  I do not know what  made  the  hon.

Member  imagine  that I did. I  did  not!  And  the

Minister for Education can vouch for that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that I was said to have attacked

the  six-day week, and then could not  make  up  my

mind  and  finally said it was good. My remark  was

that  I hope Government will continue with the six-day week, but my suggestion was to reserve Saturday

for  extramural activities which the children would

otherwise  have to sacrifice if Saturday  continued

as  a  school day. And I gave examples of  lack  of

premises which I myself have experienced in  my  30

years  of  teaching. The schools I  have  been  in,

unfortunately, have had small



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



playgrounds. If some Members of the Government were

lucky to have schools with big playgrounds, well  I

did say that those schools were fortunate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this; the Member agreed with me

that  it is good for children to go to school on  a

Saturday,  otherwise they would be playing  in  the

drains. Yes. I did say that. But some parents would

be  most indignant if we suggested that every child

in  Singapore  plays in the drains,  and  therefore

must  be  a  rogue and should be kept in school  on

Saturdays.  That is not the idea. I  said  that  it

would be a blessing to bring only the children  who

would  otherwise be playing in drains to school  on

Saturdays. I said, let us make it optional -  extra-mural  activities for those who need them  and  for

those  who  will benefit by them. I did not  attack

the  principle of a six-day week. I made that  very

clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also pointed out that I said schools should

teach  pupils  to  buy better  food  or  do  better

cooking - I  did not quite catch this  point  as  the

speech   was   delivered  in   Mandarin   and   the

translation was not very clear. I said  nothing  of

the  sort.  Possibly  I  was misunderstood  or  the

interpretation was wrong. I do not remember when  I

said  that.  I  never said buy better  food  or  do

better  cooking or extra cooking or  anything  like

that!

better food and doing cooking.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody said if the family becomes good, surely

the  Government does not become good?  I  argue  it

does,   because  the  government  comes  from   our

families. If our families are all well brought  up,

the  Government will be a good government. Sir, the

whole  nation  is  made  up  of  little  units   of

families. So if we have good families, we will have

a good nation and a good nation brings forth a good

government. Good government has to come  from  good

families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My argument about stretching the working hours of

teachers was that maximum output stretched  over  a

longer    period    does    not    produce    extra

efficiency - that was my argument.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone said, "I had been to a Chinese school, and

I  had  been through a six-day week and it had  not

affected my brain." Of course, it has not.  I  said

the  same thing. I said that the extra hours should

not cause undue strain on the children. What I said

was  that Primary I students who were so new to the

school,  probably  because of the  newness  of  it,

might  feel  the strain. But I never said  that  it

would be a strain on the brains of the children. By

no means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I really want to make very

clear  is this. I did not advise the Government  to

teach  family planning in Primary I. I did not  say

that  as someone was accusing me of saying. What  I

was  doing was to give an extreme example of how  a

desired  atmosphere could be put into  a  textbook.

But I did not advise them to teach family planning.

Somebody   said,   "Supposing   they   come    with

embarrassing questions on family planning?"  I  did

not  mean family planning in that sense. Do not let

the  Press  get me wrong and say that I said  teach

family planning in Primary I. No.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone said that I had been talking about salary

cuts  the whole day. In my whole speech I  did  not

mention or touch upon salary cuts. That is where  I

said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



imagination  had  groped about. I did  not  mention

salary cuts and I was accused of that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody then said that all my accusations were

unfounded. I did not accuse anybody of anything  at

all  in my speech. I made a few suggestions  but  I

made no accusations against anybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about school functioning 3½ hours a day. They asked: How can the Member for

Mountbatten  increase it? I would like  to  read  a

circular from the Education Department.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>School curriculum</b></div>

<pre>

 "The  following will come into effect as from  the

beginning of the third term 1959.'



  And the summary of teaching hours was given:



   Primary V - 4½ hours a day, six days. 26½ hours.



   Primary V1 - 4½ hours a day, six days. 26½ hours.

</pre>

<br><br>That  was  what I quoted. And I put  in  the  extra

homework, corrections, etc. But the Members on  the

Government Bench said that teachers do 3½ hours a

day  when  the Education Department circular  asked

them to do 26½ hours a week. I think the Minister

for Education had better look into the schools that

are doing 3½ hours, if there are any.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I will not dwell at length on

the  debate.  I  will only make a short  speech.  A

moment   ago,  we  heard  very  many   and   varied

accusations - this  and  that - from  the  Member   for

Mountbatten,  that she did not oppose  the  six-day

week  principle. I know that she is not opposed  to

that.  I  have  often heard the teachers  say  that

working  six days a week is good, but it is  better

if  the salary is increased in the form of overtime

and so on. This is the position. There is the story

of  a man who is asked to work voluntarily. He says

it  is good to work voluntarily, but if he is  paid

it is even better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly the Member for Mountbatten said just now

that she did not disagree, but indirectly she meant

that   it  would  be  better  if  the  salary   was

increased.  On the whole, Mr Speaker, this  matter

emanated as a result of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



cutting out of the allowances, although the  Member

for  Mountbatten had repeatedly said that  she  did

not   mention  the  butting  out  of  the  variable

allowances.  On  the  whole, however,  the  subject

centred  around  the cutting out  of  the  variable

allowances. If additional allowances were given for

working six days a week, this matter would not have

arisen at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman</b>: Order. The Member for Mountbatten

made  it quite clear that she did not touch on  the

cutting of salary or the paying of allowances. I do

not think the Member should assume that that was in

her  mind.  Nobody can read what is in  a  person's

mind.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): However, on the

whole,  the theme is like a merry-go-round-it  goes

back  to  the  cutting of allowances. Teachers  are

leaders.  They are more powerful than the political

leaders  because the teachers lead the children  to

think like human beings and live like human beings.

When  I  was  at  school, I was  taught  this.  The

teachers  said, "We teachers are leaders,  to  lead

all  of  you  to  become  useful  citizens  in  the

future."  But  now  such  words  no  longer   exist

because,  firstly, their allowances have been  cut.

They have to work harder and six days a week. In my

opinion,  Mr  Speaker, there is  no  necessity  to

debate  this  question further. We should  remember

that  the  population of Singapore  is  increasing.

There  is  a  shortage  of  schools,  shortage   of

premises, and lack of funds to erect more schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Mr Speaker, I would like to say that

the  debate  which  has arisen has  centred  around

nothing  more  than  the cutting  of  the  variable

allowances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy

Prime  Minister made an unhappy comparison which  I

am  sure  is  not  the  official  attitude  of  the

Government towards teachers. He said that  teachers

were like dogs and horses-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And elephants!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> And elephants which could be

conditioned  to respond to lights and bells.  I  am

sure he did not mean what he said.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said further that the reason for the large

proportion of failures in the Government  secondary

entrance examination was due to the five-day  week.

Sir,  there  were quite a number of schools,  among

which I am glad to say mine was included, where the

proportion of passes was about two-thirds and these

schools were run on a five-day week. So that is not

the  relevant factor. I believe that basically what

we  need is an attitude towards the teachers  which

the   old-fashioned  Chinese  had - an  old-fashioned

practice  which  we hope will be  revived - that  the

teacher  is  like the head of a family. His  pupils

are  his children, and on that basis, we shall find

that  some  students need a five-day  week,  others

need  a five-and-a-half-day week, and others  again

will  need a six-day week. Once a student  has  got

the  habit  of studying, he studies on and  on.  No

matter how many days are imposed on a child, unless

he  has  a love for learning, a six-day week simply

means one day of additional torture. Whereas if  he

comes under the right teachers who are regarded  as

the  head of the family - you will find teachers  who

are  willing  to  teach, as  has  happened  already

before,  not  only five days, but unofficially  six

days, and part of the seventh day - he will not  mind

the  six-day week. So let us put it to the test  of

result  and  public reaction - whether  the  five-day

week will produce the best result or the five-and-a-half-day week, (I think the Chinese schools have  a

five-and-a-half-day week), or a  six-day  week.  So

let  us not be rigid. Let us be flexible and  open-minded, and judge by the result of this experiment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also feel that one mistake made before is

to  regard the school as a factory and the teachers

and  children  as so many pieces  of  wood,  to  be

transferred  about. I believe that has  produced  a

condition where the pupils do not regard the school

as  a home. Now and again there is a new head.  Now

and  again there is a new teacher. We cannot expect

a pupil to regard that school as a home where today

his  father is so and so, and after one  year,  his

father  changes:  He does not  get  a  home.  So  I

suggest  there is something good in the old  system

in Chinese schools and some aided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



schools   where  they  permanently   post   certain

teachers  and certain heads, and they regard  their

schools  as their homes. I think with that attitude

we  can  contribute  a great deal  towards  nation-building.  When we develop in pupils a  loyalty  to

the  school  to  the point where  they  can  regard

personal  advantage as being secondary to the  good

of  the school, it is quite easy from there to help

them to reach the point where loyalty to the nation

is  more important than loyalty to individual  self

or individual advantages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that in January there will be a

wholesale transfer of heads and teachers. Maybe  it

is  necessary,  but I hope that after  the  initial

mass transfer, gradually there will be stability in

the  staffing of schools, so that the students will

begin  to  identify the school as a  home  and  the

heads  and teachers as their foster fathers in  the

field of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another matter that I raised under the head of

Ministry  of  Finance. Now that  the  Minister  for

Education has definitely said that the principle of

equality will apply, we need not, therefore,  worry

about  scholarships  and bursaries  being  unfairly

allocated.  All will be treated in  the  same  way,

whether   the  students  are  from  aided  schools,

Government  schools,  Chinese,  English,  Malay  or

Tamil schools.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, to bring up a

point of correction, I have never at any moment  in

my  speech  earlier on compared teachers  to  dogs,

horses  or  elephants. I am quite  sure  the  House

remembers  very clearly what I said. Never  at  any

time  did  I  say  that  teachers  are  horses   or

elephants. What I did was to bring out an  analogy.

I  have explained to you, Mr Speaker, very clearly

the  processes of conditioning, and in my speech  I

gave  out  examples of how even  elephants  can  be

conditioned, so that even they do not grumble about

a six-day week.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a very

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan who is  perhaps  the

third person who makes the crowd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been criticised for introducing the six-day

week, and for requiring teachers to work harder for

less  pay. I should have thought that our  Minister

for  Finance's  Budget speech would have  impressed

Members  of the Opposition with the stark realities

of  the cost of education. But apparently they  are

incapable  of appreciating the full impact  of  his

remarks.  Even  in an empty room, Mr  Speaker,  if

there is a noise there will have been an echo.  But

I presume in the case of the Opposition, it is like

a  room  which is not only empty but a  vacuum  and

void, so that there is no sound nor echo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not a static population. On the contrary,

the population of Singapore increases annually at a

rate  higher  than  anywhere in the  world,  thanks

perhaps  to our efficient Ministry of Health.  This

single   feature   of  our  population   has   wide

ramifications   in  the  social,  educational   and

economic fields. I am for the moment concerned with

the educational and economic sectors. The story can

be told very simply in figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It means that each year some 56,000 to 60,000

children  of  school-going age want to be  admitted

into  our  schools.  The  annually  recurrent   and

special  expenditure  for  1960  amounts  to  $65.3

million,  which is almost one-fourth of  the  total

budget  for  1960. [I am glad that Members  of  the

Opposition are now increasing in number!]  Of  this

sum,  $53 million represents the salaries of 10,000

teachers in Government and aided schools and a  few

thousand  members of the staff. And this  is  after

the cut in the variable allowances in July 1959.  1

think it would be very interesting, Mr Speaker, to

disclose  at  this stage that the cut  in  variable

allowances has affected 7,243 out of the 9,832



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



teachers,  and that the savings for the  last  half

year  of  1959  amounted to $3.3  million,  or  the

equivalent of $6.6 million for a full year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the 1957 census figures, those

working in the education service amounted to 12,000

people,  which is equivalent to less than  one  per

cent  of  the population of Singapore's one  and  a

half  million people. Therefore, simple  arithmetic

will  show  that  less than one  per  cent  of  the

population  of  Singapore  is  in  receipt  of  $53

million  or  20 per cent of the revenue alone.  Can

this  expenditure  go  on increasing  with  half  a

million  or one-third of our population illiterate?

I  say  to the teachers: that one per cent  of  the

population receiving 20 per cent of the revenue  of

the  country  should prove that they are  not  only

worth  20  times but one hundred times more,  as  a

contribution  to  the country,  now  that  we  have

Merdeka, now that we want to build a nation. It  is

clear  that  the  resources  of  the  Ministry   of

Education must be expanded to cope with our growing

school  population,  but it is equally  clear  that

economies  must be effected in all directions.  The

cost of new buildings will be carefully watched and

cut down to the bone. Economies to the salaries  of

civil  servants  which are of  general  application

have  brought  down  the cost of administration  in

this Ministry. But something more has to be done if

these   economies  are  not  to  be  nullified   by

increases to the numbers of teachers to be employed

in  our  schools. We are going to appoint at  least

770  new  people  for  the education  service.  The

solution  lies  in  requiring teachers  to  put  in

additional  hours of teaching. These measures  have

been introduced with the greatest reluctance on  my

part,  for I can find no other alternative solution

to  this  problem of mounting costs to provide  the

education  which  our  children  have  a  right  to

expect. We have inherited four streams of education

which  are at different stages of development,  and

it  is our aim to bring about integration, as  soon

as  possible.  Parents  have  complete  freedom  of

choice over the media of instruction in which their

children are to be taught. The two common languages

in  all  streams  will be Malay  and  English.  Our

readers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



and textbooks in all media must be truly Malayan in

content  and  context.  All communal  barriers  are

being   torn  down.  All  organisations  of  school

children and sports meetings run on communal  lines

have  been abolished. A very successful display  of

6,000  school  pupils from all  streams  for  Malam

Raksaksa  Ra'ayat on Tuesday, 8th  December,  bears

testimony  to the new spirit of this Government.  A

bigger  and  better  show  will  be  organised  for

National Day on June 3rd next year. In future,  our

children  will  meet in friendly competition  which

will  cut across communal feelings and differences.

To  remove any difficulties that might stand in the

way  of  the full integration of our young  people,

this  Government has intensified its drive to  make

the  idea of a national language a reality. A crash

programme  of  instruction of our teachers  in  the

Malay  language  is in full swing in  the  Teachers

Training College, and it is hoped that by  the  end

of  1961,  we  shall have more than 3.000  teachers

qualified  to  teach the national language  in  our

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish now to enlarge on certain provisions in the 1960 Estimates

not dwelt upon by the Members of the

Opposition.  This  is perhaps the most  appropriate

time to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with our declared aim to popularise

Malay  as  the  national language of this  country,

naturally  we  shall recruit more  Malay  teachers.

This  we  are  doing  for  1960.  Of  the  770  new

appointments  for the Ministry of  Education,  one-third, or 252, will be Malay teachers, made  up  of

50 trained teachers and 202 probationary teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we shall raise the Malay stream from

the  present primary level to secondary level,  and

thereafter  to university level. As  a  first  step

towards  the setting up of Malay secondary  schoo1s

in  1961, teaching at secondary level in Malay will

begin next month at the Kallang Secondary School.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides an increased provision of $8,400 for

Malays   in  respect  of  Island  scholarships   as

compared  with  $3,000 for 1959,  and  $18,000  for

Malays attending English Secondary schools. I  wish

to draw the attention of the House to the fact that

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



Government recognises the special position  of  the

Malays by making a special provision of $15,000 for

the higher education of Malays in the University of

Malaya  for  1960.  These bursaries  will  be  made

available  to  those  who have recently  taken  the

Higher  School  Certificate  Examination  and  gain

admission to the University next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish now to draw attention to the provision of

$50,000  under  sub-head 56 for  the  provision  of

bursaries  to students in the Polytechnic  and  for

technical  and  vocational education.  This  is  to

indicate Government's genuine earnestness to ensure

that  deserving  students should not  be  prevented

from  pursuing their studies in technical  subjects

because of lack of finance. This is in addition  to

an  item for scholarships already provided  for  in

previous  years.  Then there is sub-head  54  which

shows  a 50 per cent increase in the provision  for

Nanyang University students at $600,000 as compared

with $400,000 for 1959. It should be added that the

increased  provision will enable the Government  to

offer   some  scholarships  to  Nanyang  University

graduates to undergo further studies either in  the

University of Malaya or universities abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish to touch upon capitation grants now

paid by Government to aided schools which involve a

sum  of  more than $1 million per annum. This,  Mr

Speaker,  falls within various sub-heads  known  as

Grants-in-aid   under  O.C.A.R. totalling   $26.9

million. The existing rates are 50 cents per  pupil

per  month  for primary schools, and 75  cents  per

pupil per month for secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Grants-in-Aid Regulations, 1957,

capitation  grants may be used to cover  contingent

expenditure  for, I quote, "apparatus,  stationery,

City  Council charges, telephone charges,  auditing

fees", etc. Since auditing fees have been included,

I  regret  to  say that certain aided schools  have

failed  to  submit their audited  accounts  to  the

Ministry of Education as far back as 1957.  I  have

here a list of aided schools which are very much behind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



in  their  submission of their  accounts.  34

schools  have not rendered their 1957 accounts,  33

being  Chinese  and one Tamil: 37 schools  for  the

1958  accounts, 36 Chinese and one Tamil. I  regret

to  state  that if these audited accounts  are  not

received by the, Ministry of Education by  the  end

of  this month, they will not be able to get  their

capitation grants for 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I wish to state that the 1959

audited  accounts  should  be  submitted   to   the

Ministry not later than 30th June, 1960, and so  on

thereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $65,338,120 for Head 47 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman</b>: Perhaps the Minister for Finance

will check me if I go wrong - the remaining heads  of

19,  20, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 39, 41  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the sums stated for those heads as

of 1959", put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution to be reported.
