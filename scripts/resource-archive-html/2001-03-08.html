<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Main and Development Estimates of

Expenditure  of Singapore for the financial year  1st  April,

2001 to 31st March, 2002, contained in Paper Cmd. 3 of 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For convenience, I shall take the totals for each head

of  expenditure in the Main and Development Estimates as they

appear  in  the  last columns of the schedules  of  estimated

expenditure under the Main and Development Estimates  Outlays

for  FY  2001/2002  on  pages 24 and 25 respectively  of  the

Command Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the "guillotine" times for heads of expenditure,

which I have fixed under Standing Order 89(7)(a), I have also

allotted  the  time for discussion of each amendment  in  the

Estimates.   The time allotted for a discussion includes  the

replies  from the front bench.  I shall announce these  times

as we go along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noted that in previous years, several Members who

have  asked  to  raise  matters  pertaining  to  details   of

expenditure  did not get the opportunity to  speak.   I  have

therefore  allotted more time this year to Members  who  have

filed $10 'cuts'.  This of course comes at the expense of the

time  allotted  to  the $100 'cuts'.  Hon. Members  who  have

therefore not heeded my appeal and insisted that their  query

on details of expenditure is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>

major  policy  issue may well find that they  are  unable  to

raise their matter because of the shortage of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully this will endear Hon. Members to raise their

matters in the appropriate category in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the sitting time of the Committee of Supply

for  each day of sitting being extended to 6.45 pm,  time  is

unfortunately  not  a  luxury  we  have  to  pander  to  long

discourses.   With  484 amendments to deal  with  this  year,

Members will once again not have the time they have requested

for.  Other Members who would like to join in the debate on a

particular amendment will be allowed to do so only  if  there

is sufficient time left on an amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure in

respect  of  which  amendments  stand  on  the  Order   Paper

Supplement.

Amendment No. (1), we have a total of 135 minutes.  Mr  Leong

Horn Kee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I shall take

your  point that we should make our speeches short and sharp.

Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go into speaking on my cut on the impact

of  regional  developments, I am compelled to  actually  make

some  remarks  on some reports made in the press  today.   In

particular, I would like to refer you, Sir, to the commentary

by  a  certain reporter that yesterday there was so much time

but  so few questions.  In fact, the reporter went on to  say

that  with  the  Budget debate on, there had  been  only  two

queries  for  oral answers each day and not by  elected  MPs.

That did not sound very fair.  She went on to say that we had

extended Question Time by half an hour purposely to give more

time for Q&A and why the MPs, especially elected MPs, did not

use the time to ask questions.  And she said that rather than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>

elected MPs, Nominated MPs and NCMP had used the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that this is unfair because it shows she

has  no clear understanding of our parliamentary process.   I

am  also  disappointed that this particular reporter actually

had  spent  many years in the Gallery, looking at  us  making

speeches,  and  should know the procedures of the  Government

and  parliamentary process here.  In fact, Question  Time  is

only  used  during  normal Parliament sittings.   During  the

Committee  of  Supply, MPs actually spend their  time  asking

many detailed questions.  The fact that we have extended  the

sittings  to  61/4  hours  every day  is  testimony  that  we

actually  spend a lot of time asking questions.  As you  have

said,  Sir, there are a total of 484 amendments being  filed,

and  each  amendment  can  be a multiplicity  of  many  other

questions  in  those topics.  So we could easily  have  asked

thousands of questions within these few days of sittings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporter also asked why the number of speakers also

went  down and it seems to be a very important fact, from  25

to  13  yesterday.  This again shows that she  has  no  clear

understanding  of  our process.  MPs speak according  to  the

time  that they feel they should make clear and good  points,

not  by the length of time they speak.  On the final day,  we

need  to  give  the  Minister time for him  to  give  a  very

detailed  reply.  Therefore, more time is spent and given  on

the first day for MPs to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a final remark. In a sense, I am disappointed

that  somehow  the recent press coverage of our parliamentary

process  seems  to be taking a line on focusing  on  the  MPs

themselves,  instead of the issues and topics for discussion.

It  seems to also lack, in my own words, in-depth analysis of

our  process.  We should actually look at issues being raised

and  how the Minister answers them, rather than say which  MP

asks  which particular question, how many times he  has  been

featured in the coverage, and, in their points, counting  the

number  of  times the MP has been mentioned.  These  are  not

very fair assessments of an MP's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>

performance because he has worked on the ground.  Even if the

MP  spends  little  time, he makes quality  comments  in  the

debate.   I  think, on the other hand, the press should  also

take  note  of  what they are doing, and  not  focus  on  MPs

themselves, but on the topics we are discussing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I go on the topic of the first cut which is the

impact of regional developments.  Sir, the Economic Survey of

Singapore 2000 reported that Singapore's trade with  Malaysia

surged  by  37%  in Year 2000.  For the first time,  Malaysia

overtook  the  USA as the top trading partner  of  Singapore.

Our trade with Malaysia amounted to S$82.6 billion, nearly 9%

higher  than  the  total trade of S$75.9  billion  with  USA.

Similarly, although we do not publish our trade figures  with

Indonesia,  it  is understood that our trade  with  Indonesia

used to be very substantial.  I do not know whether the trade

volume  with  Indonesia has dropped since the  political  and

financial turmoil in that country, but I would think that the

trade volume should remain significant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, we have to accept that any adverse

political  or  economic  developments in  these  neighbouring

countries will have an impact on Singapore.  In fact, DPM  BG

Lee  Hsien  Loong has recently said that this is one  of  the

most difficult and uncertain times in this region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp rise in the bilateral trade with Malaysia was

due  to  a  few factors.  One was the increase in Singapore's

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Malaysia.  The second  was

the  upturn in the global electronics market which led  to  a

more  re-export  of  electronic parts and components  between

Singapore and Malaysia; and the third reason was the increase

in  oil  exports.   This  growth of bilateral  trade  between

Singapore   and  Malaysia  clearly  demonstrates  the   close

intertwining of the two economies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the regional crisis, Singapore was pushing for

the Growth Triangle and for the promotion of the location  of

manufacturing facilities by Singapore based

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>

companies and MNCs to the neighbouring countries and regions,

like  Batam and Bintan.  Therefore, similarly, we  also  have

close ties with our other neighbour, Indonesia.  Hence, I  am

concerned   about  the  economic  and  political  events   in

Indonesia and Malaysia.  The Minister for Trade and  Industry

recently  visited Indonesia, and he also must  have  been  in

close touch with the developments in Malaysia.  Therefore,  I

would very much appreciate to hear from the Minister what are

his  views  on the possible scenarios unfolding in  Indonesia

and  Malaysia.  If there were to be adverse developments, how

could   Singapore  cushion  ourselves  against  the  negative

impact?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I move on to my second cut? On Free Trade

Agreements, while maintaining close ties with our neighbours,

Singapore  has embarked on a bold initiative to leapfrog  the

region  by establishing closer trade and investment  linkages

with  the stable developed economies further away.   This  is

achieved   by  signing  Free  Trade  Agreements  with   other

countries outside ASEAN.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has inked an FTA with New Zealand, and is in

discussion  with  USA, Australia, Canada, Mexico,  Japan  and

Chile on FTAs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These FTAs will bring about substantial benefits. For

example, if we can sign an FTA with the USA, it would attract

more  foreign  investments from MNCs eyeing  the  US  market.

This  benefit is clearly seen in Mexico, which  has  a  North

American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) with the USA and Canada.  It

was  reported in the Business Week magazine, in its 5th March

issue, that with the widened horizons, Singapore's FTAs could

bring the following advantages:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Reduce the nation's reliance on its neighbours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Lower tariffs and attract foreign manufacturers to

Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Spur our neighbours to get back on the free-trade

track.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Help boost global confidence in the rest of the

region in Southeast Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these meaningful and real benefits, I was indeed

surprised  to read in recent press reports that  top  leaders

from   both  Malaysia  and  Indonesia  were  concerned  about

Singapore's  unilateral free trade agreements with  non-ASEAN

members.   For  example,  Indonesian  President,  Abdurrahman

Wahid, was reported to have said that he wanted Singapore  to

help  first  restore Indonesia's economy, and not search  for

new trade partners far afield.  The Malaysian Prime Minister,

Dr  Mahathir,  was reported to have remarked that  such  FTAs

were a "worrisome" development affecting the ASEAN Free Trade

Area (AFTA).  He was bothered by the non-ASEAN countries that

may  use  the FTAs as a "backdoor" to enter AFTA, by shipping

partly  completed products into Singapore and  complete  them

here  so  that  these products can be regarded as  Singapore-made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am rather baffled by these contrasting comments

of  the  Business  Week magazine, analysing the  benefits  of

Singapore's FTAs with the surrounding countries in the  other

parts of the world, against the resentments expressed by  the

two  closest neighbours.  Perhaps, the Minister for Trade and

Industry could enlighten this House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, we have been informed

by  the  Minister  for Trade and Industry that  Singapore  is

negotiating  free  trade  agreements with  Australia,  Japan,

Mexico and the United States, with the aim of concluding them

by  the end of the year.  We have also been informed that  we

are  also  in exploratory talks with Canada and the  European

Free Trade Area.  Our first bilateral FTA was signed with New

Zealand in 1999.  These are important developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking as Chairman of the Government Parliamentary

Committee for Manpower, and a union official, I support

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>

the  Government's  move to establish free  trade  with  like-minded  countries, because the FTAs can help expand bilateral

trade with and two-way investments in these countries.   This

means there could potentially be more economic activities and

more  jobs  in  our  country,  as  well  as  in  our  partner

countries.  There may not be equal benefits for two countries

involved  in the bilateral FTAs, but there could  be  overall

benefits  for the ordinary people, as well as for businesses,

as  there would be more and, hopefully, better jobs and  more

businesses.  We must make sure that the agreements would have

sufficient safeguards for the workers, businesses, as well as

for the states.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although FTAs should not be an alternative to

multilateral  trade  agreements,  they  could  prove  to   be

decisive   in   fostering   moves   towards   global    trade

liberalisation  under  the WTO.  So,  the  FTA  is  a  useful

measure  to  take  before  there  is  a  multilateral   trade

agreement later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free trade agreements will not only serve to better

economic  conditions for workers and businesses in Singapore,

but  also  bring  greater  international  interest  into  the

markets  in Southeast Asia.  Being a business hub, I am  sure

Singapore  would be able to attract investments and companies

to  come  to Singapore and look at the business opportunities

in  Southeast  Asia.   To  give  an  example,  without  clear

benefits  to itself and to the region in which it is located,

I  am sure Mexico would have little interest to negotiate the

FTA with us.  In fact, Mexico, which is already a part of the

North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), would not  have

concluded  or  negotiated FTAs with so many Latin  and  South

American countries like Brazil, Uruguay and Peru, as well  as

with  the  European Union and Israel.  In  fact,  Mexico  has

already  started  discussions with Japan,  which  is  another

country with whom we are negotiating an FTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are those within our own region which fear that

our pursuit of bilateral free trade agreements could lead  to

massive  inflows,  into  ASEAN, of non-ASEAN  products,  thus

abusing the terms and conditions of AFTA, and diluting the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>

benefits that ASEAN will gain from the full implementation of

AFTA.  Ironically, we have similar voices outside ASEAN  that

are  full  of  concern that competitively-priced ASEAN  goods

will   flood   their  domestic  markets  through   Singapore,

jeopardising their own local industries.  We have heard  this

argument from some quarters in New Zealand before we signed a

bilateral trade agreement with Wellington.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there seems to be a need for us to explain to our

ASEAN   neighbours  about  our  pursuit  of  bilateral  FTAs,

particularly to Malaysia and Indonesia, which have  expressed

concern  over the possibility of Singapore being  used  as  a

backdoor  to  gain entry into the AFTA region.  In  my  view,

this is a very short-term view of the issues at hand.  In the

long  term, bilateral free trade agreements could  act  as  a

stimulus  for  an  increase of trade and  investment  in  the

region.   Moreover,  it  can also accelerate  and  strengthen

multilateral trade agreements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise to

talk  about  the  same  issue  -  the  bilateral  free  trade

initiatives taken by Singapore - and as to how we should look

at the picture in toto and encourage our neighbours to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage the Minister to consistently promote

the  idea that these bilateral free trade initiatives  really

are  a  response to the stall in the World Trade Organisation

negotiations,  and a kind of competitive reinsurance  against

the  free trade initiatives happening in the Americas and  in

Europe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, there have been limits to what the ASEAN Free

Trade  Area  has done, and these have not been on Singapore's

part,  but those of our neighbours.  But our goal must be  to

reassure  our neighbours and bring them along, and,  in  this

sense,  I  would actually disagree with the hon.  Member,  Mr

Leong  Horn  Kee,  that  we should not  be  leapfrogging  the

region.  Rather, we might want to bring the region along with

us; we are not leaving any one behind.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this sense, I am encouraging the Minister's

policy  to  be  one  of  reconfirming  our  priority  to  the

multilateral  framework,  even as  we  pursue  our  bilateral

initiatives.  We should help our neighbours to understand how

we see these connections, the links, from the bilateral level

to  the  regional  level,  to the international  level,  and,

therefore,  pay  due attention to both the levels  below  and

above us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, I would like to ask the Minister to

reassure this House and our neighbours that we would be  WTO-consistent in our approach, paying heed to Article 24 of  the

GATT, and that we will try to be inventive in seeking out new

areas which WTO, as yet, does not encompass, and that we will

also  try to egg on a faster pace of liberalisation, to build

up momentum for the WTO round.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, too, was disturbed by reactions by our neighbours

regarding the possibility of a backdoor, but my understanding

is that we will negotiate rules of origin.  In the ASEAN Free

Trade  Agreement (AFTA), it is 40% of local manufacture.   In

this sense, I would ask the Minister to confirm that this  is

the agreed front door.  There is no backdoor entrance in this

sense, to AFTA.  We should not let any possible envy slow  us

down,  Sir.  But we should pause to help clear up any genuine

doubts  or misunderstandings and, if our neighbours need  our

help, we should increase our assistance to them, to help them

adjust  to  AFTA  and  to the WTO.  For  those  who  are  not

members,  such  as  Vietnam,  we  should  encourage  them  to

understand and cooperate with them, to help them prepare  for

WTO accession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, Sir, I am asking our policy to be one of

training  and dialogue, not just among governments, but  also

the  academics  and think-tanks, so that our  neighbours  can

take  part  with  us in moving the region  and,  indeed,  the

world, forward for more free trade.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, can I make a point of

clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, with your indulgence, I need to

explain  the  point  that, perhaps, Mr  Simon  Tay  has  been

mistaken as to what I have said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not mean to say that Singapore should ignore the

surrounding  region  and reach out to the  countries  further

afield.   If  he heard my speech more carefully,  I  actually

said  that we should maintain close ties with our neighbours.

Of  course, I used the word "leapfrog", to reach out  to  the

other  countries  further  away.  In  the  process,  it  will

actually  also  bring benefits back to this  region.   I  did

mention that it would spur our neighbours to be back  on  the

free trade track and also help to boost global confidence  in

this region.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, hitherto, the

role  of each business and trade body has been a logical  and

useful extension of businesses or companies belonging to  the

same   industry.   Many  such  interest  groups   have   been

instrumental  in furthering the collective goals,  frequently

along industry lines, such as organising trade delegations or

representation of needs to the Government.  For example,  the

Singapore  Hotel  Association or the  Retailers'  Association

will  facilitate networking amongst members, conduct research

and  surveys, and facilitate the implementation of Government

schemes to help players better position themselves.  Not  too

dissimilar  in intent is the Association of Small and  Medium

Enterprises  or ASME, which looks after the needs  of  member

companies across different industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This network and clustering of interests has generally

worked  well but will increasingly prove inadequate  for  the

globalised  nature of the marketplace and, hence, competition

that Singapore-based businesses now face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of all market players should no longer be a

Singapore-centric, but a global marketplace instead,  and  be

where market forces are pulling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, in making the transition to a knowledge-based economy, the interests of most, if not all, industries

are likely to revolve around the theme of exporting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>

brainpower and software-type services of a Singapore origin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, for related industries, for which there is

increasingly  more  overlap  or  convergence,  a  pooling  of

interests will make a lot of sense, eg, between logistics and

transportation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiative to integrate and pool these interests

under an umbrella body is, therefore, fitting.  However, care

must  be taken to ensure that the right leadership and vision

must be in place to balance the wide range of interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister, within this framework,

what  role  would  the  Government play  and  how  would  the

Government  help  ensure that both Singapore's  larger  macro

goals  and  the  needs  of  member companies  are  met.   For

example, what sort of role can such an umbrella body play  in

the  pursuit  of  free  trade  agreements  with  the  various

countries?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, on the formation of the

Singapore  Business  Federation,  early  this  year,  it  was

reported that the Minister for Trade and Industry, BG  George

Yeo,  said  that he would be moving a Bill to  recognise  the

Singapore  Business  Federation  as  the  new  apex  business

federation in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea was that the local business sector needed a

strong  apex  organisation, like the Keidanren of  Japan,  to

improve   its   representative  prowess,  both  locally   and

overseas.   The Singapore Federation of Chambers of  Commerce

is  reorganising  itself into the SBF, and  a  search  for  a

suitable CEO for this new body is ongoing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the

status  of this proposed SBF.  When would the Bill  be  ready

for  tabling  in Parliament?  Could the Minister  give  us  a

preview  of  the  main elements of the Bill?   What  are  the

features that would ensure that the SBF would have the image,

clout  and  means  to be developed as an  equivalent  to  the

Japanese  Keidanren.   One way is  to  ensure  that  our  top

businessmen  can be persuaded to serve on the board  of  this

SBF, and another is to ensure that we can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>

identify a very capable and well-respected person to  be  the

CEO.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do have a concern with the SBF, which is that

if  the  concept is to have a law that empowers  the  SBF  to

require  all  companies operating in Singapore  with  paid-up

capital  of more than $0.5 million to be members,  then  this

may  create  a  lot  of resentment by the smaller  companies,

especially  if they have to pay subscription by  law.   Among

the  18,800  Singapore  registered companies  which  will  be

forced  to  join,  the  majority will  be  small  and  medium

enterprises.  They may not want to join because they may feel

that  the  SBF will speak only for the large firms and  their

interests  will not be represented.  Hence, to be successful,

I  feel  that the framework of the SBF has to create  avenues

whereby the different firms from different groupings  and  of

different  sizes  can find their views and  interests  voiced

adequately through this apex body.  The Minister may wish  to

comment on these concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to my next cut on entrepreneurship. Singapore

has  been  ranked the world's most globalised  country  in  a

recent  survey  done  by  the respected  US  magazine  called

"Foreign  Policy"  of 50 countries around  the  world.   This

Globalisation  Index  was  created  by  the  Foreign   Policy

magazine  and  renowned US consulting firm, AT Kearney.   The

report  said that "Tiny Singapore clearly stands out  as  the

world's  most  global  country and it far  out-distances  its

nearest   rivals,   which   are  the   Netherlands,   Sweden,

Switzerland  and  Finland which are  in  the  second,  third,

fourth and fifth places respectively."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am actually very intrigued by this celebrated ranking

of Singapore as the world's most globalised country by a very

respectable  agency.   No doubt, the  assessment  is  correct

based  on  the criteria like cross border flows of goods  and

services, capital, people and communications.  If  we  are  a

top  globalised  country,  then  where  are  our  top  global

companies?  In sharp contrast with the hugely successful  and

well regarded global

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>

companies  like  Shell, Ericsson, Swiss Bank Corporation  and

Nokia,  which are companies and products of the lesser ranked

companies,  then  where are the world-class  companies  home-grown from Singapore which can match our exalted status as  a

globalised  economy?  Save for Singapore Airlines,  I  cannot

think of any other local companies that can truly be said  to

have  a  global business presence equal to that of  Shell  or

Nokia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do feel that enough has been done by the Government in

recent   years   in   terms  of  creating  a   pro-enterprise

environment, such as a low tax regime, stock option  schemes,

access  to  venture  capital funds and a  conducive  business

climate.  However, what is still lacking is the insufficiency

of   the  main  ingredient,  which  is  the  people  or   the

entrepreneurs.   Having done so much  by  the  Government,  I

actually  wonder why we constantly lament at  the  dearth  of

entrepreneurs in Singapore.  Some people rationalise that the

reason  could  be that Singapore is a small economy.   But  I

feel  that this excuse of small size is not a good excuse  to

make.   Let  us  take the example of Nokia.   Nokia  is  from

Finland  which  has  an  economy and  population  similar  to

Singapore.  Yet Nokia is a world-class company that  grew  by

seizing  the opportunity of the world telecommunication  boom

in recent years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would suggest that the Minister may consider

seriously two other factors that may affect the growth of our

entrepreneurship environment in Singapore and the  number  of

entrepreneurs that we can nurture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is the effect of the crowding out of the private

sector by the Government-linked companies (GLCs).  Second  is

the  deprivation of a pool of the brighter and talented young

people to join the private enterprises, as the Government and

the  GLCs and the statutory boards have been giving out large

numbers  of  scholarships  to  capture  our  brightest  young

students  and bond them to work in the Government service  or

in GLCs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these are valid reasons, I would like to ask the

Minister whether the Government should consider hastening the

process  of divestment of the GLCs and liberalise the concept

of  imposition of bonds on our students.  Perhaps, it is time

for us to take a more enlightened approach on bonds.  I would

like  to  suggest  that for some of these  bonds,  we  should

require  our  scholarship students to return to Singapore  to

work  as the only requirement for bondage, rather than to  be

bonded to a particular company in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister concur with this evaluation? Let us

hear  his  comments.  However, not having enough  world-class

companies  now  does  not mean that we should  not  start  to

cultivate and nurture promising local companies to grow  into

world-class   ones.   The  process  would   take   time   and

substantial effort.  For a start, we need to create a  larger

pool  of entrepreneurs running sizeable companies. They  must

be  prepared  to take risks and venture out.   They  must  be

tolerant  to  failures and we must create an  environment  of

enterprise, with ample rewards for those who succeed.   Local

companies should be encouraged to merge so as to create  bulk

and compete more effectively against foreign enterprises.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, in the Budget

debate  a  few days ago, I spoke about the need to strengthen

the  entrepreneurship drive in Singapore because of the  drop

of  confidence among entrepreneurs and investors.  While  the

many  companies  started  by many  young  entrepreneurs  have

failed  in the past one year or so, there are many  more  who

are  willing  to try, but the environment has  changed  quite

drastically  to  one of conservatism and, therefore,  to  one

that  is  quite detrimental towards our efforts to  promoting

entrepreneurship. The trend that I have seen recently is that

this time, we are seeing not just the young Singaporeans  who

are  trying their hand at being entrepreneurs, but also  many

more  experienced and older Singaporeans who have many  years

of  working  experience and domain knowledge who are  leading

the charge in the next wave of start-ups.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>

These  "gray-haired" entrepreneurs, as I  call  them,  in  my

opinion, have a much higher chance to succeed as they partner

with  the  younger people who bring technology to the  table.

It  is  a very encouraging sign and we should support it.   I

have the following issues to raise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, when NSTB launched the US$1 billion fund which

was  used to co-invest mainly with foreign VCs, there  was  a

requirement  that only about 30% of the fund was required  to

be  invested  locally.  Many foreign VCs therefore  took  the

advantage  of  this  scheme and used the  funds  for  foreign

projects and investments.  I therefore suggest that, first of

all,  we  should tighten the 30% requirement so that more  of

the  funds  must be invested locally.  We should require  the

VCs  which benefited from the funding to invest the  majority

of  their  funds in Singapore projects.  Secondly, allow  the

funds to be invested not just in high-tech, but also low-tech

projects,  as long as we promote entrepreneurship.   What  we

really want is to develop the entrepreneurship culture and it

does  not matter what the content is. Thirdly, there is  talk

about  the next $1 billion that the Government is willing  to

put aside and I suggest that we should do it differently this

time   by   giving  the  fund  to  local  entrepreneurs   and

businessmen  to  manage  the funds  directly  as  a  national

service.   I  am  confident we have many  capable  people  in

Singapore who will be willing to do this service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the Budget debate, I also spoke about the

sudden tightening of the funding situation.   While we cannot

force  banks  or VCs to fund start-ups, we should  set  up  a

Lifeline Fund to help promising companies that are in trouble

because  of  the  over  conservatism  environment  after  the

dot.com  bust.  We  risk  losing good  companies  and  people

because  they lack funding.  The Technopreneurship 21 Private

Sector Committee suggested this sometime last year and I hope

the  Minister  will  seriously consider  this  request.   The

proposal is as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to set aside $20-$30 million to fund 50 to 60

companies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this fund can be jointly administered with a

private  sector  entity, for example, the T21 Private  Sector

Committee or any other private entity, that Government  wants

to identify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, use this money to co-invest with private sector

funds  or  individuals so that we can lighten the  burden  of

those who try to save these companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, this needs to be administered quickly and

speed  is  very  important  because  there  are  still   many

companies  at  the  brink  of  collapse   and  therefore  the

criteria requirements for investment need to be simple.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, the Lifeline Fund can take a reasonable equity

in  lieu  of  the  life-saving investment.  Even  if  only  a

handful of companies make it, I am confident that the $20-$30

million  will  be  multiplied many more times  and  ensure  a

generous return for the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the goodwill created by the Government will go

a  long  way  in improving the environment and in encouraging

others to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently heard about the Prince Charles Fund in the

United Kingdom, where the prince set aside a certain fund  to

invest  in  projects and start-ups which failed to  find  any

interested  investors or VCs.  The main  criterion  for  this

fund is that the person or persons seeking the fund from  the

Prince Charles Fund must truly have exhausted all channels of

funding before the fund is disbursed to them. We might  think

that  this is a kind of charity and is doomed to go bankrupt.

But  from what I understand, the fund is actually growing and

has  an  annual  Internal Rate of Return of about  15%.   The

principle is the same for the Lifeline Fund.  All we need are

some winners for handsome returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should aggressively privatise the NSTB, EDB and

PSB   roles  that  duplicate  the  private  sector  type   of

activities.  In fact, all of these agencies, over the  years,

have  taken  on activities that just duplicate  many  private

sector activities, for example, funding, consulting, training

and so on.  We should consider forming consortiums

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>

consisting  of  private sector players who  can  manage  such

activities rather than just corporatise these entities  which

I think is the current Government's immediate plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to resolve the serious problems seen by the

neighbourhood  HDB businesses is to allow the HDB  shophouses

to   be   used   for  technology  start-ups  in   the   info-communications, light and non-polluting type  of  industries.

This will make the neighbourhood more vibrant.  It will allow

good  use of the HDB shophouses and for the current shophouse

owners  to  exit their businesses by leasing or  selling  the

shop  to  start-up companies.  It immediately  increases  the

availability   of  commercial  and  industrial   space   and,

therefore, this will reduce costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point I want to make on entrepreneurship is

the  Buona Vista Science  Hub.  From what I understand, there

are  plans  for  JTC  to create the Silicon  Valley  type  of

environment.   I  do not see how JTC can manage  two  systems

under  the  same  management.  I therefore suggest  that  JTC

leases  the  Hub  to a truly private sector  organisation  to

manage  it  and leave them to create that kind of environment

that we want to create.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have also been problems seen by many talented

people  that  we  want to bring into Singapore,  in  bringing

their   families   down   here.   The   current   immigration

regulations  are  still  restrictive  especially  for  family

members  and  I  hope that the Minister  can  work  with  the

Ministry of Manpower to make this easier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point on entrepreneurship is the 60-plus

incentive schemes that the Minister for Finance talked  about

recently.  The current issue is that these are just too  many

and  too confusing, especially for start-ups as well  as  for

the  smaller  companies to comprehend and to  get  around  to

apply this incentive successfully.  Many of them just give up

applying and are therefore unable to benefit from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>

this  scheme.   I  suggest that we take  the  opportunity  to

rationalise  this  to  just a few  schemes  that  are  easily

manageable, easily understandable by everyone and that can be

more  effective  in  trying to promote  entrepreneurship  and

start-ups in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, with the collapse of the dot-com phenomenon in the US, we are seeing more and more dot-com

or  e-commerce companies collapsing and falling by  the  way-side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is equally affected by this dot-com downturn.

However,  from  my contacts with the e-commerce  or  Internet

community,  I  feel that there are some fairly good  start-up

companies with good management and sound product ideas  which

would  be  worthwhile to rescue.  However, due to a  lack  of

funding  which  dried  up suddenly, these  potentially  sound

companies  can  be  starved of funding  and  could  therefore

finally collapse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like my GPC colleague, Mr Inderjit Singh, I feel that

the  Government  can establish a Start-up  Lifeline  Fund  to

assist  these  companies.  The idea can be  based  on  a  co-funding  manner where the Government can work  together  with

some  selected  experienced and capable venture  capital  and

management companies to seek out and support promising  local

companies  to get through the current difficult market.   The

general  concept can be that of a Lifeline Fund that can  co-invest into local companies on a dollar for dollar basis with

the  private sector funding.  This way, some promising  local

start-up  companies  can  be assisted  to  pull  through  the

present difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the scheme can be worked out with some of

these  industry professionals and need not be discussed here,

provided that the Government can agree and support this  idea

through a pledge of a certain sum of money, say, to create  a

fund  of  $50  million which is to be matched by another  $50

million  from  the private sector, making  a  total  of  $100

million.   This  $100 million fund can therefore  be  a  very

important   lifeline  for  many  of  our   smaller   start-up

companies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have spoken about the

Lifeline Fund.  I will move on to the next cut on the  retail

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retail sector of the economy has had prolonged

structured  problems  which,  up  to  now,  have   not   been

effectively resolved.  There are many people engaged in  this

sector,  employing a significant proportion of our workforce.

Data  show that this sector is the most unproductive in terms

of   value  added  per  worker,  as  compared  to  the  other

industries  in Singapore.  For example, the value  added  per

worker  for the manufacturing sector in 1998 was $84,000,  as

compared to $26,500 for the retail sector.  The retail sector

was  therefore the worst among all sectors, even  worse  than

the  construction sector in terms of productivity per worker.

In  fact, if we compare the productivity and value added  per

worker  of  Singapore  retailers with  many  other  developed

countries,  we  are performing quite badly, worse  than  most

European and western countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Productivity and Standards Board

commissioned  a  study called Retail 21, of  which  I  was  a

member,  in an attempt to define strategies for the  industry

in this new millennium, and this was launched yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of their findings, I would like to highlight

a  few  critical areas that should be looked into.   Firstly,

with  regional shopping centres and neighbourhood malls,  HDB

shophouses are losing substantial business to the point  that

they  are no longer viable as businesses.  This, coupled with

changing lifestyle of Singaporeans who prefer to go to  large

supermarkets and shopping centres, signals a time for  us  to

make  decisive changes to the retail sector.  The  Government

should devise a scheme for such HDB shopowners to exit easily

from their trade without a major financial impact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should allow a greater flexibility of use

of  such shophouse space, including allowance for such spaces

to  be  used  for  the  type of infocomm  industries  that  I

mentioned earlier.  We should no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>

longer  prolong the pain of the people stuck in these trades,

especially the HDB shophouse owner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we have not been successful in promoting retail

on the Internet due to a number of reasons, including payment

security, efficiency of our logistics system and the lack  of

domain  knowledge for those who have started doing e-tailing.

We need the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a proper strategy including bringing in

international expertise to jump start the process;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) we need to put in place a better on-line payment

service system that is trusted by everyone;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) we should take the opportunity to promote Singapore

as  a  regional or Asian e-shopping hub, taking advantage  of

our expertise in handling logistics in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fourthly, professionalism in the retail industry

needs to be stepped up so that the value added per worker can

keep  pace with other industries, and this can then  free  up

workers for other industries which constantly face a shortage

of manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, regionalisation of the retail sector can be

given  another  boost.  I believe some of our  retailers  did

attempt to go to the region and they basically lost a lot  of

money  because  of the Asian financial crisis.   However,  we

should  not  give up the opportunities to take  advantage  of

future boom in the region or around the world.  We need a few

home-grown  Isetans  or  Wall Marts  which  can  successfully

compete  in  the region or in the world.  Can the  Government

devise proper incentives and support for this to happen fast?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, while we try to help the industry through

incentive schemes, I feel that these schemes should be market

driven  rather  than  subsidies that may solve  a  short-term

problem while creating long-term inefficiencies.  We need  to

move  away from the subsidy mentality that I spoke  about  at

the Budget debate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>

I  believe  that  such  an  approach just  hides  fundamental

weaknesses  of  companies.  And we have  seen  whenever  many

companies  run  into  problems, they  actually  come  to  the

Government for subsidies or handouts, and I think this is not

healthy  because  we will be competing with companies  around

the  world,  which basically operate based on market  forces.

If  we  continue to hand out subsidies, I think we will  just

weaken them, and not strengthen them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the retail sector has been

experiencing  poor business for several years now.   Although

there  was  a 7.8% increase in the total sales volume,  after

excluding  unusually high motor vehicle  sales  in  the  year

2000, most retailers are still finding business difficulties.

This  has  prompted the Government to draw up the  Retail  21

Plan, which was announced yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the retail business in HDB estates

has  been poor in the last few years.  This is aggravated  by

the  fact that some years ago, under the HDB's Sale of  Shops

programme, many shopkeepers had bought their shops  from  the

HDB  at  market  prices then.  Even though  the  prices  were

discounted  from market rates, some are finding  difficulties

in  servicing  their bank loans.  In the face  of  continuing

poor  business, I would like to ask the Minister to work with

his  colleague,  the  Minister for National  Development,  in

devising  methods  for assisting the retailers,  hawkers  and

stallholders.   Both  Ministers  may  wish  to  consider  the

following suggestions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) In HDB wet markets and food courts where the

business   is   poor   and  the  stallholders   are   finding

difficulties   to  sustain  their  business,   the   relevant

authority   should  consider  reducing  the  rentals.    Such

downward adjustment of rentals should be undertaken speedily,

rather  than  after numerous appeals.  This will also  ensure

that  the stallholders will have a chance to survive  with  a

lower  rental  cost.  A case in point I have is  in  the  new

Shunfu Mart, a wet market-cum-food

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>

court  in  my constituency.  Business has been poor from  day

one  since this new centre was opened last year, but the  HDB

has  not  yet  agreed to any rental reductions  despite  many

appeals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Sir, I wish to ask the two Ministers to be flexible

in  the applications of change of use of premises in the case

of  privately owned shops or retail outlets.  Another example

I have in my constituency is the private old shophouses along

Upper  Thomson Road.  Business has been bad for some of these

shophouses  for  several years.  Commercial activities,  like

shops and restaurants, have been allowed on the first storey,

but the authorities have not allowed commercial activities on

the  second  storey but insisted on its use  as  residential.

Repeated  appeals  to  the authorities to  allow  the  second

storey  for  commercial  purposes, such  as  restaurants  and

offices, like what Mr Inderjit Singh brought up, for  dot.com

companies have been turned down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stated reason given was that the proposed commercial

uses  would "likely aggravate the traffic and illegal parking

problems in the area."   Sir, the stated reason given is  not

reasonable.   The  shopkeepers feel that certain  alternative

uses  of  the premises would help to bring in new businesses.

Why  would  the  authorities reject the applications  on  the

basis of concern of traffic?  Having higher traffic is a good

sign.   It  means  that the intended use is viable  and  will

generate more economic activity.  As there are other means to

resolve  the traffic problem, we should not curtail  a  sound

and  viable business idea just because of the fear of traffic

congestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a good example where freedom to operate and choice

has  worked very well is the popular Holland Village.  It has

a  very  vibrant and lively eating and shopping locality.   I

notice  that  new shops or outlets constantly sprout  out  in

this  area.   When  the business is not  sustainable,  it  is

quickly   replaced  by  another.   It  is  this  ability   to

constantly  adjust and change that enables  the  locality  to

remain  so  vibrant.   Hence, in both  the  HDB  and  private

shopping and retail areas, I would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>

like  to suggest that the Government should actually let  the

shopkeepers decide what is best suited for the area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister give us his views?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, last year, the Minister talked

about  creating many more world-class companies in  the  next

few  years.   I  have  the  following  questions.   Have   we

identified  the  right strategies and put in place   workable

criteria in selecting and grooming such companies?   I  would

like to ask the Minister what  is the progress so far for the

target  which we set last year, namely, to create  a  hundred

world-class companies in a five-year time frame.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I have on world-class companies is that

too  many  of  our research institutes (RIs)  are  Government

controlled   and  Government  driven.   We  should   consider

outsourcing this to the private sector.   The private  sector

industry  players can form permanent groupings  according  to

their  industries and get some Government funding  to  manage

this.  The pace at which these RIs can then progress will  be

much  faster and much in line with what is happening in other

parts of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that we need a new Government agency

to  do  the  reverse  role, if we really  want  to  focus  on

developing  Singapore-based multi-nationals.  While  EDB  has

done  an excellent job in bringing in foreign companies  into

Singapore,  and while NSTB and the PSB have helped  many  new

companies  to start up and grow to a reasonable  size  within

Singapore,  we  do  not  have any  agency  that  focuses  and

facilitates  the globalisation of our companies.   The  Trade

Development   Board   has   done   an   excellent   job    in

internationalising our trading activities and in linking  our

companies  with  businesses from  around  the  world.   They,

however,  are  not chartered to groom and support  home-grown

multi-nationals,  especially in the areas  of  manufacturing,

engineering, construction and others.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one very useful role for the GLCs to play is to

basically act as big brothers in bringing our SMEs with  them

when  the GLCs globalise or do international projects.   This

is  the  reverse  of  the Local Industry Upgrading  Programme

(LIUP) where we give incentives to multi-nationals and  large

companies  based in Singapore to help groom and upgrade  SMEs

in  their  Singapore  operations.   This  practice  of  large

national  companies  bringing  along  smaller  companies  for

international projects is prevalent in Japan and  in  France.

So, if we can do something that is the reverse of the LIUP to

allow  our Singapore large companies to bring SMEs with them,

I  think this will be very useful in trying to groom some  of

the world-class companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that many of our SMEs are not going to be

viable  in  the long run, even if they are surviving  in  the

short  term.   For  such companies, it may  be  necessary  to

consider  giving them incentives to encourage them  to  merge

and   consolidate   among  themselves.   Collectively,   such

companies  may  have a better chance of becoming  world-class

companies, while on their own many may not even survive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to encourage value creation activities for

companies  based in Singapore.  The Government  may  want  to

consider giving incentives to companies to facilitate them to

break  up  their  value chains and move the  less  productive

activities  of  the  companies to outside Singapore,  to  the

region, where these activities can be done more productively.

I spoke about this in the Budget debate.  I hope the Minister

can give an answer to this.  In this way, we will be able  to

ensure  that companies will continuously climb in  the  value

chain of activities in line with what our economy needs,  and

can support in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I also talked about incentives to promote

productivity improvements within our manufacturing companies.

I  hope that the Minister will consider schemes, not just tax

incentives,  that directly promote productivity  improvements

and in this way, we can continue

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>

to  keep Singapore as a manufacturing hub for a long time  to

come.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, can I take all my

three cuts?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> First, on widening SME criteria.

It  is an acknowledged fact that SMEs are critical pillars of

the  Singapore  economy.  Nine out of  10  establishments  in

Singapore  today are SMEs.  They employ half of our workforce

and generate one-third of our total value added.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to note that the Senior Minister of

State for Trade and Industry, Mr Peter Chen's reiteration  of

the  Government's commitment to SME 21, during the launch  of

the  SME  March  earlier  this week.  However,  an  important

factor, which I feel was not adequately addressed in the  SME

21  blueprint launched in January last year, is the  widening

of  the SME criteria.  SMEs, under the existing criteria, are

defined  as  companies with at least 30% local  equity,  have

less  than  $15  million in productive asset  investment  for

manufacturing  companies  and,  additionally,  have  a  staff

strength of not more than 200, if they are in commerce or  in

the service sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These criteria, I believe, have been in force since 1988

under  the 1988 SME  Master Plan, and therefore may no longer

be  relevant in the context of our current transition into  a

knowledge-based economy.  The business landscape has  changed

quite  dramatically  since  1998 and  now  includes  a  wider

spectrum   of   SMEs,  such  as  dot-coms  and  biotechnology

companies which are knowledge and skill intensive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional brick and mortar companies are also

restructuring and incorporating new economy features, such as

e-commerce   into  their  operations.   Such  companies   may

slightly  fall outside the current eligibility  criteria  for

assistance,  but  yet they are in need of  help  during  this

period  of  transition.   Also,  as  a  consequence  of   the

Government's policy to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>

attract  technology  intensive and knowledge  companies  into

Singapore, more small foreign SMEs are coming to Singapore to

set   up   operations  here.   Such  companies  also  deserve

assistance,  but  are  denied such  because  of  the  present

criteria.   As  such,  I would like to ask  the  Minister  to

consider redefining and broadening the definition of SMEs  to

accommodate  the  changes over the last  decade  or  so  and,

particularly, take into account SMEs' needs in the knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new definition should also include factors such as

sales  volume, paid up capital, ownership and other desirable

factors,  as  done in other developed countries.   This  will

enable a broader range of SMEs, including small foreign-owned

ones,  to take advantage of Government assistance schemes  to

help propel the growth of SMEs operating in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next cut is research on SMEs. While I applaud the

Government's  rigorous  and sincere  effort  to  nurture  and

strengthen  the SME sector with massive plans and programmes,

as outlined in the SME 21 document, I am concerned that there

are  very  few formal studies being done about our  SMEs.   I

must declare that I have a vested interest here in that I  am

personally doing research on SMEs.  In my endeavour  to  look

up  past  studies done on our SMEs, I have found very  little

information, particularly academic material, available  about

them.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the increasing importance attached to our

SMEs,  I  would  like to urge the Minister  to  consider  the

setting  up of a formal division within MTI, or through  PSB,

to  study  our  SMEs.  I suggest that key  issues  afflicting

them, such as their changing needs in our transitory state of

evolving  into  a  knowledge-based  economy,  challenges  and

difficulties   facing  them,  effectiveness   of   Government

assistance  programmes rendered to SMEs and their performance

should be studied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The studies should be broken down into key SME sectors,

so as to understand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>

the different needs of and impact on our SMEs in a constantly

changing business environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the relevant faculties of our universities

and  other  institutes  of  higher learning  should  also  be

encouraged to undertake in-depth academic research on various

issues  concerning  Singapore SMEs, while drawing  references

and  comparisons  to  SMEs  from  other  NIEs  and  developed

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year the Government sets aside hundreds of millions

of  dollars  to  help  our SMEs.  It is  imperative  that  we

understand  the  extent  of  how much  of  these  funds  have

benefited  our SMEs and also their corresponding contribution

to the overall economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data from such studies will also enable the Ministry to

formulate  more  meaningful policies, reformulate  Government

assistance  programmes  and  schemes  so  that  they   remain

relevant  to  SMEs'  needs and, more importantly,  that  such

schemes  are effective in propelling them to greater  heights

of achievement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on my cut on human resource development expertise

in  SMEs.  It is a fact that in a KBE, human capital  to  any

organisation  becomes  the  key  resource  as  it  holds  the

knowledge and skills required, not only for growth  but  also

in  many cases for organisational survival.  Management  guru

Peter  Drucker  predicted that in many  developed  societies,

knowledge workers would be the largest single population  and

workforce group.  Organisations in developed nations have  no

choice  but  to  manage workers effectively to harness  their

full potential, retain them or risk becoming obsolete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge base and skills complexity requirements of

our  SMEs  are  increasing  by  the  day  to  maintain  their

relevance   in   an   increasingly   sophisticated   business

environment.   However, I am concerned, Sir, that  our  SMEs,

especially  the  smaller ones, generally lack human  resource

development and human resource management expertise to manage

and  properly  motivate their workforce.  As a  result,  high

turnover of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>

staffing  and  absence of structured HRD and  HRM  programmes

translates  into loss of valuable talent and  expertise  when

their  trained personnel leave or lower productivity  due  to

low staff morale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smaller companies also lack the ability to attract high

quality staff due to their limited resources and also absence

of human resource expertise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I am well aware that the Government has already

a  wide range of assistance schemes available to help SMEs, I

would  like  to propose that either a new special  assistance

scheme  be  devised to specifically assist SMEs  to  beef  up

their  HRD and HRM capabilities or a current scheme, such  as

the PSB's People Developer Scheme, be expanded to incorporate

a  structured  approach to linking HRD and  HRM  to  business

objectives.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I just remind hon. Members that we

are falling behind schedule on this amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, before I

begin,  I would like to say that I am already aware that  the

Government  is  providing  a lot of  assistance  schemes  and

programmes  to help the SMEs, through the PSB, EDB  and  many

other  Government agencies.  But they are given more  in  the

form  of  technical  assistance  schemes  such  as  training,

consultancy and so on, to help the companies modernise  their

management,  adopt technology and help them  to  become  more

productive and efficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we have come to a stage today where the

SMEs  need  more  than just these.  And I  am  talking  about

support today by the Government in the form of equity to help

them  to  capitalise better and to grow more aggressively  so

that they can go into the region.  I know that the Government

does  this already through Temasek Holdings, NSTB, EDBI,  and

so  on.   But  these are more investments in large companies,

large  projects,  and when they have already succeeded,  they

start looking at you and putting money into you.  At the very

start-up stage, we have got Vertex and some start-up funds,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>

venture capital funds, to look at start-up phases.  But  SMEs

are  somewhere  in-between where they seem to lack  financial

support from the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a gap which I hope the Government would

address and try to close.  I am not talking about big stakes,

I am talking about token stakes of 5% to 10%, and they should

leave  the  management  of these companies  to  the  founding

entrepreneurs  and to professionals employed,  so  that  they

will  not  become a GLC.  When they go into the region,  they

should also not be perceived as a GLC.  But, I think when the

market  knows  that  there  is  financial  support  from  the

Government in the form of a shareholder, this would help them

when they regionalise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take a look at the Enterprise 50 companies, Sir,

a  lot  of  them have gotten to where they are today  without

financial support from the Government, and it has taken  them

a long time, many years.  Some of them have been in operation

for  more than 10 years.  If they were to become big  in  the

region without financial support from the Government, imagine

how  long  more  it will take for them to become  a  regional

company  and even a world-class company.  I do not  think  we

have  this  kind  of time to wait.  So I am  suggesting  that

perhaps  the Government should lend them a hand so that  they

can actually become a world-class company a lot quicker.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

rise  to  ask the Minister to do more to help SMEs to improve

their  R&D activities.  Companies must innovate in  order  to

thrive.   R&D  is  not  only  a luxury  of  Government,  huge

corporations or large MNCs, but a necessary survival tool for

most  companies.   In  the  face  of  increasing  competition

brought  about  by  a  more  open economy,  R&D  is  a  vital

competitive edge, one that determines whether a company  wins

or loses a contract, between making or breaking the company.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last couple of days I was involved in a major

tender,  one where the incumbent is a local SME, but  it  was

unable  to retain the business because it was unable to  help

the client grow the business in the region and has a lack  of

business   process.   This  really  typifies  the   kind   of

challenges that SMEs face as they try to grow their  business

in  the  region.   R&D  is  crucial to  creating,  innovating

productivity  and process improvement which are prerequisites

for  SMEs  in  preparing for the challenges  ahead,  ie,  (1)

facing  an  unfamiliar  country  and  market  condition;  (2)

adapting  its products and services to consumers of different

backgrounds, tastes and preferences; (3) confronting  a  very

complex business practice overseas that is more likely to  be

very  protective  of the domestic market and  interests,  and

more often than not we are seen as very suspicious aliens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, despite all these, SMEs are spending too little

time  and  perhaps effort on R&D.  According to the  National

Survey  of  R&D 1999, although some SMEs spend an average  of

3.5%  of  their total expenditure on R&D, compared  to,  say,

2.7% in large corporations and 1.2% in MNCs, it does not seem

to bring about the desired result, if you consider the number

of  patents being awarded arising from these R&Ds compared to

research  conducted  by higher institutions,  Government  and

public research institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one looks at the criteria for applying these grants

for R&D, it is clear that it is targetted to assist companies

that  will  conduct  research  to  create  and  discover  new

knowledge  that  will  perhaps  revolutionise  the  industry.

However,  the  fact is that R&D in SMEs is  not  about  these

things  that would revolutionise the industry.  It is  a  lot

more  basic.   It is about process improvement,  finding  and

making  that  little improvement and differences  that  would

allow  the  company to go one step forward and for  many,  to

survive  another day, to fight another challenge and  to  win

the  next contract.  It is not likely to emerge a new patent,

which  is one of the three criteria in allocating R&D  funds.

Therefore, R&D funds should be made

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>

more  easily  available  to SMEs to  conduct  basic  research

which,  I believe, in any case forms a small but an important

part of a larger research network that would create a healthy

R&D environment of knowledge creation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a number of suggestions for the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To make these funds more accessible for such basic

research, because the aim is to encourage research activities

within  the company and hopefully to spur bigger attempts  in

the future;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We should be realistic about the goals. Not all

will  succeed,  except the fact that the ideal and  necessary

pre-conditions  for research may not be there  in  many  SMEs

which  are  usually  under-staffed  and  may  not  have   the

specialist talents one would find in MNCs;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Expertise from local tertiary institutions,

especially from the polytechnics, are a potential  source  of

research   expertise.    Make   them   available   to   these

enterprises.   Allow and encourage them to take up  secondary

appointments in SMEs;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Government research institutions should allocate

part  of  their  research for the specific benefit  of  SMEs,

especially  on the softer aspect of research, like  marketing

intelligence and development, helping companies to enter  new

markets,   cutting  costs  and  developing  right   marketing

strategies  which are certainly more urgent and important  to

these SMEs than hard research.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore encourage that the Minister review some of

these criteria in allocating R&D grants for SMEs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, we have taken the right

approach by focusing on life sciences as the long term driver

of  our  economic growth.  If we do not start now,  Singapore

risks  becoming  the  receiver of technology  instead  of  an

innovator.   This was the pattern of our economic development

during  the last industrial revolution in the last  30  years

where  our  success as a developing economy was a  result  of

Singapore getting the lower value chain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>

of   activities  of  the  electronics  industry   while   the

innovation of technologies occurred in USA, Europe and Japan.

In  the  last 10 years we have changed that trend but in  the

beginning,  that  was how our economic development  happened.

This  time  we  must  take a lead or at least  be  among  the

leaders if we want real economic prosperity as a result of  a

successful  life  sciences industry.  I  have  the  following

three questions for the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the target in terms of contribution to GDP

by the life sciences industry in the next 10 to 20 years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Has the current effort been too Government driven?

Do  we  want  to  go  the route of GLCs again  for  the  life

sciences industry?  Can we invite and incentivise the private

sector to play a leading role in this case?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can the Government set aside a high-risk fund,

managed  by  the  private sector to stimulate  the  industry?

This  would be helpful for two reasons.  First, we need  many

to  try,  of which many will also fail, but we will need  the

critical mass to be involved in order to develop just  a  few

good  companies  capable of competing in  a  global  economy.

Second,  when we started the IT revolution a few  years  ago,

funds  were  difficult to come by.  A number of  our  budding

entrepreneurs  faced  tremendous difficulties  in  the  early

stages  and  some even left for the Silicon Valley  or  other

parts of the world.  It was only in the last two years or  so

when  funds  availability improved. This time round  we  will

need to repeat the same boom we saw for the IT-type companies

some  years ago, before the life sciences industry.  So funds

will  be  very critical in trying to stimulate the growth  of

such industries in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, it was recently reported that

the Changi Airport hotel site had no takers.  Presumably, the

economics  did  not support that particular  investment.   Is

this  merely a function of the cyclical downturn or is  it  a

reflection  of  the underlying difficulty  with  deriving  an

acceptable  return  on  investments in hotels  in  Singapore?

Taken together with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>

the  bumper  10.5%  growth to a record  7.7  million  tourist

arrivals in year 2000, this must be slightly puzzling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to ask the Minister to

revisit the value-added potential of the hospitality business

in  Singapore, with a view to modifying the existing industry

structure and Government support where necessary.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in measuring the effectiveness of our efforts, the

Singapore  Tourism  Board  has  inclined  towards  throughput

measures, such as tourist arrivals, average length  of  stay,

hotel  occupancy  rates.   However,  our  preoccupation  with

clocking in arrivals must be accompanied by a focus on yields

or,  simply, profitability.  For example, when we look at the

spending per tourist-day or similar measures, the picture may

be less pretty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Singapore Hotel Association, total

operating  costs  averaged 78% of revenues,  excluding  fixed

charges  of  typically another 10%.  Thus, operating  margins

are   razor   thin  at  best,  making  investments  generally

difficult.  Neither is there a meaningful capital gain to  be

realised as transactions of pure hotel assets are few and far

between.   I  would  therefore like to ask  the  Minister  to

describe what he would regard as value-drivers for the  hotel

industry  and  whether  the existing industry  structure,  in

terms  of  supply of rooms and mix of hotels,  would  require

modification.    I  would  also  like  to   know   what   his

considerations   are  when  designing  incentives   for   the

hospitality industry.  Specifically, how would the  Strategic

Thrust of the Tourism 21 plan relating to the enhancement  of

the  existing  operating environment via attractive  tax  and

other incentives be fleshed out?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, Sentosa Island is one of the

main  attractions  for tourists and a favourite  recreational

playground of Singaporeans.  In land scarce Singapore, it  is

indeed a very valuable piece of real

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>

estate.  One of the regular grouses of Sentosa is the  hassle

of  getting  there.   When you get there, the  difficulty  is

getting  around due to the very inefficient monorail  system.

This problem will be solved when eventually there will be MRT

links to the island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maximise the potential of Sentosa, I would like to

suggest  to the Minister to give further thought in improving

the  local  transportation in Sentosa.  Perhaps, an efficient

network  of LRT and a large fleet of small buses will enhance

the  speed  and  convenience for visitors to  get  around  in

Sentosa.   Secondly,  money spent  on  future  new  and  bold

attractions,  eg,  theme  parks,  fun  rides,   museums   and

theatres,  will be money worth spending as tourists  will  be

attracted to stay longer in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I sincerely feel that if we could give bold and

imaginative ideas and attractions to be developed in Sentosa,

it  will  have a tremendous impact on the tourism income  for

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to ask about the

status  of  the Sentosa Cove project.  Bringing residents  to

Sentosa  is  a  very  good move.  It  will  add  life  there.

Sentosa  Cove  will  provide a very  pleasant  resort  living

environment.  However, it was reported that this Sentosa Cove

project  will be deferred.  What are the reasons?   What  are

the problems causing the deferment?  Also would the MRT links

be  provided to Sentosa Cove to enhance its attraction  as  a

prime residential area in future?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, first, allow me to thank Members of this House

who have spoken on MTI's budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From MTI's perspective, this year's budget is a very

good  budget  because  it is pro-enterprise.   The  Singapore

economy  is completely open and highly dependent on  external

demand.  We are like a ship sailing in the ocean, we  are  in

control only of the ship.  We have to take the ocean for what

it  is.   Of course, if we have good radars and good  weather

forecasts,  that  is  very good.  But, otherwise,  we  adjust

ourselves to external conditions.  What is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>

important  is  that we should stay competitive  whatever  the

situation,   keep  costs  down,  upgrade  our   capabilities,

facilitate restructuring, help those who are badly  affected,

stay united.  By cutting taxes, and cutting them the most for

SMEs,  the  budget  strengthens us on the  supply  side,  and

avoids  the idea that it should be subsidies that  will  keep

industries  moving forward, a point which Mr  Inderjit  Singh

made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although investments into Southeast Asia slowed down

during the financial crisis, EDB was able to keep up the flow

of  investments into Singapore in the last three years.  Last

year,   manufacturing  investment  commitments   exceeded   a

historical  high  of  S$9 billion.   It  is  this  inflow  of

investments  that keeps the entire economy  going.   When  we

discuss SMEs, it is important not to forget the main picture,

which  is the total investment flow into Singapore.  If  that

is  maintained,  then the game is on.  If  that  shrinks  and

shrivels,  then  the  SME  game  itself  is  very  much  more

difficult to play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, we have not done badly. The investments

that  we have been able to attract of late are also of better

quality.   Take  two recent examples.  UMC of  Taiwan,  in  a

joint  venture with Infineon of Germany, will build a  US$3.6

billion  12-inch wafer fab plant in Singapore.  That  is  our

biggest investment by one company.  And it will attract other

industry players to come to Singapore and it will benefit our

SMEs.   Another project recently announced last month is  the

$1  billion investment by Toshiba and Matsushita to  build  a

plant  to  manufacture  Thin Film Transistor  Liquid  Crystal

Displays.   Eventually, these flat wide screen displays  will

replace  the cathode ray tubes that we see in most television

sets  today.  This is the first such plant outside Japan  and

it is a coup for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both these successes will create many new opportunities

for  SMEs.  Credit must go to Mr Philip Yeo and the  officers

of  EDB  and  JTC who worked tirelessly during  the  economic

crisis to make sure that new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>

investments  continued to come in.  Mr Yeo has  since  handed

EDB  over to Mr Teo Ming Kian to lead the development of  the

Biomedical Sciences at NSTB, which is another area  of  long-term importance to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to place on record

in  this House MTI's deep appreciation to the leaders of NTUC

and the labour movement for their support of the Government's

pro-growth  policies.  Without the labour movement's  support

of  the CPF cut during the Asian financial crisis, EDB  could

not  have succeeded.  I listened carefully to Mr Thomas  when

he  reminded Government on Monday to restore the remaining 4%

as  quickly  as possible.  That is part of the fair  bargain.

Our  collective  resolve to reduce costs when  necessary  and

maintain  competitiveness sends a  strong  signal  to  global

investors  and give them confidence to invest  big  bucks  in

Singapore,  and we need these big bucks to keep  the  economy

humming.  I thank Mr Hawazi for speaking in favour of our FTA

negotiations on behalf of the trade unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about SMEs in greater detail. As many

MPs  have  pointed out, despite the strong growth last  year,

many SMEs, especially those in the retail sector, did not  do

well.   But not all SMEs did badly.  In particular,  SMEs  in

the  wholesale and services sector enjoyed growth  comparable

to  the  large  firms.   However, with slow  economic  growth

expected this year, more SMEs would be affected. As  MPs,  we

can  already  feel this slowdown on the ground.  And  several

MPs, including Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr Ahmad Magad, Mr Lew  Syn

Pau  and Mr Zulkifli Baharudin have stressed the need to help

SMEs  cope  with the changes, and many good ideas  have  been

proposed in this House.  Let me reiterate what Dr Richard  Hu

said, that the Government is fully committed to helping local

enterprises meet the challenges of this economic slowdown and

the challenges of the New Economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a wide array of assistance schemes and

programmes and, no doubt, we will need more.  But  the  point

is any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>

SME  which  wants  to upgrade will receive assistance.   Yes,

there may be ignorance and we will try our best to reach  out

to  them.   But in the end, they must meet us half  way.   We

cannot shield SMEs from competition, but we will help them to

compete  better.   For  those  whose  trades  are  no  longer

competitive or do not wish to carry on, we will help them  to

exit and to move on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Lew Syn Pau and Mr Inderjit Singh pointed out,

among our SMEs, there are a few with the potential to make it

big  in  the  world.  With ingenuity, courage and good  luck,

they  too  can  become  like Creative  Technology.   And  the

Government  will support them under our PLC scheme  and  PSME

scheme.  To answer Mr Inderjit Singh's point, we have  fallen

short  on  our PLC scheme target, but that is to be  expected

because  of the economic crisis.  The point is, yes, we  have

this wish to create Creatives and Nokias.  But it is not easy

if  you  look  at other small countries like New Zealand  and

Denmark.  They have not been all that successful.  Yes,  from

time to time, there will be a huge success which should bring

us   all  pride,  and  such  successes  should  serve  as  an

inspiration  for  all of us.  Government  cannot  make  these

bets.   The  global  market will have to  do  it.   But  what

Government  can  do  is  to provide a nurturing  environment,

improve  the  odds,  but let the market settle  who  are  the

winners and who are the losers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we are seeing a new breed of entrepreneurs and

companies.  Some are led by second-generation family  owners,

others  are professionals who have less secure jobs in  MNCs.

And more than 80 such companies are listed on the local Stock

Exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our GLCs should be helpful, but I do not think our GLCs

should  play  a  big  brother role.  In fact,  the  criticism

against  them is that they have too dominant a role which  is

in  fact not true.  As I mentioned in this House, their share

of  GDP  is  only 12.9%, counting all companies in which  the

Government has 20 or more percent controlling interest.   And

many local

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>

companies have received support from PSB and EDB.   Like  our

barbecued  pork  retailer, Bee Cheng Hiang,  which  has  done

quite well by franchising its outlets overseas and now has 28

outlets  from Manila to Mauritius.  Or Informatics  Holdings,

an IT training school, which now operates over 300 schools in

30  countries in Asia, Europe, Middle East and Africa.   That

is  not bad.  Or Biosensors International, which has received

grants  and  support  from our research  institutions,  which

invented  the  S-Stent, a device used for coronary  diseases.

Because  it is more flexible, it is more suitable  for  Asian

sizes,  and  it  hopes  to become the first  high-tech  Asian

medical device manufacturer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as our companies grow, TDB will help them globalise

through   trade  investment.   With  e-commerce  and   market

liberalisation, the opportunities for globalisation are  much

greater.  We will rejig our incentives to see what we can  do

to help them, and feedback from Members in this House is very

useful to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our assistance schemes are broadbased. Last year, the

Government committed $1.2 billion to assist SMEs, up 50% from

the  previous  year.   A total of 108,000  applications  were

approved,  as  compared to 88,000 in the previous  year.   Mr

Inderjit  Singh  asked  if we have too many  schemes  because

there  are  60-plus,  mentioned by  Dr  Richard  Hu,  causing

confusion.   We have been rationalising and we will  continue

to  do  so.  But because SMEs cover such a wide area, 100,000

in  Singapore,  so many different sectors,  we  have  got  to

customise  our  schemes.  It is not possible to  have  a  few

sizes-fit-all,  because then there will be no  good  fit  for

most cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad suggested that we tailor-make some

assistance schemes for human resource development.   This  is

indeed  an important area of emphasis.  SMEs can make use  of

LETAS  for this purpose which defrays up to 50% of  the  fees

paid  to consultants who help them.  But we will look at  how

we can widen the people developer scheme to take into account

the points made by Mr Ahmad Magad.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli suggested encouraging SMEs to do more R&D,

and  for  PSB to widen the criteria so that more of them  can

qualify for such grants.  It is not easy, because, for  SMEs,

R&D  is not too different from normal operations.  And we  do

not  want  the grants given by PSB to lead to moral  hazards.

But  we  will look at Mr Zulkifli's proposals and see how  we

can accommodate the genuine cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau asked whether the Government can provide

more  equity  support  to SMEs, and Mr Inderjit  Singh  asked

whether  the  TIF  fund can be relaxed  to  include  low-tech

companies.   It  is  not easy.  For high-tech,  yes,  we  can

define  clear  criteria,  but, for low-tech,  who  is  to  be

helped?  And it is politically invidious for us to help some,

and  not  the  others.  So, what we have  done  is,  we  have

created  the  Promising  Local  Enterprises  Scheme  and  the

Promising  SME schemes, with definite criteria, and,  if  you

meet   these   criteria,  then  you  are   given   particular

assistance.  I think that is what we can do.  If we  need  to

widen  the criteria, we will do so.  But if we have too  many

such  case-by-case assistance packages, I think it will  open

us to a lot of criticisms and also to possible abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To open up more opportunities for local SMEs overseas,

we  will try to make Singapore an international hub for SMEs.

SMEs in other countries are keen to hub in Singapore in order

to  use  Singapore as a base to operate in the wider  region,

and  we  have good information sources here.  So, to try  and

achieve  this,  PSB  and JTC are cooperating  to  develop  an

International SME Business Hub in Jurong East by the  end  of

this  year.  It will house both local and foreign  SMEs,  and

also  overseas SME agencies.  The Singapore Confederation  of

Industries (SCI) will be the anchor tenant, and we hope that,

by  providing affordable office spaces, more foreign SMEs and

start-ups will set up shop here, and this will help  our  own

local SMEs to regionalise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote sector-level restructuring, PSB will continue

to incentivise the formation of franchises, economic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>

groupings and shared services.  This is in line with Mr Leong

Horn Kee's suggestion to help group SMEs together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh

that  the retail sector requires particular attention.  There

are  a  number  of structural problems: an excess  supply  of

retail space, low productivity and poor service levels.   And

given  the  changing  shopping patterns of  Singaporeans  and

strong  competition  from supermarkets, departmental  stores,

and  Johor Bahru, our SMEs are going through a difficult time

and  they  would  have to readjust themselves and  reposition

themselves, given the fact of these changes.  We cannot  just

stay put.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, PSB has got industry players to get

together,  and the result is the Retail 21 plan announced  by

Mr  Lim  Boon  Heng, Chairman of PSB, yesterday.   Many  good

recommendations have been made under the rubric of Retail 21.

The  Government supports Retail 21, and a $16 million  Retail

<br><br>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fund  has been announced.  We will follow up and  address

many of the specific points which several MPs have raised  in

this House today.  In addition, because many of our shops are

in  the HDB estates, we need a special package to help  those

who  are in the trade, either to re-optimise the spaces  they

have,  to  upgrade their productivity, and to help those  who

wish  to  exit,  to  do so, more easily.   Mr  Mah  Bow  Tan,

Minister for National Development, will announce the  details

of the package for HDB shops during his Ministry's budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internally within MTI, we have set up a Task Force to

review  our current efforts and programmes on the development

of  local  enterprises.  We are relooking the  functions  and

responsibilities of JTC, NSTB, TDB and PSB, in  this  regard.

We   will  restructure  PSB  to  give  more  focus  to  local

entrepreneurship.  Over the years, PSB has taken on more  and

more  responsibilities and we intend to, as Mr Inderjit Singh

recommended,   privatise  and  corporatise  some   of   these

responsibilities.  And we will do so not only  for  PSB,  but

also  for JTC and NSTB as well.  We want the statutory boards

to be trim and light, with clear missions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB will devote more attention to the monitoring of

SMEs, as suggested by Mr Ahmad Magad.  It will do surveys and

research  on SMEs in greater detail, if necessary,  with  the

help  of  the  universities.   I  welcome  Mr  Ahmad  Magad's

suggestion  that  the criteria for SMEs be widened,  to  take

into  account  new realities.  And we do revise our  criteria

from  time  to  time.  For example, the criterion  for  fixed

assets  was raised from $8 million to $15 million in 1995  to

qualify more SMEs for Government assistance.  And, during the

Asian crisis, the criteria for SMEs were adjusted further  so

that larger companies could make use of the facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the topic of science and

technology.  Last year, we announced a $7 billion Science and

Technology 2005 Plan for the next five years, much  of  which

will  fund  research.  Mr Inderjit Singh has  suggested  that

there  should  be greater private sector participation,  that

the Government should outsource public sector research to the

private  sector, and provide grants to support joint industry

research projects.  This is indeed our intent.  A key  thrust

of  the  S&T plan is to support industry R&D.  And for  every

dollar  spent by the Government on R&D, we attracted $3  from

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, our target is for private sector research

to account for two-thirds of Singapore's gross expenditure on

R&D   by   the  year  2005.   This  is  an  important  market

discipline, that we are putting public monies in R&D to  good

use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pushing on with life sciences as a long-term

undertaking.   But, for the life sciences, we  cannot  expect

quick  returns.  This is something for the longer-term.   Our

goal  is  to  attract  world-class companies,  and  become  a

regional hub for clinical trials and drug development, and we

need to establish, layer by layer, a good infrastructure  for

the  biomedical  sciences.  It involves many  Ministries  and

many institutions.  But to answer Mr Inderjit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>

Singh's  question,  we  hope to  double  the  output  of  the

biomedical sciences industry to $12 billion in five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to all this, to a lot of what we do, is talent.

We  can  succeed  in the life sciences if we can  get  global

talent to help us.  Last year, I mentioned the assistance  of

Dr  Sydney Brenner of Cambridge, Dr Alice Huang and Dr  David

Baltimore  of  Caltech.  Since then, we have  got  many  more

scientists,  from  Japan, Europe, America and  Australia,  to

help  us.   And they are helping us pro bono.  And  they  are

helping  us  because  they are convinced  that  we  are  dead

serious,  are eager students and are likely to make progress.

So,  that  is  a  good signal.  We have also been  recruiting

outstanding individuals who are prepared to leave prestigious

international institutions to join us, like Professor  Edison

Liu  from the National Cancer Institute of the US.   Born  in

Hong Kong, he has become one of the top scientists in America

and,  when  he  decided  to come to  Singapore  to  head  the

Singapore  Genomic  Programme, many of  his  colleagues  were

shocked.  Now he is helping us to recruit talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, like Dr Gunaretnam Rajagopal from Cavendish

Laboratory   of   Cambridge,  Tamil,  Malaysian   origin,   a

physicist,  expert in biophysics and mathematical  modelling,

he  has  agreed to help us set up a Bioinformatics  Institute

and,  as  you know, for a lot of the follow up on the genomic

work  and  on  the  work of proteins, we  need  computational

capabilities and high mathematics, and this Institute  is  an

essential  part  of  our  total  effort  to  build   up   the

infrastructure for the biomedical sciences in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the EDB International Advisory Council, under

Dr  Tony  Tan's chairmanship, met in Singapore.  It  reviewed

all  that we have done, took stock, and asked us to  look  at

how  we should move forward.  They felt very strongly, and  I

think  they  agree with MPs here, that we should do  more  to

encourage innovation and risk-taking, in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their advice was published in the newspapers. Under

Technopreneurship 21,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>

we  have reviewed many of our laws and regulations, like  our

bankruptcy provisions, to make it easier for people  to  fail

and try again, a point Mr Leong Horn Kee raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh would like to see venture capitalists

channel  more of their funds into Singapore investments.   He

suggested   that  we  increase  the  30%  quota   for   local

investments  so  that  more  monies  would  be  available  to

Singapore  companies,  especially  to  those  which  are   in

trouble.  We are reluctant to do this because it is  easy  to

waste  money, or to burn money, in this area.  Yes, companies

which  show promise and are starved of cash, we should  help,

and  we will help them.  But we cannot just loosen the spigot

like  that,  because  we have a fiduciary  responsibility  to

Singaporeans for the public funds which we are in charge  of.

And  we still do not have the mass of start-ups and ideas  in

Singapore to raise the percentage further.  But, having  said

that,  despite  the  crash  in high-tech  stocks,  we  should

persist  in our efforts to build Singapore as a major  centre

for  the  global VC industry.  In fact, we should  see  these

crashes as an opportunity for us to move even further ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget debate last year, I remember Prof. Toh

See  Kiat  and other MPs cautioning us on the danger  of  the

dot.com mania becoming a dot.con disaster, and NASDAQ started

crashing  shortly  after in April.  Mr Inderjit  Singh  knows

this  sector  well, and I agree with his assessment  that  we

should see this as a healthy correction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On extending a life-line to cash-strapped start-ups

which  are  worth  saving, I have asked EDB to  consider  co-investing part of the existing Venture Investment Support for

Start-ups Fund for this purpose.  Yes, we should speed up the

process,  but  we cannot avoid due diligence.   Let  me  just

emphasise  that  this  cannot be a  bail-out  for  non-viable

businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technopreneurship development is a long-term

undertaking.   The  Government is committed  to  building  an

enterprise ecosystem and will push on with our T21

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>

efforts.   And,  if  we need a greater  supply  of  money  to

encourage global VC companies to have connections here and to

operate  here, then we should be prepared to do so.  In  this

regard,  we  are  studying  whether  we  need  a  TIF  II  to

supplement and build on the momentum of TIF I.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important part of the enterprise ecosystem is the

proposed Buona Vista Science Hub being developed by JTC.  Let

me assure Mr Inderjit Singh that this will not become another

ordinary industrial estate or business park.  We will use the

Buona  Vista  Science  Hub  to  experiment  with  new  ideas,

including radical changes to our regulatory environment.   It

would not be easy.  We will need many ministries and economic

agencies to work together.  To facilitate the coordination, I

have  asked  Minister Lim Swee Say to chair a  multi-ministry

steering committee to get the Buona Vista Science Hub off the

ground  quickly.   It cannot be done by the  private  sector,

because  our  existing  rules  and  regulations,  which  were

perfected for the old economy, will kill many of our  efforts

in the new economy, if we do not first change them.  So, this

has  got to be a publicly-driven initiative.  Later on,  yes.

As  we  are  confident with what we have done,  then  we  can

divest the investments to the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key recommendation of the EDB Advisory Council

was  that Singapore should expand its regionalisation efforts

and  develop stronger global links for market technology  and

talent.   The  Council  recommended  that  Singapore   should

exploit  the  potential of a regional market of  2.8  billion

people  by  extending  our region to a 7-hour  flight  radius

within  which  there will be rapidly-growing  middle  classes

numbering in the hundreds of millions in the future.  I  have

circulated a map to Members showing what this extended region

would   look   like.    Basically,  what   this   means   is,

increasingly,  in  all  our  policies,  we  should  see   our

geographical  hinterland to include China, India,  Japan  and

Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This important recommendation by the international

advisers  fits in with our various efforts to negotiate  FTAs

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>

strengthen  regional groupings.  But we can only  regionalise

if  our own base in ASEAN is solid.  As Mr Leong Horn Kee and

Mr  Simon  Tay  pointed out, Singapore's economic  well-being

must  be  rooted  in  the region.  And we  follow  events  in

Indonesia  and  Malaysia  closely  because  they  affect   us

directly.       With     Indonesia,     despite     different

administrations, on the whole, we enjoy very good  relations.

After  the  economic  crisis, Prime Minister  Goh  Chok  Tong

extended  to  the Indonesians an economic assistance  package

and  we  recently  concluded two gas deals, each  worth  US$8

billion  over  a 20-year period.  Within 5 to 10  years,  all

households  in  Singapore will be using  Indonesian  gas  for

cooking  and  we will soon be having gas coming  out  of  our

ears.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Malaysia, our relations with them at the economic

level are very excellent.  Last Saturday, when I was up there

for  a  conference,  the  Johor MB and  I  had  a  very  good

discussion,  and  Malaysia  and  Singapore  are  really   one

economic space for global manufacturing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Indonesia, we must take into account the fact that

Jakarta  will  give  greater autonomy to  the  provinces  and

regencies in the coming years and we must begin to widen  our

links  to  the  various  provinces  around  us.   The  Growth

Triangle  Agreement already allows for this.  It  allows  the

provinces  of Indonesia and the states of Malaysia which  are

included  within  this Growth Triangle to have  direct  links

with  Ministries  in  Singapore and it is  our  intention  to

follow   up  on  these  provisions  in  the  Growth  Triangle

Agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the wider region. China will loom

larger in the coming years and Northeast Asia is fast leaving

Southeast Asia behind.  I have circulated a recent article by

the  Asian  Wall Street Journal highlighting  in  very  stark

terms  how  much  Northeast Asia is  leaving  Southeast  Asia

behind and these are long-term trends.  This is the reason

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>

why  we  are  working  very  hard to  move  ASEAN  along,  to

integrate  our economies further, to move into  services,  to

remove  non-tariff barriers to trade, so that we  can  be  an

alternative  manufacturing base to China.  China  is  a  free

trade  area  of  1.3  billion people.  We  have  500  million

people,  still divided and compartmentalised into 10 national

markets.   So,  this  remains a very important  objective  of

Singapore  in ASEAN.  We are, of course, without saying,  one

of  the  greatest supporters of the WTO in the world and  let

there  be no mistaking on support of the WTO, even though  we

are  moving on FTAs.  As Mr Simon Tay, Mr Leong Horn Kee  and

Mr Hawazi pointed out, the regional FTA initiatives, far from

weakening  the  WTO,  are already creating  very  interesting

competitive  dynamics in the region, in the  world,  for  the

launch  of  a  new  round.  It is good because  what  we  are

proposing is not only WTO-consistent but also WTO plus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there have been some murmurs from the region, but I

believe  this  is  because  of a lack  of  understanding  and

because  of  discomfort that the status quo would  inevitably

change.  As Mr Simon Tay said, there is only the front  door.

There is no back door to AFTA because the Rules of Origin are

very clear on this issue - 40% within ASEAN, you are in.   If

you  are not in, you are out, whether or not you have an  FTA

with  Singapore.   This is in writing and all  the  Ministers

understand this.  But what is interesting is that many of our

neighbours  are  thinking along the same lines  as  us.   The

former   Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Supachai  from   Thailand,

supported  Singapore fully in our efforts and the new  Deputy

Prime  Minister has indicated his support for Thailand having

FTAs  with Australia and New Zealand.  Even Malaysia, I  have

heard  from Japanese officials that they have been approached

for  an FTA between the two countries.  I believe by what  we

have done, the dynamics have altered for the better and it is

clearly our objective to keep ASEAN strong and vital and  use

ASEAN as our own base to move into the extended region.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Singapore Business Federation, Mr Leong Horn Kee

and  Mrs  Lim  Hwee  Hua asked about its  progress.   I  have

earlier  announced that the Government will enact legislation

requiring companies and businesses with a paid-up capital  of

$0.5  million  or  more  to be members  of  the  SBF.   These

companies  can  either join directly or via a chamber  or  an

association.  A Protem Committee is being formed to establish

and  run the SBF until the first council is elected.  Amongst

other things, it will propose a constitution for the SBF  and

help MTI to draft legislation and we will expose the draft to

the  business  community so that all views are  incorporated.

The Committee will be chaired by Mr Stephen Lee, Chairman  of

SNEF,  and  would  include  representatives  from  local  and

foreign  chambers.  I will release the list of members  later

this afternoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need a Board of Trustees to own the properties

of  the  SBF and ensure that the key appointments of the  SBF

council  are  not  filled  by unfit candidates.   The  Protem

Committee  will ensure that the SBF represents the collective

interest  of businesses in Singapore, not just the big  boys,

but  also  the  small  players.  And  all  the  three  ethnic

chambers  must  be included.  As foreign companies  based  in

Singapore  contribute  significantly  to  our  economy,  they

should  also be adequately represented.  I hope that the  SBF

can be established by 1st September, assuming that Parliament

agrees with the legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tourism promotion, I fully agree with Mrs Lim Hwee

Hua  that  value-added measures are a  better  gauge  of  our

tourism  performance.  I will just give an example to support

Mrs   Lim's  point.   Although  visitor  arrivals  have  been

increasing  annually  by  4%,  from  1989  to  1999,  visitor

expenditure,  narrowly  defined, remained  flat  during  this

period  because the average length of stay in  Singapore  has

gone  down.  We have become so efficient, and also  per  diem

expenditure has come down.  But if we look at overall tourism

receipts  and  spin-offs  to the  larger  economy,  then  the

benefits are greater.  But I agree with Mrs Lim Hwee Hua that

we should look at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>

how we collect the indicators and present them to members  of

the public.  As to her remarks about specific proposals under

Tourism 21, this will be released shortly to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On GLCs, Mr Leong Horn Kee talked about the dangers of

GLC  dominance in Singapore.  This is a subject which I  have

given  a  response to, which I should not  repeat  here.   Is

there a danger that GLCs are absorbing too many of our bright

"A"  level students through scholarships and bonds?  I am not

sure,  because parents now have more means and our  best  and

brightest  now have more alternatives open to them.  If  they

join the Government, the Armed Forces, the GLCs, non-GLCs  or

if they decide to work overseas, it is really their decision.

Even  for  bonds, there is no compulsion.  There is a  market

operating  for bonds.  And it is like financial  instruments.

In  the  end,  you  have different packages, students  decide

which  one  they  are interested in and they make  their  own

decisions  and  all agencies, including Government  agencies,

will  have to compete for their fair share of talent.  But  I

do  not  see,  in the next phase of our economic development,

the public sector cornering as large a proportion of the best

and brightest, which we had to do in the last lap when we had

to  build  up the basic institutions of state.   On  GLCs,  I

understand that a Parliamentary Question has been  filed  and

next week, the Minister responsible will give a full reply on

how we intend to divest our GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sentosa, Mr Leong Horn Kee asked about its

development.  You have read in the papers that Mr  Philip  Ng

has  taken over from Mr Alan Choe as Chairman.  Mr Alan  Choe

gave  his  life to Sentosa. He was there when  it  was  still

Pulau  Blakang Mati. He was there at the conception.  He  was

the  one who heard from Winsemius that we should not turn  it

into  a  fuel farm but conserve it as a tourism  resort.   He

created the corporation, he chaired it.  He knows the  island

like  the  back of his hand.  If today Sentosa  has  such  an

international reputation, it is because of Mr Alan  Choe.   I

would like today to record MTI's deep

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>

appreciation to him for his tremendous contribution.  I thank

him also for agreeing to stay on to remain as Chairman of the

exciting  Sentosa Cove development.  We are ready  to  launch

but  because  the property market has suffered significantly,

we  decided  to  hold  back for six months  to  reassess  the

situation  before deciding whether or not we  should  launch.

For  those of you who play golf on Sentosa island, you  could

have seen it from a vintage point and seen how beautiful  the

site is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the People Mover System on Sentosa, we are

reviewing  it  because we have been reviewing  the  long-term

plans  in  Sentosa.  We have got to be mindful of  the  cost.

Whether  or  not  such a mover system should be  extended  to

Sentosa Cove depends on whether the economics justify it  and

whether additional investment is more than made up for by the

increase in property values.  These are issues being reviewed

and it is premature for me to give you details right now.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, can I take the two cuts

together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> The need for a Fair Trading Act in

Singapore in today's context cannot be understated as it  has

been pursued by at least two of my predecessors in CASE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to consider such an Act began with the need to

address  the  problems faced particularly by HDB dwellers  in

their  quest  to  rid  themselves of  the  persistent  vacuum

cleaner  salesman who would not leave their premises even  at

midnight  until a deal was closed.  The salesman would  exert

high pressure sales tactics, mislead the consumers on product

functionalities, cajole the consumers and if all things fail,

I understand that in the dead of the night, play the sympathy

card  of losing their job, having mouths to feed and  so  on.

Regrettably, at the end of the day, consumers then in the 80s

had no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>

protection of the law as there was no cooling-off period  and

high-pressure sales were not easy to prove.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, such was not actionable in court due to

the   subtle  difference  between  misleading  and  deceptive

conduct  which  the law would catch and that which  it  could

not.  For example, as long as an armchair was top leather and

the  bottom could be PVC, there was no remedy to the consumer

who  thought  he  was  buying  a  full  leather  armchair  or

represented that that was leather.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation evolved to the more sophisticated time-share companies in the 90s, and which still persist today and

where  consumers  are "losing" millions of dollars  in  high-pressure sales.  For example, young couples are identified on

the streets and then told of lucky draw winnings.  A visit to

the  company's premises, however, is necessary to collect the

prize.   Both couples suitably enticed find that the trip  to

the  time-share  company can be the  beginning  of  the  most

trying part of their marriage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE has been told of couples being led from room to

room once inside the time-share company's premises, bombarded

by sales person after sales person.  Even more horror stories

of  drinks  being  spiked, and other  unconscionable  conduct

being practised by these companies.  The problem is very real

as bouncers are sent in some cases to collect dues, and after

the deal is closed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some even engaged lawyers to chase an airtight deal

where  consumers had been made to sign away all their rights.

CASE  has  seen  contracts  where the  consumer  signs  every

possible right away.  CASE has seen women and men of all ages

including professionals in a dilemma as to what to do. As the

sums are large, CASE has to deal with the trauma and emotion,

and even threats of suicide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the above illustrations show that, notwithstanding

the laws we have in Singapore, there are still loopholes that

we have to plug. More businesses have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>

joined  our call for a Fair Trading Act as such an  Act  will

rid  their  respective industries of rogue traders  who  give

them  a bad name and also will mean that businesses can  then

compete  on  a level playing field and hence reduce  business

costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister can consider implementing a

Fair  Trading  Act  to further enhance Singapore  as  a  fair

trading business hub and shopping hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on to my next cut on trustmark. In an open

market like Singapore, where goods and services can flow into

the  country freely, we must protect both consumers and  good

traders.   To  achieve  this, we need to  instill  trust  and

confidence  among  consumers and traders.   Although  a  Fair

Trading  Act will provide the necessary legislative framework

to  attain  a fair trading marketplace, consumer  and  trader

education  also plays an important part to ensure  that  fair

trading business transactions take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the development of Singapore into a global

trusted   business  hub,  CASE  has  embarked  on   two   key

initiatives, namely, CASETRUST, an accreditation  scheme  for

good business practices, and Consumer and Trader Education  - a  long-term programme for educating consumers and traders to

enhance consumer protection in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for trustmark, CASE has announced its CASETRUST award

in  December  last  year. It is preparing grounds  to  enable

businesses  to  adopt  good business  practices  and  achieve

business  excellence.  I hope that the Ministry  can  provide

funding  to  spearhead  this scheme  to  be  a  national  and

international  trustmark for Singapore.   Consumer  education

has always been a key thrust in enhancing consumer protection

.  To-date, CASE has launched a series of intensive education

drives  aimed  at  the grassroots, consumers and  businesses.

Such  drives involve rotating around the constituencies  with

seminars, speeches at both macro as well as micro levels.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry can consider setting up a consumer

education fund where like-minded organisations like CASE  can

tap  on  this  fund to provide education to  consumers  on  a

sustained   basis.   In  countries  like  New   Zealand   and

Australia,  government support has enabled many organisations

to  provide  useful  consumer education  materials,  such  as

leaflets  and information booklets, to consumers.   Educating

consumers will help to avoid and thereby reduce disputes, and

will be good for businesses overall.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, we should control

and   regulate  suppliers  through  legislation  to   protect

Singapore  consumers better.  As my parliamentary  colleague,

Dr Teo Ho Pin, has said much of what I wanted to speak on,  I

will only repeat his call and urge the Ministry of Trade  and

Industry to consider introducing  a Fair Trading Act.  I will

only  add  that  such  a  Fair  Trading  Act  should  contain

provisions that make it an offence for suppliers to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) make false or misleading representations in relation

to  the  nature, characteristics, suitability or quantity  of

the products or services;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) engage in conduct that is unconscionable; some

examples  are  where  the supplier unduly influences,  exerts

pressure or uses unfair tactics on consumers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) engage in misleading and deceptive conduct in

relation to the goods or services; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) use bait advertising to lure customers, eg, a

supplier  cannot  advertise a service at a  particular  price

with no expectation of honouring it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Trade and Industry would

consider introducing such an Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, on electricity, there have been

several reports and statements made by the Government about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>

the  intention to privatise the generation of electricity and

allow  more players into this sector.  This move is supported

and  welcomed  by the people, because it is hoped  that  with

more   private  sector  players,  the  service  delivery   of

electricity will improve, and electricity rates will be  kept

low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent sharp increase in electricity charges has

created  much  concern to the common people and the  business

sector.  This has added to living and business costs.  Hence,

Sir,  I raise this cut so that I could ask the Minister  what

is  the  status with regard to attracting new operators  into

this   sector.   How  soon  or  how  much  faster   can   the

privatisation effort be pushed along?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I wish to ask whether the Government will

allow  private operators to buy electricity from neighbouring

countries, like Malaysia, for sale to Singapore-based  users.

It  may  be  possible  that there are  occasions  for  excess

electricity generated by Malaysia which they are prepared  to

sell  to  us at competitive rates.  Unlike water, electricity

is a less emotive and critical utility.  We should favourably

consider  sourcing  electricity from Malaysia  if  they  have

excess  to sell and we can use this source to supplement  and

cover for the peak electricity demand periods.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, my issue on electricity is the

power  disruptions that we have faced in the past few  years.

In the year 2000 alone, my company experienced 10 disruptions

of  electricity.  So the whole industrial estate  down  there

was affected.  This is too many, especially for the high-tech

wafer  fab, petro-chemical and semi-conductor industries.   I

therefore have the following issues:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is a need for more accountability and

penalties   for  the  electricity  distribution   agency   to

compensate affected companies.  In this case, PUB  should  be

responsible  to compensate companies affected  by  the  power

trips.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in liberalising the electricity industry, what

safeguards will be put in place to improve and not worsen the

standards of electricity supply?  How can we be sure that  we

will  be  able to avoid a similar disaster like the one  that

recently  occurred  in California?  Our high-tech  industries

cannot  afford such type of power disruptions.  It will  just

create  problems to our reputation for bringing in  high-tech

industries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

electricity is an indispensable basic need in modern life for

all  families.  The increase in the tariff rates  will  exert

great  pressure on all families, especially the lower  income

group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1999, tariff rates have increased from 11.7 cents

per  kilowatt  hour  to  19.87 cents per  kilowatt  hour,  an

increase of 70% in one year, putting the man-in-the-street in

fear of more increases and feeling the pinch of the high cost

of  living.  The Minister has explained that it is because of

the increase in fuel oil prices, but this is unconvincing and

the problems of fuel price increase and the mounting pressure

on people's livelihood cannot be resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask how does an energy supplier

work  out the tariffs.  How much is their profit?  What  sort

of  formula  do they use?  And what is the cost per  kilowatt

hour?    Currently,  we  also  use  the  heat  from   rubbish

incineration to generate electricity, this is not affected by

fuel  price  increases.  I would like  to  ask  the  Minister

whether  any alternative means to generate electricity,  such

as  solar  energy, natural gas and nuclear energy  have  been

considered.   How  would  the Government  ensure  that  after

privatisation,  electricity tariffs will not  become  a  huge

burden on the people?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my cut is on

water.   Without   adequate water supplies, Singapore  cannot

survive.    Water   is  the  key  to  Singapore's   survival.

Therefore,  the importance of sufficient water supply  cannot

be over emphasised.  The bulk of our water supply is from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>

another jurisdiction  -  Johor.  Singapore has invested large

sums  of money to build the Linggui catchment area in  Johor,

which  has sufficient water and a water processing plant,  to

give a constant supply of processed water to Singapore.  From

time  to  time,  we hear of disturbing news from  across  the

Causeway.   Threats are made by political groups  over  there

calling  on  their  government to cut  off  water  supply  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Johor government announced that they

shall  be  requiring much of the water supplied to  Singapore

for  their  own  use, and that they shall be  building  water

processing   plants   themselves.   All   those   news   make

Singaporeans  very uneasy.  The older generation Singaporeans

can still remember that when the Japanese Imperial Army early

in 1942 reached Johor Bahru, they cut off the water supply to

Singapore,  and quickened the surrender of Singapore  to  the

Japanese Imperial Army on 15th February 1942.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two water treaties with Johor. One expires in

about 2011 and the other sometime in 2062.  Singaporeans know

very little of the contents of these two agreements.  Can the

Minister  give  the salient points in respect  of  these  two

water   agreements?   Is  it  possible  for   the   Malaysian

Government, under these two agreements, to restrict  or  even

stop  the supply of water to Singapore?  There seems to be  a

lot  of  uncertainties  regarding  the  supply  of  water  to

Singapore  from Malaysia.  In the light of what is  happening

so far, including the threatening remarks made by Abdurrahman

Wahid,  the Indonesian President, after his recent  visit  to

Kuala Lumpur, the Government has announced that the long-term

solution  to  Singapore's water problem is  to  make  use  of

recycled water, which also includes recycled sewage water.  I

would  like  to ask whether such recycled water is  only  for

industrial  use,  and  that  only  water  obtained  from  the

desalination plant is for human consumption.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I made the cut

on  the  same  point  as Mr Chiam's, to  try  to  reduce  our

dependency on Malaysia for water.  My tack, however, is quite

different.   I  believe it should not be  a  trump  card  for

Malaysia  or  any  other  country to  hold  over  our  heads.

Moreover,  in  the future, studies suggest that Malaysia  and

indeed the whole region will be facing shortages of water  of

sufficient quantity and quality.  As such, I would  urge  the

Ministry to look more closely at desalination, recycling  and

efficiency.  These should be our watchwords and should be  on

stream  earlier.  Possible measures should include water  use

audits,   incentives  for  households  and  the   design   of

facilities.   Tapping rainwater should also  be  improved  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these improvements, we should develop more security

in  meeting our water needs.  Consequently, I would urge  the

Ministry  that  we  can and should be more realistic  in  our

negotiations  with  Malaysia on this issue.   The  agreements

last until 2062.  We need not and cannot expect guarantees of

water   that  extend  well  beyond  the  lifetimes  of   most

Singaporeans.   It  may  not be  possible  and   may  not  be

realistic, given the future contingencies for Malaysia's  own

needs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Sir, let me deal first with the Fair Trading

Act.  I can understand Dr Teo Ho Pin's concern about consumer

protection but, truly, the best advice anyone can give to the

buyer  is  still the legal maxim caveat emptor  or  "let  the

buyer beware".  We should do well to remember the meaning  of

the  cliche  "There's no free lunch."  Ultimately, if a buyer

is  not careful or succumbs to a moment of greed, it is  very

difficult to save him from being cheated or overcharged.  And

therefore  consumer education must continue to  be  the  main

pillar  or  our  policy  on  consumer  protection.   In  this

particular  area of consumer education, I want  to  place  on

record MTI's appreciation of the good work that has been done

by CASE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving forward, I would encourage CASE to take on an

even more influential

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>

role.   As  the  natural focal point for consumers  to  raise

their  concerns, CASE would be able to sift through  all  the

complaints, and help deserving cases to seek redress  through

the  Small Claims Tribunal and the courts.  CASE could  then,

in  fact,  be the de facto fair trading office, but  separate

from Government, so that the work is not politicised.  But it

would allow CASE to perform many of the watchdog functions of

safeguarding  and protecting the consumers.   These  are  two

important points which Dr Teo and Dr Lily Neo are proposing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that CASE would need more teeth, and sharper

teeth,  in  order to carry out its work.  CASE,  as  well  as

several  Members  of  the House, has for some  time  already,

sought MTI's support for a Fair Trading Act.  The purpose  is

to  prohibit deceptive and unconscionable sales tactics  like

bait  advertising, misrepresentation, as described by Dr Lily

Neo,  or  hard selling, which seems not uncommon among  time-share marketeers.  However, we should always be mindful  that

consumer  protection legislation that is  too  onerous  would

increase  business  costs for both retailers  and  consumers.

And  if CASE is agreeable, I would suggest that MTI and  CASE

jointly  lead a task force to discuss ways to strengthen  our

consumer  protection  laws,  including  the  possibility   of

enacting a Fair Trading Act and the means to empower CASE  to

carry out its role more effectively.  Representatives of  the

task force can come from the Government, CASE and the private

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo has also suggested setting up a new consumer

education  fund.   In  1996, we actually  started  a  funding

mechanism  where the Government contributed dollar-for-dollar

donations  made  to  the CASE Endowment Fund.   And  I  would

encourage  CASE  to  seek  greater  contributions  from   the

community,  so  as  to ensure that CASE continues  to  remain

relevant to the people it serves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On electricity, Mr Leong Horn Kee has asked about the

liberalisation  of  our energy market.  This  is  progressing

well.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>

The  energy sector is an important component of our  economy.

Within  the  broader framework of keeping our business  costs

competitive,   we   have   to   keep   our   energy    market

internationally competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st April, Singapore Power will divest its two

generation companies  -  Power Senoko and Power Seraya  -  to

Temasek  Holdings and reposition itself as the owner  of  the

transmission  and  distribution system, which  is  a  natural

monopoly.  Singapore Power will be regulated and will not  be

allowed  to  participate  in the  competitive  parts  of  the

electricity business.  Temasek, in turn, will divest all  its

three generation companies  -  Power Senoko, Power Seraya and

Tuas Power  -  with no limit on foreign ownership.  This will

take  place  in  the second half of the year, after  the  new

electricity  market  begins  operating.   Work  on  the   new

electricity market is in progress and should be ready in  the

second  half  of this year.  The Energy Market  Authority  of

Singapore to be set up in April will take over the system and

market  operations of the electricity system  from  Singapore

Power.    It  will  be  responsible  for  the  security   and

reliability of the energy supply.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will allow consumers to buy electricity from

competing  retailers  in  stages,  starting  with   the   big

customers.  Initially, some 11,000 customers who take up  70%

of  our total electricity demand will be able to do this.  By

the   year  2003,  households  will  also  be  able  to   buy

electricity from competing retailers.  Since the announcement

of the liberalisation last year, five new retailers have been

licensed and are preparing to enter the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong asked about the import of electricity from our

neighbours.  This is already allowed, but so far it has  only

been  used  for  emergencies.  However, for  system  security

reasons,  the import of electricity from overseas is  limited

to a maximum of 600 megawatts.  We are prepared to allow more

import under our new market structure, if these are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>

economic.   However, it must not affect our  system  security

and reliability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh commented on power dips and the need

to ensure a reliable supply of electricity.  I agree with him

that  this  is an area where more improvements can  still  be

done.   Last year, there were a total of 34 dips,  two  fewer

than  in 1999.  Recent dips have been due to recurrent faults

in  cable joints in two types of cables.  PowerGrid will take

all  these  faulty cables out of service by the  end  of  the

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also introduced several measures to control

companies  that  cause power dips.  Construction  contractors

face  stiff  penalties should they damage electrical  cables.

Licences for both the customers' electrical installations and

their  licensed electrical engineers will be suspended should

they repeatedly cause voltage dips.  Generation companies and

the  grid owner will also be fined if they cause dips.  These

series  of measures emphasise that we will not tolerate  acts

that  would  undermine  the reliability  of  our  electricity

supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang referred to the high cost of

electricity.   Electricity tariffs are  set  to  reflect  the

economic  cost of power generation.  Fuel oil makes up  about

half  the  cost  of producing electricity.   We  are  totally

dependent  on  imported fuel to generate  electricity.   When

world  fuel oil prices increase, electricity prices  have  to

follow.   However, Singapore Power has tried to moderate  the

impact by spreading the tariff increase over a longer period.

We  cannot subsidise the consumption of electricity  as  this

would  lead to over-consumption and mask the real cost.   The

best  way  to  assist low-income families is to provide  some

income  support through rebates and the Utilities Save Scheme

which the Government has just announced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay and Mr Chiam spoke on the need to secure

our  water supply through a combination of sources.  This  is

indeed  the strategy that we are taking.  We ensure that  our

water strategy is robust by diversifying our sources.  First,

we will continue to maximise local supply.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>

Already 50% of our land is used for water catchment,  and  we

have  implemented  stringent pollution  control  measures  to

protect  these catchments.  Secondly, we will try  to  expand

our  regional  supply.   We have a long-term  agreement  with

Malaysia.  Thirdly, we are also exploring the development  of

water resources in Bintan.  We are also exploring development

of  water resources by harnessing technology to augment these

supplies.   We will build sea water desalination plants.   We

are  putting  in place infrastructure to recycle  used  water

into  ultra-clean  water, which we have called  NEWater,  for

supply to those industries which require large quantities  of

high-grade water, such as wafer fabrication plants.  For  new

sources   of  water,  we  will  encourage  private   sector's

participation  by  leaving the choice of  technology  to  the

market  and  for  the companies to supply water   to  PUB  on

commercial terms.  Together, this three-pronged strategy will

ensure  that  Singapore's water needs will be adequately  and

securely met in the 21st century.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification.

The  Senior  Minister  of  State has  not  answered  the  two

questions  I  raised.   One,  is whether  the  Government  is

considering  using other sources for electricity  generation,

for  instance, solar power or even nuclear power.  The second

question is:  how does the Government ensure that the cost of

electricity  will not be a heavy burden to the  people  after

the power supply company is privatised?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> On the question of other sources of

energy  for  the generation of electricity,  it  is  not  the

Government's policy to use nuclear power, and solar power  is

not  something that is commercially feasible on a large scale

at  the moment.  There are other sources such as coal,  which

seems  to be too pollutive.  We do not have any hydroelectric

power.  So, at the moment, fossil fuel remains to be the only

viable source as far as electricity is concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to what measures do we have to ensure that

the  cost of electricity will be kept low, it is hard to  say

as that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>

depends  on  fuel cost.  But we want to create an environment

where  there is competition, and in the new structure,  which

you  will  hear  later,  we  want to  ensure  that  there  is

contestability; in other words, on the supply side  and  even

on  the  retailing  side.  At both ends of the  whole  supply

chain,  there will be competition where there will be several

players.  The only thing we could do would be to ensure  that

there is an environment of competition.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, with your permission, may I

seek  another  clarification.  Would the Senior  Minister  of

State agree to release the formula in which Power Supply uses

to  calculate the tariffs of electricity?  Because I think it

is  important that people understand how much is the cost  of

electricity generation and what is the benefit or the  profit

that is imputed into the tariff.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> I think the cost of electricity

generation  has been explained here several times;  something

like half the cost is the fuel cost.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> What is the formula? What are the

details?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> If he will file a separate Question,

that will be answered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, with the benefit of not having

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently an owner of a JTC industrial property

needs  the  approval  of JTC to sell or transfer  to  another

party   such   a  property,  both  are  of  course   business

organisations.  In granting the sale, JTC gives its  approval

on  condition that the subject property must be reinstated to

its  original  condition.  I am aware of one such  sale.   At

this   juncture,  I  wish  to  declare  my  interest  as   an

independent  director  of a company  that  has  sold  such  a

property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reinstatements will include such things as to

repair   damaged  fencing  and  driveway  along  the   common

boundary,  to  paint  the factory buildings,  prune  and  cut

overgrown vegetation and overhanging tree branches,  to  tidy

up  and clear up premises and remove debris from drains,  and

so  on.  I understand that even in HDB's case where the buyer

and  seller  are both individuals, the rules on reinstatement

are  much  simpler now.  As long as the buyer is prepared  to

accept the property as it is, HDB usually waives the need  to

reinstate the property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of the property in question, which apparently

was  delayed by the reinstatement and approval process,  took

some  five  months.   In this present day of  business  where

business is conducted at Internet speed, I think we  all  can

agree  that five months to be allowed to transfer a  property

seems like forever.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I shall be brief,

taking into account the time that we have left.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that we had discussed in this House at a

sitting  in  January  this  year  the  issue  of  electricity

charges.   At that time my colleague, Mr Leong Horn  Kee,  in

response   to   the  reply  from  the  Minister,   raised   a

supplementary  question which touched on the issue  of  price

volatility and how we could overcome it.  I believe the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>

issue  of  fluctuation in prices of electricity  charges  has

been  a  cause  of concern to consumers.  In his  reply,  the

Minister agreed that we do not want day-to-day fluctuation in

prices  of  electricity charges as this may cause disturbance

in the market.  The Minister had also agreed that, in theory,

Singapore  Power  can  go into the futures  market  to  hedge

against  price  fluctuation.  Sir, I think this  is  an  idea

worth  pursuing  as the futures market is  a  mechanism  aims

precisely at preventing extremities in price fluctuation.  In

a futures market, forward contracts can be fixed at a certain

price  and the contract will be honoured irrespective of  the

changes  in  the oil prices.  Consumers, on the  other  hand,

must  be  educated in understanding that they  cannot  expect

Singapore Power to supply power at low tariffs all the  time.

What   they   can  expect,  however,  is  the  stability   of

electricity  prices.  Of course, the prices of oil  may  come

down after it has been hedged, such is the way of the market,

if consumers want stability in electricity charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Minister to kindly consider

looking  seriously  at  oil  price  hedging  as  a  means  of

stabilising the price of electricity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng):</b> Sir, Mr Chng Hee Kok

raised  the issue of reinstatement of industrial property  to

the  original  condition  upon its  sale.   Reinstatement  of

industrial  property  to  the original  condition  is  not  a

requirement  for the transfer of JTC's industrial properties.

However,  where  there  are  breaches  to  these  terms,  for

example,  when  unauthorised structures are  erected  in  the

premises,  the  buyer  or seller must regularise  the  breach

prior  to  the completion of transfer.  Otherwise,  JTC  will

withhold  consent.  JTC only requires companies to  reinstate

their  premises upon returning them to JTC.  This applies  to

both tenancies and leases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng also mentioned that HDB's policy is more

liberalised.   From  what  I  understand,  HDB's  policy   on

reinstatement of industrial property is similar

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>

to JTC's.  It means that if there is a breach of lease terms,

they   have  to  reinstate  the  property  in  its   original

condition.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann commented about the utilities charges.

Due   to  rising  fuel  oil  prices,  we  had  to  raise  our

electricity tariffs three times last year.  Fortunately, fuel

oil  price  has  since eased.  Last month, tariffs  for  non-domestic  consumers were lowered.  However, we still  had  to

raise  the  tariffs  for residential and  small  non-domestic

consumers  because Power Supply has not fully  recovered  its

under-collected  revenue from this group  of  customers.   If

fuel oil price does not increase beyond its current level, we

can  expect electricity tariff for residential and small non-domestic consumers to come down slightly within the next  few

months.  Fuel oil futures predict a decline in prices in  the

coming months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin also raised the issue whether it is possible to

hedge against price fluctuation.  As the Minister replied  in

January to a parliamentary question that the players may also

guess wrong, then consumers would also face problems.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, it is hard to imagine the breach

includes  things like painting of factory buildings,  pruning

and  cutting overgrown vegetation, overhanging tree branches,

tidying up the premises.  Sir, I can understand when a breach

involves   an  unauthorised  structure.   That  has   to   be

corrected.  But I cannot imagine that overgrowing  trees  are

part  of  a  breach.  That is very hard to  understand,  Sir.

When  I  mentioned HDB, I was referring to the  sale  of  HDB

flats and not industrial property.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> As I said just now, it is the policy

of  JTC to require the owner of the property to reinstate  to

its  original  condition, if there is a breach of  the  lease

terms.  In this particular case mentioned by the hon. Member,

if he can give me the details, we will follow up on this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I do not deny that, with hedging,

we  can get it wrong.  But I suppose the issue really is  one

of price

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>

stability.   What the consumers do not want are high  tariffs

all  the  time, but whether or not they can expect a  certain

stability  in  electricity  tariffs,  instead  of  having  it

subjected to changes every now and then.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> Power and electricity tariffs are

reviewed  quarterly based on fuel oil prices at the  time  of

review.   Changes  in fuel oil prices are passed  on  to  the

consumers,  which is fair.  Fuel oil makes up, as  my  Senior

Minister  of State said, about half of the cost of  producing

electricity.  If oil prices increase after the review,  Power

Supply  would have under collected its revenue.  But, on  the

other  hand, if oil prices decrease, Power Supply would  then

have over collected.  Power Supply is allowed to recover  its

under-collected  revenue or, alternatively,  is  required  to

return  over-collected  revenue to  consumers  in  subsequent

quarters.   Because this is done quarterly, it allows  us  to

respond to the changes in oil prices quickly.  We think  that

this is a very efficient way of responding to the changes  in

oil  prices.  But, where appropriate, we also try to moderate

the  price increases by staggering the increase over a longer

period of, say, more than three months.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently we have wave upon wave of earthquakes,

from India to El Salvador.  Besides physical earthquakes, the

Southeast Asian region is also vulnerable and prone to social

and  political  earthquakes and upheavals.   These  political

earthquakes  open  up  fault  lines  of  race,  religion  and

political struggles of power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of the Asian financial crisis, the strategic

landscape  in Southeast Asia has not changed for the  better.

Indeed, it has turned for the worst.  Southeast Asia  is  now

at  the crossroads, buffeted by storms and whirlpools.   Many

of  the  countries  in  the  region  are  in  the  throes  of

transition.   In  the Philippines, we have another  round  of

people's  power which ousted President Estrada.  In Thailand,

we  have  a change of government, and the new Prime Minister,

Mr  Thaksin,  narrowly escaped a bomb blast recently  at  the

Bangkok  airport.   In  Malaysia, there  are  also  political

uncertainties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia, Sir, is not the same after Surharto.

President  Abdurrahman Wahid is facing  increasing  pressures

from inside and outside of Parliament, and some regions, like

Aceh, are seeking secession.  In Kalimantan, we have horrific

reports  of Dayaks head hunting the Madurese.  No  one,  Sir,

knows  for  certain what is in store for Indonesia.   In  the

midst of the upheavals and uncertainties in the region, it is

foolhardy  to  neglect defence.  Remember, when we  separated

from Malaysia and became independent in 1965, we had only two

infantry  battalions; no artillery, no armour, no  Air  Force

and no navy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore can stand tall and confident because we

have  a  strong SAF.  No one can bully us.  No one  can  just

walk  in and walk over us.  Any fund allocated to the SAF  is

without doubt money well spent.  It is an investment  in  our

security: an insurance.  If there is no SAF, there would  not

be an independent and free Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam claims yesterday that we are

spending too much money on defence and that we are giving too

much  priority to defence.  He is mistaken.  He  should  read

Sun Tzu,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>

the  famous strategist who wrote the classic 'Art of War'  in

the  4th  Century BC.  Sun Tzu tells us that  states  can  be

undermined, subdued or conquered.  The only guarantee is wise

leadership,  good strategy, robust defence  and  a  resilient

economy which can fund the defence expenditures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun Tzu proclaims that defence is a deadly serious

business, that ultimately decides the fate of states, and the

fate  of the people.  In the very first paragraph of his 'Art

of  War',  Sun  Tzu  says, "Defence is  a  matter  of  utmost

importance to the state; it determines the life or  death  of

the state; the road to survival or ruin."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the key to victory is, as Sun Tzu puts it, the use

of  the right strategies.  And the ultimate aim of strategies

is  to  overcome  an  opponent with  the  minimum  of  force,

conquering   an   enemy  already  defeated   psychologically,

dislocated or out manoeuvred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should therefore learn from Sun Tzu and never

let  our  guard down.  We must stand by and be ready for  any

scenario.   We  must  monitor  the  events  and  developments

closely, scan the horizon, or the radar screens, and take the

necessary  precautions  and steps.   We  pursue  peace,  with

goodwill  to  all men.  But peace can only be  attained,  and

maintained, if we are able, ready, and has the will to defend

our  homeland and our interests.  To have peace, we  must  be

ready  for  war.  It is a matter of deterrence.  As President

Theodore  Roosevelt once said, "speak softly, but  carry  the

big stick."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, defence is everyone's business. It is the business

of  every  Singaporean.  It is total  defence.   Let  us  all

support  defence  and  endorse the Defence  budget.   It  has

always been the cornerstone of Singapore's policy that  there

should be a balance of power in the Asian region.  We welcome

in  this  context  the  presence of major  powers,  as  their

presence  will help to balance the forces in the region,  and

thereby maintain peace and security for all of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now have a Republican in the White House. We

hope Singapore will enhance the good economic and defence

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>

ties  with  the United States, and President George  W.  Bush

will  keep the United States engaged in the region.  So  far,

analysts are not very clear about the position of the new  US

Administration,  and  the new steps or initiatives  President

George  W.  Bush  will take.  In this context,  therefore,  I

would  like  to  ask  the Minister on his assessment  of  the

security  situation in Southeast Asia and  the  role  of  the

major powers in our region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 1989, Singapore has participated in a number

of  peacekeeping  operations.   In  1999,  Singapore  sent  a

medical and logistical support team to East Timor, as part of

the  UN  peace-keeping mission.  I am sure such participation

in  the  UN peace-keeping is much appreciated by all  parties

concerned, and the SAF officers and men have learned valuable

lessons from such peace-keeping operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the situation arises, I hope MINDEF will consider

other  requests  for  UN peace-keeping missions,  within  the

limits of our resources.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the past year has seen an

increase  in  unrest  in  the  region.   Certainly,  in  some

countries,  we have seen a rise in the level of  turmoil  and

uncertainty within the population.  Not only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>

have  we  seen  the  unusual replacement of  a  president  by

popular  means,  we have also witnessed the senseless  ethnic

violence in rioting that has led to a needless loss of lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is taking place in these countries is, obviously,

of concern to us here because of the possibility of the knock-on  effects.   These effects may be as diverse  as  providing

humanitarian  assistance  or  a  weakening  of  defence  ties

because of a change of regime at the top.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further afield, I note with great interest that China

has   decided   to   increase  its  defence  spending   quite

dramatically.   It seems that the decision  to  increase  its

defence  spending was motivated by its relations with Taiwan.

The   Allied   bombing  of  Kosovo  last  year,   it   seems,

precipitated  such  a  decision  to  increase   its   defence

spending.   In  that campaign, the US was able to  pound  the

Yugoslav government into submission, without having  to  pour

in  massive troops on the ground.  It dawned upon the Chinese

then  that  they  were  behind  the  West  in  leveraging  on

technology to fight a modern war.  Since the US is willing to

sell  advanced  weapons  to Taiwan, the  Chinese  were  quite

rightly  concerned  with the strategic implications  of  such

military assistance.  Hence the build-up of arms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any build-up of arms is always a challenge to peace

and  stability, particularly when it is set in a region where

the  parties have made it clear, in no uncertain terms,  that

they  would resort to arms conflict, if necessary, to resolve

their differences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, it is our stated policy that we welcome

the  US  to  maintain  a  balance of  power  in  the  region.

However, not everyone welcomes the US presence.  The Chinese,

I  believe, are deeply suspicious of the assistance that  the

US  would provide in the event that the two Chinas do  battle

to  settle their long-standing differences.  Having a  strong

US  presence  at their doorstep, and being in a  position  to

intervene at short notice, would not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>

give the Chinese government any comfort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, against the limited scenario that I have painted, I

have  a  number  of  questions to ask.   These  are:  Is  the

Government  ready to deal with the whole spectrum  of  issues

that may arise from the instability in the region?  Secondly,

is  our  defence  relations with our neighbours  affected  by

these uncertainties?  Thirdly, will our continued strong ties

with the US affect our neutrality as a country and put us  in

a difficult position with mainland China?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore is strategically

located at the heart or hub of Southeast Asia, with sea lines

and lanes of communication radiating outwards from Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore straddles the access to the Straits of

Malacca, the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, as well as

the  Indonesian archipelago.  East-West trade from Europe and

the  Suez  Canal passes through India to Southeast Asia,  and

onward to China and Japan in East Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These very sea lanes are not only our trade links, but

also  our  lifelines for food and essential  items  that  are

imported  wholesale to sustain our population.  For the  sake

of security, trade and essential supplies, we must keep these

vital  sea lanes open and accessible to shipping and  passage

at all times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from time to time, there are reports of piracy in

the  seas, as well as attempts by illegal immigrants to  land

on  our shores.  I would like to ask whether the SAF and,  in

particular, the Air Force and the Navy, have been  beefed  up

to   meet  this  challenge  of  keeping  the  sea  lanes   of

communication open.  And whether, in view of the  sea  change

in  Southeast Asia and the resulting uncertainties, that such

vital sea lanes would continue to be kept open.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of our limited resources, we cannot patrol the

vast seas and the sea lanes entirely on our own.  Indeed, the

cooperation  of the major powers would be necessary.   May  I

ask  what  is  the current Singapore position on  cooperation

with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>

the  major  powers  in  keeping these  vital  seas  lanes  of

communication open to all of us?

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the events over the

last   few  months  highlight  that  the  regional  situation

continues to be an uncertain one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big power rivalry continues in the Asia Pacific. The

recent   increase  in  China's  defence  budget   cannot   go

unnoticed, and raises questions as to its long-term  policies

and  ambitions in the region.  The recent visit by  President

Putin  to Vietnam seeks to reinforce the view that Russia  is

not completely out of the race in Asia.  The change in the US

administration again raises the question as to the new policy

orientation of the US towards the Asia Pacific region.   Will

the  new Bush administration continue US involvement  in  the

region and maintain its military presence in Asia?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both North and South Korea have shown good improvements

in  their  bilateral  relationship.  But uncertainty  in  the

relationship  continues.   The  China-Taiwan  issue   remains

unresolved and sabre-rattling can be expected from China when

the  US arms sales to Taiwan is reviewed in April 2001.  Sir,

numerous  claims of sovereignty over disputed territories  in

the South China Sea still continue to plague the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these, political manoeuvering, greater regional

autonomy, independence movements and ethnic clashes  continue

in  Indonesia.  The threat of refugee outflow from  Indonesia

is  there,  as  was  recently seen in Kalimantan.   That  the

threat is near can be seen in the recent troubles in the Riau

Islands  when  riots broke out.  People power and  democratic

change  have  changed the political scene in the  Philippines

and Thailand.  In Malaysia, the political situation is tense,

and analysts are wondering how the government will respond to

the many challenges facing the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Defence to share

with us how MINDEF sees the regional security situation,  and

as to how Singapore and the SAF are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>

prepared,  and positioned, to ride the tide in the  midst  of

this turmoil.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like to join

my  colleagues in the GPC for Defence and Foreign Affairs  in

highlighting the security outlook in Southeast Asia and  East

Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southeast Asia has seen disturbing developments, if not

upheavals,  in recent times.  Even as they are smarting  from

the recession and the political turmoil in some countries, we

can  see continued problems that are cause for worry.  In the

past  one  and  a  half  years,  there  have  been  political

leadership   changes  in  Indonesia,  the   Philippines   and

Thailand.  There have also been leadership changes  in  major

countries  further  in  the East - in the  United  States  of

America and in Taiwan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China continues to threaten to use armed force if Taiwan

pursues  independence.  The mood for unification of  the  two

Koreas  has excited a lot of people although, in reality,  it

is not likely to happen in the near future and tension in the

peninsula  could continue.  Then, there is also the  question

of  whether  the new US administration would continue  to  be

engaged, or more engaged, in Southeast Asia and East Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these in the background, there are possible

uncertainties in terms of security in Southeast Asia and East

Asia.   I  would like to ask the DPM and Defence Minister  to

share  with  us his views on this matter and, in  particular,

the US defence policy in the region.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More directly, in our own neighbourhood, I am concerned

with  the political turmoil in Indonesia.  The racial  strife

in  different parts of Indonesia and the continued  call  for

independence  in  at  least  two provinces  could  result  in

massive   outflows  of  people  to  neighbouring   countries,

including Singapore, bringing with it the potential  security

threat  to  our people.  The breakdown of law  and  order  in

neighbouring  countries  could also  lead  to  the  increased

threat of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>

piracy,  terrorism  and  kidnapping,  which  will  turn  away

tourists and investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues pose a security threat to the whole of

Southeast  Asia  and  in  East  Asia  in  general,  not  just

Singapore.  In many instances, we have worked, and  continued

to work, with several countries to combat the rise of illegal

immigrants,  piracy, kidnapping and terrorism.  Has  regional

cooperation  to  combat  this kind of  security  issues  been

successful?   Could the Minister elaborate on the  strategies

and  measures  that Singapore has taken, and  will  take,  to

counter  these threats?  What is the Ministry's  strategy  to

remind  Singaporeans of the need to be alert and vigilant  to

these possible non-conventional threats?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, in this modern world, we must

not  only  build  up our armed forces and train  them  to  be

operational  and  ready, but we should  also  pursue  defence

diplomacy and build up a good defence relationship  with  the

armed forces of the neighbouring countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good relations with neighbouring armed forces could open

up  opportunities for cooperation in defence  matters.   Such

cooperation,  through  bilateral and multilateral  exercises,

dialogues, the ASEAN Regional Forum and visits would  enhance

confidence building amongst the countries concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in difficult times when political relations are

strained, such good ties amongst the armed forces could  help

to serve as a buffer and bridge for understanding.  May I ask

the  Minister  for  an update on the SAF relations  with  the

neighbouring  armed  forces and whether such  relations  have

improved  or  declined  in the wake of  the  Asian  financial

crisis?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of multilateral defence arrangements, we

have   the  Five  Power  Defence  Arrangement  (FPDA)   which

comprises  Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Australia

and New Zealand.  FPDA has been in existence for 30 years.  I

believe FPDA is still relevant today.  However, I would  like

to ask the Minister

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>

whether  there are any plans to strengthen FPDA  and  enhance

the quality of FPDA exercises.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, I would like to make three

related points on the issue of our defence relations with our

neighbours  in  ASEAN.    The first  is  whether  the  recent

fluctuations  in  our  relations with neighbouring  countries

have  affected  our  bilateral defence relations  with  them.

Relations with neighbouring countries seem to be coloured  by

the   personality  of  leaders.   In  the  past  few  months,

Singapore  has  been sharply but wrongly  criticised  by  the

Indonesian President, Mr Abdurrahman Wahid.  Has his outburst

against  us  affected  defence  relations  between  our   two

countries?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has enjoyed close and warm relationship with the

former Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI).  Considering the  fact

that  the armed forces in Indonesia has reduced influence  in

the   past  one  or  two  years,  do  we  still  enjoy   warm

relationships with the TNI, which is the successor  of  ABRI?

Would  recent developments in bilateral relations affect  our

air training facilities in Indonesia?  In the case of defence

relations  with Malaysia, would the Minister also  share  the

progress that we have made in our relations with Malaysia?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to the multilateral defence

relations,   the   Five  Power  Defence  Arrangement   (FPDA)

involving  Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand  and  the  United

Kingdom and, of course, Singapore.  Could the Minister inform

the  House  if  the  member countries  will  continue  to  be

committed to the FPDA, considering the fact that some of them

have been facing budget constraints?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point relates to defence diplomacy in general.

We  would  like to engage more countries in defence relations

so that we can have enhanced relationship and defence network

with  them.   There has been a report in the  Jane's  Defence

Weekly  last  December  about  the  interest  of  Vietnam  to

establish closer defence relations with Singapore.   Would we

be  able  to  take  up  the offer of  closer  relations  with

Vietnam?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, it has been our stated policy to

maintain  multilateral  and  bilateral  defence  ties  as  an

integral part of our defence architecture.  To this  end,  we

maintain  bilateral  defence ties  with  our  neighbours  and

friends  and  also  multilateral  ties  with  several   other

countries.  These ties have essentially served us  well.   We

have  been  able  to  leverage on them  to  procure  training

grounds  for the SAF and also to help deepen relationship  to

promote peace and stability in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sizeable number of defence ties which we have

been  able  to maintain, perhaps, none is quite as  prominent

and  well-established as the Five Power  Defence  Arrangement

(FPDA)  which  was  started in 1971 with UK,  Australia,  New

Zealand  and  Malaysia.  Even after 30 years,  the  FPDA  has

become one of the main pillars for defence arrangements.   As

recently as a couple of weeks ago, Britain reiterated that it

would  honour the FPDA and would defend Singapore should  the

need arise.  It is indeed reassuring to note the words of the

Defence  Secretary, Mr Geoffrey Hoon when he said, "I  cannot

see circumstances arising where if Singapore is attacked, the

Republic could not look to the United Kingdom for support  or

circumstances where we would not want to give that support."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the backdrop of the importance of the FPDA, we

were naturally concerned when Malaysia decided to reduce  its

level  of  support some years ago, ostensibly on the  grounds

that it is facing constraints in the budget arising from  the

financial  crisis.  There were also some problems  I  believe

that were technical in nature and that hindered the extent of

cooperation among the member countries of the FPDA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Sir, that Malaysia has since started

participating  again  in  FPDA  exercises.   The   continuing

participation  of  Malaysians in  the  FPDA  arrangements  is

indeed  encouraging to all of us.  I would like  to  ask  the

Minister  whether the problems that we have with Malaysia  in

respect  of  the FPDA have been resolved and,  whether  going

forward, we can expect the same level of commitment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>

from Malaysia with the rest of the other FPDA members.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, we have, since our independence,

been  very  supportive and involved with the United  Nations.

We  have continued to contribute whatever support we could to

the continuance and strengthening of the United Nations.   In

becoming  a  member  of the United Nations Security  Council,

Singapore  seeks  once  again to  contribute  to  the  United

Nations to serve in a capacity which is equal to its ability.

Indeed, on the United Nations Security Council, Singapore has

been   given   the   difficult  task  of  investigating   and

instituting sanctions against Liberia. The trouble spots  are

increasing  around the world as civil wars occur for  various

geographic, ethnic and religious reasons.  We see the  United

Nations  sorely  stretched in terms of cash and  manpower  to

cope  with increasing demands for peace-keeping troops around

the  world.  Because of its small size, Singapore  has  given

what  it  can in the past and, most recently, in  the  United

Nations  Peace-keeping Force in East Timor  in  the  form  of

medical and transport services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its current role in the UN Security Council, a

responsibility  which Singapore will hold for  the  next  two

years,  will  there be greater demands on us contributing  on

peace-keeping   duties  through  the  United   Nations?    If

expectations  rise  due  to  Singapore's  membership  on  the

Security  Council, will the contributions asked, in terms  of

cash and manpower or both, be entertained or be responded  to

by Singapore?  Would the Minister give some light to this?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I rise on the same point on Singapore's

participation in UN peace operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have participated in a number of these operations

including those in East Timor and, where we have served,  our

personnel have received high marks for their preparation  and

professionalism.  On Singapore's part, those who have  served

do  us  proud and also gained valuable experience.  I believe

that  we  should build on the experiences to do more  for  UN

peace operations.  We cannot contribute

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>

much in absolute numbers compared to larger armies like those

in  India  and  Pakistan.  I believe, however, we  could  add

values in three ways and I encourage the Minister to consider

these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is the speed of our response. The United

Nations  sometimes experiences long delays  in  getting  firm

commitments  from  countries and further  delays  in  getting

people to the ground.  Singapore can be a small but rapid and

effective  force in peace-keeping.  Second, in our  training.

We  should  work  with others to share in training  military,

police and other uniformed personnel for UN peace operations.

Africa  has  a  regional  institute for  training  in  peace-keeping.    Asians   should  consider   starting   one   too.

Singapore's  ASEAN neighbours, like Malaysia, the Philippines

and  Thailand,  have also served in UN peace operations.   We

should  train  together with them and  others  still  further

away, like Australia, New Zealand and Japan.  Sir, I want  to

emphasise here that I am not talking about military exercises

but training and exercises for peace-keeping.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like the Minister to consider is

in  our  ability  to  integrate civilian  participation.   In

addition   to   uniformed  personnel,  UN  peace   operations

increasingly require civilian participants.  This is  because

of  the complex nature of peace operations that often involve

reconstruction and administration, as we see in  East  Timor.

Additionally,  they can benefit from preventive  actions.  In

these   cases,   civilian  administrators,  special   envoys,

election monitors and others play important roles.  Singapore

has  a  good  Administrative Service  and  a  large  civilian

reservist  population.  It is well-suited therefore  to  help

provide such participants from the civilian side for UN peace

operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there would always be a limit as to how much we can

help  but  I hope in terms of speed, preparation and training

and   civilian  integration,  we  can  help  make  a  quality

contribution to UN efforts.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> I rise to share the similar concerns

of my colleagues, Mr Hawazi Daipi and Mr Simon Tay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore became a non-permanent member of the United

Nations  Security Council in October last year for  a  three-year  term.   As  a  non-permanent  member  of  the  Council,

Singapore shoulders the expectations of one who occupies  the

centre  stage  in  the  international  scene.   Singapore  is

therefore expected to conduct itself in a manner that  befits

itself  as  a  member of the Council.  One such  expectation,

whether  rightly  or  wrongly perceived,  is  that  Singapore

should  also  play  a  bigger role  in  peace-keeping.   This

expectation  is  in  keeping with the increasing  numbers  of

peacekeeping  missions  that  the  United  Nations  has  been

undertaking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last ten years, the United Nations has never been

busier.   From Balkans to Cambodia and East Timor, UN  forces

have  been  asked to monitor and maintain the  fragile  peace

that  was  brokered  under  its auspices.   In  this  regard,

Singapore   has   played  its  part  as  a  member   of   the

international  community in contributing to the peace-keeping

efforts  of the UN.  We participated in peace-keeping efforts

in  such  places as Kuwait, Cambodia and, most  recently,  in

East  Timor.   In all these places, our people on  duty  have

done us proud.  This has enabled us to fly our flags high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each peace-keeping mission is different and missions

vary  in  form  and content.  In some cases,  UN  Forces  are

constantly caught up in a cross-fire in the front  line.   In

others, they are kept in the rear to maintain law and  order.

Singapore's   participation  in  international  peace-keeping

efforts has to date been confined largely to relatively  low-risk operations.  However, I do envisage that there would  be

a  time when we may be involved in operations that are  high-risk in nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister the following question:

what  is  the  experience  that  we  have  learnt  from   our

participation in peacekeeping efforts overseas and whether we

are ready to participate in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>

high-risk peacekeeping operations should the need arise?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Sir,

first,  I  would like to thank the Members of Parliament  for

their valuable and pertinent comments on our defence policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have enjoyed another year of peace and stability. We

have  gone  through the economic crisis and emerged stronger.

We  can  take  pride  that as a nation we remained  cohesive,

helped  each  other  and took the bitter  medicine  that  was

necessary to enable us to recover quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience in the last three years, 1997-1999, will

help  us  in the coming years.  It will not be smooth sailing

ahead.   The  economic situation in the region has  generally

improved.  But it is not yet clear what will happen to the US

economy  and  the  impact  this will  have  on  the  regional

economies, including Singapore's.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important lessons we learnt from the

Asian  financial  crisis  was how  quickly  and  unexpectedly

things  can  take a turn for the worse.  We should  also  not

forget  how  the  economic  crisis  quickly  developed   into

political  crisis in some countries.  There was an  immediate

and  devastating  impact on political  stability  and  social

order and these effects continue to be felt in many parts  of

the region.  None of us can help but feel concerned about the

recent  destabilising events which we read in our  newspapers

or watch on television.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Dr Ong Chit Chung has said, as a small country

in  the middle of a rather turbulent region, Singapore  would

be  wise not to take our peace and security for granted.   We

weathered the economic crisis well because our policies  were

built  on  a strong foundation.  And we will need  this  same

strong   foundation   to   see  us   smoothly   through   the

uncertainties that lie ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important element in our defence policy is our

people  -  their will and cohesiveness, and their willingness

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>

to face reality, make tough decisions and implement difficult

measures.  Another key element of this strong foundation is a

strong defence capability.  Without a credible defence force,

we  will  not have the political space or peace  of  mind  to

focus on economic growth.  We will not be able to secure  our

future.  Nor will we be able to do our part to contribute  to

regional peace and stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr Ravindran have

asked  me  to  comment  on the security  environment  in  the

region.   Sir,  last year, I told this House that  there  was

greater uncertainty in the regional security environment, and

the  developments  of  the past year  have  not  allayed  our

concerns.    How  relations between the new US Administration

and Beijing work out will determine the climate for the whole

Asia-Pacific.   A stable Sino-US relationship  is  vital  for

regional peace and stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relations between Japan and the US, and between Japan

and  China,  will also have a bearing on regional  stability.

Singapore   wants   to  see  the  triangular   US-China-Japan

relationship  remain stable.  And we continue to  affirm  the

importance  of a US military presence for regional  stability

and security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer home, there are political transitions in several

regional countries.  Some of these transitions and leadership

changes  have been accompanied by considerable socio-economic

dislocations  and  instability,  and  sometimes  even  by   a

breakdown  of  law  and order and bloodshed.   The  political

forces  that  have been unleashed will take a  long  time  to

settle  down.  The unstable political and security  situation

will  make  economic  recovery even more difficult  for  some

countries,  as it has severely undermined investor confidence

in this region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these developments could have a more direct

impact  on  us.  The violence in the Malukus and  Kalimantan,

for example, triggered off an exodus of tens of thousands  of

people  fleeing  from  the violence.  Similar  outflows  from

areas nearer Singapore would have a direct

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>

impact on us and on our neighbour, Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic hardships have also led to a significant

increase  in the number of illegal immigrants and a  rise  in

piracy.   Fortunately  the SAF, working closely with the Home

Team,  has   done well to keep these problems from  affecting

Singapore.   The  spate of illegal immigrants   in  1998  was

quickly   brought   under  control  after   we   stepped   up

surveillance and took tough action against those we caught.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piracy has risen in regional waters. But in the area in

the  Singapore Straits, where our Navy and Police Coast Guard

conduct    coordinated   patrols   with   their    Indonesian

counterparts,  there  has been no report  of  piracy  or  sea

robbery since April 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, the political developments in

regional countries have had an impact on their relations with

Singapore.   We have been subjected to some criticisms,  even

some   intemperate   words  have  been   used.    These   are

perturbations in our relations with our neighbours  which  we

have to manage with a combination of diplomacy and firmness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi Daipi has asked whether the more negative

attitude  of  some quarters has had an impact on our  defence

relations.   Sir,  the  SAF's relations with  the  Indonesian

Armed Forces remain robust.  There is a substantial volume of

cooperation  and interactions  -  some of which have  carried

on  uninterrupted for 20 to 30 years.  Both armed forces find

these  interactions to be of great benefit  for  professional

development   as   well  as  for  building   friendship   and

understanding,  and  both sides have  said  they  want  these

interactions to continue and be strengthened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed concern about whether the

SAF  is prepared to deal with low intensity security problems

and  what  measures the SAF will take.  Sir, I  informed  the

House  in last year's Budget debate that MINDEF and  the  SAF

will be working more closely with other Ministries and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>

agencies, in particular the Home Team, to prepare contingency

plans  to deal with such problems.  I am happy to inform  the

House  that we have made good progress in developing many  of

the  concepts,  frameworks and operational  plans  to  tackle

issues involving low intensity conflict.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not enough just to work out Singapore's

own responses and contingency plans.  There also has to be  a

stable environment.  This means working to achieve peace  and

stability  around the world, and in our region in particular.

When  regional peace and stability is threatened by  problems

in  one country, recent history teaches us that international

effort  is  sometimes  necessary.   The  involvement  of  the

international  community in East Timor is one example.   This

means  that we must work with other countries to develop  the

strength  and vitality of the international system,  both  on

the  security and economic fronts, with the aim of  promoting

peace  and  stability.  And we must be  prepared  to  act  in

support of this aim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations has a vital role to play in bringing

about a stable security situation in the region. The UN is an

important  component of the international system which  helps

enhance our security, because the UN plays a critical role in

promoting   peace  and  stability  around  the  world.     We

therefore  strongly support the UN.  Here, our membership  of

the  UN  Security Council will give us more opportunities  to

contribute to international security.  There will  be  higher

expectations  of us to do more. Where we can contribute,  and

in a way that is useful, we will.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a total of some 800 SAF personnel have been

involved  in  12  UN  peace-keeping missions  over  the  past

decade.   Currently, the SAF is participating in  three  such

missions - UNIKOM at the Iraq-Kuwait border, UNTAET  in  East

Timor, and UNMEE in Ethiopia and Eritrea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Mr Simon Tay that we are also

contributing  to the peace-keeping work of the  UN  in  other

ways. SAF officers share our training practices

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>

and   establish  networks  for  UN  peace-keeping  operations

through peace-keeping seminars and training programmes.   And

in  this spirit, Singapore would welcome a regional institute

for peace-keeping training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has also subscribed to the UN Standby

Arrangements  since  1997.   These Arrangements  enhance  the

responsiveness and effectiveness of UN peace-keeping efforts,

and  we have committed planning officers, military observers,

medical personnel and police officers, as well as helicopters

and  transport  aircraft  on  standby  for  UN  peace-keeping

missions.  We will continue to explore what other ways we can

help  to  make  the  world and especially  our  region   more

peaceful, stable and secure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides playing our role as a responsible member of the

international  community, our security is  also  strengthened

through  defence diplomacy.  Over the years, MINDEF  and  the

SAF  have  developed a good network of bilateral  and  multi-lateral  defence  relationships.  Some  of  these  are  long-standing,  such as the Five Power Defence Arrangements  which

celebrates its 30th anniversary this year and is still  going

strong.   Some  are more informal in nature but  nevertheless

very  useful, such as the conferences and military  exercises

we  have organised to bring together many regional countries.

And,  of  course, there is a very large number  of  bilateral

interactions and exercises which MINDEF and the SAF have with

countries,  not just in the Asia-Pacific but  also  in  other

regions, notably Europe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our overseas training also helps us develop friendships

and strong links.  Today, the SAF trains regularly in about a

dozen countries all over the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a peaceful and stable strategic environment is

best  assured  by  several layers of  security:  firstly,  by

having a strong international system under the United Nations

to  deal  with  threats to peace and stability; secondly,  by

developing   the   regional  security  architecture   through

bilateral  and  multi-lateral  arrangements  like  the  ASEAN

Regional Forum

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>

and  the  FPDA;  thirdly, by promoting defence diplomacy  and

friendly  ties  with  all countries, including  Vietnam;  and

finally,  at  the  core, by building  a  strong  SAF  as  the

cornerstone of our strategy of deterrence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have no control over what happens in other

countries,  and  this  is all the more  reason  for  constant

vigilance  and  a  strong SAF.  There  is  a  wide  range  of

contingencies that we may have to deal with, and they may hit

us, as we have evidence in the last few years, with little or

no warning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing expertise and capabilities to deal with new

situations  and demands takes time and effort.   The  vision,

planning and prudent investment that we put in over the  last

30-odd years have served us well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF is a professional and capable force that is well

regarded  and respected by others.  To tackle the  challenges

ahead,  we  must  continue  to invest  in  the  best  people,

technology and equipment.  Defence technology remains  a  key

component  of  our efforts to strengthen the  SAF.   We  will

continue to invest in R&D to maintain our technological edge,

both  by  our  own  efforts as well as in collaboration  with

partners in our universities and overseas.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF will also continue to invest in effective

equipment  and weaponry that can best fulfil its missions   - whether  this is by upgrading existing equipment  and  weapon

systems  or  developing our own products to meet  our  unique

defence requirements, or procuring new equipment from foreign

manufacturers  when these best meet our needs.   However,  we

must remember that what determines a successful operation and

victory  on  the  battlefield is not so  much  technology  or

equipment but the men and women who serve in the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF firmly believes in investing in people, and we

have always made it a priority to attract the best and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>

brightest  by  offering  a  career that  is  challenging  and

rewarding.  Over the past three years, we have developed  the

New  Partnership  schemes  for the  SAF  officer  corps,  the

warrant  officer  and  specialist corps,  and  MINDEF's  non-uniformed  personnel. These enhanced career  schemes  aim  to

provide first class careers to attract first class people  to

work in MINDEF and the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we work hard to develop the SAF's capabilities, we

must  never forget that the SAF is a citizens' army, and  the

bulk of our strength comes from our NSmen and NSFs.  They are

your  average Singaporean, although what they do in  the  SAF

certainly puts them above the average Singaporean -  both  in

terms  of  the capabilities they have developed  and  in  the

commitment and effort we expect of them.   MINDEF, and indeed

all   Singaporeans,  recognise  their  contributions  to  the

defence of our nation.  MINDEF therefore convened RECORD III,

chaired  by Minister of State David Lim, to address  many  of

the issues of concern to our national servicemen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, Singaporeans have since the earliest

days  of our independence, recognised the critical importance

of  having a strong defence capability.  Dr Ong Chit Chung in

his  speech  has  said that a strong defence is  a  necessary

investment  to  secure our future.  And I am  sure  that  all

Singaporeans will share his sentiment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a strong defence capability is an investment

which  requires  not only money but also the  hard  work  and

sacrifice  of  all Singaporeans - not only  those  who  serve

national  service  but also their families  and  loved  ones.

Building a strong defence force involves sacrifice.   But  it

is  a necessary sacrifice.  Because, Sir,  without the SAF to

secure our peace and stability, Singapore has no future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have responded to many of the major points which

have been made by Members of Parliament.  My colleagues,  the

Second Minister for Defence and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>

Minister  of State for Defence, will deal with the  remaining

points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I rise to encourage the Ministry to

increase  transparency in defence policies as  a  confidence-building  measure.   I do so because some mistakenly  believe

that defence policies should be shrouded in absolute secrecy.

I believe history shows that to the contrary.  Conflict often

resulted because one side did not know or understand what the

other  side  was doing or intended to do, and  therefore  the

lack   of  understanding  and  transparency  could  lead   to

conflict.    Knowledge,  understanding   and   exchange   can

therefore help to lessen the chances of conflict.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) to which the Minister has

referred  is  now the leading multilateral security  dialogue

for  our  region.  The ARF has suggested that  defence  White

Papers and security outlooks be published and exchanged.   In

this  way,  I  hope that we will play our part in  developing

defence  diplomacy  and  its  regional  institutions  a  step

further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Armed Forces has already taken a

commendable step in this direction - a publication last year.

More,  however, can and should be done.  No state secrets  of

course   need   to   be   given  away.    However,   reliable

international  reports  and  publications  that  are   openly

available, such as Jane's, already give more than the  MINDEF

publication  has  done.   I would ask MINDEF  to  participate

fully  and enthusiastically in these initiatives and to  help

set  the highest possible benchmarks for defence White Papers

as well as other confidence-building measures.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, Singapore actively participates in efforts to promote

transparency  and  confidence-building.   Indeed,   we   have

organised activities and participated in initiatives  by  the

ARF   and   various  regional  countries  that  help  promote

dialogue, understanding and cooperation among regional  armed

forces and defence establishments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last year, as Mr Tay has said, we published

"Defending Singapore in the 21st Century" which sets out  our

defence  policy  in some detail.  There are also  initiatives

under  ARF  auspices  to  exchange information  among  member

countries as a form of confidence-building.  Besides this, we

also  take  the opportunity to explain our defence policy  at

various bilateral conferences and seminars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, transparency is not only about what is

published,  what we say, but, more importantly, what  we  do.

The  most  effective  way  to  promote  transparency  is   to

encourage  more  interactions among  regional  armed  forces.

MINDEF and the SAF hosted about 120 visits by senior military

and  defence officials of a large number of foreign countries

last  year, that is more than two visits a week.  So  at  any

one  time, somebody is visiting us and we brief them and also

find  out more about them.  Many of these were visits to  SAF

units  and  bases  by  armed forces and service  chiefs.   We

participated in about 80 bilateral and multilateral  military

exercises,  that is about one-and-a-half a week  on  average.

So  we are always participating and working with armed forces

of different countries all the time.  For instance, we hosted

Exercise Pacific Reach 2000, a submarine rescue exercise that

brought together more than 600 participants and observers and

several  navies  in the Asia-Pacific region.  Singapore  also

organised many conferences and forums, some of them under ARF

auspices,   such  as  the  Combined  Humanitarian  Assistance

Response Training course which was attended by defence, civil

affairs  and foreign affairs officials from 17 ARF countries.

Then,  there  were  events such as the Millennium  Air  Power

Conference,  which  was  attended by air  force  chiefs  from

countries  all  over  the world.  Those defence  interactions

help  participating  armed forces to  learn  more  about  one

another, thereby contributing to mutual understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, MINDEF and the SAF have taken practical steps

to   promote  transparency  and  confidence-building  in  the

region.  The success of such efforts

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>

depends  on  the contributions of all regional countries  and

not  just  Singapore alone.  And we will continue to  do  our

part at a pace that others are also comfortable with.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I must applaud MINDEF for

building  nice and well-designed training camps, for example,

the  new  basic  military  training camps  at  Pulau  Tekong.

Visitors  are  indeed very impressed by the new and  upgraded

facilities there.  Even the food, I dare say, is delicious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I hear lament from some old soldiers, the `Lau

Ping',  that the training is not what it used to be and  that

the  training has gone soft.  The old soldiers talk about the

times  when they had to run up and down Peng Kang  hill  with

full packs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I hope the Minister will assure us that

the  training is no less rigorous and vigorous,  despite  the

very  nice  setting there, and our soldiers  are  as  fit  as

fiddle, and have the fighting spirit or warrior spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that most operationally ready National

Servicemen take their in-camp training very seriously.   They

are  prepared to make the sacrifices and take the disruptions

to  their  careers  in their strides when they  go  for  such

training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that they ask is that their time in training be used

productively.   What  they hate most is to  wait  around  for

their slot for shooting at the range for a long time, or wait

for their transport, or hang around for the next phase of the

exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask MINDEF if it can cut down such `idling'

time,  and  make  in-camp training even more productive,  and

perhaps  some  in-camp  training  could  even  be  shortened,

without forgoing quality or operational readiness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with the advances in technology and changes

in the political landscape, military threats have changed and

evolved over time.  Besides full frontal attacks, we have  to

prepare for chemical attacks, terrorist attacks, hijacks  and

electronic warfare, for example.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister if MINDEF and SAF have

developed  new  capabilities to deal with such  threats,  and

whether the SAF is ready operationally on D-day, whenever  it

happens, or when the chips are down.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, the SAF we have today is the

outcome of years of investment in people and equipment.   The

SAF is a modern and well-integrated fighting force with sound

doctrines.   It puts much effort and resources into  training

and  it  is  operationally ready to deal with any contingency

that involves our national security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we may be a conscript armed forces, the

Singaporeans who serve national service know that they are as

important  a part of the SAF's capabilities as regulars.   So

they  take their training very seriously and they are  always

heartened when they benchmark themselves against the seasoned

armed forces that they exercise with and come out well.   And

we  have exercises with armed forces like the US Armed Forces

at the National Readiness Centre and have come out quite well

compared  to regular US forces.  As the House is  aware,  the

SAF  also  conducts regular mobilisation exercises to  ensure

that  we  maintain  our high state of operational  readiness.

And  I am happy to say that the turnout rate in the past  few

years  has  almost always surpassed 95% for the  mobilisation

exercises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the SAF is basically made up of urban Singaporeans

living  in a relatively small island, we do give our soldiers

exposure  to  a  wide  variety of  training  because  of  the

extensive  training  facilities  or  opportunities  that  are

provided  to us by various friendly countries in  the  region

and  beyond.  So our soldiers - our Air Force, Navy, and Army

-  are  in  fact training all over the world, in  the  United

States, Australia, Thailand, Brunei, and elsewhere.  And they

get a lot of operational experience both by rubbing shoulders

with  their  counterparts of other countries as  well  as  in

operating in various types of climates and terrains, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>

this prepares them for a wide variety of contingencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have in recent years seen how the SAF

successfully executed a number of missions when  called  upon

to  do so at short notice.  This was possible only because of

our  operational readiness.  The more recent  missions  which

the SAF executed with distinction, and which all Singaporeans

are  familiar  with, include the evacuation  of  Singaporeans

from  Phnom  Penh and the recovery operations  following  the

SilkAir  crash  in  Palembang, and our  participation  in  UN

missions, INTERFET and UNTAET in East Timor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF is geared to fight any external aggressor who

may  threaten Singapore's security and territorial integrity.

But  there  are  other  sorts  of  security  challenges  that

Singapore may have to deal with, apart from these -  what  Dr

Ong  has mentioned, chemical, biological, electronic warfare,

and  so  on, which our defence research institutes,  together

with  the  SAF, conduct research and equipping on contingency

basis  for our soldiers, so that we are prepared and we  know

what  to  do  should such a threat arise.  But  we  are  also

preparing  the SAF to deal with other forms of low  intensity

threats  which DPM Tan referred to earlier.  But such threats

cannot  be  dealt with by the Ministry alone.   An  effective

response  requires coordinated efforts of  all  the  relevant

Government  agencies,  and  the SAF  will  continue  to  work

closely  with  these  agencies  to  expand  our  spectrum  of

capabilities to deal with these security challenges.  We will

also  continue  to work with the international  community  to

ensure  that  such  potential threats do  not  undermine  our

security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our camps may look comfortable and our food may be

good,  though not as good as the home-cooked food of Dr  Ong,

which  I  had the opportunity to sample after his  invitation

last  year,  I  must  say  that the standard  of  operational

training  and discipline is maintained.  So while  the  camps

are  comfortable, they are designed for the soldiers to  rest

when  they need to rest, so that they will be ready to  train

vigorously  with  full intensity and with full  concentration

when they need to do so.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I want to thank the Minister

for his assurance that the SAF is fighting fit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that all National Servicemen would thank

MINDEF  for  convening  Record III, the  Third  Committee  to

Recognise the Contributions of Operationally Ready  NSmen  to

Total  Defence.  The recommendations of Record III  are  far-reaching indeed.  Here, I wish to highlight two areas which I

believe have practical significance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Top on my list is the exit permit control. Previously,

NSmen  have  to apply for Exit Permits whenever  they  travel

overseas.  Now, with Record III's recommendations, NSmen need

only  apply  if  they  travel overseas for  more  than  three

months.  Moreover, a standardised multi-trip Exit Permit  has

been introduced to cut down red-tape, and applications can be

done  online  via  Internet.  This would  save  us  time  and

eliminate all the hassle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know, as my sons now do not have to queue up

every  so  often  when they travel overseas  for  studies  or

holiday,  and I do not have to follow them to  CMPB.   It  is

quite a great relief to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other recommendation of significant value to NSmen

is  the  award  of  bonus points for entry to  institutes  of

higher  learning.  Such bonus points are part  of  the  point

system  for  co-curricular activities  (or  CCA)  and  is  in

recognition of NS contributions and performance.  May  I  ask

the  Minister  to elaborate on how the bonus points  will  be

awarded and when will the scheme be launched.  Further,  will

such a scheme place the ladies who do not do National Service

at a distinct disadvantage?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to allowances for full-time National

Servicemen, we know that allowances are deliberately kept low

and  are  not  meant  to be full-pay,  but  as  part  of  the

sacrifice, as part of their service.  But I wish to  ask  the

Minister  if he would consider revising the NS allowance,  to

keep  pace with inflation, and to help families who are  hard

hit by the economic downturn.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing  me  to join in this debate.  I would also  like  to

thank Dr Ong Chit Chung for saying half of the things which I

wanted to say in this topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support most of the recommendations of Record

III, but would like to seek the Minister's response to a  few

of the recommendations.  It was stated in the Report that the

Committee was mindful that golf courses take up land in  land

scarce Singapore.  Nonetheless, it went on to recommend  that

a  new golf course be developed at a suitable site.  It is my

hope  that  this  will  not be done at the  expense  of  more

pressing needs for the land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other recommendation, already mentioned by Dr

Ong,  was the need for clarification pertaining to the  award

of  bonus  points  to  deserving  NSmen  for  admission  into

institutions  of higher learning.  While this  proposal  will

provide  some  benefits and recognition  to  those  who  have

performed  well  during  National  Service,  will  it   place

Singaporeans who are not eligible to serve NS, such as women,

at a slight disadvantage?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, in-camp training for NSmen studying in

local  institutions of higher learning is currently conducted

during  vacation  periods to minimise  disruptions  to  their

studies.   With  the  education system now  emphasising  more

project  works and industrial attachments during the vacation

periods, the current training cycle may need to be changed to

accommodate  this  new  situation.   Now,  Record   III   has

recognised this problem and has recommended a review  of  the

NS  training cycle for NSmen in local institutions of  higher

learning so that they will not be caught between the  demands

of academic studies and NS training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would be grateful to hear the Minister's comments

on  these  points and also to ask whether the Government  has

accepted all the other recommendations of Record III.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, as we have heard

from  the  Minister, defence is placed high on  the  priority

list.  The Ministry of Defence has ensured that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>

equipping  our  forces  with modern  and  high-tech  weaponry

enhances  the  capabilities of our soldiers.   It  no  longer

requires  just  brawn but intelligence  to  be  an  efficient

fighting  man.   The Minister also stressed on the  important

contributions  our  NSmen made.  I would like  to  propose  a

scheme whereby the efficiency of our NSmen can be maintained,

yet the period spent under NS is shortened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most schools offer their students a chance of joining

the uniformed group as the National Cadet Corps.  In the NCC,

students  are  trained  in  the basics  of  military  skills,

including weapon handling.  It does not take much to  upgrade

NCC  training to cover the scope for basic military training.

If  this  is done, enlisted men who have spent at  least  two

years  in  the  NCC could be considered for much  shorter  or

revamped  basic  military training.  It may  be  possible  to

shave  off  a  few months from their overall  NS  commitment.

Training under National Service should be intensive and  less

time  consuming.  To a great extent, men can be prepared  for

National  Service by having them to join the  NCC  and  being

provided with pre-NS training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to needing less time under NS, our men would

treat  military training as just a normal process since  they

started training while still schooling.  Such a scheme  could

start  from  Secondary 3.  Those who continue into  JC  level

could  be provided with a wider scope of training to  prepare

and  test them as potentials for accelerated promotion to the

ranks of non-commissioned officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time spent under NS can be maximised with such a

scheme.  Enlisted men would already be familiar with military

training  and the terminology used.  Having the basics  under

their  belt,  they  can go straight into a  higher  level  of

training.   They  would thus require less time  to  be  fully

trained soldiers and can be released sooner to complete their

tertiary  education.   A  shorter NS  commitment  would  also

reduce  the disadvantage men face, in terms of time loss,  as

compared to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>

their  female contemporaries.  I hope that the Ministry could

give some consideration to this proposal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> First, I would like to thank the Deputy

Prime  Minister  for paying tribute to the  contributions  of

National Servicemen to the defence of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our full-time National Servicemen are the frontline

soldiers ever ready to defend Singapore.  The small allowance

that  MINDEF pays to National Service full-time men is  often

inadequate  and the family usually supplements the  allowance

to  allow the young men to have a quality of life that  their

station  in life requires.  However, not all National Service

full-time young men are as fortunate to be supported by their

family  members.  There are many who struggle on  the  meagre

NSF  allowance.  I have known cases where the young  man  had

gone  on  AWOL as he could not support the family on the  NSF

allowance and he had to go and seek employment to support his

family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the allowance NSF are paid is a matter that must be

reviewed regularly as the allowance is often inadequate.  The

last  review  was  done  some years  ago.   I  am  sure  that

inflation  and  the  cost of living have gone  up  for  these

allowances to be reconsidered.  I would ask the Minister  for

Defence  when MINDEF intends to review the NSF allowance.   I

also like to call upon the Minister to increase the allowance

substantially  so  as to allow the young men,  who  sacrifice

their youth for their country, to enjoy a decent standard  of

living.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am rising

also  to speak about allowance for NSF men.  The subject  has

been  brought up, I think, with some regularity during Budget

debates  and,  in 1996, I remember Dr Wang Kai Yuen  detailed

the  proposal for the payment of an amount equivalent to  the

employer's  and employee's CPF contribution,  at  that  time,

amounting  to  40% on an approximation of an office  worker's

starting  salary of $1,000 into CPF account for our full-time

NSmen.  The fees were reviewed and increases in the allowance

had been very much on the basis of financial hardship,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>

particularly,  for those NSF men who have to  support  family

members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am bringing up the matter again this time in view of

an  additional consideration which surfaced during the recent

intensive discussions that we have been having on the subject

of  the family, specifically encouraging our young people  to

get  married and settle down earlier.  Surveys conducted have

consistently indicated that, among the top reasons, our young

men and women delay getting married is to say that until they

can  afford to have a home of their own.  A scheme,  such  as

that  proposed  by  Dr  Wang, that  starts  building  up  CPF

balances  for the young men as they discharge their full-time

NS  obligation  would make a significant difference  and  how

soon  young  couples  are  able to  afford  that  downpayment

towards the home of their own that would start them off on  a

lifetime together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From previous responses from the respective Defence

Ministers, each time has been largely to remind us that NS is

a  responsibility  and an obligation of all male  Singaporean

citizens  and  that the philosophy is that  some  element  of

sacrifice  is expected.  The men are not considered  salaried

employees and their allowance is meant only to cover some  of

their basic daily expenses since their accommodation and food

are  already  provided  in camp.  I am  not  at  all  arguing

against   the  principle  that  NS  is  indeed   a   national

responsibility and obligation.  I would submit, however, that

in our current very fast paced environment, the commitment of

21/2 years in service to the nation with the consequent delay

in  completion of studies or of starting up in a career is in

itself already a significant sacrifice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore ask the Minister once again if he will

review the allowance for NSmen, in particular, with a view to

making some payment into CPF accounts for the men, regardless

of  the fact that it will be on an allowance, and not in  the

usual manner, on a salary?

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would also

join  my colleagues, Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Ravindran  and  Dr

Jennifer Lee, in asking

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>

the  Minister  to  review NS allowance as well  as  make  CPF

contributions.  I agree with them that it will not just  help

families.    It   will  also  help  in  our  pro-family   and

procreation  policies.  The fundamental thing is that  people

have  already sacrificed and made a contribution and I  think

we  should not make them lose out, in terms of opportunities.

The  other  arguments  which I have  have  already  been  put

forward quite eloquently by my colleagues.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.44 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Sir, we have heard this afternoon arguments reiterated as to

the   importance  of  the  SAF,  in  particular,  given   the

uncertainty facing us in the security outlook in the  region,

and  we  have  also  heard that National  Servicemen  are  an

important backbone of the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our National Servicemen are not reserves. They are

frontline  soldiers.   They  are trained  in  a  spectrum  of

operations  and,  if  called  upon,  they  must  be  able  to

undertake whatever missions or tasks that are given to  them.

It  is  for  this  reason that we convened, once  again,  the

committee  to  look at how we can recognise and  enhance  the

contribution of National Servicemen to defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RECORD III was convened last year. It comprised members

of   the   public   from   grassroots  organisations,   NSmen

themselves,  as well as their spouses, and some hon.  Members

of  this House.  We took a consultative approach, we even had

people  email ideas and suggestions to us, and we  had  focus

groups talking to National Servicemen to seek their inputs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process culminated in a set of recommendations,

which  were  announced last month.  I would like  to  put  on

record,  as Chairman of the Committee, my thanks to  all  who

participated  in  this process.  MINDEF,  together  with  the

relevant ministries and organisations, is now studying RECORD

III's proposals, and announcements will be made as and when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>

details  have been worked out.  We hope to implement as  many

of the recommendations as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me take the opportunity this afternoon to

deal with a number of issues that Members have raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On exit control measures, RECORD III has recommended the

relaxation of exit control measures to make it convenient for

NSmen  and  their families to travel overseas  for  work  and

leisure.  Some of the recommendations are that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The passports of Singaporean males who are between

11 and 161/2 years old be extended by two years, or up to the

age  of  161/2,  whichever is earlier.  These  are  for  pre-registrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The passports of Singaporean males who are above

161/2 years old, up until the time when they are enlisted, be

extended by one year.  These are the registrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The passports of full-time national servicemen be

extended by up to 10 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. A standardised multiple-trip exit permit be

introduced to replace the various types of exit permits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Singaporean males who are 11 years old and above,

and  have  yet to enlist for full-time National  Service,  be

bonded  by  deed,  rather  than  monetary  bond,  when   they

accompany their parents on overseas employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF recognises that, with increased travel, both for

work  and leisure, these are practical measures, and we agree

in  principle  to these recommendations.  The  implementation

agencies, including Singapore Immigration, CMPB and MHA,  are

now working out the implementation details and we hope to  be

able to put these measures into effect within a month or two.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Charles Chong has also raised the issue of the

NS  training cycle for NSmen who are in universities.   It is

true

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>

that  we had tried to schedule NS training, in-camp call-ups,

during  the  university vacations.  But with changes  in  the

educational  system,  more  and  more  project   work   being

introduced during vacation period, NSmen often write  in  for

deferments  so  that they can do their projects  or  take  on

special   tasks   and  assignments.   This   is   disruptive,

especially when we try to keep our NSmen together in the same

unit  as  they  progress through their 13  years  of  in-camp

training  cycle so that we build up the bond and  camaraderie

amongst the men.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RECORD III has recommended that the NS training cycle

for NSmen studying in institutes of higher learning (IHL)  be

reviewed, to help them manage both their academic studies and

NS  responsibilities.  NS call-ups could be synchronised with

specific vacation periods, when no academic programmes  would

be  conducted,  so that NSmen can go for NS training  without

affecting their studies.  In addition, the longer NS call-ups

could  be  confined to the vacation period during the  second

year  of  studies, so as not to clash with the more intensive

third and fourth years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the idea is that we would agree with the three

universities, to take a time slot in the second year, so that

NSmen  can  all go for their training during this  period  of

time.   MINDEF  is  now  working with these  universities  to

implement  this  recommendation, and we target  to  introduce

this new arrangement by next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of comments have also been raised

concerning  the award of NS points for university  admission.

RECORD  III has recommended awarding NS points for university

admission,  in  recognitiion  that  NS  contributes  to   the

development  of  desirable  qualities,  eg,  leadership   and

teamwork,  in  the  same  way that  co-curricular  activities

(CCAs)  in  the  school do.  This is in line with  MOE's  new

university  admission  system, in which university  admission

bonus  points will be awarded for students' participation  in

CCAs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong and Dr Ong asked whether the awarding

of  such points would be unfair to the females.  Let  me  say

that  we  are  now  working  closely  with  the  Ministry  of

Education  and  the  local  universities  to  evaluate   this

recommendation.  It will not be unfair to the females, but it

would be fair to the males.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, National Service is an important period in a

person's life.  During the two and half years of his service,

there  are  many  opportunities for a person  to  demonstrate

qualities that will help indicate whether he can successfully

undertake and benefit from a university education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What RECORD III is proposing is that if a person has

performed  well  in National Service, and has displayed  such

qualities,  then  this  is  one  of  the  factors  that   the

universities  should take into account  in  deciding  on  his

suitability for admission.  This should help the universities

obtain  a  more  holistic  appreciation  of  the  applicant's

abilities.  The bonus points awarded for NS will be given  in

proportion  to how well they do and how much they  contribute

during  National Service.  Of course, the universities  would

have to balance the various factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, MINDEF will consider RECORD III's recommendations

for bonus points, but on the basis that such points should be

subject  to the overall cap that the student could earn  from

CCA  in  school.  With this, Members can be assured that  the

recommendation   seeks  to  recognise  good  performance   in

National  Service, and it will not disadvantage  the  others.

Both,  those  who may not do National Service or girls,  have

the opportunity to participate actively in the schools in the

CCAs  and,  where they show the qualities of  leadership  and

teamwork  and  the other qualities that the CCAs  attempt  to

measure, they will also be eligible to get the maximum number

of bonus points so that it would not be unfair to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, for males who serve full-time National Service,

they   enter   the  job  market  later  than   their   female

counterparts.  Awarding NS bonus points to them is a  way  to

recognise their contribution

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>

and sacrifice.  It also recognises that NS develops desirable

qualities, just as those that the CCAs try to promote in  the

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF, MOE and the local universities will announce

details of this soon, once they have completed their study.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Charles Chong has asked about the new golf

course  and  why  this is necessary.  RECORD  III  made  this

recommendation because it recognises that the existing  SAFRA

Resort  and Country Club is very well utilised.  SAFRA Resort

and  Country  Club  was  opened  in  1994  to  recognise  the

contribution of NSmen to Total Defence.  Today, it has 10,000

members,  which, compared to private clubs, is several  times

the  order of membership that a club normally has, given  the

number  of  holes  in  the  golf  course.   Furthermore,  the

utilisation  rate of this course has increased  from  79%  in

1994  to  91%  in  1999.   So, golfing facilities  today  are

heavily utilised and there is often a very long waiting queue

for  people  who  want to play.  It is in this  context  that

RECORD III recommended that another golf course be built  for

NSmen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if land is going to be allocated for golf courses,

then  NSmen  should be given priority in recognition  of  the

important  role  they play in Total Defence.   The  new  golf

course  could be developed at a suitable location where  land

use would be optimised.  MINDEF will examine this proposal in

greater detail before announcing its decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, once again, I would like to thank Members for their

interest and support for RECORD III's recommendations, and to

note  that  MINDEF  would continually strive  to  improve  NS

management  and  administration, as well as the  NS  training

system,  to better recognise and enhance the contribution  of

our NSmen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may now turn to the issue raised by Mr Gerard

Ee  and  also touched on by Dr Ong Chit Chung on NS  training

periods.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee has suggested that participation in certain

uniformed  groups, in particular, the NCC and the PCC,  could

help  to shorten the training period during National Service,

full-time.   MINDEF recognises that participation  of  school

students  in  uniformed groups prepares them for the  rigours

and  discipline of military training.  It creates  a  certain

mindset  in  them;  once they wear a uniform,  and  they  are

subject  to  discipline.  But we do not  think  that  we  can

shorten  the  period of NS because of such participation,  as

military training deals with substantially different  skills.

Even  for  the  NCC  or PCC, the kind of training  that  they

undergo is quite different from the military training  during

NS, which is at a standard and level much more demanding than

that expected or possible within these uniformed groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Basic Military Training, recruits are taught a

wide  range  of basic military skills, apart from handling  a

rifle  and  shooting,  field-craft,  drills,  manoeuvres   at

platoon, company and battalion levels.  Beyond BMT, they  are

assigned to operational units, where they learn to fight as a

team.   Development of esprit de corps amongst themselves  is

also part of the unit training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we recognise that, wherever possible, we want to

keep  as short as possible the time in National Service.   So

MINDEF  has  a  scheme  where we reduce  by  two  months  the

National  Service  duration  of males  who  have  attained  a

certain  level of physical fitness, and this be  set  at  the

silver  standard  for the NAFA test.  This scheme  encourages

students   to  keep  fit  through  various  means,  including

participation in CCAs, such as sports, athletics or uniformed

groups.   Those  who fail to meet the fitness  standards  are

brought  in, as per schedule, and are put through a  rigorous

Physical  Training  Phase  before  they  join  their   fitter

counterparts in Basic Military Training.  Those who  pass  do

not  have  to undergo this Physical Training Phase, and  they

then have their NS period reduced by two months.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, may I reiterate that the 2 to 21/2 years

of  National  Service brings a fresh recruit to the  required

level  of  military proficiency to be a part of an  effective

fighting   force   and  is  necessary  for  the   operational

effectiveness of the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the matter of allowances raised by Mr

Ravindran, Dr Jennifer Lee, Mr Thomas Thomas and Dr Ong  Chit

Chung.  They have asked whether a review will be done for the

allowances that we pay to full-time National Servicemen.  The

short answer is yes, but, before I go into the longer answer,

let me restate the principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental principle is that National Service is a

duty  to be performed by all male Singaporeans.  It is a duty

that  is  necessary, as Dr Jennifer Lee has pointed  out,  to

safeguard  our  country, our home and  our  families.   As  a

service rendered to the nation, it cannot be equated  with  a

regular  salaried  job.   But  it  is  their  commitment  and

sacrifice that ensure our continued peace and stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, because National Servicemen are not salaried

employees, they are not paid market wages.  They are given an

allowance  for  personal upkeep.  Most of them stay  in-camp,

they  are given a comfortable bed, as Dr Ong has pointed out,

and rather good food now.  In fact, the food has improved  so

much  that  some  of  the canteens have started  to  complain

because  their business has gone down.  So their basic  needs

are  taken care of.  The allowance, therefore, covers  things

like transport and some incidental expenses.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF reviews this NS allowance regularly, taking into

account inflation and cost of living.  Their allowances  were

last  adjusted in 1996 by between $40 and $60.  A review  was

conducted  again  in  1999 but no adjustment  was  made  then

because  cost  had not gone up significantly since  the  1996

review owing to the economic downturn.  MINDEF, however, will

review  the  NS allowance again this year and  on  an  annual

basis to keep pace with changes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>

in  the cost of living.  The current review will be completed

and its outcome known by the third quarter of this year.   So

I hope we will have some news for you then.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas and Dr Jennifer Lee also asked whether

we   could   make  CPF  contributions,  even  if  they   were

allowances.  This crosses the line on the principle that  CPF

contributions are really made only for salaries and  not  for

allowances.  Nevertheless, full-time national servicemen  can

still benefit from CPF top-ups.  And indeed, during the Share

Ownership   Top-up  exercises  and  the  recent  CPF   top-up

exercise,  MINDEF has assisted full-time national  servicemen

who  might  not  have enough money to open CPF  accounts  and

offered  interest-free loans to those who  are  eligible,  so

that  they could make their own contribution to CPF in  order

to receive the CPF top-up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the issue raised by Dr Jennifer Lee about the

impact   of  national  service  on  marriages  and   starting

families,  this  does take two to two and a half  years  away

from  more time socialising and finding partners.  But  these

are  two  separate  issues.   National  service  is  for  our

national  security.  Strong families are also for  our  long-term  development  as a society. Both are important,  but  we

should  not  mix  the two up.  Increasing  NS  allowances  to

facilitate earlier marriages is not appropriate, as  it  goes

against  the principle of national service being a  duty.   A

full-time  national serviceman should not be compensated  for

this  reason.  But the Government does help young couples  in

other ways.  For example, there is a CPF Housing Grant Scheme

to   help   young  couples  who  are  first-time   applicants

purchasing HDB flats and I think we should leave it at that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me touch on the general point about

families  that  may face financial hardship because  sons  or

spouses  are  called  up to do national  service.  MINDEF  is

mindful  of this and we have a number of schemes to  help  NS

men  whose  families  face particularly  difficult  financial

hardships.  We offer both grants as well as loans  and  there

are a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>

number of such cases every year.  If any Member of this House

knows  of such a case, please refer it to MINDEF and we  will

look into the matter.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I want to thank the Minister of

State  for his reply.  But just as a matter of clarification,

under  the  law, allowances are CPF payable unless  they  are

exempted.  But  I  take the Minister's  point  that  national

service  allowance is actually part of our service and  duty,

and  that we should have an element of sacrifice.  I  do  not

agree with the Nominated Member that we use this to build  up

the CPF reserve of our national servicemen or to help start a

family.   I think they are quite different things altogether.

The  element  of sacrifice should still remain. What  we  are

asking  is  revision  of  the allowance  to  keep  pace  with

inflation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1999 and 2000 Budget debates, my GPC raised

the  issue of compliance with financial regulations  and  the

Audit  report  by  the Auditor-General  on  the  Ministry  of

Defence.   I am afraid this year we have to raise  again  the

observations  of  the Auditor-General on  MINDEF's  financial

procedures for FY1999/2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Auditor-General, there was

inadequate control on advance payments to MINDEF's suppliers,

resulting  in  a  total of $1.1 billion advance  payment  not

being reported to the Auditor-General's office.  The Auditor-General  states  that  he has no assurance  that  MINDEF  has

accurate information on the total amount of advances standing

to  its  credit  at  any point of time.  The  Auditor-General

states  that MINDEF's accounting officer submitted a  listing

of  405 accounts in May 2000, but later changed it to a total

listing of 411 accounts.  Further, the Auditor-General points

out  that  the opening fund balances of 70 accounts  did  not

tally  with the closing balances, with one account  having  a

difference of $139,783. The Auditor-General highlighted  that

there  were  serious irregularities in advances  given  to  a

company and that between June 1998 and June 1999, the advance

of  $2.13 million exceeded requirements by $645,000 to  $1.13

million.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Auditor-General reports that Audit test checks

at  three  camps on records of meals supplied, revealed  many

discrepancies  between the camps' records and the  suppliers'

invoices  of  the  number  of meals consumed.   The  Auditor-General further observes that there were many alterations  to

the  camps' documents which were not properly endorsed. There

was  also  over-payment  for food supplied  as  a  result  of

payment  made  on  higher prices and not on tendered  prices.

There was also misappropriation for the sub-imprest at a  SAF

camp and misappropriation from a unit fund of a SAF camp.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in the public interest to seek clarification

from  MINDEF on the report of the Auditor-General.  Again,  I

urge  MINDEF  to take all the necessary actions  and  put  in

place  preventive  measures  to ensure  that  all  procedures

comply with the financial regulations of the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the Auditor-General, in its Report

for  the  year 1999/2000, has once again highlighted  certain

financial  lapses and irregularities in the accounts  of  the

SAF.   Last  year, as a Member of this House,  I  raised  the

point  that MINDEF needs to pay greater attention as  to  how

financial matters are handled within the SAF and as  to  what

MINDEF will be taking in terms of steps in ensuring that such

financial lapses and irregularities do not occur.   The  fact

that  the  SAF has once again been picked up in the  Auditor-General's  Report causes concern to me as a  Member  of  this

House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I would like to seek the assurance of the

Minister  for  Defence  on the measures  or  steps  that  the

Ministry of Defence will be taking to ensure that such lapses

and irregularities do not occur again, particularly when some

of the sums of money which have been highlighted as being the

matter in question involve substantial amounts of money.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I have very little to add to

what  has  already  been  said by  the  Chairman  and  Deputy

Chairman  of the GPC for Defence.  I would just like  to  ask

the Minister if any of the discrepancies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>

cited  in the Auditor-General's Report are similar or  repeat

discrepancies that had been picked by the Auditor-General  in

previous years?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> May I, first of all, thank Dr Ong Chit

Chung  for  pointing  out  that allowances  may  attract  CPF

contributions. I had spoken too quickly.  Indeed,  what  I

should  have said was that treating NS allowances  like  an

employment salary  and introducing CPF  contributions  would

involve a major change in the philosophy and principles  of

the NS allowance which, as you have agreed, is an allowance

and not a salary, and that is the principle that we defend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Members for the questions on the Auditor-General's Report and the opportunity to clarify the issues

and the steps taken to deal with them.  The Auditor-General's

Report   for  FY1999/2000  contains  seven  observations   on

administrative  lapses, and two cases of fraud  committed  by

one  serviceman.  The two cases of fraud are the more serious

and let me deal with that first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these two cases involve two accounts. One is a

petty cash account and the other is the unit welfare account.

The supervising officer of these accounts had failed to check

all  payments of proper documentation and invalidated all the

supporting   documents  after  payment  in  accordance   with

MINDEF's  procedures.  As a result, the  account  holder  was

able  to  misappropriate about $93,400 from the two  accounts

through  fictitious  claims  and recycling  of  invoices  and

receipts.   The  investigations also  revealed  that  another

$44,000  was  unaccounted for due to improper  documentation.

MINDEF  intends to take the account holder and other officers

responsible for these losses to task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that we note that these two cases

were  not  the  result of systemic failure  in  the  internal

system of checks and controls.  These were in place.  Rather,

they  were  due to negligence and fraud.  The account  holder

has  been  charged and was sentenced to 15 months'  detention

and  fined  $3,000.   He also returned a sum  of  $84,000  to

MINDEF and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>

MINDEF  will  recover the balance of $9,400  from  him.   The

supervising  officer has also been charged for negligence  in

discharging his responsibilities and fined $1,500.  These two

cases  would  be widely publicised internally as a  deterrent

measure  and  also  as  a  lesson for all  staff,  especially

supervisory   officers,   to  take   their   responsibilities

seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their audit on contracts with advance payments, the

Auditor-General had reported that MINDEF did not  inform  his

office  of 90 contracts with advance payments totalling  $1.1

billion.   The Auditor-General had therefore stated  that  it

had  no assurance that MINDEF had accurate information on the

total  amount of advance standing to its credit at any  point

in  time.  Let me assure the House that the $1.1 billion  was

fully  accounted for at all times by MINDEF.   All  contracts

are   individually  monitored  and  tracked  by   procurement

officers  who  keep  a  record  of  the  outstanding  advance

payments.   The  errors in the report to the  Auditor-General

occurred  because  the data on advance  payments  had  to  be

complied  within  the two-week deadline set by  the  Auditor-General at the onset of the audit.  As a result, a number  of

contracts  were inadvertently omitted during the  compilation

process.   So  this was a compilation error.  We  have  since

adopted  the Auditor-General's recommendation that  quarterly

consolidated  reports  on  outstanding  advance  payments  be

submitted to the Permanent Secretary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other irregularities observed in the Auditor-General's Report were due to administrative lapses. MINDEF

has  taken  actions to rectify them. Let me again assure  the

House that in none of these other cases were there any moneys

lost or any moneys unaccounted for.  But let me just touch on

one other case that Dr Ong has raised about our cook houses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make mention of this because of the

particular wordings in the Auditor-General's Report that  may

mislead some Members as to the severity of the discrepancies.

In  the  Auditor-General's Report, words to the  effect  that

some of the mistakes had been "covered

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>

up" had been used.  This really referred to two discrepancies

in  the  cook house records.  One was that in keying  in  the

data  into  the  system, a clerical error had  been  made  by

referring  to  the wrong list of items. This resulted  in  an

overpayment of $3,478 out of a total contract value  of  $434

million.  In context, this is a relatively small amount  but,

nonetheless, it was an error.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concerned human errors in keeping records in

the  cook  house.   When  Audit  queries  were  raised,  some

personnel made the corrections on the records with correction

fluid   instead  of  following  the  standard   practice   of

cancelling the errors and initialling against the amendments.

Therefore, they literally covered up their mistakes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very serious criminal offence to cover up.

MINDEF investigated the cases cited by Audit and is satisfied

that  there  was no evidence of cover up or falsification  of

any  documents.  It was a case of inappropriate  response  to

the  errors or omissions pointed out by Audit.  In any  case,

it  does not make sense for anyone to attempt to cover up  an

error  after  it  has already been detected by  the  Auditor-General.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me say also that since last year, MINDEF has

embarked   on   a   comprehensive   review   of   the   major

administrative  processes involving finance, procurement  and

logistics.   This review is chaired by a Permanent Secretary.

We  will  continue to improve our controls  and  educate  our

staff  to  be more careful and vigilant in discharging  their

responsibilities.  We will also continue to inculcate in  our

staff the importance of striving for zero defects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me thank the Members for their

concerns raised, and ensure them that MINDEF will continue to

be vigilant and prudent in its financial management.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I want to thank the Ministers

for their very comprehensive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>

answers and also the Minister of State for his assurances  on

the  audit.  And I hope that we need not raise it again  next

year  and  let the case rest.  Thank you very  much.   I  beg

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head K of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code KA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the RSAF is a vital component of the Singapore

Armed  Forces.  The Singapore Armed Forces enjoys  tremendous

support   from  the  public,  as  it  is  both   a   credible

organisation  with  a credible deterrent capability,  and  it

enjoys tremendous support on the ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like the RSAF to address the issue of

RSAF   aircraft's  loud  noise  over  residential  parts   of

Singapore.   The affected areas include parts of Jurong  West

and  Sengkang.  Many of the residents living in  these  areas

had  purchased their homes, hoping to return to a home for  a

peaceful  rest  or  to study.  However, the regular  aircraft

training schedules of the RSAF have become a serious nuisance

to  residents  in  these two estates.   Many  residents  have

complained  that  they are unable to tolerate  the  extremely

loud noise levels emitted as aircraft fly at low altitude  to

land at the nearby airbases.  Some residents have stated that

they  can  even  see the pilots' faces as  they  fly  by.   I

sympathise   with  these  residents,  as  I  have  personally

witnessed the loud noise generated during these RSAF training

stints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my speeches to my residents, I usually highlight

to them that they should show the thumbs up to the pilots.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>

But  I fear that when they are irritated by a noise, they may

show the thumbs down to the pilots, and that may not motivate

the  pilots.  I would like to ask the Minister whether  there

is  regular  consultation between the  Ministry  of  National

Development and MINDEF prior to the development  of  new  HDB

estates.  If yes, then why were new HDB estates built on  the

approach path of these RSAF aircraft?  If not, whether  there

are  plans to coordinate such future developments, so  as  to

prevent the recurrence of such a problem again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister how MINDEF

could  immediately  help alleviate this serious  problem  and

suffering  of these unlucky residents, and whether there  are

any long-term plans to solve this aircraft noise problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, first of all, may I empathise and

sympathise with the Member for Bukit Timah.  MINDEF is  aware

of  the  problem  of aircraft noise, as  I  am  sure  is  the

Ministry of National Development and I am also sure that they

do take this into account when planning new housing estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RSAF has done what it can to reduce aircraft noise

over  the  years.   It  has  taken many  concrete  steps.   A

significant reduction in the noise problem has been  achieved

when  the  RSAF  relocated  some  of  its  flying  activities

overseas.  However, the RSAF still needs to conduct  day  and

night  flying  to  familiarise  our  pilots  with  the  local

airspace  environment and to maintain operational  readiness.

Due  to our country's limited airspace, it is inevitable that

RSAF  aircraft  has to fly over some residential  areas.   In

particular, night training is important because it gives  our

pilots an important edge and it gives the RSAF combat options

that  it otherwise would not have.  I know that night  flying

contributes  particularly to noise disturbances,  because  at

night  the  ambient  noises are low, and  the  RSAF  aircraft

noises are therefore accentuated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RSAF has introduced other measures to reduce

aircraft  noise.  Where possible, flight simulators are  used

for training.  A hush house was built in 1984

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>

for  the  conduct of engine runs by RSAF and  ST  Engineering

Aircraft.   To  further reduce noise pollution, the  aircraft

departure  and  recovery  procedures  and  routes  have  been

amended, and minimum height requirement has also been imposed

on all RSAF aircraft over built up areas.  So if the Member's

residents  can still see the faces of the pilots, please  let

me know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also strict regulations prohibiting night

flying  after 2300 hours, unless there are valid  operational

reasons   to   do  so.   And,  finally,  being   mindful   of

examinations,  RSAF scales down its local  flying  activities

during  the  end of the year school examination  period,  and

coordinates  closely with the Ministry of Education  to  make

sure  that  when students are doing their oral  examinations,

aircraft is not flying overhead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I certainly hope that MINDEF can do

much  more  than  that, and I look forward to measures  along

those lines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government compensated the telecommunication

companies  about  $2  billion for accelerating  the  pace  of

liberalisation  of  the industry.  After  almost  a  year  of

earlier  compensation, can the Minister  provide  us  with  a

balance  sheet  of  cost benefits of the spending?   Can  the

Minister  give  us  an update of the liberalisation  process?

Has it been able to attract new entrants in providing service

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>

customers, and at what level of investment?  In general, have

the  consumers seen the benefit of lower cost or  more  value

for the dollar?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on 3G auction. The Government has

come  up  with a proposal of setting a reserve price for  the

auctioning of the four new third generation telecommunication

licences.  Will the Minister enlighten the House on the state

of the preliminary evaluation and the justification for still

sticking  to the announced reserve price to the participants?

Bearing  in  mind that the level of investment the successful

bidder will have to fork out to abide by the rules, which can

run  into tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars,  and

the  speed  at  which the technology in this  field  can  get

obsolete very fast, will the Minister not consider going  for

a  lower  reserve price plus a royalty percentage on turnover

to  lower the risk for the participants?  This can also lower

the  restrictive development of the industry in  the  future,

because  of  high capital cost and minimise the risk  of  any

disruptive technological change for the industry players.  It

can  also lead to more participation in the auction with  the

likely   promise  of  more  customer-oriented  service   and,

possibly,  more competitive business which it is intended  to

serve.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, 3G technology

forms   an   important   bridge  to   the   future   wireless

telecommunication service.  In my view, the speed with  which

3G  service  is developed and how pervasive it becomes  would

determine  whether  Singapore will  become  the  hub  of  the

digital economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced that it has decided to

award  3G  licences  by  auction.  Awarding  3G  licences  by

auction is like the award of COEs.  The Government will  rake

in  huge sums of money.  Perhaps the Government is envious of

the  bonanza  that  the British and French  governments  have

obtained  for  their auctions of 3G licences.  The  rationale

for  the Government to award 3G licences  through auction  is

that  the prices could be  determined by market forces.   But

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>

more  important reason is that the Government would  like  to

make a big profit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market competition is not entirely rational. The end

result  will  be  that through auctioning the  licences,  the

Government amasses a big sum of money, but the companies that

successfully  bidded for the licences are saddled  with  high

cost thereby delaying the development of such technology,  as

they are too expensive and was beyond the reach of people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the auction, has the Government considered

how it will make use of the 3G technology and its application

to   attract  new  investments  to  Singapore?   Apart   from

auctioning  and the "beauty contest" method, as suggested  by

some players in the market, has the Government considered the

possibility   of   cooperating  with  the   telecommunication

companies to jointly develop the 3G technology and popularize

the related markets?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, Mr Chay Wai Chuen has

asked about the process of telecommunications liberalisation,

and  has  asked  for an update on the new entrants  who  have

entered  into  the market, what sort of investments  and  how

have the consumers benefitted from the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Members will recall, we want to transform

Singapore  into a competitive telecommunications hub  with  a

multi-player,  multi-network  environment  that   can   offer

innovative, high quality and cost effective telecommunication

services.   In  the  process, both business  and  individuals

should benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the one year since the liberalisation took place, I

think we have realised much of the desired benefits.  Let  me

give  Members some update.  We have awarded licences to  over

200  telecommunication companies in the last one year.  There

are  now  a  total  of 16 new and existing  Facilities  Based

Operators (FBOs) and 195

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>

new Services Based Operators. The new companies include world-class  players like MCI Worldcom, GlobalOne, UUNet  and  Asia

Global  Crossing.  All these companies together will help  to

improve    the    variety   and   the   richness    of    the

telecommunications services and quality in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of investment, I think the telecommunication

liberalisation  will  definitely result  in  significant  new

investments  and jobs for Singaporeans.  We expect  that  the

capital  investment over the next 5-6 years will  exceed  S$3

billion, of which about S$2.2 billion will be realised within

the  next  2-3  years.  The new licensees will  create  about

4,500  jobs  by  end of this year.  So the  results  and  the

benefits are going to be quite immediate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new telecommunication players will boost our

international connectivity by 400 times by the  end  of  this

year,  to  over 20 Tb per second.  Our Internet data  centres

are projected to increase by 750% to 1.5 million sq ft by the

end  of  this year alone, compared to March 2000.   Within  a

period  of  nine months, we are going to see a huge increase.

With   such   rapid  and  vast  developments,  Singapore   is

definitely fast becoming a leading hub for telecommunications

traffic.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has this benefited us? All sectors of the economy

in  Singapore  have benefited from our increased connectivity

and  enhanced  telecommunications facilities.  Companies  now

have a wide choice of telecommunications service providers to

choose  from in order to meet their global telecommunications

needs.   The  competitive telecommunications environment  has

therefore  made  Singapore also a more  competitive  business

hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very high voice and data traffic is helping us to

become  a strong and vibrant info-communications hub.   As  a

result, we are now able to attract a vibrant cluster of infocomm  players across the entire digital value chain and  many

of  them are hubbing their operations in Singapore, to  serve

not just the Singapore market

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>

but  also  the regional market.  These new companies  include

content   creators,   aggregators   and   hosters,   portals,

application  services  companies,  systems  integrators,   e-business  solution providers, web enablers, server farms  and

Internet data centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the consumer level too, the benefits are quite

evident.   IDD  rates have fallen by 60% on average,  and  in

some  cases, as much as 80%.  There is also a greater variety

of  IDD call services, including voice over Internet Protocol

(VoIP), and IDD aggregators, who help consumers find the best

price  and  quality  plan at any particular  point  in  time.

Consequently, IDD calls have increased by over 20%,  to  over

100 million minutes every month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will conclude by saying that our

telecommunications liberalisation has clearly been effective.

It   has   accelerated  the  development  of   our   national

information  infrastructure,  and  our  regional  and  global

connectivity.   I will expect our economy and our  people  to

continue   benefiting   from   the   opening   up   of    our

telecommunications sector in the years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the two cuts on the 3G auction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay has asked for a preliminary evaluation as to why

we  are  sticking  to the old reserve price  and  whether  we

should  instead lower the reserve price but include in  it  a

royalty  element, and that this will help to lower  the  risk

for  the investors, and in the process you may get also  more

bidders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our assessment as to whether we should stick to a

reserve price or go with a mix of a lower reserve price  plus

a  royalty  component  is that whatever upfront  charges  you

impose,  plus royalty or without royalty, the operators  will

typically  charge the consumers based on what the market  can

bear, because the competition in the 3G market is going to be

very,  very tense.  And not only that, the 3G operators  will

also  have to compete with the present 2G operators in  terms

of  voice, in terms of some of the data traffic.  As such,  I

think whether we charge only an upfront fee

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>

or  a  combination of both, it will not likely influence  the

charges to the consumers when the 3G service is launched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is true that if we are able to lower the

upfront  charges, it will help to lower the risk element  for

the  operators.  But, on the other hand too, by lowering  the

risk  element for the operators, it may also lead to a lesser

outcome  for the consumers.  You may ask why.  The reason  is

that  when  they pay totally upfront, I think  operators  are

incentivised to roll out their systems as quickly as possible

and  to also roll out as many services as possible, in  order

to  be able to recoup their upfront investments as quickly as

possible.   So  there are pros and cons.  These are  elements

which the other countries, which have auctioned out their  3G

licences,  have been considering.  And I think  in  the  end,

most of the countries have opted for an upfront fee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of whether we should stick to the announced

reserve price of $150 million, IDA has definitely been making

a review of this issue.  We recognise that much of the global

telecommunications     environment,     the     international

telecommunications environment, has changed over the last six

to nine months.  The market sentiment has definitely weakened

and  there  is  also a greater uncertainty over the  business

case  for  3G.  In Europe, because of the high 3G  prices,  I

think  the telecommunications companies have also suffered  a

downgrading  of their investment ratings.  As a result,  they

are also finding some difficulty in getting funding for their

project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have taken all that into consideration and we have

also consulted our economic consultants who have done another

study for us as well, in order to confirm our own findings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the assessment is that the market value of 3G

licences  has  dropped considerably.  As a  result,  IDA  has

decided  to lower the reserve price to bring it in line  with

the  current international levels.  The new reserve price  is

now  going  to be $100 million per licence, instead  of  $150

million.  The auction will proceed as scheduled in late April

this year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has accused the Government of going

by  the  auction route in order to rake in money and that  we

are envious of the high auction bids in Europe.  Sir, this is

far from what the Government's intention is.  In fact, when I

announced the decision to award 3G licences, I think that was

done in probably September last year or so, I had stated very

clearly that it is not the Government's intention to use  the

3G  licences and the auction process as a means of maximising

revenue  for the Government.  What we are looking  for  is  a

mechanism  that  will   allow us  to  award  3G  licences  to

companies  which  value it most.  If Mr  Low  can  propose  a

better  system than the auction system in order to award  the

licences, we would be very happy to hear about it.  And I  am

sure  consultants all over the world will be very happy  too,

because  this is an exercise which has occupied the minds  of

many consultants and even professors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consensus so far has been that the auction process

is  the  most efficient mechanism for a few reasons.  One  is

that  the  3G technology is still unproven, no 3G  system  is

operational  yet,  and therefore the true  potential  is  not

known  to regulators.  Even operators, I think, are not fully

aware  of  what the 3G potential is going to be, because  the

technology  is  changing so fast, that what is possible  next

year  may be obsolete the year after.  Therefore, it is  very

difficult for the regulators to try to put a value on what  a

3G licence should be, and therefore we should leave it to the

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our intent is to make sure that we have viable and

vibrant 3G operators in Singapore.  Therefore, we should make

sure  that  we  do not cripple them by having a high  licence

fee,  and  that is why we went through a very deliberate  and

careful process of trying to determine what the reserve price

should  be.   As I have stated just now, we have reviewed  it

and  recognising  that the market has changed,  we  have  now

reduced the reserve price to $100 million.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low has also asked whether we should not cooperate

with  the  telecommunications companies  to  develop  the  3G

technology.   Sir, indeed, that is what we are going  to  do.

In  my  announcement on the decision to proceed with  the  3G

auction last year, I had also mentioned that we are going  to

set  aside a development fund for IDA to work with companies,

those  telecommunications companies who are the  3G  licensed

holders,  as  well  as the service providers,  to  help  them

develop  services, technology application that will give  our

companies  a good headstart in this very new technology.   So

we  are  definitely  going along the line  that  Mr  Low  has

mentioned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, on broadband development,

Singapore is the first country in the world to have installed

a  nationwide  interactive broadband  multimedia  network  in

1997.   Since  then, I have wondered what  is  the  state  of

affairs of this nationwide network.  Has it been put to  good

and effective use?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that broadband network with big

capacity and fast speed is good.  But everything has a  cost,

as  the Minister for Finance will tell you.  Has the Ministry

of  Finance's  allocation  for  the  broadband  project  been

successfully  implemented with an equitable  social  rate  of

return?  Being such a big-scale project, naturally we do  not

expect immediate returns.  But is the Minister satisfied that

we  are  there?   How  many customers  are  there  using  the

Singapore  One  network in business or  at  home?   Does  the

network suffer from a lack of content or usage?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost is one important factor in attracting usage as

consumers may be quite satisfied with accessing Internet at a

slower  speed if broadband access costs are high compared  to

narrow  band Internet access.  Given the price elasticity  of

such  demand,  especially at our population's  income  level,

many of the people may consider this a luxury.  How does  the

Minister  intend to extend usage to attain a  certain  market

size which can then lower cost of content?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, we have a

dream.   We  dream that one day every household in  Singapore

will  have  a  computer, or two - just as they have  TVs  and

telephones  today.  We dream that these computers  will  help

them do their work, exchange ideas with colleagues around the

world,  and send off the work product to the boss  -  whether

this  product is a document, a book, a film or new  software,

and  whether the boss is here in Singapore or on an  orbiting

space  station.   We dream that the same computers  can  keep

them  informed of what is happening around them, educate them

and  allow  others  (such  as the Government  or  their  town

council)  to communicate and interact with them.   We  dream,

too,  that these computers will entertain them; pushing  them

movies, news programmes, talk shows, music - all at their own

time,  in  their own space.  The one computer  will  be  work

manager, communicator, entertainer, book-newspaper-telephone-fax-TV  all rolled into one.  And it will come to  pass  when

broadband rules this land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, before that dream is realised, we have to go

through  a nightmare.  The modems into computers jam  up  the

massive amounts of data that are being pumped into them.  The

technology  to  clear  that jam is called  "broadband".   The

Information Superhighway must be a 20-lane road and not the 2-lane  road it is today.  Building the roads costs money,  and

after  that the users have to pay an arm and a leg (and maybe

more)  for the private investors to recoup their investments.

Worse still, the roads lead to nowhere.  There is nothing  to

do  or  see, nothing to engage us and nowhere to go  when  we

finally  gain  access to the valuable Superhighway.   In  the

geek  world,  we  call  these  the  problems  of  "cost"  and

"content".

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads have to be built for a country to be developed.

This  initial  infrastructure  is  usually  provided  for  by

governments.  If private sector developers are employed,  the

cost  of  use  is often subsidised - unless the  country  has

developed to a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>

point  where  this new road is but one of many other  cheaper

alternatives.  The  costs of these roads  are  high,  but  no

government worth its salt passes the full cost to  the  user.

We built our physical roads in Singapore on that model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet when it comes to the critical age of the Internet,

we  have farmed out infrastructure development to the private

sector,  to  the  highest bidder there is.   And  the  winner

invariably has to pass the final cost to the consumer, on top

of his margin of profit (which will of course be high also if

he has few real competitors).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is commendable that the Government has broken

SingTel's  monopoly on broadband infrastructure, and  we  are

fortunate   that   the   technology   itself   has   improved

sufficiently  for  there  to  be  more  than  one   non-telco

competitor.  You see, Sir, duopolies and cartels  can  be  as

harmful  as  monopolies.  And yet in our first  days  on  the

Superhighway, we had two monopolies in SingTel and  SCV.   It

was  one  or  the other: ADSL or cable.  Mutually  exclusive.

And  until we have alternative copper wire networks owned not

by  SingTel,  there  is  still a  chokehold  on  the  supply.

Whether  it  is Pacific Internet or Superpromises Internet  - they  all have to buy space from SingTel, whose access  costs

can  kill  off  the  budding competitor,  or  whose  business

practices  will  ensure  that the budding  competitor  cannot

survive  one day beyond the deadline for paying up his  phone

bill,  or whose control of the lines and the technology could

ensure  that subscribers of cable, for example, would not  be

able to interface with certain services and content hosted on

SingTel  servers.   Result: you have to  get  both  ADSL  and

cable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for content, Sir, it would seem very much a private

sector problem.  After all, when the roads are built,  it  is

the private sector which puts up the cinemas, shopping malls,

petrol  stations, bowling alleys and whatnot.  While this  is

largely  true, I would like to remind Members that  what  the

EDB  has  done  is to make Singapore a thriving manufacturing

centre  by  giving  grants,  tax  breaks  and  various  other

incentives to bring investors to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>

Singapore,  and  not  just building  industrial  estates  and

science parks.  We formed the EDB to help them also to smooth

over  the rough passages so that they will not trip over  the

carpet in some bureaucrat's office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given itself a target of 400,000

users  of  broadband by end 2001.  The thinking of course  is

that  a  critical  mass  of this size is  important  so  that

broadband  providers would find a sufficiently  large  market

base   to  roll  out  pilot  projects.   Again,  this  is   a

commendable move.  But with broadband charges going  up,  how

is the Government going to achieve that target?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take the liberty to suggest some

possibilities for the Minister to consider?  (1)  We  should,

if  we  cannot reduce charges, continue to give subsidies  to

people  who  sign  up  for  broadband  access.   The  current

subsidies  end on 1st April.  The scheme should be  extended,

and better still, the subsidy rates increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Free broadband access should be given to all

Community  Children's Libraries (CCLs), Residents  Committees

(RCs),  community centres (CCs) and clubs in Singapore.   And

when  the  access is easy and the presence of  the  broadband

services   ubiquitous,  people  will   grow   familiar   with

broadband.   Familiarity  drives out  fear  and  the  biggest

barrier to growth will be gone.  Soon everybody will be using

broadband as comfortably as they do with the ATM or  the  fax

machine  today.   The Government can pay the full  costs  of,

say,  two  accounts per RC or CCL and, perhaps,  up  to  five

accounts per CC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) EDB-type incentive programmes and tax breaks should

be  given  to  content providers to provide  content  on  our

broadband network.  The IDA should go on a roadshow round the

world  to  attract talents and investors here to develop  the

content industry.  Venture capital and seed funding should be

freely and liberally available to start-ups to enable them to

try  out  risky  innovations and experimental ventures.   Tax

deductions and exemptions

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>

should be available to those who risk their capital this way.

Not  every cent we have should go willy-nilly into the still-nebulous one basket called "life sciences".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Government should seriously consider pumping in

more  resources to develop the movie industry,  the  graphics

and  animation industry, the music industry and the  software

industry.   We  should not only devote monetary resources  to

build  up  our  local giants but also liberalise  immigration

policies to attract talents to come to Singapore to  dig  for

gold  in  these here streets of Singapore.  Our  schools  and

institutes  of  higher learning should  initiate  courses  to

train  such  of  our youths who are inclined  that  way.   We

should  put  the stars in their eyes and take  away  all  the

barriers  in  our  educational system (or in  their  parents'

expectations) so that they will venture out to work  in  such

unconventional, untraditional jobs and industries.   Perhaps,

MediaCorp  or  MediaWorks  can  give  out  scholarships   and

guaranteed  jobs - the way our GLCs did when  they  developed

our fledgling airline and shipping line so many years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) There should be a tougher stance on anti-competitive

practices.  The regulator is too congenial.  Hence, there  is

inadequate  incentive  for  self-regulation.   Without   some

painful  elbowing  in  the  sides of  the  industry  players,

nothing  will move.  Perhaps, the winners of the 3G  licences

could be given a 30% discount if they can devote resources to

building  up  a  credible industry association,  or  watchdog

body, to assist the IDA in its regulatory activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, would it be possible to give tax breaks to

companies which come up with innovative uses of broadband  in

their  business?  It should not matter in this case  for  the

tax  break whether they have devised new content or a new way

to  provide  value-added services or simply to do  their  own

work and business better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need every hand at the helm as we steer our ship into

the  murky  waters  of  the broadband  future.   I  hope  the

Minister agrees with me.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the successful development and

implementation of broadband network is a must if the  country

is  to  compete  with  the rest of the  world.   A  broadband

network used by the greatest number of Singaporeans will  not

only  improve our lives, but necessary for business  and  the

running  of  e-Government.  I can safely say that  this  will

determine  and  sharpen our long-term  competitiveness  as  a

nation.   In  the  business environment of tomorrow,  a  good

communication system is no more than just a telephone  system

that  works.  It is the ability to transmit and receive  high

volume  of  digital information that defines the  competitive

edge  of  nations.   Therefore, when other countries  in  the

developing   world  are  floundering,  we  must  take   every

opportunity to move ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, not all countries are floundering though.

South  Korea,  not a country strong in the English  Language,

has  taken to broadband and the Internet like fish to  water,

despite  not quite coming out of the Asian financial  crisis.

Today,  there  are  no less than 3.4 million  subscribers  of

broadband  service.  When I visited Seoul  in  November  last

year  for  a trade show, scores of Korean companies  were  on

display  developing software for Internet.   Look  right  and

left  and one cannot help but see the URLs instead of company

names  on most commercial buildings.  We do not see  that  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, in Singapore, we have no more than 300,000

subscribers.  We read of slow service complaints in the Forum

pages of our dailies.  I understand that the speed of the SCV

service drops to as low as 26 kbps.  A dial-up modem now  can

get  you something like 56 kbps.  Is it due to the fact  that

SCV  is  buying insufficient bandwidth from SingTel, a  point

which was made earlier by Prof. Toh See Kiat?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides slow service, there are also complaints

that  it  is  expensive.  Effective from next month,  we  all

know,  it is going to be even more expensive when the subsidy

from the IDA is removed.  This will be a bigger impediment to

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>

growth  of broadband.  Is the Government not concerned  about

this?   Is  it not the Government's duty to fund its  further

development?   If  broadband is so crucial to  our  long-term

well-being,  the question that comes to mind is  whether  the

Government   is   doing   enough.   Maybe   not.    Broadband

infrastructure is akin to the building of roads  and  rolling

stock of our MRT.  One can imagine where we will be today  if

we charge the full cost of the roads and rolling stock to the

consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 3G is also a piece of the broadband jigsaw,

we  have to develop this with the concept of road building in

mind.   Instead, we can readily see where the  Government  is

heading.  The Government is trying to squeeze as much out  of

the  consumers  on the front end by setting  a  high  reserve

price for the coming auction, despite what the Minister  said

that  the  price  has now dropped to $100  million.   He  has

argued  that, just only a month ago, it was going to be  $150

million.   In other words, this technology moves so fast  and

prices  have moved just as fast.  But having said that,  Sir,

even  if  we  reduced  the  reserve price  to  $100  million,

industry sources say the minimum bid price, if based on  $100

million, works out to some US$60 for each Singaporean.   This

compares to Switzerland, where the bids tumbled to US$17  per

citizen,  a point which I raised at Question Time  few  weeks

ago.   The  Minister  was arguing why  that  is  economically

correct.  I think by the time the tender comes out and  maybe

give another month, hopefully, we will see something like $50

million  if  we agree to adopt the road building  model.   In

other  words, we have to create the broadband, both  wireless

and  non-wireless.  And if the development  of  broadband  is

really  necessary  for the long-term viability  and  success,

then I think we have to adopt a different business model.  In

this case, the road building model is really best suited  for

our needs because the country does not really need the money.

What we need is a system in place and worry about getting the

money later on, not getting the money upfront.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, I thank the Members for

their  interest and comments on the broadband development  in

Singapore.  Basically, Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Prof. Toh See  Kiat

and  Mr Chng Hee Kok asked about where are we today, in terms

of  take-up rate, content, application development,  cost  of

access,  subsidy, quality of service, and so on.  They  would

also  like  to know what are we doing to sustain  the  future

development of broadband in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may respond broadly from two aspects.

Firstly,  where are we today, and secondly, where  do  we  go

from  here.   Firstly, where are we today?   Are  we  in  the

nightmare scenario, as painted by Prof. Toh See Kiat?  Sir, I

do  not think so.  As pointed out by Mr Chay Wai Chuen and Mr

Chng  Hee Kok, we are among the first countries in the  world

to embark on broadband development way back in 1997/1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our efforts in promoting the use of broadband are

bearing  fruits.  For example, the number of broadband  users

in  Singapore has more than doubled from 100,000 in  December

1999  to  over 270,000 by the end of last year.  Mr Chng  Hee

Kok  mentioned the fast growth in South Korea.  He is  right.

South Korea is making tremendous progress in the adoption  of

broadband.   But  if you look at Singapore's  statistics,  we

have  not  performed  any  worse either.   In  fact,  270,000

broadband users work out to about one in six Internet  users,

meaning  that  out of six Internet users in Singapore  today,

one  is a broadband Internet adopter.  This penetration  rate

places Singapore among one of the highest in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh See Kiat commented that S-One today is a road

to  nowhere.  Sir, I am happy to report that this  is  indeed

not  the  case.  Initially, the main attraction of  broadband

Internet was to provide a fast access to narrowband Internet.

This  was  how broadband Internet was positioned in 1999  and

2000.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, today, the situation has changed tremendously.

Take,  for example, the case of Singapore.  We now have  more

than  300  applications developed in Singapore  on  broadband

Internet.  This is an increase of 50% from a year ago.  If we

were   to  go  to  Singapore  ONE  today,  we  can  see  very

interesting  applications  and  contents  relating  to,   for

example,  online  newspapers.  And these  are  not  just  the

narrowband  newspapers.  These are multimedia,  rich  content

and rich media newspapers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at e-learning applications, again, these are

broadband-based multimedia.  For lifestyle entertainment,  we

can  look  at e-magazines.  Again, they come in all kinds  of

content - video, music and so on.  Cyber shopping, it can now

be  conducted in 3D; video and KTV - Chinese, English,  Malay

and  so  on - they are now available.  Lately, companies  are

using  S-One  to  do  product marketing through  the  use  of

streaming  video.  On the whole, I would say  that  S-One  is

certainly  not  a  road to nowhere.  Can it  be  better?   Of

course, it can be better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the comments that subscription to S-One broadband

costs  an  arm  and a leg, I do not think this is  the  case.

Sir,  in  the last one year alone, we have seen the  cost  of

broadband   access   coming  down  very   rapidly.    As   an

illustration, the cost of unlimited broadband access on cable

TV,  through  SCV, has now fallen to $66 for  those  who  are

cable  TV  subscribers,  and  $76  for  those  who  are  non-subscribers.  If we go to SingNet, for example,  we  can  now

get 25 hours of broadband access for about $45 - cheaper than

Hong Kong and comparable to the price in Taiwan.  So, on  the

whole, the cost of broadband access in Singapore is as  cost-competitive as any other country we can find.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I note that some Members are concerned that

the  cost  of  broadband access may go up on 1st April  2001,

with the reduction in Government subsidies.  Sir, let me just

take  a  few minutes to explain why the subsidy was there  in

the  first instance.  In 1998/1999, when we wanted to promote

the use of Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>

ONE  and  broadband in Singapore, the take-up rate  was  slow

because,  exactly as Prof. Toh See Kiat mentioned, it  was  a

road  to nowhere.  There was no content, no application.   So

there  was  no  reason for subscribers  to  go  on  broadband

Internet.  But, if we are not able to grow the user base, the

application  and service providers are not going  to  develop

their applications.  In order to break this cycle, we decided

to jumpstart the user base in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, therefore, decided to subsidise,

firstly,  the cost of the modem.  We subsidised  70%  of  the

cost  of broadband modem to the users.  Secondly, we provided

subsidies on the cost of International Leased Circuits  (ILC)

because, in the case of Singapore, many users access contents

that  are  hosted in the USA.  ILC is therefore  a  high-cost

item.   Before we liberalised the telecommunications  market,

ILC  cost  in Singapore indeed was higher, compared  to  Hong

Kong  and other countries.  So we decided to break the  chain

by  subsidising cable and ADSL modems, as well as the cost of

ILC.   Because of the subsidies, we were able to  expand  the

base  of the broadband users to where we are today - 270,000.

Having achieved this 270,000 base, our assessment is that  we

have  done  enough  in terms of creating a critical  mass  of

users and, therefore, we decided that it is now time for  the

market  forces  to take full effect.  That is why,  effective

from  December last year, we removed the subsidy on broadband

modem  and,  on  1st October this year, we  will  remove  the

subsidies for ILC so that competition can take over.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that the cost of broadband Internet will

now  increase  to  beyond  the affordability  of  the  users?

Again,  Sir,  we  do not think so.  Firstly,  for  the  early

adopters, we will continue to subsidise the cost of access to

broadband Internet.  For example, we are now working with the

Ministry of Education on a programme called FastTrack@School,

where  we  are  experimenting  with  broadband  Internet  and

multimedia content in the schools.  Sir, about 27 schools are

now on this programme.  And we will continue

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>

to provide subsidies and incentives to these users under this

programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the mass market on the whole, we expect the charges

for  broadband Internet in time to come to become  even  more

attractive  and, at the same time, the quality of service  to

improve for at least two reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the liberalisation of the telecommunications

market  has  led  to, and will continue to lead  to,  further

reductions in the cost of International Leased Circuit.  This

means  that with the lower cost of ILC, the cost of broadband

access should come down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have put in place an open access framework

to  ensure  that  the broadband infrastructure  will  not  be

monopolised  by  any  particular  broadband  access   service

provider.   For  example, since October last  year,  we  have

enforced  open  access on ADSL, the telephone line  owned  by

SingTel.   So  there  are now four broadband  access  service

providers  providing ADSL services, and they  are:   SingNet,

Pacific  Century Cyberworks and Pacific Internet, in addition

to  SingTel  Magix.  In time to come, we believe  that,  with

open  access,  there  will be more broadband  access  service

providers  in  the  marketplace.  Through this  more  intense

competition  among them, cost will come down and the  quality

of  service  will go up.  We think this is a more sustainable

way of growing the broadband market in Singapore, instead  of

relying on Government subsidies all the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking ahead, where do we go from here? I share

the point by Prof. Toh See Kiat that we do have a dream.  Our

dream is very much like the dream that he has described,  but

maybe  with  one difference. That is, it will not necessarily

be  centred around computers alone.  We believe that  in  the

world of the future, computers would be one device, but there

will  be  many  other broadband appliances.   In  fact,  with

broadband Internet, 3G, and Internet appliances, the day will

come  when  Singaporeans  will be  able  to  have  access  to

broadband Internet, multimedia

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>

content  any  time, any place, using almost  any  device,  to

access almost any form of media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, we fully agree with Mr Chay Wai Chuen

and  Mr  Chng Hee Kok that broadband development will have  a

positive   impact   on   the  long-term  competitiveness   of

Singapore.   This is why we do look at the future development

of broadband Internet with a lot of priority and emphasis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to highlight three areas where we will

continue to intervene, facilitate and develop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first area of priority is in content development.

We  intend  to  continue  to  speed  up  the  development  of

innovative contents and pioneering broadband applications  in

areas such as e-Learning, edutainment and e-Home.  Under  the

incentives  programme that we provide, we have, for  example,

programmes  for new media and contents enrichment.   We  will

continue   to   incentivise  the  industry   and   the   user

organisations to move in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of priority is in content hosting and

application  development.  We will continue to  attract  more

regional  as well as the global players to come to  Singapore

to  host their broadband contents out of Singapore, not  just

for  the Singapore market, but also for the regional and  the

Asia  Pacific market.  In fact, we have already  in  place  a

programme known as the International Contents Hosting  Scheme

whereby  we  provide  very strong incentives  for  all  these

broadband   contents  owners  to  bring  their  contents   to

Singapore for the Asia-Pacific markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third priority is in the area of content delivery.

We  are  going  to continue to facilitate and  encourage  the

telecommunications  operators and building  owners  to  bring

broadband  infrastructure  to  more  buildings,  hotels   and

commercial  buildings,  so  that,  in  time  to   come,   all

businesses would have easy access to broadband contents  from

their workplaces.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we are committed to continue to

build  on  our  broadband foundation which we have  developed

over  the  last  three  to four years and  will  continue  to

embrace new broadband technology, such as the 3G and  so  on.

At  the  end of the day, it is our objective and priority  to

make  sure  that  Singapore will remain a leading  nation  in

broadband  development as we pursue the  vision  of  the  new

economy and an information society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, on the programmes to bridge the

digital  divide, the Government has committed to spend  about

$25  million  over three years to help our community  outside

the  schools  to  bridge this so-called digital  divide,  and

various  languages,  as  media, are also  used  in  order  to

facilitate this access to the world of Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2-roomers and 3-roomers in the HDB estates should be

given access to this use of Internet readily.  Access to  the

world  of Internet may mean many things.  Definitely, we  can

start by having a PC and get connected.  Poorer families  may

have  no  such  access in having a PC,  and  paying  for  the

subscription can be quite costly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access can also mean proximity to community centres or

such  programmes as currently run by IDA or  funded  by  IDA,

CDCs,  CCMCs and so on.  Will the Minister consider extending

this  project  to  Residents' Committees  and  PAP  Community

Foundation Centres, with co-funding of such projects?  I feel

that  extending to the RCs and the PCF centres is a good  way

of reaching out at the grassroots level and provides a useful

medium for grassroots to keep close to the people.  Also, RCs

and  PAP Community Foundation Centres, being in the heart  of

the  HDB  estates,  are nearer and give  convenience  to  the

children in the nearby flats.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the Infocomm

Development  Authority  or IDA calls  it  work  in  progress:

society being hooked up.  Infocomm technology has powered  up

all  aspects of life in Singapore, from playing to  learning,

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>

paying bills.  By the same token, technology has also invaded

all  aspects  of  our  lives, regardless  of  our  degree  of

preparedness  or  understanding.   The  ability   to   employ

technology or, better still, to master the use, is of  course

desirable,  but the inability to use or being intimidated  by

the  very pervasiveness of technology can be daunting.   This

is the reality today for Singaporeans, where the pace of life

has been blistering and, the ability to embrace, achieved  to

varying degrees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, as what the Minister has opined, whether we

succeed or not will depend on the active, committed and civic-minded  Singaporeans who make a difference.  As we are aware,

the  Government has dedicated $25 million over the next three

years  to  "dot.com" Singaporeans.  But  the  bulk  of  these

efforts,  like the current e-Celebrations event, would  still

rely  on  an  awareness  and a willingness  on  the  part  of

Singaporeans to participate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I cannot fault the IDA in terms of

programmes to reach out to the various people across  a  wide

spectrum.  In fact, I would like to urge the IDA to  continue

to  actively  engage  in  efforts  with  the  grassroots  and

community  organisations.  However, I believe the  Government

itself  should  go  beyond the mere provision  of  funds  and

schemes  by  extending more widely, through public  education

through the media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recall when Hong Kong was trying to promote the

use  of  electronic point-of-sale transactions  back  in  the

1980s,  they  ran  carefully-scripted  TV  campaigns,  subtly

addressing  potential concerns and complete with a  Cantonese

jingle  that  even the most conservative of housewives  would

hum.   I  would  like to urge the Minister to consider  doing

something similar for new developments which will change  the

way  we live and work, for example, what 3G is all about,  or

what  broadband access means.  And this should not be  merely

discussed  over  a  programme  over  ChannelNews  Asia,   but

extensively  carried over TCS 5, 8 and Suria, and  the  local

papers.  Some degree of understanding will, I believe,  go  a

long

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>

way towards helping those who are less tech-savvy not feel so

alienated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, to enable Singaporeans to rise

up  to  the  challenges  in the new  economy,  they  must  be

computer literate and Internet savvy.  However, there is this

digital  divide  between the high and low-income  households,

and  the  well-educated versus those who are  not.   Our  HDB

heartlanders, older workers and housewives are the  group  of

people  who may not have access to computers and,  thus,  lag

behind in embracing an e-lifestyle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC realises this importance and has pledged to

train  10,000 union leaders in basic IT and Internet  skills.

To   date,  a  few  thousand  workers  have  completed  their

training.  NTUC has even tied up with PeoplePC to adminster a

programme to give union members access to computers with  all

the support network for less than $1 a day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, union members comprise less than 30% of the

total  workforce in Singapore.  I would like to inquire about

the  plan of the Government to bridge this digital divide for

our  HDB  heartlanders, particularly the  older  workers  and

housewives.  Is the Government planning to have concrete  and

structured IT public education programmes to benefit our  HDB

heartlanders,  older  workers  and  housewives?   This  would

definitely   speed   up  the  process  of  the   Government's

initiative to bring infocomm to all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am encouraged by the efforts made by some of the

grassroots organisations, VWOs and churches to contribute, in

their  own  individual ways, to educate  the  public  on  IT.

However,  there is a limitation to their outreach.   I  would

like  to  suggest the Government develop a national programme

on IT public education, riding on the CDC, PA or PCF network,

so  that  all Singaporeans can have an opportunity to embrace

the e-lifestyle.

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I must first compliment the

Ministry and, in particular,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>

IDA for their efforts in promoting IT and e-lifestyle amongst

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The e-Celebrations, which were just inaugurated in March

last year and now held for a second time this year, have  and

will,  I  believe,  create  a greater  awareness  of  IT  and

adoption of e-lifestyle amongst Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support campaigns such as e-Celebrations in

promoting  IT  through events and mass media.  However,  such

events  as e-Celebrations here and e-Exhibition there,  while

creating  general  awareness, may not by  themselves  produce

substantial  permanent  change in  the  people's  ability  to

master  or  sit  in  front of the computer.   After  creating

awareness,  what we need is a more sustained  effort  at  the

grassroots level to reach out to the housewives, retirees and

those  who  are not so well-educated.  I suspect  that  these

groups  of people may not be reached by the mass events  such

as  e-Celebrations.  They are probably even afraid to  go  to

such  an  exhibition.  There is an inherent fear among  these

people  to anything that is high-tech, more so, if the events

are  held  in town centres, and launched in Suntec City,  and

not in an HDB heartland or HDB neighbourhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on Monday, I highlighted in this House our

experience  in setting up the Marine Parade CDC  Fengshan  IT

centres.   Sir, if you will recall, you are one  very  strong

supporter of the particular setting up of these IT centres as

Mayor  of Marine Parade CDC and for that, we all can  jointly

celebrate what we have done.  The success we have in reaching

out to some 25,000 persons going through a training programme

in  the  last  three years and equipping them with  basic  IT

skills, in my view, is grassroots action at work and is  most

encouraging.   I  have also related some  real  life  success

stories   of  housewives  and  retirees  to  show  that   the

grassroots approach is perhaps the best way to reach  out  to

this  group  of  people.  When we talk about digital  divide,

those  on the wrong side of the divide can be brought  up  to

the main stream and this can be done.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we must bring IT education to the HDB

heartlanders.    We  have  very  successful  IT   programmes.

Perhaps, if the Minister would like to see our report on what

we  have  done, I would be more than pleased to  furnish  him

with the report on what has been done in Fengshan.  It is  my

pleasure to give him such a report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore calling on the Government to consider

more  funding for grassroots organisations such as the  CDCs,

the  CCCs and RCs to promote IT to our residents.  The  funds

can be used to set up centres in the neighbourhood to provide

IT  literacy  courses.  We will bring IT to their  doorsteps.

The  funds  can  also be used to promote computer  ownership.

For instance, at Fengshan, we have refurbished and given away

200  old  computers.   Part of these funds  can  be  used  to

upgrade  some of the old computers which would be given  away

or  sell them at a much lower cost to residents and, in  this

way, we can help low-income families to own computers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe such initiatives at the grassroots level will

go  a long way to help heartlanders to overcome their fear of

IT  and  bring them on board.  This is one way which  we  can

conquer the digital divide.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the four

Members  of Parliament who have spoken on the digital  divide

and  the  importance for the Government to  act  strongly  to

narrow the digital divide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MPs have all identified the key groups that

need  to be addressed, ie, low-income earners, older workers,

housewives and senior citizens, and that we need to bring the

training programmes closer to them by bringing them into  the

HDB heartland in order to make it convenient for them to gain

access to the training facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they have also pointed out that we should not just

take  single  approaches or use single  events  like  the  e-Celebrations as a means of reaching out to them.   I  totally

agree with the remarks made by the four MPs.  What they  have

talked about reflects the complexities of the issue, and that

is, this is a multi-faceted challenge

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>

and  we  cannot  use  a "one size fits  all"  approach.   The

challenge is how to design programmes that can enable  us  to

reach out to the four groups that we are talking about.   And

here,  I  think  the "Many Helping Hands''  approach  is  the

correct one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first give Members an idea of what is being done

so  far and what do we see for the future.  One key programme

for  helping  the low-income families is something  which  Mr

Chng Hee Kok had also mentioned, and that is, giving free PCs

to  low-income  families, PCs that are bundled together  with

free  Internet access as well as free training.  We have been

working  with the various self-help groups and the grassroots

organisations like Mendaki, CDAC, SINDA and also with  a  few

CDCs.   I  am  happy to inform Members that so far,  we  have

given out a total of 2,000 PCs free to the families concerned

and  we  would  be happy to work with Members  here,  through

their  CDCs,  to  further  expand  this  programme  in  their

constituencies.  NTUC is also helping, as mentioned by Mr Yeo

Guat  Kwang, to bridge the digital divide by making ownership

of  PCs  affordable.   The  NTUC  EasyPC  Scheme  is  a  very

commendable one.  The union members can buy the PCs by paying

only  a  dollar a day and the response so far has been  quite

encouraging.  I hope NTUC will continue to push this Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government side, the Ministry of Manpower and

IDA,  together  with the NTUC, are also spearheading  certain

training schemes and these schemes are all heavily subsidised

by   the   Skills   Development  Fund,  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme, and by the NTUC Education and Training Fund.  As a

result, on the part of NTUC alone, they have managed to train

over 70,000 workers over the last three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For homemakers and senior citizens, we have the One

Learning  Place  in  the Toa Payoh Community  Library.   This

offers infocommunications training courses which are tailored

to   meet  the  individual  needs  and  capabilities  of  the

trainees.   I  think the homemakers and senior citizens  have

found that the training programmes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>

are   very  useful  because  they  can  take  those  training

programmes in the language that they are comfortable with. To-date,  the  One  Learning  Place has already  trained  20,000

housewives and senior citizens. I am also happy to  say  that

the People's Association, on its part, also conducts basic IT

training programmes for the elderly as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also have quite a few other programmes. I do

not know whether Members have heard of the IT coach.  The  IT

coach  goes  around to the CCs, schools and  shopping  malls.

The IT coach is a coach that is equipped with Internet access

facilities and PCs, and it visits the shopping malls  or  the

CCs  and  the  participants are given a very  short  training

programme that lasts between half an hour to one hour on  the

use of the PC and access to the Internet.  It is a very quick

awareness  building  programme.  So far,  the  IT  coach  has

already serviced over 60,000 people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are part of what we call the "Many Helping

Hands" approach.  Where do we go forward from here?  I  agree

with  Members  that  we have to bring the programmes  to  the

heartlanders and we are going to work very closely  with  the

CDCs  to  identify centres that can be set  up  and  for  the

funding   support  to  be  given.   Because  some  of   these

programmes  can be quite expensive, it will be difficult  for

the MPs on their own to drive the programmes.  So, by working

with the CDCs and the IDA, I think we can provide the support

to bring those programmes down to the CCs and later on to the

RC  level.   I will encourage those Members who are  keen  to

encourage their CDCs to begin the dialogue with IDA.   I  can

assure you that we will be giving you the full support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another programme that we are looking at, which is

in  line  with  what Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has  mentioned,  is  a

national  IT training programme.  Here, we are talking  of  a

national  IT  literacy programme which  would  be  a  10-hour

programme, very well-structured and drawn-up, and  we  expect

this programme to train 350,000 people over the next

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>

three  years.  The key drivers of this programme will be  the

National  Library Board because the National  Library  has  a

very  good  network  of  community  libraries  and  will   be

leveraging  on  their  facilities and their  locations.   The

other members who will be driving this programme will be  the

People's  Association, NTUC, the self-help groups like  CDAC,

SINDA  and  Mendaki.  With all these multiple approaches,  we

should be able to further narrow the digital divide.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the dot-com frenzy

has  ended  abruptly and in the process dashed  many  hopeful

dreams   but   regardless,  communication   and   information

technologies  will relentlessly move on to change  our  lives

and  our  organisations  and  institutions.   This,  we  must

remember.   We  must therefore continue with our  efforts  to

adopt  information  technology  to  transform  for  the   new

economy.  The dot-com saga must not distract us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have this nagging feeling that the national

impetus  towards  adoption  of  information  technology   has

somewhat  lost  steam.  Have we really lost the  drive?   For

example,  are we satisfied with the penetration of  usage  of

broadband?   My fellow parliamentary colleagues  have  spoken

much  on  this issue and the Minister of State, Mr  Lim  Swee

Say,  has replied as much.  But I believe that there is  much

more that we can do, and we must do.  I therefore want to add

my  voice to the appeal to the Government to seek even  lower

costs  of  broadband  access and  to  raise  the  quality  of

service.  I still feel that the broadband access charges  are

high,  even  though the Minister of State has said  that  the

prices are internationally competitive.  The cost of ADSL and

cable  broadband  access remains outside  the  means  of  the

average household.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What progress have we made with e-commerce? The

Government has used itself to spearhead this drive.  How many

Government services are now available on-line?  How  much  of

the transactions have really gone on-line?  My gut feel is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>

that we have made some headway in the public sector, but  not

much  in the private sector.  In the private sector, how many

transactions  are available on-line?  How much  has  actually

gone  on-line?   I know that some supermarkets  have  website

ordering   capabilities.   How  many  other  companies   have

emulated  them?   What else can the people  expect  from  our

companies?  Do  we  have  a secure and user-friendly  on-line

payment  system which users can trust and use?  More broadly,

what  progress have we made in e-banking?  Again, personally,

I  feel it is not much.  Do their own experience and those of

foreign  banks  which have found the journey  into  e-banking

rough  disillusioned  our banks?  I have  read  that  foreign

banks  have encountered great difficulties.  Some have scaled

down their on-line operations and others have even folded.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my fervent belief that, at least for us, the

new  economy is inevitable.  The questions asked earlier  may

not  be  easy  to  answer but thereupon the  outcome  of  our

efforts to become an information society. Besides the need to

build  an  information infrastructure, we  need  our  people,

organisations and institutions to be information oriented.  I

am  glad to hear the Minister explain the effort made to make

our  people  computer  literate.  This  necessitates  mindset

change among all parties  -  people, workers and captains  of

our  industries and institutions.  Much work needs to be done

by the nation, by everyone, to move into the information age.

I  urge that we do not relent on this task, and especially in

the  discouraged  atmosphere of the mauling  of  the  dot-com

companies and of shattered dreams, that the Government  takes

the  lead  in maintaining the momentum of this drive  towards

the information society in the new economy.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, rumours

that  e-commerce is dying or has died are, as usual,  greatly

exaggerated.   I  think e-commerce is  going  through  a  bad

patch,  and several dot-com companies have disappeared.   But

Singapore is positioning

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>

itself as an e-commerce hub, and many of us who have used  e-commerce,  including e-banking, have found it to be  somewhat

akin  to an addiction.  Like opium, you take a bit, you  want

to  have more.  But, like opium, you always have this nagging

feeling that you are doing something not quite right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is this sense of insecurity coming from? I think

it  comes  from  the fact that there is a genuine  fear  that

whatever you disclose to a dot-com company for your purchases

and  so  on,  whatever personal information may  one  day  be

compromised.   And  this fear is actually a  very  real  one.

Anyone  who has used e-banking or e-commerce will  always  be

looking  at  his credit card numbers and saying, "Where  will

this reappear next time?", whether it be in Japan or in other

parts  of  the world.  So, one of the reasons that is  fairly

well  documented  why  consumers  are  diffident  towards  e-commerce is their fear that their personal information may be

disclosed, and that if we want e-commerce to move  ahead,  we

will  need  to  come  out  with a clear  policy  on  consumer

security and privacy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this issue should be tackled sooner rather than

later.  There is a view that we should allow the industry  to

regulate itself, but it is likely to be a recipe for  inertia

or  long-term  wrangling  as to what  the  proper  procedures

should be.  In the US, they have virtually given up on  that,

and  there are currently eight Internet privacy Bills  to  be

considered by the new Congress.  And I would like now to  ask

the  Minister  to  take action to determine the  policies  of

consumer  privacy  as a means of encouraging  the  growth  of

Internet commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me just provide a familiar example of the need

for  privacy.  Many Singaporeans here, including  Members  of

this  House,  must have used Amazon.com to order  books,  and

sometimes  other  products.  In the  early  days,  Amazon.com

would  just  take  your order and send you the  articles  you

ordered, and that would be the end of the transaction.   But,

gradually, the company developed ways and means to allow you,

first, to keep

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>

track of your order.  At the same time, it kept track of what

you  ordered.  So, the next time you log on, they  will  say,

"Hello,  welcome  again.   Here are our  recommendations  for

you."  And there will be a new list of books which they  have

tracked, which they will then suggest that you look at.  Now,

they have gone one step further.  They kept track of everyone

as  a  group,  so that they can recommend to you books  which

others of similar taste have ordered, so that you too can  be

advised  as  to what else you can order.  In this  way,  they

have, of course, increased their commercial appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this type of matching of personal data and so on

suggests  privacy risks, and it also suggests that  companies

of this type will build up huge databases which one day could

be  sold for profit.  Of course, I thought that since  I  was

ordering  from  Amazon.com,  I  have  no  worries   of   this

happening.   Until  recently, I  heard  from  a  report  that

Amazon.com was about to be acquired and that if it were to be

acquired,  it was going to sell its customer database.   Now,

they  come  in for some very severe criticism, and they  have

decided  not  to  do that.  But this actually  suggests  that

there  is  a  very serious problem and that  if  we  want  e-commerce  to grow, we must also have the legal infrastructure

in  place to make sure that individuals, consumers who use e-commerce, should have the confidence to do so.  And  this  is

particularly so in the case of e-banking.  But it is also the

case  where  you  buy health products, for  example,  on  the

Internet. If  you  make  an order for  viagra  through  the

Internet, you  might be worried what people might  think  if

this information were to get into the public domain, and  you

would  like to see some privacy provisions in place for  this

sort of thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I would like to propose, as an initial step,

is  that  all  companies  which are  involved  in  e-commerce

transactions should be required to state clearly  and  simply

their  privacy policy, ie, what they will do with the private

information  that  they  collect  from  each  customer.   The

customer can then opt in or out, depending on whether he sees

the company's policy is good or bad.  We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>

should  encourage companies, particularly those  thinking  of

going  into e-commerce, to develop a best practices  approach

to  Internet trading, one aspect of which is clearly  a  good

privacy policy.  But I certainly hope that the Ministry  will

study  and quickly bring before this House a Bill to  give  a

statutory basis to privacy on the Internet.  I am sure that e-commerce will benefit as a result.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the Prime Minister recently

talked about the Asian IT Belt.  Could the Minister elaborate

on what the plans are to make this IT Belt a reality, and how

Singapore will benefit from it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, with your indulgence, just now

in  my  reply, I missed giving a reply to Mrs Lim Hwee  Hua's

remarks.   I  want to thank her for her support and  for  her

suggestion that we should go beyond just all those events, in

terms  of  creating awareness, but to also use the  media   - TV,  radio, newspapers.  Sir, I am happy to inform  her  that

last  year, in line with the inaugural e-celebrations  event,

IDA  had  also utilised TV commercials to widen the level  of

awareness amongst people.  Five TV commercials were used, and

they were telecast over Channels 5 and 8, and touched on  the

benefits  of  e-shopping,  e-banking,  e-communications,   e-learning and e-entertainment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post campaign survey showed that the level of

awareness  of the commercials was very high, and  that  there

was  a  72%  penetration amongst our target  groups.   So,  I

totally  agree  with her that the use of the  media  is  very

important.  And for this year's e-celebrations, we are  doing

the  same  thing.   We are having a 5-week  6  TV  commercial

programme, and this time it will be broadcast in the English,

Chinese,  Malay and Tamil channels.  This year, the  outreach

will  be  even  greater.  And we will definitely  review  the

success  of this programme and, if need be, we will  have  it

more often.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Dr Tan Boon Wan is concerned that

with  the  recent burst of the dot-com bubble,  our  national

impetus

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>

in  IT  may  lose its steam.  Not too long ago,  people  left

their jobs to rush into dot-com.  Today, I was told that "dot-com" is known as dot-gone, B-to-B means back to banking,  and

B-to-C means back to consulting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to assure Dr Tan Boon Wan that as far as

the Government is concerned, we look at the evolution of dot-com  development as a structural change.  It is not something

that  will  come  and go away, because we  believe  that  the

change will continue for a long, long time to come.  Over the

last  20  years,  we have had this national impetus  to  keep

Singapore up to date with IT, and we intend to continue to do

so.   In  fact, under Infocomm 21, we are pursuing the vision

of  an  e-economy, e-society as well as e-Government.  We  do

intend   to  reinvent  the  economy,  the  society  and   the

Government and public sector, so that the 3P sectors will  be

able  to progress together and we can all live a better  life

in the infocomm age of the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan asked how do we make sure that consumers

would  trust and use e-commerce.  This is also the same point

raised  by  Prof.  Chin Tet Yung.  As far  as  e-commerce  is

concerned,  again, we take it very seriously.   In  1998,  we

announced the e-commerce master plan.  Subsequent to that, we

formed  a  multi-agency committee on e-commerce action  plan.

The  whole idea is to turn the master plan into real  action.

I  am  happy  to  say that over the last 1-2 years,  all  the

Government agencies were able to work together in a concerted

manner.  We also work very closely with the industry as  well

as  the  people  sector under a 3P partnership  programme  to

pursue our vision in e-commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prof. Chin mentioned, and also pointed out by Dr Tan

Boon  Wan,  it  is  very important that we create  trust  and

confidence in the consumer in e-commerce.  Privacy is a  real

concern.    It   was  once  said  that  to  convey   personal

information over the Internet, whether it is your credit card

number  and so on, is like undressing in front of the  window

with  the  lights on.  You never know who is looking  at  you

from the other side.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, what do we do? There are

basically  three  models  in  regulating  privacy.   The   US

believed  in self-regulation.  Europe believed in  government

legislation.  And I think, over time, both have realised that

the two models will not work.  In the case of US, the pace of

self-regulation is too slow.  In the case of  Europe,  to  go

for  government legislation is too inflexible.  In fact,  the

world  is  converging  towards  the  concept  known  as   co-regulation,  meaning  that  it  is  a  combination  of  self-regulation and government legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, I am pleased to share with this

House  that  the  Ministry of Communications and  Information

Technology  has  decided  to  pursue  this  concept  of   co-regulation.   On the part of the business community,  just  a

few  days  ago,  my Minister announced the  formation  of  an

industry-led National Trust Council.  They are in the process

of  formulating  a  privacy code for the  private  sector  to

adopt.   And  I will convey to them Prof. Chin's suggestions,

eg, for all companies to state clearly their privacy policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of Government, we have taken steps to study

further into this privacy issue.  My Minister has initiated a

task force within the Ministry.  This is an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>

inter-agency  task force chaired by our Permanent  Secretary.

The  task force will study the impact of the Internet and  e-commerce  on data protection and privacy.  It will take  into

account international developments in this area and will come

out  with a recommendation regarding self-regulation  through

the  privacy code of the industry, as well as to examine  the

need for the introduction of a privacy legislation.
