<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

National Development (a)

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>

how   much  has  been  collected  from  the  Housing  and

Development  Board (HDB) resale levy  over  the  past  10

years;  (b)  what  happens to the  money  collected;  (c)

whether  the HDB resale levy is considered high  compared

to  the subsidy given per flat in today's market; and (d)

what plans are there to do a review of this levy.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, the objective of the resale

levy  is  to reduce the housing subsidy enjoyed by  those

buying  their second subsidised flat from the HDB.   When

second-timers  sold  their first  subsidised  flat,  they

would  have  cashed in the subsidy that they  enjoyed  on

their  first  flat.  The resale levy therefore  helps  to

discourage  over-consumption of public housing  subsidies

by   these  second-timer  families.   This  ensures  that

housing  subsidies are fairly allocated between them  and

first-timer  families,  who have  more  pressing  housing

needs.   I  must  emphasise  that  flat  owners  are  not

required to pay the resale levy if they do not purchase a

second subsidised flat from the HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resale levy collected by the HDB is used to

partially   offset  its  expenditure  on  home  ownership

subsidies.   The amount collected during  the  period  FY

1992  to  FY  2001 can be found in HDB's annual  reports.

The  average  amount  collected per year  is  about  $170

million.  This is a small sum when we compare it  to  the

net amount of $750 million per year that the HDB incurred

over  the  same  period to subsidise its  home  ownership

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resale levy is graded so that lessees of smaller

flats,  whom  we  recognise may have a  greater  need  to

upgrade,  pay a lower levy rate.  The subsidy enjoyed  by

these families is still attractive compared to the resale

levy  that they have to pay.  And, in fact, this  is  why

second-timer  families return to the  HDB  for  a  second

subsidised flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home ownership has always been an important facet of

our public housing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>

policy.   It  has  helped  us to achieve  greater  social

stability  and  engendered  a  sense  of  community   and

belonging  to  Singapore.  There is  a  need  for  us  to

balance  the  allocation of our home ownership  subsidies

carefully,  to ensure that they go to those who  need  it

most.   The  resale  levy policy  is  an  important  tool

through  which we achieve this.  It is still relevant  in

today's context, and therefore we have no plans to review

or remove it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, four supplementary questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in view of new flats being sold for almost

$1/2  million  in  the market, what is  the  Government's

subsidy per unit for a flat costing almost $1/2 million?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, where the subsidy is through a Government

grant of up to $50,000 for staying near the parents,  the

resale levy imposed can be seen to be more than two times

the  grant given for bigger units.  The question is:   is

HDB  aiming to profit from this grant if the levy is more

than  $50,000?   Can  the homeowner have  the  option  of

returning the grant instead of paying the levy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, for owners who are not sure whether they want

to  get a second bite of the subsidised cherry flat,  but

they  are  not making a profit from the subsidised  flat,

can this resale flat levy policy be waived for them?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> I thought he said he had

four supplementary questions.  I counted three.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the subsidy which HDB provides is in the form

of  a  market subsidy, and that is clear to anyone buying

an   HDB   flat,  because  they  know  that   when   they

subsequently sell it after the minimum occupation period,

they  sell  it at a price which is higher than what  they

originally purchased from HDB.  It is a matter of  timing

and definition as to exactly how much that sum is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that the resale levy is not a capital

gains tax.  It is not related to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>

notional  or actual profit that you would have made  from

cashing  in  your  subsidy..  This is a  policy  tool  to

ensure that people do not unnecessarily come back  for  a

second  bite of the subsidy cherry.  At the  end  of  the

day,  remember  that  there  is  a  finite  amount  which

Government  can  direct towards housing  subsidies.   The

more we allocate to people taking a second bite, the less

we have for people who are taking a first bite.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Steve Chia's supplementary questions are

missing  this point.  It is not a matter of how much  the

homeowner actually made when he sold his flat, nor is  it

a  matter of whether it was a profit or a loss.  It is  a

matter   of  directing  people  so  that  they   do   not

unnecessarily consume housing subsidies.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, may I

ask  the  Minister of State whether the HDB will consider

reducing  the  resale  levy for 3-room  flats  so  as  to

encourage  growing families staying in  3-room  flats  to

upgrade to a 4-room flat?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since May

1977,  the  resale levy for a 3-room flat  is  20%.   For

people  who do their sums, it is still financially viable

for  them to sell their 3-room flat and subsequently come

back for a second bite of a subsidised HDB 4-, 5-room  or

Executive flat, and they will still be ahead financially.

So,  the levy, in that sense, is not an impediment or  an

obstacle to them upgrading.  Obviously, because the  levy

is  graduated, for those who are already in 4- or  5-room

flats,  depending on the exact circumstances of the  case

and on the timing of the sale and purchase, it may not be

sensible for them to come back for a second bite  of  the

cherry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, the Minister of State

has not answered my question on the unit subsidy per flat

for  those  flats that are sold for almost $1/2  million.

The Minister for National Development had been quoted  in

the  papers  as saying that a $150,000 new flat  is  very

affordable  in the market.  So, what is the subsidy  that

the Government is giving for this flat?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question that the Minister of State has

not  answered me is:  will the Ministry consider  waiving

the resale levy when the houseowner actually makes a loss

when selling his subsidised flat?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am unable

to  give  him  the  exact number for  the  subsidy  of  a

notional flat which is sold for $1/2 million, because  it

depends  on where the flat is and when it was bought.   I

cannot give him a specific number to that question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question is on whether the levy can be

waived.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Whether the houseowner has

the  option to return the $50,000 grant if the  grant  is

actually lower than the resale levy that he has to pay.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> He cannot subsequently

decide  that  he does not want the housing grant  in  the

first  place and therefore is not affected by the  resale

levy  policy.  We do not allow people to play  the  rules

retrospectively.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Can the Minister of State

explain why it is not allowed?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> If we allow people to play

these games retrospectively, we are going to create  much

more  complexity and probably much more unfairness  in  a

system which is no longer transparent and clear.  We have

a  clear  set  of  policies.  Remember  that  no  one  is

compelled to buy a flat from the HDB.  Even if  a  person

wants to buy an HDB flat, he is not compelled to come and

buy a subsidised flat from the HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more important point, in fact, about the resale

levy  is  that if a homeowner does not come  back  for  a

second  subsidised flat, he cashes out the housing  grant

and  he  does  not  have to pay any levy.   That  is  the

important point.  It is entirely up to them to  do  their

sums and decide what is sensible and what is not.  We are

not  here  to  create a system in which people  can  play

games  with  the  rules, change the rules retrospectively

and decide which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>

ones apply to them and which do not apply to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, owners are not sure

whether they want to buy a second subsidised flat but  it

is  very  certain that their first subsidised  flat  that

they  bought from the HDB was at a higher price when  the

market  was  very high.  Subsequently, five years  later,

when  they  sell  the  flat, it is actually  below  their

purchase price, effectively, making a loss.  If they  are

not   very  sure  whether  they  want  to  buy  a  second

subsidised  flat, then they would need to  pay  the  levy

upfront.   For  such a case, will the Minister  of  State

consider  waiving  the levy?  Because, effectively,  they

made a loss from buying and selling a subsidised flat.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, it is the same issue

again.   I  keep emphasising that this is not  a  tax  on

profit.   Whether a houseowner has made a profit or  loss

is  irrelevant.  Let me state it explicitly.  The levy is

to discourage people from coming back unnecessarily for a

second bite of the subsidy cherry.

<div align="center"><b>SECOND PAY-TV AND SATELLITE DISHES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Acting

Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (a)

what  are  the  reasons  allowing  for  a  second  pay-TV

operator  to  enter  our  small  domestic  market,   when

satellite dishes will have been more cost-effective;  and

(b)  when  will  satellite dishes  be  approved  for  the

consumer market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr Khaw Boon Wan) (for the Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Steve Chia is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>

correct in saying that Singapore's broadcasting market is

small.   There  are  only one million  households.   This

small market is further divided among various racial  and

language   groups.    That  is   why   the   Government's

broadcasting competition policy cannot simply copy  those

of others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach we have taken is to introduce

competition incrementally.  Over the last seven years, we

have  had  a  single pay-TV operator.  That  has  allowed

Singaporeans  to enjoy a much wider range of  programming

than before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now is whether the market can support a

second  pay-TV  operator.  Our industry consultants  have

studied  the problem and concluded that the market  could

support  one more operator.  This is why we have  decided

to  offer just one additional pay-TV licence.  Even then,

we  cannot be sure that there is market interest in  this

licence, or that if awarded, the second licensee will  be

viable.   However,  this is an assessment  best  left  to

interested industry parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upside of having a second pay-TV operator is

that  the competition would help to build a more  dynamic

and  vibrant  media  industry  in  Singapore.   It  would

encourage  greater  innovation and  experimentation.   It

would  also  facilitate  the  development  of  convergent

applications  and  increase  the  sophistication  of  the

Singapore marketplace.  Consumers could benefit from  new

and improved pay-TV service offerings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for our satellite dish policy, this has been

debated   several  times  in  this  House  before.    The

installation  of  satellite  dishes  for  households  was

disallowed  to keep out undesirable content  that  is  at

odds  with our multi-racial and multi-religious  society,

and to prevent the influencing of Singapore politics from

a  distance.  This was why we built up the cable network,

so that Singaporeans would nonetheless be able to enjoy a

wider range of programmes.  Households have therefore not

lost  out  on programming variety by not having satellite

reception.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the reasons why we should not allow undesirable

contents  from  easy  access  to  the  living  rooms   of

Singaporeans  through satellite dishes remain.   Security

challenges faced by the region, such as the uncovering of

terrorist  networks here in Southeast Asia, have  brought

home  the  reality that we must continue to  be  vigilant

against influences that may split or divide our society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, since the Senior

Minister  of State agrees that Singapore is a very  small

market, is it not more cost-effective to allow individual

households to install satellite dishes instead of  having

a second agency to do that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question relates to the Senior Minister

of State's reply about regulation of undesirable content.

There  seems to be a contradiction here, because  if  the

Ministry does not seem to be able to regulate and control

undesirable content on the Internet, especially with  the

advancement of broadband, why is there a need to  control

satellite?   Is there not inefficiency or a contradiction

in the policy here?

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the market is

small, and Mr Steve Chia therefore argued that it is more

cost-effective  to  just  allow  households  to  put   up

satellite dishes.  The most cost-effective means for them

is  to  subscribe  to the existing pay-TV  operator.   Mr

Steve  Chia  may  have  the impression  that  putting  up

satellite dishes is a cheap proposition.  It is not.  The

fact  that  we are able to go for this current policy  of

disallowing satellite dishes by wiring up is  because  we

are  quite  unique.   We  are a very  small  and  compact

country.   This is one of those few advantages  of  being

small.   If  we have a huge hinterland, like  most  other

countries,   our  current  policy  will  be   harder   to

implement.  But because we are small and compact,  it  is

quite  inexpensive  for us to wire  up.   There  are  one

million  homes and, in fact, more than 90% are  high-rise

HDB  flats.   The cost of wiring up a home works  out  to

less than - I am relying on memory here - $300

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>

per home.  If you put up a dish, a good dish costs almost

$1,000.   And  one  dish  can only receive  a  particular

satellite  up in the sky.  So if you want the full  works

of  things, then you need several dishes per home.  So it

is  not  cost-effective at all.  But, of course,  if  you

have  a  large country with huge rural areas, that  is  a

different  proposition.  Then insisting that banning  the

dishes  and  wiring  up  everybody  may  not  be  a  good

solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly for us is not only it is cost-effective to cable up, cabling up allows us new

opportunities because at the end of the day, optic fibres

can  provide  a  much wider spectrum of frequencies  than

wireless  can provide.  It is not quite there  yet  today

because  the  signals  are still  analogue  but,  in  due

course, I expect the cable network to turn digital.  Then

you  would have a wide spectrum of channels to work with.

So that is the reason why in Singapore, we go for cabling

as  against allowing domestic homes to put up dishes.  It

is  a  unique situation that we are facing, and it  is  a

unique  advantage  that we are exploiting.   Whether  the

market,  as  I  said,  can accommodate  a  second  pay-TV

operator  using  some  other platforms,  it  is  for  the

industry  to decide.  Technologically, it is possible  to

go  on  a  second platform using copper wires  (telephone

wires),  which  are  already into every  home  with  ADSL

technology.  But that is for the market to decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia's second point that there is a

contradiction,  that  with  Internet,  we  seem  helpless

because  you can get any content that you want, then  why

bother  to  tighten  up  on  satellite  transmission   of

broadcasting materials?  If Mr Steve Chia truly  believes

that  through Internet you can get all and sundry - I  do

not  know whether he subscribes to cable TV, but I  do  - and  there are 300,000-over families in Singapore who  do

the same thing - if he is right, that you can already get

anything  that you want through Internet, then they  must

be  fools to subscribe to cable TV.  So, obviously,  this

banning of dishes has been effective and serves a  useful

purpose.  And for as long as it does, the ban stays.

<div align="center"><b>IRIS RECOGNITION SYSTEM</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs  (a) what is the reason for developing  and

testing  an  iris  recognition  system,  since  Singapore

already  has  the Immigration Automated Clearance  System

(IACS) which is working effectively; (b) how much does it

cost to develop each system; and (c) what will happen  to

the newly setup IACS.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Steve Chia asked why the Singapore

Immigration and Registration is developing and testing an

iris  recognition  system when the Immigration  Automated

Clearance System (IACS) is working effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by explaining what the IACS is about.

The  IACS  is  an automated immigration clearance  system

that  leverages on biometric technology to  identify  the

travellers.  The fingerprint of the traveller  is  stored

in  a  smart card and then used to match the actual  live

fingerprint presented by the traveller during immigration

clearance.  ICAS not only does away with the need for  an

immigration  officer  to man each clearance  counter,  it

also enhances security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IACS is not a new system, as Mr Steve Chia seems

to  suggest.  It was first implemented at Changi  Airport

in   1997.    It  was  extended  to  Tuas  and  Woodlands

Checkpoints  in  1998  and  1999  respectively  for   bus

travellers.   The cost of implementing the  ICAS  is  $13

million.    We   have  not  implemented  the   ICAS   for

motorcyclists  after a trial in 1999, because  the  total

clearance   time   could   not   meet   our   operational

requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, biometrics technology is a fast evolving field.

International  research has shown that iris  recognition,

which  works  by  scanning and matching  the  human  iris

pattern, has a very high level of accuracy and is  faster

compared to fingerprint matching.  Hence, SIR decided  to

conduct  an  iris  recognition  trial  for  about   3,000

motorcyclists   on  a  voluntary  basis   at   the   land

checkpoints from June to December

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>

last year to test the feasibility of implementing it on a

full scale for the motorcycle lanes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will not only reduce manpower, but more

importantly, it will also enhance the level  of  security

without increasing the clearance time.  The trials at the

Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints cost about $300,000  each.

SIR is now evaluating the results of the trial which seem

to be quite encouraging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not the only country that is exploring

the  latest  biometrics technology to  enhance  security.

Under  the current security situation, countries such  as

the  United  States, Australia, Japan  are  also  on  the

lookout for advanced biometrics technology for deployment

at their checkpoints.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, why was there not

much thought given to the IACS system when it was set up?

Is it because the Ministry has been given too much money,

so  they  spend  on this, and then later they  find  that

another system ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chia, just ask your question. No

speeches.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> The question is: why is

there  not much thought given?  And is there a new system

coming  forth  in a few years' time to replace  the  iris

system again?  Are we spending too much money on this?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> If Mr Steve Chia had listened to

my  answer clearly, he would have known that I said  that

such  biometric technology evolves and is fast  changing.

At  that time in 1997, fingerprint recognition seemed  to

be  the  better  alternative, iris technology  was  still

quite  new.  And now we have a new one too called  facial

recognition.   All  these systems change  all  the  time.

When  we decided to do the IACS in 1997, we decided  that

it  was a good system to be implemented in both the  land

and  airport  checkpoints, and  it  served  our  purpose.

There is no waste of money.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  face formidable challenges in a world which  is

changing  rapidly and radically.  To me, the  thrust  and

the message of the Budget Statement and the ERC Report is

clear.   To  succeed in this new increasingly competitive

environment,  Singaporeans must be ready  for  a  mindset

change.  The Economic Review Committee has come out  with

various recommendations, including some radical ones,  to

ensure that we are able to keep pace with the changes and

meet  the  challenges effectively.  As many Members  have

emphasised,  it  is crucial that the recommendations  are

implemented  quickly  so  that  we  keep  ahead  of   our

competitors.   It  will not be easy or painless,  but  we

cannot  afford  to be soft.  There will be problem  areas

that   will  have  to  be  dealt  with  sensitively   and

carefully.  We will have to manage changes in a way  that

more  confidence will  be generated along the  way.   Our

track  record  in managing changes in the past  has  been

recognised  by  many all over the world as exemplary  and

the  resources  that  we  have  pooled  over  the  years,

especially  our  financial and  human  resources,  should

provide  the  confidence  to  succeed  even  though   the

challenges  are  more serious than  what  we  have  faced

before.   Social cohesion is critical and in the  process

of  meeting  the  challenges, we  will  have  to  provide

special  provisions for those who find it hard  to  cope,

mainly  because of their education and age.   And  as  we

make  progress,  we  will have to ensure  that  everyone,

regardless of race, language or religion, will be able to

seize the opportunities that emerge, especially when they

have  made  the efforts to adapt and be relevant  to  the

changes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past two days, many valuable comments

and  proposals were made by Members, particularly my  PAP

colleagues,  including the need to provide more  help  to

the  local businesses and SMEs, cutting red tape,  better

information  sharing of retraining and upgrading  courses

available  for our workers, so that they are better  able

to   consider  available  employment  opportunities.    I

support these proposals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to turn to some specific issues.

First,  employment  opportunities  for  older  or  mature

workers  who  have  voiced  their  concerns  about  their

employment difficulties.  They pointed out that employers

prefer  younger  workers,  even  though  they  have  work

experience  and  the required skills and  qualifications.

It    is   frustrating   for   them   after   they   have

conscientiously  attended retraining or skills  upgrading

courses to face barriers to employment, even though  they

have  realistic expectations of the job and  compensation

terms.   With  the changes in the CPF contribution  rates

for older workers, especially those in the 50 to 55 years

age  group,  their wages would have been  moderated.   We

will  have to urgently change employers' mindsets to  get

them  to give the older workers a fair opportunity to  be

employed.   In  the new work environment where  companies

have   to   constantly   restructure   to   boost   their

competitiveness,   workers  will   face   more   frequent

employment changes.  It will be very stressful for  older

workers  in  this new employment regime if the  employers

only   prefer  the  younger  workers.   It  is  therefore

necessary  for  the  Government  to  address  this  issue

urgently  and  to consider incentives to jolt  employers'

mindsets to be fair in providing employment opportunities

to  older  workers who have gone for skills and knowledge

upgrading  to be relevant to the current demands  of  the

workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, complaints or allegations of

discriminatory   hiring   practices.    Sir,   some   job

applicants  have  provided feedback at my meet-the-people

sessions  and  some have also written to the  press  that

they  are discriminated when they apply for a job.   They

can  understand  that there are jobs  which  may  require

special requirements

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>

and,  if  they  do  not  meet the job  requirements,  for

example,  a  language ability or, more specifically,  the

ability  to speak Mandarin, or any other special  skills,

they  will not be considered for the job.  However,  they

feel   very   aggrieved  when  they  consider  themselves

qualified  based  on  the  job  specifications,  but  not

considered  for jobs for reasons which are not disclosed.

They simply cannot understand their rejections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such grievances should be urgently addressed.

Otherwise,  there will be a loss of trust and  confidence

and our social cohesion will be severely tested.  At this

time of great uncertainty and increasing competition,  we

must  strengthen our unity and pull together to become  a

formidable competitor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the sensitive issues of

foreign  talents.   Some Singaporeans  have  also  voiced

their  concerns of being displaced by foreign workers  or

talents.  The ERC Report has recognised that bringing  in

foreign talent is a sensitive issue, especially so now in

a    slow   economy   with   retrenchments   and   rising

unemployment.  However, we must be able to attract enough

global  talents in order to be a dynamic and  competitive

economy.   There  is,  in fact, a great  competition  for

global talents and it would be better for us to get  them

in  our  workforce  than  in our competitors'  workforce.

They can certainly help create more job opportunities for

Singaporeans.  Having said this, I think more needs to be

done to explain to Singaporeans why it is vital for us to

attract  foreign  or  global  talent  to  complement  our

workforce so that we are a world-class workforce able  to

sustain  the  attraction of good quality  investments  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the development of an entrepreneurial

culture  so that Singaporeans at all levels can  be  more

enterprising and more self-reliant, I support  the  ERC's

proposal to extend programmes to promote entrepreneurship

to  the  young  people through the Community  Development

Councils.  Sir, allow me to share the experience at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>

the   South   East  CDC.   We  are  promoting   a   Young

Entrepreneurs  Programme.   Last  year,  we  organised  a

Breakthrough Camp for students to encourage them to break

out  of  the  mould  and  to acquire  an  entrepreneurial

spirit.   During  the  camp,  the  students  were  taught

business skills emphasising creative as well as practical

aspects.   The students were challenged in a  very  short

time  to work a business proposal with limited resources,

that is, simulating the real world.  They presented their

business  ideas  to  a  panel  of  "investors"  and   the

successful  projects  went on  to  organise  a  Christmas

Bazaar  at  the Marine Parade Promenade.  Even the  teams

that  were  not  selected were  so  fired  up  that  they

organised  themselves as a marketing team to promote  the

Bazaar.   They  made a profit of over $6,000  which  they

unhesitantly donated to the Straits Times' School  Pocket

Fund showing that they were entrepreneurs with a heart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the process, we also created a community in

support of entrepreneurs as parents, teachers and members

of  the  Marine  Parade Merchants Association  came  out,

despite  a  heavy  downpour,  to  encourage  the  budding

entrepreneurs.  There is great interest among  the  young

and  we will certainly continue with programmes with  the

aim of developing a strong, young entrepreneur network in

the South East District.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime

Minister and Minister for Finance what will be the impact

of  an increase in oil prices and a long, protracted  war

in  Iraq on our economy.  Are we ready with a contingency

plan in case of such an eventuality?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am confident that Singaporeans, our leaders,

employers, businessmen and workers have what it takes  to

ride  over  our current problems and build a more  robust

and  competitive economy.  However, we have to watch  the

external   environment   closely   and   understand   the

developments and trends.  We cannot afford to be soft and

must    proceed    quickly   to   implement    the    ERC

recommendations.  We have to cast aside the old  mindsets

and  firmly  resolve to pull together  to  find  new  and

better ways to earn a good living.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

just  like  my colleagues and fellow Singaporeans,  I  am

encouraged  by  the  Deputy Prime  Minister  and  Finance

Minister,  Mr Lee Hsien Loong's bold vision  in  steering

Singaporeans in this dull time into a safer environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the title of my speech is `Striking a Balance - Going Forward'. The Budget has many practical aspects to

strengthen  our  Singaporeans'  resolve.   I   shall   be

focusing  on  four  aspects.  They are strengthening  the

social  compact,  embracing a flexible future,  restoring

CPF for the senior workforce and university graduates  in

the School of Straight Talk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on strengthening the social compact. The

crux  of  Budget  2003 is about remaking  the  individual

spirit  and soul of Singaporeans as we embark on a future

of  uncertainties.  Ever true to its political philosophy

of  "a  government of the people, for the people, by  the

people,"   Budget  2003  promises  a  place   for   every

Singaporean  who  makes the effort in the  new  Singapore

economy  through the focused assistance of the Government

and the support of the unions and employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focused assistance and support do not equate with

freebies   and  Singaporeans  must  begin  to  take   the

incremental steps to self-reliance.  Logic dictates  that

priorities   must   first  go  into   strengthening   the

fundamentals and infrastructure for the New Economy.  The

big challenge ahead is how fast is the Government able to

implement  the many recommendations of the ERC which  are

supposed to revitalise the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions ahead of us include: are Singaporeans

ready for the wheel of change?  In doing so, how can  the

Government  strike a balance to ensure  that  we  do  not

leave behind those older ones who are unable to catch up?

On  the  other hand, if we were to move too slowly,  then

how  can  we ensure that the needs of the younger  cohort

will be fulfilled?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not forget that there will always be in

our midst those who are not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>

capable of managing transition and also those who need to

be  given  the  booster  to get  themselves  going.   The

spiritual  surgery  that Singaporeans are  going  through

must  be  supported by rich social capital where we  will

have  to  invest  the  time and efforts  to  explain  and

educate the population on policy and directions taken  by

the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People must feel that there is trust, respect and

compassion  in the society that they live  in.   This  is

where the Government must be at the helm.  I have had the

opportunity  of co-chairing one feedback session  on  the

expectations for Budget 2003 and also speaking to various

stakeowners of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the newspaper reporting, I am happy to

note  that there was concern expressed for the needy poor

who  include  the middle income group whose  breadwinners

have  lost their jobs.  Brought up in a culture of  loans

ranging from loans for homes to cars, to household goods,

to   credit  cards,  many  have  a  string  of  financial

commitments.   Yes, they can downgrade and sell off  even

at  a loss.  The fact remains that they are out of a  job

and  may  be  so  for a long time to come especially  for

those aged 40 and above.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there were calls for Government subsidies

and  grants, these were dignified calls.  They were calls

for  targeted subsidies, grants and loans for  a  limited

period  to  help the unemployed tide over their difficult

time.  I call these reasonable calls because we have,  in

our  midst,  social  capital  that  has  self-regard  and

empathy.   They  were not asking for freebies.   Here,  I

join  my  fellow MPs before me to urge the Government  to

consider a portion of the CPF account for the purpose  of

granting loans to those retrenched and who need  to  tide

over their difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was saddened by what I saw when I went for my

house  visit in the evening in Boon Lay.  The electricity

of  two  households was cut off.  In one  household,  the

children  were  seen  straining their  eyes  doing  their

homework in the dim candlelight.  In another household, a

little  girl  was  reading under the  dim  light  of  the

corridor.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retrenched middle-income group has never

been   included  in  any  form  of  Government  financial

assistance.   With an increasing cohort  of  Singaporeans

falling  into this group, it is timely that we give  them

more  attention.   Out of the 18,000  or  so  retrenched,

7,000  comes  from  this cohort, and  this  is  no  small

number.    In  the words of DPM Lee "we  now  live  in  a

fundamentally changed world", it is therefore appropriate

that  Singaporeans should wear a new mindset.  Of course,

with  this come adjustments to realities around us  which

include lowering our expectations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are a pragmatic lot and I trust that we

have  the  social capital and qualities to will ourselves

to  do  what we need to do to survive.  Nonetheless,  the

Government  must realise that there is a  social  compact

with  its people.  This social compact is to deliver jobs

and  stability to the people of Singapore who, in return,

give the votes to the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unlike the employment relationship that a

corporation  has  with  its employees.   That  employment

relationship  is a commercial contract and therefore,  an

enterprise  can within reasonable limits of the  contract

terminate this commercial contract.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, social capital is not just focused on how we

might increase the wealth of an individual and a country.

Social  capital  is itself a form of wealth.   Sure,  our

social  connections can help us in business but  feelings

of   connection  and  commensurate  feelings  of  safety,

comfort  and  support constitute important  qualities  of

life.  As we look for competitive ways to be competitive,

the  Government  must  develop this social  compact  with

Singaporeans in the midst of severe cost cutting and  job

losses  due  to retrenchment.  It is through building  up

this   social  capital  that  we  can  strengthen   every

Singaporean's  resolve, and collectively forge  a  better

and  flexible future.  Hence, the social compact  of  the

Singapore  Government  with its  people  must  strengthen

during these times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my second point on embracing a

flexible future.  To embrace

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>

a  flexible  future,  Singaporeans have  to  discard  old

practices  and  habits,  even  practices  that  might  be

considered  sacred  cows.   Hence,  both  employers   and

employees need to adopt a new mindset and better ways  of

doing  things.   This  includes flexi work  arrangements,

overtime  payments, flexi compensation and other overtime

arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two main domains of the flexi future that we can

consider  are  the collective agreements and  flexi  work

mindset.  On collective agreements, employers and  unions

may  even need to review the terms and conditions in  the

collective  agreements  so as to  help  employers  better

manage  the manpower cost structure, including  benefits.

For  instance, why should some collective agreements have

fixed  increments and benefits, especially in a  volatile

situation,  where  we have to lower  costs  to  safeguard

jobs?  We may even need to shed `grandfather baggages' in

the  collective  agreements.  Why should such  collective

agreements be signed for a duration of three  years?   In

such volatile times, there may be a need for us to put in

place  flexi arrangements to review high cost  items  and

irrelevant conditions which are deemed inappropriate in a

changed situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister has put it, there is no iron

rice  bowl.   Today,  it  is about  disposable  styrofoam

bowls.  In driving productivity and cost competitiveness,

early retirement and layoffs are just some of the options

open  to  companies.  Very often, the hidden  costs  come

from `grandfather rights' in the form of shift and roster

patterns  and  entrenched compensation  and  benefits  in

collective  agreements.  One may argue, "Well, collective

agreements are negotiable documents.  Go and bargain  for

the best deal."  But we know that negotiations tidying up

wastages   arising  from  fixated  items  in   collective

agreements   can  be  protracted.   Therefore,   a   more

convenient and expeditious way taken by most companies is

to  retrench  or  offer  early  retirement.   It  enables

companies to turn around bottomline results quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In new economy thinking, clean wage ensures cost

competitiveness for business

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>

and   saves   jobs.   Renewal  of  collective  agreements

traditionally cost companies anything from 3-5%  increase

to  the  payroll.  Moreover, they can tie companies  down

for  a  good three years.  Perhaps it is time to  rethink

the  structure and purpose of a collective  agreement  in

the  new economy, just as the unions themselves have been

evolving their role to be more relevant.  So, instead  of

just massive layoffs or early retirement, perhaps we  can

substitute  with  smaller-scale  layoffs  and  trim   the

`grandfather baggage' in the collective agreements.  They

can  achieve  similar outcomes.  In  fact,  they  can  be

neater.   Newcomers  to the company  simply  inherit  the

`grandfather rights.'  So what happens is that whilst  we

weed off employees at one end, the other end continues to

grow  into  the rigidity of the system.  Cost, therefore,

continues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are facing a very uncertain future,

with a number of factors converging at the same time: the

worst  economic  downturn since independence,  structural

unemployment,  highest unemployment rate, poor  fertility

rates,  threats of terrorists acts, and the looming  Iraq

war.   Against  this  background,  Singaporeans  need  to

strengthen their resilience to overcome these challenges.

We  can  do  this  by  adopting a  flexi  and  pro-active

mindset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be challenges that we had to contend

with.   Today,  and  in  the  future,  we  have  to  face

uncertainties.  While challenges spur us  on  with  hope,

uncertainties  underscore an unpredictable future,  which

can turn hope into despondency.  Here, the Government and

grassroots  leaders must step in to raise the  confidence

of Singaporeans and encourage them to plough on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second domain is on flexi mindset. We will

begin  to  see  a  workforce made up of economic  gypsies

simply  because  they  have turned itinerant,  so  as  to

adjust   to  an  increasingly  complex  and  inconsistent

business environment.  Singaporeans must recognise that a

flexi  arrangement is an important source of  competitive

advantage   for   companies.   Two  noteworthy   benefits

observed by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>

companies   with   flexi   arrangements   are    enhanced

productivity  and  being  nimble  in  different  business

environments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of employment relations, we see new

trends   emerging.   Companies  are  beginning  to   hire

temporary  part-time  or contract workers.   Today,  some

37,000  people in Singapore are classified as  `temporary

or  part-time  employees'.  This may be  a  small  number

compared  to many other countries, but it is a  50%  jump

from  the  number recorded in 1998.  In today's difficult

times, a temporary job is always better than no job  but,

clearly,  there  are many issues to be  considered.   For

example,  companies  may  have  to  specially  invest  in

training  for their short-term or part-time employees  so

as  to  raise  their  productivity.   Furthermore,  while

employees may be denied a coherent career structure, they

are  flexible,  as  they can move on to  other  companies

requiring their services.  Companies will be able to stay

competitive with a flexible workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge Singaporeans to adopt a flexible mindset with

regard  to  employment.  Many of the jobs that have  gone

may  never  come back.  Flexibility is a way of  widening

the  potential labour market.  In addition to  short-term

or  part-time working, flexible work arrangements come in

other  forms.  They can include job sharing, tele-working

or working from home, besides contract work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Committee of the ERC on Enhancing Human

Capital has, in its recommendations, highlighted the need

to  grant  companies  the discretion  to  implement  work

schedules that are based on their actual strategic needs.

In  other  words, organisations should be  given  greater

freedom to implement flexible working practices, so as to

better optimise their manpower resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the success of a flexible future hinges on

implementing  a  framework  or  guidelines   to   prevent

malpractices,  as  well as engaging  the  HR  fraternity.

There  was  also a recommendation to review  the  present

employment   legislation,   which   often   limits    the

implementation of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>

flexi   work  arrangements.   As  the  Sub-Committee   on

Enhancing  Human Capital has rightly noted, a  flexi-work

arrangement  can only succeed if employers and  employees

are  prepared to adapt to new practices.  To ensure  that

malpractices do not take place, the Ministry of Manpower,

together  with the unions, employers and professional  HR

bodies,   should  put  in  place  broad  guidelines   for

implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry also highlighted the challenges posed

as a consequence of `contingency workers'.  Non-permanent

workers,  for example, are not automatically entitled  to

employee   benefits,  such  as  medical   and   insurance

entitlements.  One option currently under review  is  the

introduction of medical benefits that are pegged  to  the

number of hours worked in a month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this point, I would like to declare that I

am  a  HR practitioner as well as the President of  SHRI,

and  what  I am about to speak reflects the views  of  my

profession and Institute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are three areas that the HR fraternity

would  like  to offer its services to promote a  flexible

culture  in  our  industry. They are joint  participation

with the Tripartite Body, SBF as well as the newly set up

CET statutory board and the CAL.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues arising from implementing flexi

collective  agreements and work mindset will need  to  be

addressed by the HR experts and practitioners from the HR

fraternity.  These credible professionals have  years  of

practical   experience  and  insights  into   issues   of

organisation  and  employment.  No  substitute  can  just

spring  out of the blue to resolve these issues.   I  say

this  because - although I am the Co-Chairperson  of  the

Sub-Committee on Enhancing Human Capital - I only came to

know that SBF and SPRING Singapore are poised to forge HR

excellence  and  competencies when I  saw  the  print  in

chapters  12  and  13  of the ERC  report.   On  national

programmes such as these, it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>

important that the HR fraternity play a key role as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is heartening to note and hear from many

quarters, including our highest political leadership,  on

the  importance of human capital.  As co-players, the  HR

fraternity  sees  itself  as  a  plus  component  in  the

tripartite formula.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been re-making itself in every sphere

in  the  last two years.  Why not re-make the  Tripartite

Body  into  a Tripartite-Plus that will then see  a  more

visible  impact  of  the professionals  in  the  decision

making  of  the Tripartite Body?  I am glad that  the  HR

fraternity  in  the  private sector, represented  by  the

Ministry  of  Manpower  as well and  by  SHRI,  has  been

actively  promoting  and  showcasing  HR  excellence  and

practices  through a community of learning  and  sharing,

both locally and overseas.  As mentioned, the SBF will be

setting  up  a  HR  Centre  of  Excellence  to  drive  HR

practices and excellence in the private sector.   The  HR

fraternity   sees   itself  synergising   its   practical

experience  and  practices with  the  Centre.   I  see  a

twinning  of  the 38-year-old SHRI with  the  newborn  HR

Centre of Excellence of the SBF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embracing a flexible future is to remain relevant

with   the   skills  and  knowledge  that  will   empower

Singaporeans to stay employable, as well as to assume any

form  of self-employment activities.  This entails  every

Singaporean to acquire multi-skills and lifelong learning

capabilities.  This is their only form of safety  net  to

endure    uncertainties   in   the   environment.     The

establishment  of  a  national Continuing  Education  and

Training  (CET)  body  and a Centre  for  Adult  Learning

(CAL),  together with the setting up of portable training

accounts  for  our workforce, will ensure that  Singapore

has the future workforce that is relevant to the needs of

the   industry.    The  ERC  recommendations   to   equip

Singaporeans  for the future and to help Singaporeans  to

face  up  to  the challenges are concrete steps  to  this

flexible future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on restoring CPF for the senior workforce, the

Minister for Finance, in his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>

Budget speech, announced that the restoration of the  CPF

rate  to 20% will not take place over the next two years.

Instead,  the current 16% rate of employer's contribution

will be retained over the next two years.  The purport of

this measure is to ensure that wage costs do not get  out

of  line  with  the urgent priority of helping  Singapore

recover  from this recession.  Since wage costs represent

a  significant  part of total costs in  Singapore  today,

this  move  is  indeed  a signal to investors  that  this

Government  is serious about tackling the issue  of  cost

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, there are a number of concerns that I

would  like  to raise with respect to the  issue  of  not

restoring  the 20% employer contribution rate  for  those

who  are  50 and above, even when this recession is  well

behind  us. The main concern behind this policy  is  that

older  Singaporeans are able to find jobs in the  future.

Most  of the concerns centre around the observation  that

employers  perceive older workers to be more costly  than

their younger counterparts, and less productive as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a number of my colleagues have said so before, I

think the Government would have a better time selling its

case if it can back up the assumptions with solid data to

show that older workers do not represent value for money,

when  compared to their younger counterparts.   Is  there

data  evidence  to  show  that  older  workers  are  less

productive and would cost more in terms of the  value-add

they  bring  to the job, as compared to younger  workers?

Are   there   real,  concrete  bits  of  information   to

conclusively  demonstrate that the policy of  maintaining

the   employer's  CPF  contribution  rate  at  16%  would

significantly reduce the overall costs of doing  business

in Singapore and, therefore, increasing the employability

of older workers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent experience that this group of people

could  not  gain  re-employment after losing  their  jobs

suggests  that the problem of employability may have  its

cause elsewhere.  If such is the case, then the policy of

not restoring the employer's contribution to 20% for this

group of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>

workers would be a double whammy blow for them.  I  think

that  it  would be much more prudent to educate employers

to  change  their  perceptions concerning  older  workers

rather  than  adopt  a  measure  that  may  not  be  very

effective to begin with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially so when we think about the

difficulties many among this group of workers would  face

in  ensuring  that they have sufficient funds  for  their

retirement and not have to depend on the state for  their

upkeep.  While it is laudable to attempt to maintain  the

employability  of  this  group of  workers,  it  is  also

important  that we keep other objectives in  mind  before

implementing  the policy.  This is especially  so  if  we

wish  to  ensure that many older workers  do  not  suffer

undue hardship in the years to come.  Sir, I also join my

colleagues  in  advocating for  a  mindset  programme  or

campaign  for  employers  with regard  to  employing  the

senior workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth aspect is providing the university

graduates  a transit in the School of Straight  Talk.   I

would   like  to  urge  those  graduates  who  are  still

unemployed to take an active lifestyle during  this  time

by  tapping  the services available at self-help  groups,

CDCs and SPEC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPEC is termed the `School of Straight Talk' because

it  runs  practical programmes that equip the  retrenched

participants  with  realities of a downturn,  values  and

skills  and assist them with job placements.   Such  pre-employment orientation talk in an unemployment  situation

can  be  useful.   Bottom-line driven  organisations  are

shunning university graduates for diploma holders and ITE

graduands   because  these  are  supposed  to   be   less

demanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact, many bottom-line driven

organisations are taking this opportunity to recast  jobs

traditionally  held  by the `O' and `A'  levels  holders.

Many  of  these jobs are now redesigned and enlarged  for

the diploma holders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the potential of the university

graduates lies in their ability to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>

contribute  at  a  higher strategic  level.   There  will

always be a need in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, if university graduates are prepared to

start  from  the  lowest end and win over  the  potential

employer  with  a  willing attitude,  they  can  have  an

advantage in terms of their strategic contribution to the

company in the long run.  It can be very discouraging  to

be faced with a bleak job prospect and, at the same time,

being told that their failure to find a job is because of

their unrealistic expectations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over FM 93.8 radio, graduates were interviewed on

their  feelings  about  the  job  market  and  many  have

expressed despondency over the bleak job prospect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned that if this matter is not given

the attention, the morale of our university graduates and

their resolve to find a job would be affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Straight Talk runs programmes on

Entrepreneurship, Self-Employment and Minding the Mind in

difficult  times.  Such programmes will  help  boost  the

confidence of our graduates, inculcate a flexible mindset

and equip them with practical skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to extend some financial

assistance under the WSTP funding for retrenched  workers

to  this  group of graduates as well.  In this way,  they

can  prepare themselves better for the job that they  are

looking  for.   And  so, university  graduates  need  not

despair whilst waiting for that job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to raise that in

our  pursuit for unprecedented structural change, we must

be  mindful  that our transactions and relationship  with

people  do  not evolve into an adversarial stance,  where

each hardens its resolve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do not need more are the quick fixes to

problems within the rules in the box.  Instead,  we  need

strong  social  capital  support for  the  stark  choices

arising from thinking out of the box.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As people grapple in the dark to find new ways, they

want  and need help.  Such help must be based on respect,

trust  and  advocacy of interests within the  context  of

evolving new lives for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Budget 2003 will spur the implementation of the

ERC   recommendations  and  the  success  lies   in   the

acceptance  of a flexi future by the public, private  and

people  sectors of Singapore.  Only then can the  economy

remain competitive for years to come.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I   would  like  to  focus  on  two  groups,  the   older

Singaporeans and young Singaporeans: what do they have to

look forward to?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, older Singaporeans. In this debate, much has

been   said  about  the  problems  posed  by  our   aging

workforce,  such  as  increased social  spending  in  the

future.  The  answer to this problem, as  stated  in  the

Budget Statement, is:  we must find new sources of growth

or  else  stagnate and decline.  Put this way, the  aging

population is cast as a burden on society and  the  cause

of  possible stagnation.  Why not view them instead as  a

potential  engine  for  economic  growth?   The   greying

population can be a big opportunity for business and  can

spur the Silver Sector, the industry for senior citizens.

This would involve not only medical and nursing care, but

also  creating,  producing  and  marketing  products  and

services  to  meet  their changing needs  and  interests.

This  would  include  anti-aging  healthcare  and  beauty

products,  health  supplements like Viagra,  cheaper  and

better   alternatives  to  that,  as  well   as   leisure

activities.  The Silver Sector may also boost the pension

and insurance industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just look at the phenomenon of line dancing which

took  our older Singaporeans by storm.  Imagine how  much

money  some  entrepreneurs made by selling cowboy  boots,

cowboy  hats and chequered shirts.  Mind you,  these  are

not  cheap stuff.   As I understand it, the cowboy  boots

are brought in from Australia and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>

they  cost from $100 to $1,000 a pair and they are  being

snapped  up by our not-so-young residents and  during  an

economic downturn.  Sir, we should not keep painting  all

older  Singaporeans as people without spending power  and

who would only drain our resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 10 years, we will have more empty nesters

than  young people.  Empty nesters are those aged  40  to

59,  with  their youngest nearing financial independence.

We  will  also  have more aging singles with considerable

purchasing  power.   The  number  of  empty  nesters   is

forecast  to grow by 50% to 10.9 million during the  next

decade  in  economies  like Hong Kong,  Singapore,  South

Korea and Taiwan. At the same time, the youth market will

shrink  by  10% during the same decade.  In  Japan,  some

companies  are  already reorienting  their  marketing  to

appeal  to the senior citizens.  As the Asian Wall Street

Journal  reported on February 28th, Yamaha Corp  had  two

years  ago created an easy to play electronic guitar  for

older people who grew up on the Beatles and Japanese folk

rock  and  who had always wanted to play the  guitar.  So

they produced an easier version of the electronic guitar.

The  guitar was a hit with those above 50 and  they  were

all snapped up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another reason why the Government should

nurture  the  Silver  Sector as one  of  our  new  growth

industries.   It  would  also help  with  the  employment

situation  of  our  older  workers.  Studies   in   other

countries show that companies with customers aged over 45

are   more  likely  to  employ  a  mature  worker.  These

companies  know  that  if they are to  appeal  to  mature

customers, they need to improve the level of service they

offer this group.  Older workers will become increasingly

important in developing relationships with customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growing population would also influence

employment  trends.   In Australia,  the  second  biggest

employer group was hospitals and nursing homes with about

330,000 workers.  As its population gets older and begins

to   require  even  more  medical  attention,  employment

categories such as medical and dental services are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>

expected to continue to grow.  This means more jobs would

be created in these sectors. Are we projecting for this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of our older workers today feel that their

future  in Singapore looks like a bleak one because  what

they hear and see is this: their pay needs to be cut year

after  year  by the CPF to make them more employable  and

then  jobs  are still hard to come by even with  the  CPF

cuts.   Cost  will keep rising as public services  become

more  market-oriented.  Medical and social services  will

be  means-tested.   They are a burden  to  society.   The

emphasis is on nurturing the young, and not the old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to get through to them a better vision

of  their  future - or else why should they buy into  it?

That  is  why  one of the brightest spots in this  year's

Budget  to me is the setting up of a new statutory  board

for  Continuing Education and Training.  It should tailor

programmes specifically for our mature workers which  can

then place them into decent jobs.  If the pay is too  low

with  reduced  CPF  and  the job is  too  onerous,  older

workers  may not see it as worth their while to carry  on

working.   One way to encourage them to continue  working

is to provide financial incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under one proposal in Australia, people who

work for five years beyond their pension age could become

eligible  for  a tax-free payment of A$25,000  when  they

retire.   We need not be so generous.  But the option  to

me seems stark - unemployed and pessimistic older workers

clamouring  for  more  handouts and  subsidies  or  older

workers with decent jobs which make them feel useful  and

wanted,  and a decent quality of life to make  them  glad

that they are Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to young Singaporeans, Sir, their mood today

is one of frustration and despondency.  Many of our fresh

graduates  have found it hard to get the jobs they  want.

But  it is useful to remember that this is not the  first

time  that  we  have been through such a difficult  time.

Indeed, when I graduated in 1986, it was a recession year

and I too found it hard to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>

find  a  job. After my final examinations, jobs  were  so

scarce  that  I  had  to  take a part-time  job,  telling

children stories at the Robinson's toy department.  I was

hired  by a young entrepreneur who was bringing in  teddy

bears  from  Australia, and for each bear,  there  was  a

character in the story.  So I gained from the efforts  of

a  young entrepreneur.  My pay was $100 a week as my  job

was  only over the weekends in the afternoons in the  toy

department.  That was about $400 a month.  But the  money

managed to tide me over for about two months until I  got

a  full-time  job at $800 a month. So that was  double  - what joy!  And that was as an editor-cum-writer-cum-sales-cum-marketing  person-cum-ad-copywriter-cum  many   other

small jobs for a small time publication company.  It  was

an  insecure  job  because  the company's  finances  were

shaky.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite the poor prospects, I thought having a

job was much better than having none.  And frankly, I had

a  great time because I felt stretched and I also  learnt

to stretch the dollar.  And one of the greatest pleasures

for  me  in  those  days was to save up  enough  to  have

breakfast at McDonald's.  But about five months later  in

August  1986, I got a job in the Straits Times which  was

the start of a more stable career until I joined politics

in 2001.  I tell this story to remind ourselves that this

gloomy   situation  for  our  young  graduates  is   only

temporary.   The  crucial thing I learn is  to  keep  our

chins up and to seize every opportunity that comes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this tough time as an opportunity for our

young  Singaporeans  to  show  their  mettle.   The  more

entrepreneurial  among us should strike  out  and  follow

their  passion. What is the worst that could happen?   We

fail,  so  what?  Try again, better than staring  at  the

wall  and  griping.  And with the Minister  of  State  in

charge  of entrepreneurship, the outlook should  be  more

promising now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more creative among us should write plays,

poems,  songs, make movies that can give us  a  different

view of things

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>

and,  in  the process, help lift us from this gloom.   In

this  respect,  I am pleased that the Government  is  not

stinging on its investment in the arts scene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure how many of you remember but there is

this  song  titled "Happy Days are Here Again".   It  was

written  in  1929  in the US for a movie called  "Chasing

Rainbows" and the chorus goes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy days are here again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skies above are clear again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let us sing a song of cheer again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy days are here again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this song was written and sung in the midst of

the  Great Depression in the US.  Yet the lyrics are  one

of  hope  and  cheer.   You  have  to  hear  the  Barbara

Streisand version to hear how exhilarating the  song  can

be.   What  we are going through is by no means  a  great

depression, but where we are heading towards is indeed  a

great destination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget is a step towards realising the vision of

a  leading  global city, a hub of talent, enterprise  and

innovation and one of the best places to work and live in

Asia.   It is a place where, young or old, all of us  can

enjoy  an  interesting  and  fulfilling  life.   This  is

something  that  we  should  look  forward  to  and  work

towards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we have many strengths, not

least  a  team of good leaders who have brought  us  this

far.   It  must  be  recalled that, though  some  of  the

changes in recent years have been swift and drastic, such

shifts are not new in Singapore.  The 1960s, in fact, had

been  the  most  revolutionary for Singapore.  Few  other

countries  have undergone so many significant changes  in

so  short  a  period.  The 1960s saw  the  transition  of

Singapore  from  a colony to an internally self-governing

state  from  1959  to 1963, to becoming  a  part  of  the

Federation of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965, and then to  an

independent  republic. Furthermore, the  challenges  that

threaten  Singapore's economic viability as a  state  was

sprung

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>

on  it  in  quick  succession.  This  includes  Sukarno's

Confrontation  and  Britain's decision  to  withdraw  its

military bases in 1975 which left Singapore with the task

of  absorbing 40,000 employees, making up for the loss of

20%  of  the  GNP and creating a credible  defence  force

within   four  years.   It  was  Singapore's  leadership,

together with the support of the people, that effectively

overcame all these severe problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1986, when I was wondering what the future

held,  there was a team looking at how to pull  Singapore

out  of  the  recession.   It  was  called  the  Economic

Committee  and  was  led  by Mr  Lee  Hsien  Loong,  then

Minister of State for Trade and Industry.  Today we  have

another  committee,  the Economic Review  Committee,  led

also  by Mr Lee.  Sir, I would say that our leaders  have

had  a  good track record so far.  This should  give  our

people  confidence.  I, for one, am confident that,  with

the  people  united behind the Government, determined  to

achieve  a  better Singapore, happy days would indeed  be

here again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  just  want to speak in support of this motion  in  the

name  of the Minister for Finance.  Members of the  House

have  been  speaking and have spoken  at  length  on  the

various issues in the Economic Review Committee Report on

entrepreneurship and the present economic difficulties we

are   facing.   I  want  to  focus  specifically  on  the

investment issues and business related issues to growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the foreign direct investment issue. Our

economic strategy over the past three decades or more has

been on attracting foreign investments that will lead  to

growth  and employment.  We had been very fortunate.   We

embarked on this path in the sixties, just about the time

when the MNCs were going transnational.  We betted on the

MNCs  and the export growth strategy and that would  help

us  clear  our unemployment problem then and  our  growth

into the future.  We were right.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, however, the other giants have awakened,

chiefly India and China.  And, today we all know China is

absorbing the major share of the FDIs from the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This foreign direct investment (FDI) growth strategy

here is characterised by a lumpy or plant size investment

in  manufacturing products, which can be a  final  or  an

intermediate produce, which is usually exported overseas.

The  gain  we  expect from the manufacturing  process  is

derived from the employment generated and the value-added

for the investors.  Is this FDI growth strategy still the

way to go for Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying the foreign investment is no more

useful.   It  is  a source of technology  and  jobs.   My

question is: can FDI growth be an effective strategy  for

us, whether it is in the current electronics industry  or

some other manufacturing sector?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should remember that when we went into the FDI

growth  strategy many years back, many of  our  competing

countries were not awakened yet.  Later, as more of  them

were  awakened to the challenges, the EDB had to  attract

so-called  higher  technology content and  higher  value-added  industries  to  base them  here.   The  employment

creation  in  many of these investments is low,  and  our

competitiveness in terms of business cost or wage cost is

only  temporary as the technology of these  processes  is

often embodied in the machines.  As the costs get higher,

these factories move in search for lower wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we should be aiming at in growth at this stage

of  our  economic  development is to move  to  businesses

where the technology or knowledge resides in the heads of

our people, not just in the machines.  With technology in

machines,  labour ends up working for the  machines.   We

always think that the machine is working for us.  Capital

gets  higher rate of return and labour gets paid  in  low

wage.  With technology or knowledge invested in the head,

the  table  is  turned, and the knowledge and  technology

workers get more decision-making and get the first

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>

cut  of  the  value-added.   So  we  have  to  reposition

ourselves and the investment we attract.  I believe  this

knowledge  based  in  the  head investment  approach  for

growth rather than machines or plants is more sustainable

for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These investments in knowledge and technology in our

heads  can  also  be  lost if our able  men  go  away  or

migrate.  I assume it is harder to move the men than  the

machines.  But that is another issue.  The investments in

the  heads have to have quality and content.  It  has  to

have  complementary resources to get the correct  soup  - good  brains  and environment and research facilities  in

universities or private research units.  There  also  has

to  be  quality.  For example, some years ago we  started

this  idea  of  "incubators" for research and  design  in

Singapore.  The best example of incubators is, of course,

Silicon  Valley.  But recently we hear of  incubators  by

the hundreds all over China.  Is this the real thing?   I

am  not sure.  Some young talented research students  may

be there, but the facilities for research, the resources,

the   marketing  and  business  network  connection,  the

international trust and respect for Intellectual Property

Rights,  the  efficient legal infrastructure system,  are

not there in China, or even in India, by a long mile.  So

these  are actually competitive advantages for Singapore,

which we should exploit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If input investment under FDI for growth is not

sustainable,  what then should the new Singapore  economy

be  aiming  for?   We should be aiming  for  growth  from

Research  and Development, Design, Innovation,  Knowledge

and  Quality Control.  These are growth factors  but,  by

themselves, spending on them may not yield returns.   The

productivity of these factors will also be determined  by

how  well our businesses in the economy can synergise and

how  well we can blend these elements and market them for

business.   Here  is  where the assistance  to  SMEs  and

outsourced   businesses  can  be  developed  to   service

technical processes.  This type of growth in the  economy

is  different  from  the input growth  we  have  been  so

familiar

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>

with.   Economists call this endogenous growth  and  such

growth derives from total factor productivity gain.  I am

glad  SPRING has last year finally embarked on  measuring

total  factor productivity in our economy.  It will  take

time  to  systematically  monitor  this,  but  it  is  an

important step in the right direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask our workers to brace for the challenges - tighten up for the competition by lowering wage

expectations,  CPF  and so on.  What  can  our  GLCs  and

bigger Singaporean companies do?  Can the Government  get

GLCs to spearhead this overseas business drive by setting

the  management to work and achieve X% of  their  revenue

from  overseas  by year Y by developing  viable  overseas

businesses?  By setting targets and time-lines for  them?

Any  management team that achieves the target by  year  Y

should   be   given  both  bonuses  and/or  tax   breaks.

Introducing  the right incentives for them  is  the  only

true  way of getting things done.  Otherwise, we will  be

talking  with insufficient sense of urgency as  what  our

colleague, Mr Inderjit Singh, mentioned yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot has been said about helping SMEs and taking

them overseas.  To me, the national economic strategy, if

there  is  one,  is  to  get the bigger  ones,  with  the

potential to go transnational, such as the GLCs,  because

they   have   bigger  resources,  or  the  bigger   local

companies, and then to get the SMEs to latch along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I agree that it is difficult, it is

important  for us to do and important for our  Government

agencies  to  assist  the SMEs.   In  all  these,  it  is

important  to  understand that speed and  simplicity  are

important criteria for SME businesses.  One-stop  service

centre and meaningful value adding assistance will be  of

great help to them.  We should cut down the red tape  for

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our plant/factory focus approach to attracting

investment  should  give way to more  process  focus  and

value  chain focus approach to base MNCs here.  I believe

steps are already being taken in attracting MNCs to  base

their  OHQs  here.  But the linkages in  the  economy  to

exploit this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>

presence  may not be sufficiently developed.  I think  we

should  go a step further in identifying the value  chain

and  the production/research or design processes in these

segments of the chain to make business successes  out  of

them  for our local businesses and start-ups.  A  mapping

of this should be done.  The Government has the resources

to do it.  The Government should invest in such a service

agency  and  get  private sector  people  who  understand

business  to do it.  I believe there are a lot  of  local

talents in the employment market and many of them used to

work for the MNCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a lot of advantages, especially in the

educated  young  graduates  from  our  universities   and

polytechnics, who are very good.  I have met many of them

and  I  am really proud of them.  We should do the  right

thing  by  opening the avenues.  They will do  it  right,

once the trail is blazed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems facing the economy are indeed

challenging,  to say the least.  I believe  the  Minister

has  got the issues well covered.  Frankly, many  of  the

issues  mentioned by the Minister in the Budget Review  - high  business  costs,  the need for  an  entrepreneurial

economy,  GLCs crowding out private sector in businesses,

which  properly  should be left to the local  SMEs,  high

statutory costs - all sound very familiar, and have  been

said by many of us who have been long enough here on this

side of the House.  Let us hope that the remedial actions

will be implemented with speed and efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I support the motion.

from  Kedah,  who not many years ago was  a  rice  trader

wandering  around  Kuala Lumpur in a  pair  of  slippers.

Today, this man has varied business interests.  He has  a

net  worth of RM1.7 billion and has been ranked  the  7th

wealthiest  man  in Malaysia.  He is Mokhtar  Al-Bukhary,

now better known as the man who developed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>

Johor's  Tanjong Pelapas port and lured away the business

of  two  big  shipping lines, Maersk and  Evergreen  from

Singapore's PSA Corporation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the story does not end here. This savvy

businessman  has now been given the green light  to  take

over Senai Airport in Johor and turn it into a major  hub

to   complement  the  transhipment  business  of  Tanjong

Pelapas and compete with our Changi Airport.  Dare we say

that  he  will  not succeed?  Certainly  not,  after  the

unthinkable  happened  to PSA.  Are  we  running  scared?

Certainly not too, I hope.  But what has happened  should

serve  as  a  wake-up  call of what harsh  reality  in  a

competitive  world is, in that we cannot  take  customers

for granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In business, they say that you are friends, and the

relationship stays for as long as you can make  money  of

one another.  If your customer finds that he has a better

deal elsewhere, he will run to your competitor, no matter

how  long he has been with you.  One important lesson  we

have  learned in this is that if you are No. 1, there  is

always  someone waiting to knock you off your perch,  and

that  someone need not be an obvious competitor like Hong

Kong  or  Kaoshiung, but it could be a  sleepy  backwater

like  Tanjong Pelapas.  This is because your competitors,

no  matter  how  small  they  are,  play  a  game  called

"catching up" - that is what you can do, given  time  and

determination,  they can do too, and at a  better  price.

And,  it  is  not just in port services that  things  are

shaping up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Malaysian company launched a no-frills

airline  not  long ago called Air Asia.  No champagne  or

free  gifts  on board.  Bring your own food too,  if  you

like.   It just gets you to where you want to go  without

fuss and at a low price.  Amongst this week's offer,  fly

from  Kuala  Lumpur to Penang for only  RM19.99,  cheaper

than  taking a bus ride.  No doubt it will soon be flying

passengers   from   nearby   Senai   Airport   to   other

destinations at very low price and it gets you  to  where

you  want with minimal delays.  Delays are costly in  the

airline business and they cannot afford to have them, not

at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>

the  prices they sell their tickets.  So, they  are  very

efficient at getting you to your destination on schedule.

And  it  is  a  profitable company.  In the  first  eight

months since taking over the company and operating it  as

a   no-frills  airline,  the  new  owners  turned  around

previous losses and made RM19 million, and they are debt-free.   Last  year, Air Asia flew 1.3 million passengers.

This year, it is aiming for 2 million passengers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While airlines like SIA cater to their own niche

luxury markets, here is one airline that has carved a new

market for itself by reaching out to those who could  not

afford to fly before, or those who are simply looking for

a  better  deal  in air travel, especially  during  these

difficult  times.  I am glad that SilkAir is  sitting  up

and  has  taken notice of the competition it  faces  from

airlines like Air Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our healthcare industry is another example of how an

industry  is  feeling the heat from regional competitors.

At one time, we had Indonesians and Malaysians queuing up

at our private hospitals for treatment.  Today, they, and

even  others from as far as Europe, are going to  Malacca

or  to  Bangkok for surgery, because the costs, including

travelling  and expenses, work out to be only a  fraction

of what it would cost here, and the standards match ours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, to stay alive in a lacklustre economy,

companies  have learned very quickly that  they  need  to

offer  better  value for less money.  A New Paper  report

two  days  ago  highlighted how companies in  the  luxury

goods business now offer lower-end versions of their high-end  products  to appeal to middle income consumers.   It

cites the example of Jaguar which now markets its X  type

cars  at  half  the  price  of  its  top-end  XJ  series.

Similarly  too, as in the case of Mercedes Benz,  pushing

its  C Class and A Class cars at less than half the price

of its top of the range models.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consumer, I too am looking out for better deals

whenever I need something.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>

Two  years ago, I bought my first DVD player, a  Philips.

It cost me $750.  Three months ago, I bought another one,

this  time a Samsung, a Korean brand and it cost me  only

$180   -   slimmer, sleeker, great features and generally

easier to operate.  People may say that there is a  great

difference  between  the  two  brands,  but  I  have  not

discovered  any  loss  in the quality  of  the  movies  I

watched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Singapore company has learned to carve its own

niche during these bad times too.  This is a company that

makes  electronic products in China under its  own  brand

name  Akira.  Recently, Akira was selling 21-inch  colour

TV sets at $190, and friends who have bought them tell me

that  they are of good quality.  I tried to buy one   but

they were all sold out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give these examples to make some points.

Firstly, never underestimate the competition.  We have to

be   flexible  in  doing  things  to  meet  threats   and

challenges  because,  out there,  there  will  always  be

someone  who will try to do things better than  you  can.

Secondly,  even  in a flagging economy, one  can  find  a

niche and seize opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to make is that today, people

have wised up to the fact that good quality need not mean

high  prices.  In other words, whether you are a shipping

line  or  you  are  just shopping for  electronic  goods,

people  are  looking  for  better  deals.   If  PSA   had

recognised this fundamental point, it might not have lost

two of its biggest customers.  How did the world's number

one  port, long vaunted by the Government as a  model  of

efficient  management,  end  up  an  enigma  of   bloated

capacity?  How did 500 of its employees end up swallowing

the  bitter pill of retrenchment and find out that  they,

and  not  the sacred cows of the Singapore economy,  were

the  ones  being slaughtered?  Who can blame  those,  not

just the PSA employees but many others in the public  and

the private sectors, who have lost their jobs for the way

they  feel  now?   It  was  not too  long  ago  that  the

Singapore worker was held up as the number one worker  in

the world.  Now, the number one worker finds that being

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>

number  one is like winning a race with no prizes at  the

end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is not just with land cost, as some

Members have pointed out.  It has to do with the way  you

handle your customers, so that you retain their patronage

through  good  and bad times.  It is all  about  business

philosophy  and attitude.  Give the guy a good  deal,  he

stays  with  you.  But sometimes I know  it  is  hard  to

change  mindsets.   We are quite used to  the  Government

mantra,  that if you want better services,  you  must  be

prepared  to  pay  more   -  be it  hospital  charges  or

transport  fares.  We have gone through this  last  year,

but I think the mindset still remains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we are told that to ensure that taxis provide

better  services, there is a need to monitor  them.   LTA

says, pay $50 per taxi per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> $25.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> $25, sorry. $25 per taxi per

month.   With  19,000 taxis, that is a  cool  $6  million

collected  a year.  Will this result in solving  problems

such   that  taxis  disappear  mysteriously  just  before

midnight  and  appearing suddenly when the midnight  hour

strikes?  I think not.  Will we now be able to get  taxis

when  it rains?  I think not.  Will taxi companies absorb

this  additional charge in the long run?   I  think  not.

Will passengers end up paying for this?  I think so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or try the URA for its own brand of service - pay

$1,200  upfront when you apply for a change  of  use  for

your premises.  Sir, I do not wish to repeat what Mr  Lee

Han  Shih wrote in his article.  It is all in the Streats

newspaper of 5th February.  He wondered how the URA  does

its  costing  and  lamented that  it  is  a  very  costly

service.   Still,  it is $1,200 per application,  whether

you  are  successful or not.  And with 2,600 applications

being  processed a year, you can do your own calculations

how  much that works out to.  This is very lucrative work

for  the URA but it just adds one more item to the  heavy

cost of doing business here.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it is high cost that is making us less

competitive.  Mr Koo Tsai Kee can argue that we  are  not

much  more  expensive than Guangzhou in terms  of  office

space,  but  I  want to tell him that every dollar  saved

counts today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh said that it is hard to shake off

the  impression  that  we are an expensive  place  to  do

business to his foreign friends.  I agree with him.   How

can  we  do that when this is the reality?   And it  does

not  help  us  to shake off this image when some  of  the

measures  that  the  Government implements  are  labelled

merely 'reliefs'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reliefs are helpful. I do concede. But they

are  what they are  -  reliefs  -  a balm to relieve  you

temporarily,  make you feel good for a while.   But  when

the  effects wear off, the pain returns because the  root

causes  have not been dealt with.  Many businessmen  tell

me,  "why  can't  the  one-off  measures  or  reliefs  be

permanent ones?"  We need a permanency to these  measures

so  that we know the savings are here to stay.  We cannot

plan on the basis that you tweak with these measures  now

and  then.   I  too would say that the Government  should

have, once and for all, taken the opportunity to take the

bull  by the horns and not let business and industry play

the  guessing game as to when the next round  of  rebates

will  come.   And this is what I feel is amiss,  Sir,  in

Budget  2003  -  that it may not have provided sufficient

stimulus to kick-start the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Morgan Stanley report that I read says that this

year's Budget gives little support to a fragile Singapore

economy.   Sir, the report points out that the  estimated

deficit  at $900 million works out to less than  0.8%  of

GDP,  and  that  this might turn out to be even  smaller,

given  the  tendency to conservatively estimate revenues.

Indeed,  if you look at last year's revised figures,  Net

Investment  Income  (NII) was $3.8 billion   -   happily,

$1.4 billion more than was originally forecast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some MPs have already pointed out that the

Government  did  not incur a deficit last  year  and,  in

fact, actually crossed the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>

finishing line with a budgetary surplus of $1/2  billion.

The  transfers  to the Lifelong Education  Fund  and  the

Medical  Endowment  Fund are exactly  what  they  are   - transfers  from one account to another.  They are  monies

that  remain with the Government and are not spent.  What

is  spent from these two accounts are the interests  they

earned,  just  like the way interests and dividends  from

NII  are spent, but not the principal amounts.  So averse

as  I  am  to  red ink, I must say that the Minister  for

Finance tried very hard to show a deficit last year,  but

I think he just could not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would argue this point further. The Lifelong

Education Fund has a capital of $1 billion.  In its  last

reported  financial year, it earned $27  million  and  it

gave  away  grants  of $141/2 million.   After  deducting

expenses,  it  still  ended up  with  a  surplus  of  $10

million.   It  has  another accumulated  surplus  of  $10

million from previous years.  I know the long-term target

is  to raise the fund to $5 billion.  But if the fund is,

in fact, able to more than meet its current needs, why do

we need to increase its capital now?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, for Medifund. It has a capital sum of

$800  million.  In its last financial year, it earned  an

income  of  $30  million.  Even with its  close  to  100%

approval rate, it gave grants of $27 million and  it  has

an  accumulated surplus of more than $35 million.   Would

it  not  be  right to say that these funds are  presently

self-sufficient and we need not transfer  money  at  this

time?   After all, the Government did say previously that

transfers  to these funds would take place only  when  we

enjoy healthy surpluses.  And this may not be the time to

do  so simply because, firstly, we are not having healthy

surpluses;  and,  secondly,  the  funds  themselves   are

generating enough to serve their present needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of funds with surpluses brings me to

another  point of how I think the Government should  also

examine  its  revenue sources by taking  a  look  at  the

financial position of some of our statutory

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>

boards.     Sir,   under   the   Statutory   Corporations

(Contributions  to Consolidated Fund)  Act,  the  Finance

Minister  is  empowered to require  statutory  boards  to

contribute  part  of  their incomes to  the  Consolidated

Fund.  Statutory boards today provide services that  were

once  the  function of the Government and their  revenues

and   surpluses  would  have  accrued  directly  to   the

Consolidated Fund if they had remained so.   This  throws

up  two questions.  Firstly, can the Finance Minister ask

for  more from the statutory boards that are making money

to  boost the revenue position?  Secondly, what about the

large  accumulated surpluses that some of  them  have  in

their books?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us just take a look at the last reported

financial year of some of them.  Jurong Town Corporation,

accumulated  surplus,  $8.6  billion;  net  profit,  $112

million   after   contributing   $50   million   to   the

Consolidated Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, net profit,

$333  million; after returning $1 billion to  Government,

it is still left with $2.3 billion accumulated surplus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Utilities Board, accumulated surplus, $4.3

billion at group level; net profit, $412 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA, accumulated surplus, $1.3 billion; net profit,

$29  million  after  contributing $91/2  million  to  the

Consolidated Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, statutory boards usually take the position that

such   surpluses   are  necessary  for   future   capital

expenditure.   But  can we not require  them  to  justify

their  retention of large surpluses with  concrete  plans

and  if they cannot do so within a fixed period of  time,

to  return the money to the Government so that it can  be

put  to better use?  In fact, under the Act, the Minister

has  the power to require the statutory boards to  return

to  Government any amount that is not required  for  that

board's  duties and functions.  If the money  is  sitting

there for a long time, I think we have to take a look  at

that.  Even if the boards require capital outlays, should

we  not ask them now to fund these by going to the  money

market through such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>

instruments  as  bond issues?  After  all,  they  operate

successful  businesses and should be able to raise  their

own  funds as and when they need them.  Ultimately,  Sir,

this  will leave the Minister for Finance some extra room

to manoeuvre the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, having listened to Mdm Ho Geok Choo,   let

me  share some of my thoughts on an effective way to meet

the challenge, before I speak on the Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an open economic environment, we should throw

away all our historical baggage.  Both the employers  and

employees  should  change their way  of  thinking,  their

mindset.  It  should  not be confined  to  the  employees

alone.   I think a collective agreement is still  a  very

effective  tool  in  managing  the  relationship  between

employers and employees in the open economy.  The problem

is  not  in its form, but rather in whether the employers

have also raised the transparency of their operations and

share  all the information with the workers in an  honest

manner.  In  this way, the workers would  understand  the

terms  and conditions of their employment, and would  not

harbour  the  impression that the employer is  exploiting

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A collective agreement is made after negotiations

where the terms therein are mutually agreed upon.  It  is

an  assurance extended by the employers and employees  to

one  another.   I  want  to  emphasise  that  the  labour

movement in Singapore is an enlightened one.  I also hope

that  our  employers would understand that, although  the

iron  rice  bowl concept in some countries  is  outdated,

this  concept  has not been in existence in Singapore  at

all.   No one can say in Singapore that his rice bowl  is

cast  in  steel  and  would not be  broken.   Everybody's

ricebowl  can be broken.  However, in reality,  we  would

not  like  to  see any employee being looked  upon  as  a

disposable utensil - one that is used and discarded  when

his usefulness is no more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be it employee or employer, their rice bowls are

interconnected  and  cannot  be  separated.    Both   the

employers and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>

employees  should  share the fruit  of  success  and  the

prosperity  of their enterprises.  Whether  employers  or

employees,  they  are  all human  beings,  they  are  not

machines  or  merchandise.  We do not  want  to  see  the

employees  being  left to the mercy of  their  employers,

just  like a hunter going hunting with his dog,  captures

his  prey,  then kills his dog and eats  it.   People  in

personnel   departments  should  be  open-minded.    More

importantly,  all the people in the company  should  feel

that  their contributions and efforts put in are rewarded

accordingly.  Therefore, I hope the management should  be

foresighted  enough to warn their workers to prepare  for

the challenges they will meet ahead of them.  They should

be  committed  in  looking after  the  welfare  of  their

employees  and give them due protection and  a  sense  of

belonging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the theme of DPM's Budget Speech

was "Seizing Opportunity in Uncertainty".  I want to take

the  message one step further.  Not only should we  seize

opportunities  in  uncertainty, we must  "turn  adversity

into strength".  Let me elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic downturn has hit Singaporeans hard. We

must  help  Singaporeans to restore their confidence,  so

that they could be at ease when faced with adversity.  As

a  union  leader,  I have experienced,  first  hand,  the

impact of the downturn on our workers.  Many workers  and

people have lost their jobs.  Those who are still holding

on to their jobs face salary freeze or wage cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that the Deputy Prime Minister has

announced  measures to help workers and Singaporeans.   I

applaud these measures, especially for the assistance  in

manpower  training.  $37 million has been  set  aside  to

enhance   MOM's   employment  assistance   and   training

programmes aimed at generating 20,000 additional training

places under the Skills Redevelopment Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with Mr Tan Soo Khoon that our

expenditure  should not be based on past experience.   We

should  look at our past and present situations and  make

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>

necessary   adjustment.  We  should  give   our   workers

confidence by job creation and employment assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has accepted the

ERC's  recommendations.  These measures will enhance  our

competitiveness,  nurture entrepreneurship,   grow  local

enterprises  and  strengthen  our  human  capital.    But

whatever  benefits they may bring about, the workers  are

still primarily concerned with  job security and a steady

income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Lee disclosed that the

investments that Singapore has attracted are expected  to

create  21,000 jobs.  However, if the economic  situation

does  not improve, our unemployment rate will go up  from

4.4%  to  5.5%  this year.  I understand that  there  are

certain  external factors which are outside our  control.

For  example, will there be a war in Iraq?  How will  the

threat of terrorism unfold?  Will the major economies  of

US,  Japan  and  the European countries remain  sluggish?

All  these  factors  add  to our uncertainty.   They  are

beyond  our control.  But our people are hoping that  our

Government  would  do  more in the areas  where  we  have

control   over.   In  fact,  many  of  my   parliamentary

colleagues have elaborated on how to cut down the cost of

doing business in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Deputy Prime Minister Lee has announced

the  extension of various rebates and reductions in  cost

for businesses to the end of this year.  Many people have

asked:  "Why  not give a firm commitment to  extend  them

further?"   After  all, the deferment of CPF  restoration

for two years has been accepted by the workers and it has

sent  a  clear signal to investors.  Why not send another

signal  to  investors by cutting down business costs  for

two years?  We hope that they can expand their businesses

here, and many jobs can then be preserved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern of the workers is in the area of

healthcare.   If  we want the workers  to  upgrade  their

skills,  to enhance their competitiveness, they  must  be

assured

that  when  they  are sick, they can have  some  form  of

protection  against  illnesses. DPM  Lee  said  that  our

national healthcare expenditure is now 3.5% of GDP, which

is  lower than most of the developed countries.  He  also

said that the low expenditure was not entirely because of

our  efficient healthcare system, but rather due  to  our

younger  population.  What worries  me  is  that  if  our

population has the same age profile as, for example,  the

UK   and   Japan,   then  our  national  expenditure   on

healthcare, based on our present spending patterns, would

be near to UK and Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is another set of statistics that

we  should  also be aware of.  Our healthcare expenditure

in  dollar terms has increased fourfold from $1.3 billion

in  1990 to $5.6 billion in 2001.  Are we heading towards

the  problem  we currently see in healthcare  systems  in

some  developed countries?  In the US, many  workers  are

not  covered by medical insurance.  When they are in need

of  medical treatment, they are in a dilemma.  We are all

too  familiar  with  the  three  fundamental  pillars  of

healthcare  financing in Singapore - the  3Ms  (Medisave,

MediShield and Medifund).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget Speech, DPM Lee announced a $100

million  special  transfer  to  Medifund  to  help   more

Singaporeans.  He also announced the phasing-in of higher

contribution  rates to Medisave.  My  question  is:  what

about  MediShield?   Is  the Government  looking  at  how

MediShield can also be enhanced and modified?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the implementation of policy, the

Government  should also consider reviewing  the  criteria

for use of Medisave to be more responsive and appropriate

to  today's  needs.  For example, to  allow  the  use  of

Medisave  based  on  medical conditions  instead  of  the

number  of days of hospitalisation.  Right now,  many  of

them  still  have  to  fork out cash  to  pay  for  their

treatment  at  the clinics.  Today, 90%  of  the  working

population  are covered under MediShield or  one  of  the

Medisave-approved insurance schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, MOH has improved the

benefits and features of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>

MediShield.   I believe that the Government can  continue

to  enhance  MediShield  to make  it  more  relevant  and

responsive.   However, we know that MediShield  is  quite

near  to  portable  medical  benefits.   It  can  provide

portable medical benefits as long as the premium is paid,

whether  the  insured is still working  or  out  of  job.

However, this system has been in existence for quite some

time.    It  does  not  cover  specialist  treatment   in

outpatient clinics or hospitalisation.  I wonder  if  the

Government  will  review  or revamp  MediShield  in  this

direction.  I am also concerned that more than a  quarter

of   a   million  of  Singaporeans  have  opted  out   of

MediShield,  although 90% of the people are  still  being

covered by MediShield.  There are 270,000 people who  are

not covered by this scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the fundamental healthcare financing

programmes,  it  should  be made  a  compulsory  national

medical  insurance for all Singaporeans so that they  can

have a basic medical insurance coverage for their medical

needs.   I  feel  that every Singaporean should  have  at

least  a basic medical insurance coverage, and we  should

make  it compulsory.  As union leaders, we are in contact

with  workers every day.  There are many problems.   When

they are jobless or retrenched, they will not be able  to

enjoy  any  medical  benefits, especially  with  all  the

turnover   in   jobs  and  instability  in  their   jobs.

Therefore,  the Government should widen the coverage  and

improve the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, all CPF members should be allowed to use

their  savings in the Medisave accounts to  pay  for  the

premiums  for all portable medical insurance.   According

to the ERC's recommendations, employers should contribute

at  least 1% of their CPF for this purpose.  But  members

cannot  make  use of this amount to pay the  premium  for

this kind of medical insurance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Government should step up its education

and  publicity  efforts both for the  employees  and  the

employers on the merits of portable medical benefits.  As

union  leaders, we want to see a seamless and  affordable

medical benefits system

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>

that  is  relevant  to their needs,  and  one  that  will

provide  coverage for the workers not only  during  their

working life but even after their retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare financing has a long-term implication on

our   national   budget.  Besides   phasing   in   higher

contribution  rates for Medisave, the Government  has  to

consider measures that will facilitate greater pooling of

risks,  such  as  making MediShield  a  compulsory  basic

national medical insurance scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a greying population means an

ageing  workforce.   We do not want to  see  Singaporeans

finding  themselves unable to cope with their  healthcare

needs in the future.  We do not want our older workers to

be  disadvantaged if employers are reluctant to hire them

because   of  higher  healthcare  cost.   We  feel   that

portability  in medical benefits is a good  system.   But

Government should supplement this with other schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, history is the best judge of

successes and failures.  When we look back at this year's

budget,  several years down the road, what would we  see?

We  would see this Budget as a turning point in  the  re-engineering  of Singapore.  It will not be  just  another

dull   Budget,  as  described  by  some  cynics  in   the

newspapers.    In   such   a  difficult   and   uncertain

environment,  it  is  important  for  the  Government  to

clearly reassure Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can expect a budget deficit of $90 million for

financial  year 2002 and our projected budget deficit  is

$900  million  for  the next financial  year.   Yet,  the

Singapore Government is contributing $100 million to  top

up  the  Medifund.   This is a change from  the  previous

instance  where the Medifund was topped up only  when  we

had  budget surpluses.  This is a clear way of reassuring

Singaporeans  who  are  worried  about  their  healthcare

costs.  Whether in sickness or in health, in boom  or  in

recession,  and  whether  we  have  budget  surpluses  or

deficit, the Government will help them.  This is  like  a

marriage vow!

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should constantly reaffirm that the Government

has the best interest of Singaporeans at heart. We should

assure  the workers and those who are disadvantaged  that

we have a strong social safety net, including appropriate

healthcare   subsidies  and  measures  that   will   help

Singaporeans cope with their healthcare needs.  Only with

such  firm  reassurances and practical economic  measures

proposed  by  the  ERC, then as a nation,  we  can  brace

ourselves for the changes and challenges ahead of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> I would like to seek your

permission to clarify Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's response to the

part  of my speech where I had referred to the collective

agreements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Carry on.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Thank you, Sir. In advocating

for  a  flexi future, I have identified, as  one  of  the

domains, collective agreements to promote a flexi culture

in Singapore.  Unfortunately, Mr Yeo has, in one sweeping

statement, inferred my suggestion as doing away with  the

collective  agreements  and has cast  my  speech  out  of

context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate once again and please bear

with  me as I go through the significant portion  on  the

CA.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Make it concise, please.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> On collective agreements, I have

said  that  employers and unions may even need to  review

the  terms  and conditions in CA so as to help  employers

better manage the manpower cost.  I gave the example  and

asked  why should we not be looking at some of the  fixed

items  in  CAs  which have actually entrenched  the  good

practices  of  management, especially  in  this  volatile

time, and I have called them "grandfather baggages".  For

example,  in this volatile time, why should we  have  CAs

signed for three years?  Can we not have a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>

shorter  period?  Very often, in the three-year duration,

annual  increments be made fixed for three years.   If  a

company were to lose money, say, in the second year,  the

company is entrenched into having to pay the same  amount

of annual increment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also said that, in anticipation of the

reaction  of our labour MP, we can argue that CA  is,  of

course,  a negotiable item between the employer  and  the

union.   But  I  have mentioned that because negotiations

can  sometimes  be so protracted, running into  three  or

four  years,  before you can sign a CA, it can  sometimes

end up as one of the causes for companies not looking  at

trimming the entrenched practices and taking the easy way

out  by  trimming  away  the  workforce,  instead  of  by

removing  some of these fixed items.  So I have suggested

that  it is time to rethink the structure and purpose  of

CAs  in  the  New Economy, just as the unions  have  been

evolving  over  these  years  to  make  their  role  more

relevant.   Nowhere have I suggested that we  cast  aside

CAs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also made a point about why we have to look

at some of the rigidities in CAs ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mdm Ho, could you please cut it short?

You are making another speech.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Just one last point. Because the

fixed  items  actually would be inherited  by  newcomers.

When  newcomers inherit the fixed items, you  can  go  on

weeding off employees by retrenching them.  But,  on  the

other  hand,  you  have new employees  growing  into  the

rigidities of the system.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to thank you for allowing me to

participate in this debate.  As a Singaporean  and  based

on   the   feedback  that  I  have  received  from   many

Singaporeans,  I  have no qualms in saying  that  we  are

proud to be citizens of a country that has achieved a lot

of progress.  There are many factors that have made us  a

successful country.  Among others, I would like to  state

only two.  First, is the existence of a strong and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>

dynamic  leadership.   This is  found  in  the  political

leadership,  civil service and the private sector.    All

who  are  at  the  leadership level are working  hard  in

giving  the  best  services for  the  well-being  of  the

country, companies, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a second factor that I feel is

important.   We have a capable and hardworking community,

from  the private as well as the public sectors, to  work

together  in  order to make Singapore  a  prosperous  and

progressive  country.   Mr Speaker,  the  combination  of

these  two  factors  and other factors  which  have  been

debated by our colleagues in this House have strengthened

Singapore's economy.  We are also recognised as the  best

workforce  in the world and we have also been  successful

in making Changi Airport the best airport in the world in

conjunction  with Singapore Airlines which  is  also  the

best.   Year by year, it has been ranked as the  best  in

the airline service worldwide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there were retrenchments in PSA recently,

we  also know that our port is still one of the best  and

most  efficient in the world.  Likewise, as a  result  of

the  combination  that  I  have  mentioned  earlier,  the

standard  of  living of Singaporeans and the  quality  of

life is the best not only in Asia but the world too.   As

a  Singaporean, I realise that, in many areas,  for  more

than  two decades, we have been enjoying a good life,  we

have been enjoying the wealth that allows us to speak not

only  in  terms of improving our standard of  living  but

also  a  better  quality of life.  In the constituencies,

our  Members  frequently hear appeals for us  to  provide

more  linkways  and  additional facilities  in  order  to

improve and make it easier for the residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to urge Singaporeans to

think  again on how, as we face the situation at present,

after having successfully built our nation, today we  are

facing a crisis which has been on-going since 1999.   Are

we  able  to overcome this crisis effectively?  Secondly,

are  we  prepared  to  face this crisis  with  the  right

attitude?   What I mean is: do we only want  to  face  it

lightly and do not want

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>

to face the difficulties posed by the new challenges that

we  face?  Are we hoping that a group of people, be it in

the Government or elsewhere, can spring out a new formula

to  resolve our problems immediately?  Or are we prepared

to  work hard and struggle together to once again rebuild

our  own  strengths and niches that we have  built  since

independence?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we have a question to ponder. Although I am

confident    that   our   Singaporeans   are   practical,

hardworking  and  dare  to struggle  to  continue  making

Singapore  a  successful country, there  are  also  signs

which  at  times are worrying.  Today, we often hear  the

effect and consequence of the wealth that we have enjoyed

for  so  long  has  caused Singaporeans to  complain  and

criticise  the  situation.  This is not a  reaction  that

will  generate more ideas on how to face the problems  of

the  country  that affect its people, which  could  bring

about  problems to our future.  Can we face it in  a  way

that could build up new advantages and strengths in which

we  are  able to provide goods and services to the global

marketplace?   I am worried because, among  some  of  the

factors which made us strong and successful, in the  end,

these successes and strengths could be factors that would

weaken our country and community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what I meant here is whether the effect

of  our wealthy lifestyle has brought about an impact  on

Singaporeans  to  think  that  we  should   always   live

comfortably  and  find  an easy way  out  when  facing  a

crisis.  I ponder on these questions when I was on my way

to the office this morning when I saw a young Singaporean

man  in  his  mid-30s or early 40s.  I saw  him  using  a

motorised  bicycle.  I thought to myself: is it necessary

for  a  strong and healthy man to use a motorised bicycle

to  travel from his house to a shop which is not too  far

away?   The  question is: is it wise for this young  man,

who is not the only one using the motorised bicycle which

is  getting popular nowadays, to use a motorised  bicycle

to  travel from his house to the shop?  Is it because  he

wants  to save time so as to reach his destination  fast,

or  is it because of other reasons?  I was unable to  ask

him as I was driving.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am worried whether this is an indication that,

in  many issues which include travelling to a place which

is  not too far away, Singaporeans would like to find the

easiest way out, just press a button and you get what you

want, you reach your destination.  We press the button to

use  the  lift or escalator and we ask for more linkways.

Many hon. Members of Parliament have heard complaints  by

the  residents  about  providing a bus  stop  near  their

homes.   If  given  a  job they  prefer  it  to  be  air-conditioned,  because if it is too hot,  they  would  get

headaches, and if their working places are too far  away,

they  find  it  a waste of time.  These are  the  reasons

which  are  frequently heard nowadays.  I see this  young

man as another sign.  Is it true that we are weakened  by

our own progress and wealth?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question arises as I am comparing how some

senior  citizens  whom  I  have met  in  my  constituency

frequently cycle from one place to another.  I have asked

them  why they like to cycle.  There are two reasons  for

this.   Firstly,  they said that it is  a  good  form  of

exercise  whenever they have to travel from home  to  the

shops,  mosque  or anywhere else.  It not  only  improves

their  health  but also helps them to save  money.   Last

week,  I  met a 70-year-old man.  He is a trishaw  rider.

When  he  was  young, he worked very hard  to  raise  the

family,  and  most  of his children have  grown  up  now.

Although they live on their own and have their own house,

this Singaporean, who is more than 70 years old, is still

a  trishaw  rider.  I asked him whether it is tiring  for

him.  He said no.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he felt that riding the trishaw has helped

him  to maintain a healthy life.  And because of his good

health, last year - after his wife passed away more  than

10  years ago - he remarried.  He could afford to remarry

as  he  is  still working and has an income.  Now  he  is

married  to  a  lady who is half his age.   I  asked  him

whether he did fall sick from time to time or worry about

remarrying  again.  His reply to me was very encouraging.

He said that he has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>

been  riding  the trishaw for many years  and  has  never

taken  any medical leave.  He did not have to take  leave

as he is always healthy, seldom coughs or falls sick.  He

belongs to the early generation of people.  He is so used

to working hard since young to raise his family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I suppose the young Singaporean man who prefers

to  use the motorised bicycle is seen as a sign of  young

Singaporeans,  whom we think are wiser, but  I  worry  if

this  is  an indication that they would find an easy  way

out when faced with a problem or crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I still hope, and dare say that, in

general, Singaporeans have not become weak, but these are

signs which we must pay attention to.  I raise this issue

with the hope that Singaporeans realise that at times  we

should  not  be  trapped  by the  norms  of  our  wealthy

lifestyle  during this difficult period.  We  still  find

people  with financial difficulties who are seeking  help

from  CDCs  and CCCs but who do not want to do away  with

their  handphones.   There  are  also  people  who   have

rejected  many job offers with lower salary.   There  are

some  who  realise that their jobs will be  relocated  to

other  countries, but are still reluctant to  go  through

new  courses to acquire new skills to enable them to  get

better jobs and have careers that are long lasting in the

years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I raise this matter to urge

Singaporeans  to  think that, since the  1960s,  we  have

progressed not based on our ability to take the easy  way

out.   I  am confident that the earlier generations,  and

some  who  have passed away, had toiled day and night  to

build  a future for their children and now the prosperity

is  enjoyed  by the younger generation.  It is  important

for  us,  when  facing the situation at present,  not  to

easily  give up. Instead, we should be daring to  explore

new ideas, find new ways and work hard to bring Singapore

to greater heights in the years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the illustration that I have given just

now is not necessarily true despite my concerns.  What  I

hope is that,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>

when facing this crisis, the solution for Singaporeans is

not  by taking the easy way out.  On the other hand, what

we  have  to do is not just by asking what the Government

or the CDCs can do for us.  All these will continue to be

provided.   In  fact,  we  should  ask  what  we,  as   a

Singaporean, can do or take action in order to contribute

towards  the  recovery of the economy,  and  not  be  too

dependent  on  the  goodies that are  given  out  by  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that is my hope. I hope our fellow

citizens can think about this matter together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this is going to be a tough year for the planners and for

the  people.   Tough  for  the planners  because  of  the

uncertainty  created  by the impending  war,  rising  oil

prices  and China's competition; and tough for the people

because   of   job  losses,  the  fear   and   worry   of

retrenchment.  My parliamentary colleagues  have  already

covered  a  wide range of topics, including CPF  changes,

business costs, entrepreneurship and the bureaucracy.   I

do not propose to go over them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to draw the attention of the

Deputy Prime Minister to potential social problems at our

HDB  heartlands.  The last two days' debate produced some

very  strong arguments, calling for the Government to  do

more to alleviate the plight of Singaporeans affected  by

this  downturn.  Amongst many suggestions is one  calling

for  the  setting  up  of a central fund  for  retrenched

workers,  into  which our Singaporeans can donate  monies

and   shares   given  to  them  by  the   Government   by

contributing  their  ERS shares.   I  remember  the  hon.

Member, Mdm Halimah Yacob, also suggested even using  the

CPF,  of  course,  with some conditions attached,  for  a

contribution  to this fund.  This call,  repeated  by  my

fellow MPs, brings into focus the issue of poverty at the

HDB heartlands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us can feel the difference at our MPS,

compared  two  years ago and now.  The number  of  people

approaching us for financial assistance and jobs has  all

gone up and, in my opinion, by at least 30%.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>

Who  are  these  people?  They cannot fit  into  the  ERC

profile.    They   are  casualties   of   this   economic

restructuring.  They are not very well educated, and  the

majority  of  them are Malays, with Chinese  and  Indians

increasing in number.  The Malays are the hardest hit  in

this economic downturn.  Many hold jobs that are affected

by  the  restructuring  of  our  economy.   When  a  firm

upgrades  and starts to computerise and send messages  by

emails  and faxes, despatch riders and drivers  would  be

out  of work.  This is true also when the firms cut cost.

The  Chinese and Indians, though smaller in numbers,  are

the  recently retrenched, and they are usually  from  the

smaller  firms.   I  spoke  to  a  Malay  who  just   got

retrenched  from PSA.  He felt that he and  some  of  his

friends  were retrenched because they cost more  to  hire

than foreigners.  And I have heard of such stories at our

feedback sessions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, some of the jobs were traditionally

taken  up  by  the  less educated Singaporeans,  be  they

Chinese,  Malays  or  Indians.  These  jobs  are  usually

manual  and construction jobs.  But they are now lost  to

foreigners.   The reasons given are that  foreigners  are

cheaper  - which is true - and they are prepared to  work

longer  hours.   So,  today, we have lost  that  cushion.

These  Singaporeans, together with the sizable number  of

our  mature  unemployed  workforce,  belong  to  what  we

describe  as  "structural  unemployed".   They  lack  the

technology  and  the language of the computer  age.   Our

Lifelong  Learning  Fund may not be within  their  reach,

because  they are usually not unionised.  So, I  find  it

very  difficult  for them to make use of  this  Fund  for

their retraining.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see some of the problems that these people

face.   First,  most of them are not able  to  pay  their

electricity  and water bills.  Some live in darkness  and

depend on neighbours or relatives for water.  It is a sad

situation. This is where I ask Singapore Power to be more

considerate.  When these people come to pay a little  bit

of   their  bills,  do  not  cut  off  their  water   and

electricity supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, some are not able to pay their S&C bills,

and sometimes pasting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>

notices on their doors requiring them to make payments is

very  embarrassing  for them.  I  think  they  have  gone

through  a  lot of trauma and we should be  more  careful

when  we  implement some of the ways of recovering  these

bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, some are not able to pay their HDB loans and

mortgages.   Most of us have faced this at our  meet-the-people sessions.  This is where we have to relook at  how

to advise them on the restructuring of their loans for  a

longer period and also how to advise them to downgrade to

a   smaller   flat,  and  sometimes  this   smacks   into

bureaucracy.  And this is where I urge HDB  to  pay  some

attention  to this area.  Maybe we should allow  them  to

rent  a  flat,  because there is no need to  insist  that

everybody  must own a home.  I think rental is  a  better

option for some of them.  So, we should not try to  force

them to buy a flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are not able to pay kindergarten fees,

this  is  where we can help.  All branches and CDCs  have

pitched  in  to  help some of these students  who  cannot

afford these fees.  Education is very important.  I  make

it  a  point, at my constituency, to make sure that every

child  who cannot afford should come to see me.   Because

if the children are deprived of an education, it would be

a  great burden to their family later on because they are

not productive.  And, of course, some are not able to pay

medical  bills.   This  is something  which  many  of  us

encounter at our meet-the-people sessions, and we have to

look  into  how we can help these people to manage  their

admission to hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our CDCs, NTUC Fairpirce, our own Party and, of

course,  our education and welfare funds have all chipped

in  to help this group of people.  I remember a couple of

Malay  families  cried when my branch members  gave  them

food  vouchers  to  spend  for  their  Hari  Raya.  Their

children were living on bread and water for some time.  I

bring  up these examples to highlight a point that  while

we embark on this high road of economic changes, do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>

forget  that many may not be able to follow us. We  must,

at  times,  look back and help the slow ones along.  This

will bind us as a nation.  This group of people will find

the  going very tough. As the economy changes, they  will

find  jobs more and more difficult to come by.  Jobs that

we  are  attracting  are beyond them.  Their  educational

level, as I said, is low and the technology is not  there

to meet the changing needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a potential social problem and we must make

sure  we  address this problem.  We must make  sure  that

they  do not fall into this poverty trap or else it  will

be a big social problem for us in the years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the Budget addressed this? I think the Budget

may not have focused a lot on this area.  They have given

S&C  and rental rebates.  But these rebates are for  all.

Everyone living in an HDB flat gets these rebates.  It is

not targeted.  I know CDCs have helped  through financial

assistance  and job matching.  But what I would  like  to

see  is  a  more structured organisation at the  national

level  doing this function, rather than ad-hoc  measures.

Perhaps we can start by finding out the profiles of these

people  through  our Government agencies and  maintain  a

register  to  assist the CDCs at the ground level.   With

such a structure in place, we may have a better feel  and

understanding of the situation and take whatever measures

necessary.   And  many  a  time,  the  voluntary  welfare

organisations can play an important role as  counsellors,

and  their involvement will be very useful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br>1.35 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Matthias Yao Chih): Mr Speaker, Sir,

entrepreneurship is the choice flavour  on  the  menu  in

this  Budget debate, and rightly so.  For so many  years,

we  have relied on GLCs and MNCs to grow our economy.  We

need  more entrepreneurs among Singaporeans, so that they

too can be key drivers in the next

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>

phase  of  our economic growth.  I join the many speakers

before  me  to  support  the Government's  intention  and

measures to promote, support and nurture entrepreneurship

in  Singapore.   I support the calls to price  industrial

land competitively, and cut red tape.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much talk about entrepreneurship has,

unfortunately,  caused workers to feel rather  left  out.

They  think  that  this  debate is  for  businessmen  and

investors only. Workers are mentioned only when  it  came

to  non-restoration of CPF contributions  and  having  to

work  beyond  their retirement age.  That, to  me,  is  a

great pity.  It would be a limited view of the ERC Report

and  this year's Budget debate.  So, I was happy that MPs

who  spoke today have brought some attention back to  the

needs and worries of our workers.  Our workers should not

feel left out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this was merely a pro-business Budget and workers

are  not of concern, the Minister for Finance could  have

simply focused on helping Singapore companies move abroad

and  take advantage of the lower costs and larger markets

in the region. That would raise profits for the companies

and make many businessmen very happy.  It would also be a

cheaper  and probably less complicated exercise  for  the

Government.   But  that is not what this  Budget  is  all

about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, the Budget proposes a broad range

of  calibrated  machines  aimed  at  drawing  high  value

investments, assets, talent and know-how into  Singapore,

and  keeping  them here. They encourage  Singaporeans  to

start  and grow more businesses using Singapore as  their

base.  The emphasis this year is on our domestic economy,

less on the external wing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefit goes directly to our workers.

Entrepreneurs  and investors cannot do  business  all  by

themselves.  As  long as they operate in Singapore,  they

must employ at least a few staff to do the work. The more

successful  we can help them become, the more  they  will

need  to  employ.  And other businesses  will  emerge  to

provide  upstream, downstream and support  activities  to

these successful companies.  Meanwhile, a new statutory

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>

board and substantial funding will help the workers bring

such opportunities that lie ahead within their reach.  It

is not a zero sum game between entrepreneurs and workers.

What  we  have is indeed a pro-business, pro-entrepreneur

Budget.   But  because  it aims to attract,  nurture  and

anchor  companies  to Singapore, it  is  also  a  pro-job

creation Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already heard some good news that banks and

manufacturers have decided to move more of their foreign-based operations to Singapore because of our increasingly

attractive conditions.  As the Budget measures take  full

effect, more companies will come, more start-ups will  be

formed.  The small ones will provide only a few jobs  but

the  larger companies will bring in jobs numbering in the

hundreds.   The result will be jobs, and more  jobs,  for

the  workforce. Workers are not left out of this  debate.

Their livelihood is the key concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as jobs get created, they will not be the kind

that  we  have  been used to doing. There will  be  fewer

permanent  jobs, and certainly no iron rice  bowls.   The

skills that are needed will keep changing, more and  more

quickly. We will have to work out different ways of doing

this.  We will have to work for different employers,  and

even  change industries several times within our  working

life.   Even  our collective agreements may  have  to  be

looked  at, but collective agreements will still need  to

be  the mainstay of a relationship between employers  and

the  unions.  The terms can be discussed. If we can  make

the  transition effectively, our workforce will  continue

to thrive in the face of global competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship will not be just for entrepreneurs.

In the future, workers too need to be entrepreneurial.  I

do not mean that all the workers should go into business.

If  some  do  want to, I would say, make  a  try,  and  I

sincerely wish them every success.  What I mean  is  that

workers  must  start  to  think like  entrepreneurs  with

regard to their employment and employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurs work hard to build up a successful

business model that will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>

profitable for a long time. Workers too need to work hard

to build up their knowledge and skill sets that will keep

them employable for life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an entrepreneur finds that customers no longer

buy  his  product,  he  will improve  it,  or  switch  to

something  else.  When a worker finds that his  skill  is

outdated, he must do the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an entrepreneur meets a strong competitor who

sells  at  a lower price, he may have to lower his  price

for  a while to protect his market share while he figures

out a new strategy.  Workers too face cost competition in

the  global labour market, and need to adjust their  wage

expectations  from  time  to time  to  avoid  losing  out

altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one difference. Entrepreneurs must dare to

take risks, but workers are less able to take risks.   In

fact,  in the new era of rapid changes in our global  and

domestic  economies, workers need stronger social  safety

nets that will cushion them more effectively from adverse

outcomes.   This  is  a subject my NTUC  colleagues  have

dealt with in the Budget debate and will continue to take

up in the Committee of Supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our entrepreneurs, investors, managers, workers and

public officials are integral and interlinked communities

in  the same national economy. The changes that come  our

way affect us one and all.  Our response must be cohesive

and  concerted.   The  title of the ERC  report  is  "New

Challenges, Fresh Goals - Towards a Dynamic Global City".

We  have many long-term and immediate problems to  solve.

Let  us together embrace the challenges, take aim at  the

fresh  goals,  and  boldly implement the  recommendations

that will take us towards the dynamic global city that is

our vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

grateful  for  this opportunity to join  in  the  debate.

This  is  a watershed debate on our economic future.   We

can tell our grandchildren, I am sure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>

with  pride,  that  we were here when the  House  changed

their future for the better.  Now at the tail-end of  the

debate,  most  of  what needs to be said,  my  many  hon.

colleagues have eloquently said them many times over.   I

would thus keep my comments brief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to remember that while we are in

pain,  we  are in the midst of a global economic downturn

which many in the region and elsewhere are suffering even

more.   In comparison, we are certainly not doing  badly.

Many  people elsewhere would gladly exchange  place  with

us.   In  a global network world, we would be daydreaming

to  believe  that  we can shut ourselves completely  from

global changes and events.  Let us recognise that we  are

entering  an era of constant change.  Let us accept  this

and adapt ourselves to this new world.  Major changes are

needed.   However,  in making the changes,  we  must  not

mistake   our   short-term  needs   for   our   long-term

requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee had done a good job.

They had proposed good recommendations, many of which the

Government has accepted.  But, on a more basic issue,  do

we  need the ERC to achieve this in the first place?  Why

did  we  wait  until  the  current  economic  crisis   to

constitute  the ERC to do a comprehensive review  of  the

economy   and   for   the  Government   to   accept   its

recommendations?  Did we not have a planning  culture  in

the  first place?  Did the world suddenly change that  we

could not see it coming until it was upon us?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Dr Wang Kai Yuen had also asked this

question  in another form.  According to Senior  Minister

of  State, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, the recommendations were not

all  new.   Many were proposed before, but  for  whatever

reason, we did not adopt them until now.  So what was the

main contribution of the ERC?  It must be the ability  to

get  the Government to accept its recommendations.  Thus,

was  the  Government  lulled into  complacency  like  the

proverbial  frog  in  the pot over  the  fire?   Did  the

current   crisis   shock  us  out  of  our   stupor   and

complacency?   If  it  did,  the  economic   crisis   was

certainly a blessing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>

in  disguise.  We were lucky that we had time to get  out

before  the pot boils.  This is a very important question

for our world has changed.  Can we continue to depend  on

this same planning approach that had worked well for  us?

If  we believe that constant change would govern the  new

world,  then our planning paradigm must change.  We  must

constantly  review  our  planning  parameters   for   the

relevant and be bold enough to make continual changes pro-actively, to remain competitive and relevant.  Again,  Dr

Wang had alluded to this in his speech yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not wait for something cataclysmic to happen

again  before we see the need or build up the resolve  to

change.   The next crisis may happen so quickly  that  we

may not have the luxury of time to constitute a committee

to make the necessary recommendations for change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said of our people. If we were to

go  by the anecdotes of how some people responded to  the

difficult  economic situation, it would  appear  that  we

were  also like the proverbial frog.  Some of the reasons

they gave for not taking up jobs offered to them include:

the  workplace was too far; the job was too tough;  never

did  this  type of jobs before; too old; too  bothersome;

cannot  learn new things; wait for the old jobs  to  come

back, or do not like to serve others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that our people learn fast.

Several residents who came to see me during the MPS  with

these reasons have moved on to learn new skills and  take

on new jobs when they realised that the old jobs were not

coming back.  I agree with Mr Khaw Boon Wan again when he

said  on  Monday that proposals and recommendations  were

easier  to promulgate than to implement.  However,  I  am

hopeful  that  our people will face up to the  challenges

that  confront  us.  We must adopt an  open  and  dynamic

mindset with the world as our market - the willingness to

learn  and  relearn by recognising that our knowledge  is

time-dated, the willingness to take risk and to  try  new

things,  to  take on new jobs and to accept failures  and

try again - among other qualities.  I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>

hope  that this open, flexible, daring mindset will  take

hold  to become part of our national psyche.  If this  is

achieved, then the price paid for the pain that we had to

endure to meet this change would have been worthwhile  as

it would have prepared our people for the new world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one final point, Sir. In our earnestness to

change,  we  appear  to  have  downgraded  loyalty.    No

organisation   could  survive  for  long  without   loyal

members.    Loyalty  is  a  virtue.   Loyal,  hardworking

workers  are  a  competitive  advantage.   Loyalty  is  a

culture  that  takes  years to  ingrain,  but  if  it  is

carelessly handled and abused, it can easily and  quickly

die.  Loyalty should thus not be given short shrift as we

overcome  our  short-term problems.  If we  do  so,  this

shortsightedness will come back to haunt us in  the  days

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, it is less difficult to plan and

budget  than  to  carry  it out.   The  success  of  this

transition depends on us, the Singaporeans.  Let us  take

the  painful  lessons learned and move  forward  together

into  a  challenging  future.  We can  overcome;  we  can

succeed.   We  will overcome; we will  succeed.   Let  us

quickly adapt and adjust to the new future by making  the

necessary  changes to meet the new conditions.   We  must

succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, Sir, I express my support for

the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Earlier on, in my speech, I made a

reference  to  the financial figures  of  the  PUB.   The

correct  figures  should  be:   accumulated  surplus,  $1

billion;  and surplus in that year after contribution  of

$67 million to the Consolidated Fund, $207 million.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

after listening to more than 50 speeches in this House, I

cannot but observe the many contradicting demands we have

on  ourselves.   To  illustrate my  point,  the  business

community does not want the Government to interfere  with

business,  but urges Government funding and  facilitation

that  will bring the civil service back into the business

community.  Our people have been asked to be self-reliant

but,  at  the same time, goodies would be welcome.   Many

have  also called for pump priming of the economy but  as

our  colleague,  Mr  Khaw Boon Wan, said,  we  should  be

frugal.   Are we experiencing a schizophrenic  existence,

as my colleague in this House, Mr Iswaran, has put it, or

are  we  confused?  Or is it a case of kiasuism at  work,

where we want all of the best and none of the worst?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the case may be, these sentiments, in

uncertain  times, are perhaps the necessary catalyst  for

change.   Perhaps it is chaos before order.   It  is  the

catalyst that allows us to take the bull by its horns, to

make  fundamental policy shifts and even explain  "labour

pains",  to  restructure  our  economy  and  remake   our

society.  Singaporeans are resilient.  We are capable  of

rising to the challenge and bringing us to the next level

of growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last election, amidst recessionary times,

the  ruling party had asked for a strong mandate in order

to  carry  out  the  necessary, though painful,  task  of

change.   Let us not forget that while our people  showed

their   support,  their  expectations  have  also   risen

accordingly.  We have a duty to our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We promised jobs in our last election. It is

evident that even in the midst of long-term planning, the

Government did

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>

not forget that. It has done a great deal in the last one-and-a-half  years  since election, to  augment  both  the

supply and demand sides of labour, in a bid to align  the

differences created by the advent of technology, as  well

as   economic   restructuring,  to   higher   value-added

manufacturing and service industries.  But have  we  done

enough?   Is our plan bold enough?  I believe we  can  be

bolder   and  not  tiptoe  this  golden  opportunity   to

effectively  deal with our economy and seal our  people's

emotions to this land.  My colleagues have dealt in  both

length  and breadth about possible bold measures,  and  I

would like to focus on achieving the greater buy-ins from

our  3Ps   -   the people, private and public sectors   - and the CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the people sector. As I listened to the

Budget Statement that has been shaped to embrace most  of

the ERC recommendations, right at the back of my mind  is

how do we fire up the imagination of Singaporeans to have

a sense of mission to embrace these changes?  What is the

mental  picture of Singapore in the year 2010 and beyond?

Do  the  people on the ground really understand  the  ERC

Report?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the Straits Times article on 1st March

2003 written by Mr Tan Tarn How entitled, "A dose of mild

medicine for economy in transition".  In the article,  he

surmised  the  lack  of psychological dimension  for  the

people  in  this  Budget.  I acknowledge  that.   No  new

"goodies"   -   yes, that is true, but  the  Budget  does

extend  existing  goodies, like the S&C  charges,  rental

rebates, and so on, to help Singaporeans tide over  these

difficult times.  A little help here and there  would  be

heartwarming,  but  we must avoid fashioning  the  Budget

Statement  into  an annual "goodie bag" or,  worse,  even

lucky  draws,  as  some  benefits  would  only  apply  to

specific   segments  of  the  population.    That   would

certainly not cultivate the right spirit and attitude  of

the  nation.  But the call for a psychological  dimension

is  an  important  one.  It is a call for  the  alignment

between  the leadership and the people, so as to  achieve

accelerated  growth.   We must  see  our  people  not  as

functional economic units of production

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>

but  as meaningful value contributors.  Henry Ford was  a

gem  at  mass  production but could not  have  been  more

mistaken when he asked, "Why is it that I always get  the

whole person when what I really want is a pair of hands?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to understand that in this knowledge-based

economy where changes are happening everywhere, fast  and

furious,  the  sense of anomie may  be heightened  if  we

lose  track  of our case.  People work for a living,  but

live  for a cause.  And it is in this process of  working

towards  the  cause  that  establishes  Singapore's   and

Singaporeans' modus operandi and identity.  If we are  in

a  branding exercise, this exercise will have to start at

home,  and  not  just  with IE  Singapore.   I  hope  the

relevant  agencies involved in this "branding"  exercise,

including  the  new institution for continuing  education

and  training,  will focus on firing up  the  passion  in

every person, rather than impart mere technical skills to

mechanically "retrofit" people for jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring means uncertainty; it means change,

and   sometimes  pain.   It  is  traumatic  for   workers

accustomed  to  a  full  employment  situation  to   find

themselves, firstly, being retrenched; secondly, asked to

go  for retraining  -  sometimes in an alien field;  and,

thirdly, to realise the call to be self-employed contract

workers and embrace entrepreneurship, preferably  of  the

high value-added type.  To many, this seems like a triple

whammy!   Many workers have neither the skills,  resource

nor  mindset to do so.  Sir, to lessen the shock and pain

felt by some of our workers, I advocate the setting up of

a  proper  job  transition  mechanism  using  a  holistic

approach.  Perhaps under the new CET Institute to be  set

up under the Ministry of Manpower, retrenched workers can

receive advice and counselling that is beyond simple  job

matching.  We can assist displaced workers by a four-step

process:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, give them emotional counselling, so that they

are better able to absorb the retrenchment news;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, give them financial counselling, so that

they can better manage their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>

living  expenses  and  better deploy  their  retrenchment

benefits;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, retrain them or job match them, so that they

can have a meaningful placement; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, for those who desire to venture into

entrepreneurship,  they  could  be   redirected   to   an

entrepreneurship agency, so that they can learn to better

assess and manage their risk.  Mentorship programmes  can

be   encouraged   and   access  to   business   networks,

opportunities   and   infrastructure   could   also    be

facilitated  indiscriminately.  In other  words,  whether

the  entrepreneurial activity is in the  low-tech,  high-tech  or no-tech industry, the desired outcome is to  get

our people to adopt a different mindset  -  a mindset  to

carve  out a niche for themselves to stay nimble  and  be

self-reliant, a mindset to embrace risk as part of  their

daily staple.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CPF. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the policy on

the  temporary freeze on CPF restoration for  two  years.

However,  I hope that employers who are doing  well  will

reward  their  employees and put back some of  these  CPF

reductions to their salary either in the form of  monthly

variable  component  or even yearly  bonus.   This  would

augur  well for long-term employer/employee relationship.

Perhaps the civil service may want to lead by example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF scheme is a sacred cow not to be

slaughtered.   Started  in 1955 as  a  simple  retirement

savings  scheme,  it  is  a scheme  that  encourages  the

virtues  of  work and thrift, and saving for rainy  days.

The   scheme's   sole  purpose  was   that   of   nestegg

accumulation,  so  that members can be self-reliant  when

their  income stops.  Today, the CPF scheme  has  evolved

into  a  multi-layer and multi-purpose scheme  which  not

only confuses some, but no longer a reliable nestegg  for

many.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In good financial planning practice, it is important

to   earmark  specific  resource  for  a  specific  goal.

Otherwise,  the  multi-use of a  resource  with  separate

goals  can lead to conflict, confusion and an intertwined

web of different objectives.  Sir, a slave of many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>

masters faces multiple duties, obligations and functional

woes.   This, to me, appears to be the dilemma  faced  by

our  CPF  scheme.  Over the years, this simple compulsory

savings  scheme  has  come to mean  different  things  to

different  people.   As much as it  is  a  life-line  for

retirees, home owners and investors, it is also a  source

of   lifeblood   for   some   of   Singapore's   economic

initiatives.   This  is evident in industries  where  CPF

funds   can   be  channelled  into.   Clearly,   in   the

residential property market and, to a lesser extent,  the

financial market, each relaxation of the CPF rules,  from

1980s to 1990s, to allow for more funds released into the

respective industry, never fails to fuel the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Department of Statistics, $119

billion  was poured into housing over the last  10  years

while  $12.5 billion was withdrawn from CPF in  the  year

2000.   And where did it go?  Into housing.  If  this  is

not evident enough of our obsession with property, a 2001

paper by the Wharton-SMU Research Centre showed that  the

average  Singaporean has 75% of his  assets  locked  into

housing, compared with 20% in the USA.  What then is left

for  retirement?  Answer:  a big house, small  cash,  and

perhaps  arrears in payment.  Perhaps the Government  can

set up a study group to examine ways to help Singaporeans

unlock  the  value of their property to  encourage  self-sufficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of property, but perhaps to a lesser

extent,  the  financial  market  boomed  as  millions  of

dollars  were  poured  into  the  CPF-approved  financial

instruments.  All these would have been good news, except

that  the  starry eyes that went in came out tearing,  as

the  volatility in these investments proved too  much  to

stomach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequence of such a development, if unchecked,

will result in an urgent call for a bigger provision  for

social   security   measures,  either   through   forward

financing   -  meaning we have got to pay more tax  today

-  or  a burden on the next generation of taxpayers,  and

more deficit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>

budgeting   in  the  years  to  come.   All   these   are

undesirable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the alternative? I think the move by the

Government to relook and realign the CPF scheme is a wise

one,  but  one  which needs to be done at an  accelerated

pace and more decisively.  I have four basic suggestions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the retirement fund. CPF should stay true

to  its original objective of providing a nestegg for its

members.  This should remain the primary and single  most

important  objective.  In the original scheme of  things,

assuming  that an average couple earns an average  annual

income  of  $50,000 per year, and works for 35 years,  at

the  original  contribution rate of 40% and  an  interest

rate  of  2.5%  per annum, they would have accumulated  a

nestegg  of more than $1 million in their CPF.  In  other

words, almost every other Singaporean household could  be

a millionaire household when they retire!  But this could

be  history.   With CPF funds pouring into  property  and

half-understood  investments, it was reported  that  most

Singaporeans would not even be able to meet  the  Minimum

Sum  when they retire.  Therefore, bolder steps  to  move

cash into the retirement account should be advocated with

urgency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special and Retirement Accounts' interest rate

of  4%  per  annum  is highly attractive  and,  in  fact,

generous in such times.  Could the Government use this as

an   incentive  to  incentivise  members  to  voluntarily

contribute additional funds in the above accounts?  Could

cash also be accepted?  Could there be further tax relief

for  those  who bite?  Obviously, members would  have  to

reckon  that  such voluntary contributions  can  only  be

withdrawn  at retirement age.  The current recommendation

of  a moderate increase to the retirement account is  too

little, too late.  This could be a one-time exercise or a

long-term  strategy  if  the Government  can  afford  it.

Ultimately,  it  is either we encourage  self-funding  or

state funding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on investment account. Investment via the

CPF scheme should be properly missioned and managed.   It

is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>

a  nestegg and should be treated as such.  While there is

nothing   wrong  with  advocating  self-investment,   the

assumption  must be that all CPF members  comprehend  the

principles  and  tools  of investment.   But  is  this  a

reasonable  assumption?   I  do  not  think   so.    Most

investors who make use of the CPFIS are, in fact,  first-time  investors.  Like fire, this resource is  useful  to

those  who know its risk and learn how to use  it.   Like

fire,  it  is  dangerous and damaging to  those  who  are

ignorant.  Many CPF members saw it not so much as  a  way

to  grow their nestegg, but a way to make some money  and

cash  out  immediately from the profits.  Alas, the  fire

proved  too  hot for handling and many got their  nestegg

burnt.   They  got barbecued egg in burnt  nest  instead.

While  some  may be wiser after losing their money,  many

remain  confused and put the blame on CPF or friends  who

have  advocated the investment.  We need to  do  more  to

help  Singaporeans  wise  up in the  world  of  financial

management.  It is not rocket science, but it is  no  ABC

either.  I have advocated many times in this House,  that

financial literacy should be made a priority to  increase

the  financial quotient (or FQ) of Singaporeans, so  that

we  can  cope  with the ever complex world of investment,

and the urgency of retirement funding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me move on to the home purchase fund. The

CPF  Board  also  calls the CPF scheme a `home  ownership

fund'.   But is this really so?  Upon closer examination,

it  looks definitely more like a `house purchase fund' or

a   `property   purchase  fund'.   Let  me  explain   the

difference.  While a home purchase fund would focus  more

on  the  roof  over  the head for a  household,  a  house

purchase  fund  works  like a property  investment  fund,

where a basic roof is not the purpose, but the profit  of

the purchase becomes the primary objective.  This is,  in

fact,  the single most important fuel that fired  up  the

property  boom up until 15th May 1996, when  the  capital

gains tax was imposed on property purchase.  This is  one

way  to  place greater restraint on fund use.  CPF  as  a

`home  purchase  fund" is fine; but as a `house  purchase

fund' or a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>

property  investment fund, there will be no  end  to  the

property chase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on the Medisave fund. In the past, emperors

and  sages  feared living too short a life.  Today,  many

people  fear  living too long.  The concerns  of  healthy

living  and  illness  funding are frequently  heard.   In

fact, market talk has it that it is better to die than to

fall sick in Singapore, due to high medical cost, amongst

other  things.  Hence, I applaud the Government's helping

hand  in introducing and encouraging various medical  and

long-term care schemes like ElderShield, MediShield  and,

most  recently,  the  portable medical  benefit  schemes.

Knowing  full well that there can only be limited success

if  left  to  market  forces of demand  and  supply,  the

decision to make premiums payable via the Medisave scheme

is  a  brilliant move.  But more can be  done.   Here,  I

would  like to support Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's call to  widen

the  scheme.  But in addition to the suggestions  he  has

made,  I  have also been told that many Singaporeans  are

contracting one form of critical illness or another at  a

younger  and  younger  age.  As  such,  critical  illness

insurance  premium is indeed amongst the  most  expensive

forms  of  insurance, and it could be argued as  probably

one  of  the  most  important forms of  insurance.   Why?

Because  people do not necessarily die from  it,  but  it

will  certainly make them a lot poorer.  Critical illness

does not work the same way as medical benefits which  are

indemnity schemes.  Critical illness policies pay a  lump

sum  upon  diagnosis  of a critical  illness.   Hence,  I

propose that the Government seriously consider setting up

a  national  critical  illness cover  or  allow  critical

illness policies to be purchased via the Medisave.   This

way,  the drawdown on a person's limited resources  could

be better managed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, after we have talked about the people sector,

I  would like to move on to the private sector.  Perhaps,

in my opinion, the single biggest group that will benefit

from  this  Budget is the SMEs.  The Budget is consistent

with  the  Government's effort to proactively  develop  a

higher  level  of entrepreneurial activity in  Singapore.

But perhaps we should take a reality check

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>

and  ask:  where  are  we now?  Over the  years,  various

international  rating  agencies have  consistently  rated

Singapore  highly for its infrastructure and pro-business

environment.  Yet in the Global Entrepreneurship  Monitor

Report  2001, published by the London School of  Business

and  Babson College, Singapore was cited to be having one

of the lowest rates of entrepreneurial activity in the 29

countries  surveyed.   There seems  to  be  a  disconnect

somewhere.   Have  we  created an  environment  where  it

favours  foreign investors and GLCs over local SMEs?   Or

is it that the rewards of labour far outweigh the risk of

entrepreneurship?  In short, have we inadvertently become

a victim of our own success?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in any economy, there are

essentially  four factors of production -  land,  labour,

capital  and  entrepreneurship.  In Singapore,  the  risk

reward  ratios of these four factors are out of  balance.

The  rewards  for  land and labour far outweigh  that  of

entrepreneurs,   thereby   creating   disincentives    to

entrepreneurship.   We  will  need  to   re-balance   the

equation  to  make entrepreneurship an attractive  career

option.   As  long as reward ratios are out  of  balance,

then  it  is going to be difficult and an uphill struggle

for  us to encourage entrepreneurship.  Access to capital

could  also  be  improved, especially for  start-ups  and

those in the emerging and expansionary phases of growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, businesses move to where

there are more business opportunities and where money can

be made.  Yes, Singapore does not have a hinterland as in

the case of Hong Kong and China, but our `hinterland'  is

located  within the seven-hour flight radius, facilitated

by  high-tech connections and the successful  Free  Trade

Agreements  and  bilateral trade and business  agreements

concluded.  Thanks to the hard work and vision of MTI, we

have  cause for celebration, and opportunities  await  at

our  doorstep.  It is now up to the Government to  spread

the  good  news,  and the entrepreneurs to  spread  their

wings.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the public sector. It is heartening to

note in the Finance Minister's Budget Statement that  the

public  sector  will continue to simplify its  rules  and

procedures and cut red tape.  However, it is not just the

rules  and  red tape that need pruning, but the necessity

to   urgently   cultivate  a  pro-business,  pro-customer

service  culture as we move forward.  Obviously, deciding

to  transform is easy, but implementing it is  difficult.

The  policymakers may have the will but the civil service

must be prepared to `stick their necks out', stand on the

side  of  business  to  understand the  desired  outcomes

sought  by the policymakers, and not get trapped  in  the

process of things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our civil service grows, the expanding midriff

and   layering   distance  the  policymakers   from   the

customers,  and  response time  could  be  slowed.   Many

business  and  ordinary folks have been  frustrated  with

standard   replies  and  follow-the-rule-book   attitude.

Playing it safe becomes the name of the game, as  no  one

wants to be held accountable for their actions.  Hence, I

applaud  the  setting up of the ministerial committee  on

the  service  industry, headed by Deputy  Prime  Minister

Lee,  and  the  ministerial committee on entrepreneurship

under  Minister  of State Raymond Lim.  This  will  bring

both  decision makers closer to the ground, provided that

the structure is kept lean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past two days in this House, we have

consumed     western    medicine,    eastern    medicine,

psychotherapy as well as physiotherapy.  Are we now ready

to give birth?  Sir, I believe that when the mind speaks,

the  body  listens.   The challenge  is  whether  we  can

connect  our  mind  (which is our leaders)  to  our  body

(which is our people), so that we can walk the talk as  a

nation.  Our mind needs a loud and clear vision, so  that

our  body  will align itself to the purpose.  Our  people

need a mental picture.  If I could pose this question  to

our Finance Minister, if you have a piece of clean canvas

today, what would be the picture that you would paint  on

it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no tradition in demonstrations, but we have

a good track record in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>

campaigns,  which have helped built our nation.   I  hope

that  in  the  next few months, campaigns  depicting  our

visions and goals, best done in pictorial forms, could be

launched  as  a marketing effort to align  our  mind  and

body.   Ultimately,  we do not want visions  embossed  on

paper, but we want visions embodied in the daily lives of

every resident in Singapore.  Together, we stand; divided

we kang-kor, meaning we fall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is an old Chinese proverb

that  says  `we  cannot help the birds of sadness  flying

over  our heads, but we need not let them build nests  in

our hair'.  In fact, if we look beyond, there is a silver

lining,  and  there  is blue sky.  We  have  a  lot  more

sources and network than that of our forefathers who came

from  afar.   As we stand at the crossroad of  our  third

phase of growth, let us emulate the undying spirit of our

founding  fathers to be industrious, to be  frugal,  and,

most of all, to be hopeful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the release of the ERC Report, there has

been  much  debate  on  the means through  which  we  can

improve  the  competitiveness of Singapore in  this  fast

changing  global economy.  We have talked  about  how  we

should  remake  Singapore,  and  have  drafted  plans  to

restructure  our  economy, to make our  education  system

more  responsive  to the demands of the  economy  and  to

innovate in ways that will sustain development and wealth

generation for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we have seen some of these imperatives of

economic  restructuring being put in place  through  last

year's  Budget.  And in this year's Budget, delivered  on

28th  February by the Minister for Finance, we  see  more

initiatives, vital to our survival, which are recommended

by the ERC, being implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, aside from the wealth of quality ideas from the

various stakeholders from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>

all   quarters,  an  able  Government  and  a  dependable

infrastructure to execute the well-crafted  grand  plans,

the people of Singapore must play their part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic slowdown and the threat of terrorism

have  cast a gloom on our people.  It has put an  austere

mood  over many a Singaporean.  While it is a good  thing

to  be austere and to revere the virtues of frugality, as

Senior Minister of State, Mr Khaw, spoke about yesterday,

in  such times, the flip side is a dip in our morale.   I

want  to  speak on the ways in which we can  improve  the

morale of Singaporeans in these hard times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to quickly adopt a double-barrel approach.

We  already have one barrel pinned down quite  well,  and

that  is,  the  ERC's recommendations are refreshing  and

hold promise.  I would like to make some comments on  the

practical  examples of the forward-looking  character  of

our growth strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has taken further initiatives in the field

of  wealth  management.  These build on those initiatives

announced last year.  Singapore recognises that  we  need

to  position ourselves to provide these kinds  of  wealth

management services to successful families.  Singapore is

well  suited  to deliver such services at a  high  level.

There is competition, but the competitors do not have the

advantages that Singapore has.  Among the advantages  are

our sound banking and financial regulatory system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, too much of the wealth management service

industry,  undertaken globally, is shrouded  in  secrecy.

There  is already a drive for change as advocated by  the

Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and

other  financial sector watchdogs.  Singapore must  be  a

first  mover.  There is an opportunity to take  advantage

of  a significant shift in an industry that will learn to

depend on service levels and confidentiality, rather than

on   secrecy.   Singapore  is  uniquely  placed  to  take

advantage  of  this opportunity.  We have developed  into

one of the top tier financial services

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>

centres  in  Asia.  The infrastructure  is  basically  in

place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pre-empt or address any concerns on the standards

applied in Singapore, we must put a supervisory framework

in  place.   Some Members have, over the last  two  days,

talked   about  the  Singapore  brand.   The  supervisory

framework  will  safeguard our  reputation  as  a  Wealth

Management  Centre Par Excellence.  This  framework  will

respect the confidentiality of the clients of the service

providers  while  ensuring that those  service  providers

fully  understand their clients, and the source of  funds

being managed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is noted, among financial watchdogs, for

taking a tough stand in areas of money-laundering.   This

reputation will be a plus to develop Singapore  to  be  a

pre-eminent financial centre.  This supervision  is  best

done  by  way  of  a  cooperative  effort  and  could  be

spearheaded  by  the  MAS.  Respect  for  confidentiality

might  also  lead  to  a desire to enact  provisions  for

trusts  that  mirror those of banking information.   That

would  further  demonstrate our  seriousness  with  which

Singapore   banks,   financial  and   wealth   management

institutions treat their clients' information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current changes to the trust provisions, which

were announced in the most recent Budget, clarify certain

areas  so  that one avoids ambiguity.  In fact, something

of  a  non-NUTS  approach  is evident  in  the  ERC.   An

exclusion  list  of what cannot be done is  proposed  and

anything  outside that list is a green light.  This  will

spur  the  creative and innovative culture we  have  been

lamenting  that  is so lacking or subdued.   The  current

changes  have  also  expanded  the  availability  of  the

benefits to foreign trusts managed by all trust companies

in Singapore, details of which can be found in the Budget

Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister mentioned, one other component that

will  be  put in place soon is the review of legislation.

This  will bring the statutes current.  This was recently

done in relation to the companies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>

legislation.    Now  it  is  the  turn   of   the   trust

legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to create an environment where the fiduciary

service  providers want to locate to Singapore.  This  is

high value work.  We will see the concept of clusters  at

work  here.  Significantly, ancillary services would flow

from  the  development of wealth management  services  in

Singapore.   Legal services, banking services,  financial

management,  financial planning and private  banking  are

all  services  that  depend heavily  on  the  skills  and

abilities of the persons supplying these services.  These

services are skill-intensive and require a high level  of

understanding and some experience.  We will see a  magnet

for  talent flow from this.  In addition, the information

technology  requirements are very sophisticated  and  the

development  of  information  systems  can   provide   an

opportunity  to  service  the industry  worldwide.   Best

practices  are  evolving  in  this  area  as  well.    An

opportunity exists here.  Skilful and hardworking  people

are  providing  conscientious service to global  clients.

This  is  a  recipe  for  success that  augurs  well  for

Singapore's plan to be a pre-eminent financial centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke of taking a double-barrel approach. It is

clear  from my elaboration of the wealth management area,

addressed  by  the  ERC, that we have  one  barrel  fully

loaded and armed.  Let us consider the other barrel.  The

other barrel should be loaded with a call to Singaporeans

to  rise  to the challenge we face.  Government  leaders,

while  persisting  in  encouraging changing  mindsets  of

Singaporeans, must also continue to reassure Singaporeans

that we will have our day in the sun.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just like in banking, when a client's

investment  portfolio  is down  as  a  result  of  market

action,  bankers will, along with working out strategies,

also  handhold their clients through a difficult  period.

In  so doing, it will allow continued focus on the longer

term  investment  objectives and  avoid  hasty  knee-jerk

reactions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we want individuals to be more self-reliant, we must ensure that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>

fighting spirit of Singaporeans cannot and must not wane.

Singaporeans  cannot be pessimistic.  We cannot  let  our

energies ebb.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have to recognise whatever creative

effort  and  energy that are present in us, and  draw  on

them.   We  cannot lose the sense of urgency to move  on.

Singaporeans  must  see  this.  I  think  in  this  area,

Government leaders must do more cheer leading along  with

their  grand plans.  Without a high morale, we will  find

ourselves  at the bottom of the cliff and without  voice.

Then, we cannot say we have a great this or a great that,

or we are ranked this or that, or how clean and green our

city  is.  For we will no longer be any of these,  but  a

nation of pessimists doomed to fail.  Investors will  not

come  to our shores and people will leave once the people

of Singapore lose their drive and desire to succeed, most

of all, the guts to try and try again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the morale of our people must be high. The

Government  has the leadership quality, the  resolve  and

experience  to  tip  the  morale  scales  in  Singapore's

favour.   The  ERC Report is just one of the avenues,  or

tool kits, to address and pre-empt the challenges we  are

facing  and  will  encounter in the near and  foreseeable

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always been upfront and direct

about  the  problems  we have.  We acknowledge  what  and

where  the  problems are.  In this respect,  we  need  to

reassure  Singaporeans that we will ride  the  challenges

and  come out with our heads high, just as we did in  the

1970s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was encouraged and felt a sense of pride as I read

in  the Sunday Times' report on the four Singaporeans who

ventured  to India.  Their indomitable spirit to  succeed

and try something new came through clearly.  Sir, we need

to  hear  and  see more of such instances of  a  fighting

spirit.   We  need to celebrate and give  cheer  to  such

instances of entrepreneurship and pioneering spirit.   As

our  Prime  Minister so succinctly put  it  -  we  should

philosophise and see how things are not all bad.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the Finns and see how they dealt with

a  dramatic  upheaval in their economic environment.   Up

until  the  early  1990s, Finland had been  part  of  the

Eastern  bloc  and went unnoticed in the global  economy.

With  the collapse of the Soviet Union, Finland's economy

underwent a major transformation.  Practically overnight,

it  lost  a  quarter  of its major export  market.   This

resulted in massive unemployment in many sectors  of  the

Finnish   economy.    However,  despite   this   economic

hardship,  the  Finnish  people  did  not  despair.   The

Finnish  Parliament  agreed that  its  government  should

invest   heavily   in  education  and  research.    These

investments paid off.  Today, 10 years after the  crisis,

Finland   is   the  world's  most  competitive   economy,

according  to  a  ranking by the  World  Economic  Forum.

Average economic growth since 1994 has been 5%, and  this

is significant for an industrialised country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironic that it took a serious economic crisis

for  Finland  to  realise  its potential.   We  have  the

benefit of a strong open market economy that has stood us

in  good stead for many years.  But given the success  of

previous  years, Singaporeans were not prepared for  this

sustained downturn.  It was a shock to the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Finns, Singaporeans need to be flexible,

innovative  and  turn  a  deep  adversity  into  a  grand

challenge.   Unity  of  purpose across  the  sectors  and

interests,  and  planning with perspective  even  in  the

midst  of a crisis are important.  Look at the Finns  and

the   remarkable   Nokia  their  people   have   created.

Singapore is geared in the same way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to raise the morale of Singaporeans.

As Mark Twain once said, "There is nothing sadder than  a

young  pessimist."   We  cannot  be  a  young  nation  of

pessimists,  if  what  the  ERC recommendations  and  the

implementation of such imperatives are anything to go by.

There   is  much  hope.   Yes,  we  are  facing   serious

challenges  in the economic downturn.  However,  we  must

make  all efforts to ensure that Singaporeans do not lose

heart.  If that happens, then no amount of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>

remaking will help us get to where we need to be  in  the

New Economy of a changed world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have the brains, we have the passion and the

will.   But we need to have a heart and the guts to  move

forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the Budget Statement be proceeded

with  beyond  4.30  pm  and the  proceedings  thereon  be

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br>3.42 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Budget is an

important step forward in restructuring our economy.   It

builds on the strategic shifts which we began last  year,

especially  the tax changes, the offset package  for  the

tax   changes,  including  the  ERS  distributed  on  1st

January, and also the CPF changes.  So, as aptly  pointed

out  by Ms Indranee Rajah and other MPs, the measures and

policies  in this Budget should be seen in that  context,

and not in isolation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget will also have to be seen in the context

of   the  current  global  outlook,  and  the  short-term

prospects for the Singapore economy.  The global  outlook

is  very  uncertain.  Much hinges on what will happen  in

Iraq.    The  whole  world  is  now  anxiously  following

developments at the UN Security Council, watching to  see

if war breaks out over the next few days and, if there is

a war, how events develop and what happens afterwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One significant question is which way oil prices

will  move.   Oil prices are already very high,  both  in

anticipation of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>

war  disrupting  supplies and also  because  problems  in

Venezuela  have already reduced supplies.   Analysts  are

not  optimistic  that oil prices will  fall  rapidly,  as

happened after the Gulf War in 1991.  If oil prices  stay

high, it will dampen the global economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the US economy, the recent signs have been

mixed.   The  consensus is still that  we  can  expect  a

modest  US  recovery in the second half of the  year  and

that,  as  a  whole, 2003 should be slightly better  than

2002.   But this is not at all a sure thing.  Some  well-respected  analysts  are worried about  the  US  economy,

particularly  Steve Roach of Morgan Stanley.   They  fear

that  high oil prices, high consumer debt, deflation  and

the  lingering hangover of the burst dot-com bubble  will

result  in another US recession.  Since Europe and  Japan

remain  weak, a US recession would leave the whole  world

without any engine of growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still a minority view, but it is one that we

have to take seriously.  I met one experienced US analyst

recently and he told me that in more than 20 years he had

never  seen  a  time  like this,  where  people  were  so

uncertain as to which way the US economy was heading  and

market  analysts  were so divided in their  views.   And,

therefore, he was very worried.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these dark clouds on the horizon, right now,

our own economy is still growing.  We had 2.2% GDP growth

last year and the unemployment rate improved somewhat  to

4.2% at the end of the year, coming off from its peak  of

4.6%.   So  far, this year, the signs have been positive.

For  January,  our non-oil domestic exports increased  by

18%   year   on   year  and  our  industrial   production

manufacturing output also went up 14% year on year.   The

early  indications are that the first quarter GDP  growth

is  quite  steady.  Our early estimate, based  mainly  on

January  data,  is plus 2.7%.  And this  is  despite  the

major uncertainty of war hanging over the global economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think Dr Wang Kai Yuen may have been a

little bit too pessimistic when he said that the worst is

yet to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>

come.   But it is certainly possible that things can  get

worse and we will need to monitor and assess developments

closely, and be prepared if this happens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main concern among many Singaporeans is jobs.

Many  people  have  said this is a  pro-business  budget.

But,  as  Mdm  Halimah  Yacob and Mr  Matthias  Yao  have

pointed out, in fact, this is a pro-jobs, pro-growth  and

pro-worker   Budget.   The  Budget  aims  at   preserving

existing  jobs and creating new and better jobs  for  our

people.   But all the budget measures are only  enablers,

because  success lies in our people seeing, creating  and

seizing the opportunities that come our way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the immediate term, reducing costs is important.

But, ultimately, to create more jobs, we need to look for

new businesses and create new value.  We are making major

strategic  shifts,  and  we  must  get  them  right   and

implement the changes speedily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang complained that the cost of

living  is very high.  If I may borrow a phrase from  the

Ministry   of  Foreign  Affairs,  he  is  a   very   good

storyteller.   In  fact, last year,  the  consumer  price

index  fell  by  0.4%, despite the public transport  fare

increase.   Many basic food items cost less,  like  rice,

cooking oil, meat, seafood and vegetables.  Housing  cost

2.2%  less,  because of electricity tariffs coming  down,

accommodation  and  household durables becoming  cheaper.

Transport and communication costs fell by 1%, because  of

cheaper  petrol and the lower road tax.  Only  healthcare

and education costs rose marginally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the CPI fell, nominal wages went up by about

1%  last  year.  Mr Steve Chia asked for  a  30%  cut  in

Ministers'  salaries.  How will this solve  our  problem?

If  it  is to be a symbolic gesture, then we had  already

done it in November 2001, when we cut monthly salaries of

Ministers by 10%.  And, if we take it together with  cuts

in  annual  payments, in fact, the result was an  overall

reduction of 20% in annual remuneration. Last November we

extended  the  cut  for another 12 months  till  December

2003.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members, such as Dr Warren Lee and Dr Teo Ho

Pin,  have  asked for more help to be given to the  lower

income  group.   This  we will do.   The  Government  has

already  implemented  substantial measures  to  help  all

Singaporeans  in  this  year's and last  year's  budgets,

specially  focused  on the lower income  group.   We  are

providing  additional help where it means  the  most,  in

basic household expenditure items, such as utilities  and

Service  &  Conservancy  (S&C) charges.   The  Government

extended  the  Utilities Save scheme  by  one  year,  and

granted an extra month of rebates on S&C charges for  all

1-  to  5-room HDB flats.  So, come April, all the  flats

will be spared S&C charges.  And these are over and above

the previous provisions.  Also, we should not forget that

by  staggering the GST increase into two steps,  we  have

effectively  given Singaporeans a very large rebate  this

year of $650 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Khalis, Dr Warren Lee and Mdm Ho Geok Choo

also spoke on maintaining the social fabric and providing

additional help to those who cannot pay utilities  bills.

We  will  do that.  However, we should keep the lines  of

responsibility  clear.  Power Supply  is  not  a  welfare

organisation.  Its bills have to be paid.  But people who

need  help paying these bills should try to get help from

the  CDCs  and  CCCs, where ample help is available.   We

will  have  to  depend  on  the  grassroots  leaders   to

distinguish between those in genuine need and  those  who

can  help themselves to be more self-reliant.  With their

assessment, with their sensitive management, where  there

is  discrimination, we can deliver the help where  it  is

most  needed, without discouraging a lot of other  people

from working and looking after themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members, including Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr

Iswaran  and Mdm Cynthia Phua, have said that the  middle

income group's concerns have not been addressed.  I think

they are mistaken.  Rightly, we have focused our help  on

the   lower   income  group.   However,  we   have   also

implemented  measures for the middle income  group.   The

Utilities Save and the S&CC rebates are weighted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>

towards  the  1- and 3-roomers, but they have  also  been

extended towards the 4- and 5-roomers.  Furthermore,  the

middle  income group will benefit significantly from  the

1%  GST deferment, because their consumption level  is  a

lot  higher than the lower income group.  So, we have not

forgotten the middle income group in this Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs, including Mrs Fang Ai Lian, Mr Gan Kim

Yong and others as well, expressed regret that we did not

give   further  rebates  for  personal  income  tax   and

corporate  income  tax this year, nor did  we  lower  the

rates by another one percentage point.  But do not forget

that individuals and companies are already enjoying lower

personal  and corporate taxes this year, as a  result  of

last   year's   substantial  tax  cuts.   There   is   no

justification  for  giving them tax  rebates  on  top  of

these, considering the tight budgetary position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lowering the rates by another one percentage

point, remember that it would only affect the taxes to be

paid  next year, in the Year of Assessment 2004.   It  is

not  going  to put money in people's pockets  this  year.

So, given the uncertainties ahead, it would be unwise  of

us  to  commit now to being generous next year.   If  the

situation pans out favourably, it will not be too late to

consider an income tax rebate next year.  If it does not,

we will have to reconsider our position.  But what counts

for  investors and businesses is our long-term tax  plan.

For  that, we have already committed to bringing down the

top rates to 20% by the Year of Assessment 2005.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On help for businesses, one item of attention has

been  industrial land costs.  Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr  John

Chen,  Mr  Nithiah  Nandan and several other  MPs  raised

this.   We  cannot match the lowest land prices available

in  China or Vietnam, nor do we need to do so.  In  fact,

sometimes,  land  is  given  away  for  free   in   these

countries.   But the Government will ensure  an  adequate

supply   of   industrial  land  to  achieve  stable   and

internationally   competitive  land   prices.    Already,

industrial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>

land  prices have come down by about 45% from their  peak

in 1996.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that the Government

should  announce  its intention to lower industrial  land

prices   drastically.   I  think  the  last   thing   the

Government  should  do  is  to destabilise  the  property

market.  He may recall that, last year, he made the  same

proposal  on  residential properties -  to  reduce  their

prices  by  30%.   And I advised him to be  very  careful

about what he said, because his voters who own their  HDB

flats  would not be pleased, and they are also my voters.

Unfortunately,  this year, he has repeated  the  argument

for  industrial land.  There are thousands  of  companies

owning industrial land, and many banks have lent money to

factories  against  industrial land  as  collateral.   It

would  be  reckless  to  alarm  all  of  them  with  rash

statements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need to be rash. We can ensure that our

land   market  is  efficient  and  flexible,   and   that

multinationals   coming  here  have   enough   affordable

industrial  land for their operations.  There is  enough.

We  can  do that because, under the Master Plan, we  have

reserved at least 12,000 hectares for industrial use and,

so  far,  only  7,300  hectares of this  are  in  use  by

industries.   As  most  industrial  land  is  held  on  a

leasehold  basis, the supply is renewable  and  ample  to

meet  long-term demand.  Because, every year, some leases

will  expire and the land is taken back and  can  be  re-allocated  again.   We  have  also  been  successful   in

intensifying the use of the land so that we can  get  all

the  industrial  floor space that  we  need,  whether  to

attract new investments or to enable existing investments

to expand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chee How and several other MPs suggested

that  the  Government's land use policy was to blame  for

our  woes.    Particularly, they cited an alleged  policy

whereby  we priced land in terms of its alternative  use.

But  industrial land prices are not pegged to alternative

uses,  such as residential or commercial purposes.   Land

is  zoned  specifically for different uses, such  as  for

industries,  and  tendered out  for  that  purpose.   So,

industrial uses are only competing against

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>

other  industrial  uses,  and  commercial  against  other

commercial  uses, and so on.  With ample  supply,  prices

should remain competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen suggested that high industrial land

cost  contributed to the recent PSA retrenchment.  He  is

not  right,  because PSA is charged very reasonable  land

prices,  and land cost is not a significant component  of

PSA's  total costs.  Labour is.  The retrenchment in  PSA

is not due to land pricing but, rather, through redundant

overheads.   Faced  with  intensifying  competition,  PSA

cannot   afford  to  carry  overheads  which  no   longer

contribute   to  its  businesses,  and   they   have   no

alternative but to rationalise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rebates, a number of MPs - Dr Warren Lee, Dr Teo

Ho Pin and Mr Nithiah Nandan - have asked for the various

rebates which I introduced to be extended, preferably for

two to three years.  Members should remember that rebates

are  meant as temporary measures, and they should not  be

permanent.   They are different in nature  from  the  CPF

freeze.  Let me explain why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF is a statutory cost imposed on employers and

employees.   It is an imposition.  It achieves  important

social objectives, but it is a burden on businesses.   We

can only raise the CPF rates and increase the burden when

the  economy  is strong enough, which means  not  earlier

than two years from now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the JTC and HDB rental rebates

are  concessions to the existing tenants.  In  principle,

tenants  should pay market rentals all the time,  whether

the  economy  is up or down, and, of course,  the  market

rentals  will  go  up  and down with  the  state  of  the

economy.   In  that way, the companies which  are  viable

will come into the business, and the companies which  are

no  longer viable will leave the business.  But  to  give

the  people  who are already tenants, who are already  in

business, some respite, some time to catch their  breath,

we  have given the rebates to help them to pay less  than

the  market rentals, and to give them more time to adjust

to the new conditions.  Over

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>

the  long term, however, we cannot freeze this flow.   We

must  allow  the natural entry and exit of companies  and

businesses  because, if we continue the rebates  for  too

long,  then in fact we are holding back the restructuring

of  our  economy.  So, it is better to extend the rebates

for  six  months, and reassess the situation  again  next

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon raised the concern of Government

fees  and  charges  contributing to  the  cost  of  doing

business.   I have great sympathy with this  view.   They

may  be  small amounts, but they do add up.  We are  very

conscious of this, and we are making every effort to keep

our  fees  and charges as low as possible.   However,  we

cannot  totally  do  away  with  all  fees  and  charges.

Nothing is for free.  Ultimately, someone has to foot the

bill.  Either the users pay, or we have to fund it out of

general taxes, which may mean raising tax rates.   Or  we

will  have to cut back on services and provide  fewer  or

lower  quality  services, contrary to  all  the  requests

which  I have heard over the last three days from MPs  to

improve  the  service quality of Government  departments.

Mr  Tan cited DVDs getting cheaper year by year.  That is

true.  But services are not getting cheaper year by year,

unlike  electronic goods, because skilled people are  not

getting  cheaper.  For example, medical costs are getting

more  and  more expensive everywhere, as medical  science

and technology improve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will make sure that its operations

are  run as efficiently as possible and, sometimes,  this

will mean retrenchments and downsizing, like in HDB.  But

we  cannot avoid these tough choices.  However, the  best

way  to keep costs down for businesses is not through ad-hoc  rebates  but,  rather,  through  prudent  Government

spending to keep the overall tax burden on businesses  as

low  as  possible  permanently.  And we  have  kept  this

Government  lean,  with  Government  spending  this  year

accounting  for  only  19% of GDP.  The  Government  will

continue to keep its size small.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members - Mr Tan Soo Khoon, Mr Inderjit

Singh, Mr Loh Meng See and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>

Dr  John  Chen - said that the deficit is not  real,  and

that the Government should have run a bigger deficit.  We

did better than expected in FY 2002 because, fortunately,

we  underspent our budget.  It is true that we had higher

than  projected  Net Investment Income contribution  but,

remember,  our tax revenues were lower than expected  and

the  two  variations  cancelled  each  other  out.   Some

Members seem to regret this.  Somehow, they are sad  that

we did not run a deficit as big as we expected.  But I am

glad  that,  as a result, we were able to make additional

special  transfers to the Lifelong Learning Fund and  the

Medifund.  However, we cannot expect such happy surprises

all  the  time.   From time to time, the Budget  out-turn

swings against us. For example, in FY 2001, we forecasted

a  budget surplus but we ended up with a deficit of  $2.7

billion.  And there are many uncertainties when  you  are

looking ahead, even 12 months, especially in a year  like

this one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we had to decide very carefully how large

a  deficit  we  needed  in this FY 2003  Budget.  We  are

running  a  budget deficit for the third year in  a  row.

This   is   not  an  illusion.   Where  the   items   are

meritorious,  we  have  not cut  back  on  spending,  for

example,  on  security.   And we  are  making  a  special

transfer  of $600 million to the ERS account.   It  is  a

special  transfer, but it is money which is going  to  be

paid  out  and that will put cash directly into  people's

hands for them to spend if they wish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon also said that the Government

should draw upon the surpluses of the statutory boards as

a  supplementary source of revenue.  It  is  a  plausible

presentation of a seductive idea. The surpluses of  these

statutory  boards have been accumulated  over  very  many

years.  But on a year-to-year basis, the statutory boards

are  only running modest surpluses, which they ought  to,

because they are meant to generate sufficient revenue  to

fund their activities and we should be thankful that they

are  able  to  do  so and do not need  to  fall  back  on

Government spending.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory boards do make regular contributions to

the  Government  but,  compared to  our  overall  revenue

needs,  these  are  not significant.   Also,  to  put  it

bluntly,  we should not be thinking of raiding the  bank.

We  can only do it once and after that, we will be  poor.

It   is  precisely  to  stop  populist  governments  from

spending these reserves that the bigger statutory  boards

like JTC are protected with the President's second key.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs, of course, would prefer us to have

budgeted  for a larger deficit so that more sweets  could

be  distributed  all round.  But are  they  sure  that  a

larger  deficit  would instill greater  confidence  among

analysts and investors?  Might analysts and investors not

see  it as a weakening of fiscal discipline, an inability

to  tighten our belts?  The same people who now say  that

they  are disappointed we did not open our purses,  would

turn  around and say that they are alarmed that  we  have

taken leave of our prudence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran and others made a comparison with Hong

Kong's  recent  Budget.   This is a very,  very  relevant

comparison.  I draw three conclusions from the Hong  Kong

experience.  Firstly, it shows how quickly a country  can

move  from  a  large budget surplus to a  chronic  fiscal

deficit.  Hong Kong was in an enviable position,  just  a

few  years ago, generating a surplus of more than  6%  of

GDP  in  1997,  the  year of the handover.   Now,  it  is

projecting a deficit of about HK$70 billion,  5%  of  GDP

for  this  year, after running deficits for the preceding

two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, despite the large deficit, the Hong Kong

economy  is  stagnant.  Like Singapore, Hong  Kong  is  a

small  and open economy, and deficit spending is  not  an

effective way to boost demand.  So do not think that,  if

only  we  would open our wallets, the problems  would  go

away  and  we would all get a warm feeling.   It  is  not

true.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, once we fall into the pattern of a large

deficit,  it is very difficult to get out from the  black

hole.  We may say that the spending is temporary, but the

reality, as you will know from your appeals on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>

the  rebates,  is that it is very difficult  to  withdraw

temporary concessions.  Hong Kong is now having to  raise

taxes in a slow economy, which is extremely tricky,  both

politically and economically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, given the uncertain outlook, it would be

premature  for us to have a highly stimulative budget  to

try to boost our economy.  It is better for us to take  a

conservative stance now.  If things do worsen  later  on,

Singaporeans  can  take comfort that the  Government  has

available  bullets  to expend.  Not only  should  we  not

shoot  off  all our bullets now, but we need to  see  the

situation  develop further before it will be  clear  what

targets  we should aim at with our bullets so as  to  get

maximum effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the short-term considerations. We should

also  not  lose  sight  of  the  longer-term  dimensions,

starting   with   the  international   backdrop.   Global

competition is intensifying. Mr Tan Soo Khoon  eloquently

cited  some examples, so did other MPs.  We have  got  to

keep our system lean.  We have got to remain nimble,  and

search for new growth niches and opportunities. Our  past

success is no guarantee of continued high growth.  We can

see  many  examples  of countries  which  have  run  into

difficulties  because they cannot change and  adapt  fast

enough,  not  that  they do not know  it,  but  they  are

frozen, they are unable to do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in Germany, as reported in the Business

Week   recently,  enormous  structural  impediments  have

stalled  Germany's progress. At the core of it all  is  a

job  protection  law that makes it almost impossible  for

employers to lay off workers.  Any company with more than

five employees is subject to this law.  So companies stay

below six so as not to be caught.  And the result of this

is  11% unemployment, because the more you try to protect

jobs,  the  fewer jobs will be created. German  companies

avoid  hiring  workers even when there is  business,  and

they  invest all over the world, rather than  in  Germany

itself, and little foreign investment goes to Germany.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, we see countries which are rising

rapidly, like China and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>

India,  which  puts  pressure  on  all  other  countries.

China's competitive advantage will be low-cost labour for

some time yet.  While China dominates the world in labour-intensive products, it will also become a major  importer

of   capital-intensive   goods  and   knowledge-intensive

services.  In the longer-term, the emergence of China and

India  are undoubtedly positive developments for  us.   A

more   prosperous  China  and  India  would  mean  bigger

markets,  more  investment opportunities, bigger  trading

partners for Singapore and the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business to China is growing. We are not just

importing more from them, we are exporting a lot more  to

them.  Last year, our exports to China grew by about 28%,

to  more than $12 billion.  Our combined exports to China

and  India now equal to more than half our total  exports

to the US.  Those countries and those companies which can

get  organised  faster would be able to  move  ahead  and

seize the opportunities that these rising economies bring

with  them.   And  some of our companies and  people  are

already  making  inroads  into  the  Chinese  and  Indian

markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, you may have heard of Dr Tan Hock, a

Singapore  entrepreneur  in  Shanghai,  whose  story  was

carried on some of our radio stations.  He found a  niche

in  the  knowledge-based industry in China, by  animating

the  12  zodiac  characters into cartoon  characters  and

created  an  industry  - cartoons  as  well  as  all  the

products  to  sell with the cartoons.  And  he  is  doing

well.   His  creations  are now  broadcast  in  over  130

stations across China and 10 stations in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are people who venture into India too. You

would  have read about a group of retrenched Singaporeans

who made good setting up a factory producing ring binders

in a small rural Indian village called Tiruvallore.  When

President Nathan visited Tamil Nadu recently, they turned

up  to  meet him, which is probably how the Straits Times

found out about them.  It was a remote village. They went

there,  they set up shop, they made it viable, they  even

learnt Tamil, albeit a few words, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>

I  think  they  take  turns coming  home  because  living

conditions there are hard.  But they press on.  And there

is  another company which invested half a million dollars

and  set up something called Technigroup India to provide

modern office furniture in India.  They managed to break-even within a year and generated $3 million turnover last

year.   The  opportunities are there  and  we  must  take

advantage   of  them.   And  that  is  the  international

backdrop   against  which  we  are  making  our  domestic

changes, starting with our tax changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked airily what was so radical

about our tax changes.  It is a very significant shift to

bring  individual and corporate tax rates down to 20%  by

YA  2005  and to raise GST to broaden our tax base.   How

many  other  countries can do that?  Our  tax  rates  are

competitive for now, but we will need to keep  tabs  over

the  long term and be prepared to go lower, if necessary.

We  are  also  making other strategic changes,  exempting

foreign  source  income,  domestic  interest  income  and

enhancing taxation on intellectual property, and  so  on.

As  Mrs Fang Ai Lian has told Members, and she knows  the

business,  these are important structural changes  which,

over  time,  will  develop a lot of  new  businesses  for

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CPF, which is our second major change, I would

like  to  thank MPs like Mr Ong Ah Heng, Mdm Halimah  and

Mrs  Lim  Hwee Hua who have voiced support  for  the  CPF

deferment.   We are grateful for their support  from  the

unions and the workers. They have understood and accepted

the need for the change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no expectation of a restoration of the CPF

this   year  anyway.   And  even  if  the  economy   does

moderately  well  this year, by January  2004,  it  would

probably  not  have done strongly enough  for  us  to  be

confident enough to warrant a restoration of the  CPF  in

2004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what we are essentially asking Singaporeans to do

is merely to commit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>

now  what we would have to decide in 12 months anyway and

to  say, yes, let us decide now, we will freeze it for 24

months  and  get on our feet during that time.  It  is  a

commitment which we can make, and a commitment which will

be  an important signal to investors that we are prepared

to do what it takes to get our economy back on track.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and others raised the question of

the  long-term  CPF  structure and the  question  of  the

concept of retirement.  How can we save enough in our CPF

accounts  while we are working, so that we can retire  at

62  and  then  live on our CPF savings and hopefully  our

children  for  another 20 years or  longer?   It  is  not

realistic  and  it  will become an  increasingly  serious

problem  as life expectancy goes up, our population  ages

and our birth rate goes down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to find ways therefore to keep our older

workers  employed and working beyond their 50s  and  60s,

though  not  necessarily in the same job or at  the  same

pay.   Workers have to be prepared to take on  second  or

even third careers.  What can we do to help them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, mindset change and skills upgrading

are  important, as pointed our by Ms Braema, Mr Seng  Han

Thong and Mr Andy Gan.  Workers must be prepared to adapt

and to make adjustments.  We have to continue training to

stay  on  the job or reskill and move on to another  job,

and  many also have to take on lighter jobs at lower  pay

and  work part-time.  To carry on doing what you used  to

do,  at a slower rate, and yet expecting employers to pay

the  same or even more, is simply not viable.  But it  is

essential  to  find  other  work  or  work  on  different

employment terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must keep the labour market flexible so as to

preserve  jobs  and maximise employment,  especially  for

older workers.  The CPF system adds to business cost.  If

the CPF system is to be sustainable, it cannot impose too

onerous a burden on companies to employ workers.  Indeed,

workers,  especially those at the lower  end,  want  more

take-home   pay.   Hence,  we  are  reducing   employee's

contributions for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>

the  lower-income workers and also for the older  workers

aged  50-55.   But there is a trade-off  because  if  CPF

contribution  is too low, workers would  not  have  saved

enough  for housing, healthcare or old age and,  as  Miss

Penny Low analysed, they will fall back on the Government

when they need a house, fall ill or grow old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we have to balance two perspectives - the CPF as

compulsory savings, which we would like to have  as  high

as  possible,  against the CPF as a  cost  to  businesses

which  we would like to keep as low as possible.  In  the

earlier years, when our growth was high and incomes  were

rising  rapidly,  we emphasised more  on  CPF's  role  as

compulsory savings and pushed it up whenever we could, so

as not to let people get used to spending the money.  Now

that  we are in a tougher operating environment, we  have

to   strike   a   different  balance  between   the   two

perspectives.   But  we  should not  give  up  the  first

perspective  of  the CPF as compulsory savings  entirely,

because  it  is still valid.  Without the CPF scheme,  we

would have a different Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second major theme is entrepreneurship and SMEs.

Mr  Raymond  Lim  has adequately addressed  this  in  his

speech.   As Ms Indranee and Dr Chong Weng Chiew  pointed

out,  entrepreneurial  spirit is  about  taking  personal

responsibility and achieving success through his  or  her

own  efforts  and  abilities, rather  than  depending  on

largesse  from the Government.  If you say, "Please  help

me  to  become an entrepreneur", chances are you  already

miss  one  of  the  ingredients for  starting.   In  many

aspects, the Government should do less rather than  more.

It should act as a last resort, and not a first recourse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we heard Dr Gan See Khem tell us in vivid

personal  terms  her first-hand experience,  her  gung-ho

spirit  and  her passion, fighting for what she  believes

in.   And her HMI Holdings is exactly what we are looking

for.   It  will  always be challenging to  start  up  new

businesses, and to venture outside Singapore will be even

harder.   If  entrepreneurship was  simple,  and  anybody

could do it,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>

the  rewards  would not be great.  Dr  Gan  See  Khem  is

exceptional,  as  she persevered and fought  against  the

odds.   We  need more people like her, and the Government

will do its best to help them succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry it has taken her so long for her to deal

with the agencies.  I asked the agencies and they tell me

that  they  had  good reasons, and there are  significant

issues in assuring the standards of her training courses,

but  that they are doing their best to resolve these with

Dr  Gan expeditiously.  It is our job to help, even  when

it does not appear that we are doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that we should shift our

focus away from multi-nationals and rely on SMEs.  He  is

mistaken.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> In addition to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> In addition to - he is

correct.  We will encourage small companies and start-ups

but we still need the MNCs.  SMEs can complement them but

cannot replace them.  We have hundreds of multi-nationals

in  Singapore.   Even if our efforts  to  grow  Singapore

companies  are wildly successful, we will only  create  a

dozen or so MNCs of our own, and even that is being very,

very   optimistic.   We  need  both  MNCs  and  Singapore

companies  to  diversify and to grow our economy  and  to

create enough jobs for our people.  However, I agree with

Mr  Inderjit  Singh that more can be done  to  help  SMEs

navigate our bureaucracy.  SPRING Singapore is the  focal

agency for assisting them.  We have many things in  mind,

including  helping SMEs to get access to financing  in  a

market-based way.  However, we have to bear in mind  that

no  matter how much financing we provide, there can never

be enough for all the SMEs which want it.  SMEs will have

to  compete  for  financing, and only  those  which  look

viable and can convince the investors or lenders will  be

able to get it.  This is an unavoidable Darwinian process

of attrition.  Without it, you will not have strong SMEs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs, Chew Heng Ching, Ng Ser Miang, Zainudin

Nordin  and, memorably, Dr Amy Khor, have spoken out  for

mindset  change from the civil service to  be  more  pro-business.  Indeed, the civil service is already trying to

do this, and we will have to do more.  From time to time,

we organise sessions in the civil service for the private

sector  to come and to share their perspectives with  the

civil  servants.  I will ask them, in future,  to  invite

some  MPs to speak, and I think if Dr Amy Khor and others

can come and present to them the way they presented it in

this  House,  it will have an impact, and  some  positive

effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pro-enterprise panel chaired by the Head

of  the  Civil  Service, with ten members, six  from  the

private  sector,  and Mr Inderjit Singh  is  one  of  the

members.   The  panel receives feedback, suggestions  and

complaints   from  businesses  against   rules   and   on

difficulties dealing with the different agencies.  It has

received more than 600 suggestions since it was formed in

August  2000, and about half of these have been accepted.

On average, it took 29 days to settle a case.  Change has

been quite quick, because issues are put directly to  the

Heads  of Departments and CEOs of statutory boards.   For

example,  we amended the Auctioneers' Licences Act  as  a

result  of feedback to the panel and this enabled on-line

auctions.  So, I advise anybody who is unhappy about  any

rule to put his case to the panel and it will give a full

hearing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a Rules Review Panel which we set up

in May last year.  Every Ministry and statutory board has

to  review all its rules within three years - that  means

by  the  end  of FY 2004 - and thereafter on a  five-year

rolling  basis, as Amy Khor says, this is  a  rule  about

rules.   One  result  is  that  about  one-third  of  173

statutory declarations required by the Government will be

removed  by  the  end of this financial  year.   To  give

another  example, Mindef reviewed 135 rules, deleted  80,

simplified 40 and retained 15.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Prof. Low Seow Chay gave an example of a rule

which we ought to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>

retain  and  that has to do with odour control.   He  was

talking  about chicken farms.  His neighbouring MPs  will

know exactly what he is talking about.  His complaint was

that  we  could not specify the standard of air freshness

needed  or  be  sure  what odour  control  process  would

produce fresh enough air.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, smells from chicken farms pose a real

problem in a compact city like Singapore.  The Government

did  introduce a new odour control rule when  we  started

building flats around the farms.  However, it is not true

that the Government kept changing the rule.  The National

Environment  Agency is still pursuing the matter,  simply

because  the  farms  have  not  met  the  required  odour

standards  -  meaning they have not installed  what  they

were supposed to install.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you the real story. There were four

chicken  farms  in Sungei Tengah.  They were  causing  an

odour problem.  They were given a choice of closing  down

and  accepting  an  ex gratia payment or  continuing  and

installing odour control filters.  Three closed down  and

took  the  ex  gratia payment, one chose to  proceed  and

upgrade.   But  after it committed to install  the  odour

control equipment, it failed to install everything it was

supposed  to  do,  causing  a  great  smell  nuisance  to

residents in the neighbouring constituencies.  Hence  the

problem, which in due course will be solved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me remind Members that after all the

promotional  efforts,  all the  rules  cutting,  all  the

incentives,   whether  we  can  be   successful   as   an

entrepreneurial society and economy, ultimately it  boils

down to talent.  Do we have the people who can seize  the

opportunities?   Do we have businessmen with  a  business

sense  and  that drive and dare?  Without them,  all  the

efforts and the nurturing will be in vain.  I think if we

confine ourselves only to Singaporeans, we will not  have

enough entrepreneurial talent.  There will be a few,  but

we  will  not have enough.  If we really want  to  be  an

entrepreneurial   society,  we   must   attract   foreign

entrepreneurs to Singapore to start their business  here,

and that we are doing.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about services. The ERC's

recommendation  is that we have to upgrade  manufacturing

and  services.  There is no guaranteed business, not even

at  the  lower end.  But we are confident that we can  do

well  by upgrading what we have.  Yes, others will pursue

the  same  strategy, but I believe that we can  implement

this strategy better and faster than others.  We have the

edge, as our foundation is strong.  We are nimble and  we

can move faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Khaw Boon Wan touched on services in his speech.

The  Government is serious about promoting  this  as  the

second  engine  of  growth,  and  there  is  good  growth

potential in healthcare, education and creative services.

I  agree with Dr Lily Neo that we are well positioned  to

be  a  regional healthcare hub.  I spoke to some  private

sector doctors recently and they expressed great optimism

about  our  chances.   We  have  traditional  markets  in

Malaysia  and  Indonesia, and we are also  expanding  our

markets  further afield, to new customers like  Arabs  in

the  Middle-East, Bangladeshis, even Mongolians.  I asked

them,  "Do Mongolians speak English?"  They said  at  the

upper  end,  it is no problem.  They have the money,  and

they will come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly for education services. Raffles LaSalle

Limited now runs five schools in China, with an intake of

more  than 1,000 students.  Today, in Singapore, we  have

more  than 23,000 PRC students studying here.  There  are

social  considerations involved here  too,  and  also  in

service  sectors  like healthcare.  If  they  are  really

students  studying,  that is  fine.   If  they  are  just

students in name, that may be a problem.  But we have  to

manage  these  problems,  and we  cannot  turn  away  the

business.  The Ministerial Committee is going to make the

trade-offs and strike the balance between the social  and

the economic considerations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not just targeting the high end of the

services  industry, as Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon pointed  out.

There are opportunities in our traditional segments  like

hair-dressing,  retail  and entertainment.   However,  in

Singapore, there is no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>

non-tradable sector that we can shield from competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann suggested that maybe if we build a

strong  globalised  economy,  then  we  can  support   an

inefficient  domestic sector which can provide  jobs  for

older  Singaporeans.  I listened to  him  twice  to  make

sure,  but  he did mean that - to support an  inefficient

domestic  sector and provide some jobs.  Other  countries

have  tried that, like Japan, where in the retail sector,

lots  of  people are employed, but they just look  pretty

and stand at the elevators and bow each time you go past.

It  has not worked for Japan, and it is not feasible  for

Singapore.   We  have no domestic service  which  can  be

shielded   from   global   competition   or   from    the

neighbourhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong highlighted the competition across

the  Causeway in healthcare services.  I am not sure that

I  would go across to another country if I needed a heart

operation, but if I need a haircut, if I want to do  some

shopping, or entertainment, the facilities are there,  it

is  cheaper,  why not?  Many Singaporeans do.   Even  for

bridal  shops  and retail outlets, there is  competition.

So  it  is  not possible to have a protected  inefficient

domestic  sector in Singapore.  We have to  be  efficient

everywhere,  and  we have to look after  our  people  who

cannot find jobs and help them to find jobs, which brings

me to the question of structural unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs raised this - Dr Ong Seh Hong, Mr Zainul

Abidin  and Dr Warren Lee.  It is a difficult problem  to

solve.   It  will  not disappear for quite  a  long  time

because  if  you look at the figures, for  workers  50-59

years  old,  more  than  half have  less  than  secondary

qualifications. For the younger workers, the  educational

standards are higher. But even for the younger age group,

aged  40-44  years old, about one-third  have  less  than

secondary qualifications, and they are going to be in the

workforce  for another 20 years.  So the Government  will

go the extra mile to help these older workers.  This will

be  one  major focus of the new Continuing Education  and

Training statutory board.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>

These workers have contributed to the nation's growth and

they have made possible what Singapore is today.  Like in

the PSA retrenchment exercise, we will do all that we can

to  help  the displaced workers, counsel them, help  them

with job search and with job matching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee and a few other MPs also asked us to

subsidise older workers.  They define older workers as 40

years and above - that is a generous definition.  It is a

possible approach, but we do not have to consider it yet.

The proportion of older workers suffering from structural

unemployment is still low, only 11/2%.  We should try  to

solve the problem for this specific group of people  with

targeted assistance, and not through some broad policy to

subsidise many other older workers who are still managing

well  on  their  own.  Otherwise, you  will  incur  great

expense  and yet miss the target.  Furthermore, you  will

distort  the  economy  and  end  up  with  deficits   and

inefficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach, as a Government, is a three-level one.

Firstly, generate good growth and create new jobs.  There

are  jobs available if the older workers are flexible and

prepared  to  adapt.  Even in the wafer fabs,  there  are

semi-skilled jobs, but they will require a certain amount

of discipline, adjustment or shift work.  It is not easy,

but it can be done.  Secondly, help to educate, train and

match workers to jobs so that they can stay employed,  or

if  they lose jobs, then they can find new ones.  That is

the  purpose  of  the new statutory board  and  also  the

People for Jobs Training programme.  Also, we need to set

up  the  right networks at the grassroots, the CDCs,  the

self-help  groups  and NTUC, to help workers  find  jobs.

Thirdly, the Government will continue to provide targeted

assistance  to  those who need help the most.   But  such

assistance  must be tied to their efforts to  find  jobs.

The   Government  will  also  look  after   the   younger

generations  to  make sure that no child is  deprived  of

good  education because of lack of finances.  This  is  a

problem,  because  if it is too easily available,  people

will not look for the jobs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Australia a year ago and I visited a

village  about  50 miles outside of the  Gold  Coast.   I

asked  the  guide,  "Who  live  here?"   He  said,  "Some

teachers,  some retired people, some unemployed  people."

I said, "Why are they living here, 50 miles away from the

Gold  Coast?   There  are no jobs."  He  said,  "Exactly,

because there is a rule in Australia that if you want the

dole,  you must show that you have hunted for work within

a certain radius, 30-50 miles, and failed."  And this was

a  good  place  for  failing.  So, we  have  to  be  very

careful.  In Singapore, there is no place to go,  and  if

they do not try, you are going to have a problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have objected that many of the jobs

being  created  are for younger, better-skilled  workers.

That  is  true.  But it is important that  we  do  create

these jobs and generate the growth.  With growth, we will

have  more  resources  to help the  older  workers.  With

growth,  there  will  be some more  jobs  for  the  older

workers.   If  we  try  to preserve the  status  quo,  to

protect the jobs which are no longer viable, and  to  put

off economic restructuring, then we will fail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have set as our objective here and as our theme

"New Challenges - Fresh Goals".  Some people have accused

us  of doing too little.  Some people have accused us  of

moving too fast.  MPs like Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Leong

Horn  Kee have said that changes are not radical  enough,

and  more  could have been done.  We have left  no  stone

unturned.   We  decided where we needed to  make  radical

changes,  where modifications are needed,  and  where  we

should  leave things as they are, at least for  the  time

being.   The changes are more significant than they  look

because we have deliberately prepared people for them and

introduced  them carefully.  It was our  purpose  not  to

shock  people.  If you are astonished, if you are amazed,

if  you are not prepared, that means we have not done our

job well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are big changes - tax structure, committed to

reduce  the corporate and top personal tax rate  to  20%;

broaden  the tax base with the increase in the goods  and

services tax.  The CPF system - to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>

make  significant shifts, to balance our retirement needs

and  maintain labour market flexibility and  to  lay  the

foundation  for  changes to be phased in gradually.   And

land  -  to  lay  down the principle  to  maximise  value

creation  from our land resources as well as to keep  the

cost   of   land  competitive.   So,  we  have   done   a

considerable  amount, but maybe we still  have  not  gone

fast enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people, however, have found the changes

unsettling  and  the pace too fast.  Some  union  leaders

have  told  me, "Why do we have to move so  quickly?   My

members  cannot  catch  up."   We  are  making  so   many

initiatives.  They have not even read about them  in  the

newspapers.  But, in fact, maybe we need to go faster, as

the  world  is  changing quickly and our competitors  are

forging ahead.  As Khaw Boon Wan pointed out, we have  to

move  faster than China and the other emerging economies.

It would be even more painful later if change is not done

soon  enough.   Therefore, everyone has  to  put  in  the

effort  to  adjust,  adapt and venture  so  that  we  can

progress  as  a  nation.  The Government will  guide  and

facilitate  the structural shifts we need  to  make,  but

success  ultimately  depends on the  resourcefulness  and

resilience of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are on the right track. The ERC recommendations

are  the  result of the collective effort  of  many  good

minds  committed to Singapore.  We cannot control  events

in the short term and we may have to make tactical shifts

along the way, but the strategic thrusts are correct and,

in   time,   they  will  generate  growth  and  transform

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked what is the difference

between the 1986 Economic Committee and today's ERC.  The

world  has changed and so has Singapore.  Those were  the

days  before  the Internet and biotech.  Those  were  the

days  before  China and India joined the  global  economy

with   their   low  labour  cost  and  highly   motivated

workforces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our per capita income has more than

doubled  from  $14,000 in 1985 to $37,000 in  2001.   Our

standards of living

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>

have  improved  substantially for the  vast  majority  of

Singaporeans.   Yes, we are tightening our  belts.   But,

compared  to  1985, the last recession, in fact,  we  are

much better off.  Most significantly, the quality of  our

housing  has  improved.  Then, we had  41,000  households

living in 5-room flats.  Now, we have 194,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education level of our workforce has gone up.

Then,  graduates  were 5% of our workforce.   Today,  the

number  has more than trebled to 17%.  So, the world  has

changed, and Singapore has changed too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Committee's recommendations in 1986

laid  the  basis for more than a decade of growth,  which

ended with the Asian crisis.  And this ERC Report in 2003

aims  to  chart the way forward over the next  decade  of

intense global competition and knowledge driven growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we progress together, we will run into some old

challenges   in  new  forms,  like  cost  competitiveness

issues.   We will also meet totally new challenges,  like

the  emergence of China and India, the explosion  of  the

Internet  or  the  threat  of extremist  terrorism.   The

environment  and  competition facing us  today  are  much

tougher  than before, but we are also much stronger  than

we used to be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will be pro-jobs. We will help to

create jobs, more jobs, better jobs.  We will help  train

workers for the new jobs.  The civil service will be even

more   pro-business.   There  will  be  more   help   for

entrepreneurs to navigate the way through the  Government

agencies,  and to take off on their own.  We  will  bring

along  all Singaporeans on this journey.  Nobody will  be

left  behind.  Those who can must help themselves.  Those

who  cannot, who will be few, will be the focus of  help.

Above  all, we will be pro-Singaporeans, because this  is

our home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tough minds, warm hearts, strong spirits. With

these,  we can look forward to a bright future where  all

Singaporeans   share  in  the  fruits  of  our   success.

Together  as  a  nation, we will realise  our  vision  of

Singapore  becoming a leading global and  entrepreneurial

city, one of the best places

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>

in  Asia, and indeed in the world, in which we can  live,

work and grow.  [Applause].

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

seek clarification  from the Finance Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Be quick, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Finance Minister

referred to the CPI and said that I am a story teller.  I

would  like  to ask him whether he agrees that  the  CPI,

being  an aggregated index, does not tell the full  story

of  the cost of living, especially when there is a sudden

drop of income level.  If he agrees, then I think he  had

better listen to my story.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, is the Finance Minister saying that with

unemployment,  CPF cut and lower income, Singaporeans  do

not face a burden in cost of living?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, does the Finance Minister encounter cases in

his meet-the-people sessions of people who are unable  to

pay  utility bills, conservancy charges, telephone  bills

and  many other bills?   We just heard Dr Tan Cheng  Bock

who  told  this  House not long ago some of  the  stories

based on his experience.  Or perhaps people living in Ang

Mo  Kio GRC are much richer and do not ask for help,  and

thereby he is not aware of the problems.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,

the CPI is an average for the whole economy, covering all

income  groups.   But  we  also  have  figures  for   the

different income groups.  So, if incomes have gone  down,

you  can  see how different groups have been affected  in

terms of cost of living.  Do things cost more? The answer

is  that  things  do  not  cost  more.   There  are  some

variations, maybe +1%, maybe -1%.  But on the whole,  the

cost  of  living for all income groups in  Singapore  has

remained very stable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I fully acknowledge that times are

difficult,  that  we  have  to tighten  our  belts,  that

incomes are down, bonuses are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>

down.   And,  in some cases, net wealth is down,  because

your  property has gone down in value and you feel poorer

even if you have not sold the property.  But that is  not

the same as saying that the cost of living has gone up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I have cases, like any other MP, where

people  come  and look for help.  Maybe I get  more  than

other  MPs, because they think that if they come  to  me,

they  may get a bit more help.  But as I explained in  my

speech,  we will help them.  But the way to help them  is

not  for Singapore Power to forgive their utility  bills.

It  is  for  the  CCCs, the CDCs, to get  to  know  them,

understand  their  problems, find out  why  they  have  a

problem, and if they deserve help, to give help.  But  if

they  do not deserve help, then you have to tell them  to

look after themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if somebody comes and says, "I can't

pay  my  utility  bills", and it turns  out  he  owns  an

airconditioner.    You  tell  him   to   turn   off   the

airconditioner and he says, "I only turn it on  for  four

hours  a night."  And he has a handphone.  How much  help

should I give him?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if a woman comes along - she has

tried  her  best and the husband is not there,   she  has

children and they are studying and trying their  best  in

school   -   then I will go the extra mile to help  them.

So,  I  think we need that sensitivity and not just  make

political  capital in order to collect selfish  political

dividends from people's sufferings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the

Government for the financial year 1st April, 2003 to 31st
