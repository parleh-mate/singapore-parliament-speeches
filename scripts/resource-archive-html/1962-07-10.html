<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister For Health And Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister For Health And Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency's permission

to signify his recommendation for this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second Time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1960, provided

in section 83 that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The President shall, once in each year, furnish to

the  Minister  for  presentation to  the  Legislative

Assembly a report on the working of the provisions of

this  Ordinance relating to the Court, to arbitration

and  to the registration of collective agreements and

of  any other provisions of the Ordinance in relation

to  which he considers it appropriate to report,  and

in  particular the extent to which the objects of the

Ordinance  have  been achieved and any considerations

or circumstances which have prevented or hindered the

achievement of these objects.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President of the Industrial Arbitration

Court  has  submitted his report for the period  15th

September, 1960, to 31st December, 1961, and this has

been published in Paper S. 4 of 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of his report, the President said

(paragraph 33 of his Report):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A year of operation has shown that the Ordinance is

in   the   main  an  effective  Legislative  measure.

However, during the course of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



the Court's work it was discovered that some sections

of  the Ordinance could be amended to achieve greater

clarity and to avoid certain anomalies arising out of

its application.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 34:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You are aware that as early as the 25th January,

1961, I suggested certain amendments to the Ordinance

and   that,  at  intervals,  I  consulted  with  your

predecessor,  with  the  State Advocate-General  and,

later,  with  the Minister for Law  with  a  view  to

clarify  and  strengthen  certain  sections  of   the

Ordinance and for the removal of anomalies.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 35:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I was mainly concerned on the one hand, with the

heavy burden of work, and on the other hand, with  my

desire  to  speed  up proceedings. I  also  expressed

certain  views  on  the  two panels  of  members,  on

representation before the Court, on the  notification

of trade disputes, the registration and certification

of agreements, representation in negotiations and, at

a later stage, on the review of cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 36:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Correspondence and discussions on these matters

continued  between  the  Court  and  the  appropriate

authority  throughout the year, and  I  am  satisfied

that our discussions were most fruitful.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 37:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister for Law, with your concurrence, early

in  1962,  is to suggest to the Legislative  Assembly

certain amendments to the Ordinance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 38:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am aware of the nature of the amendments. They

cover   nearly   all  points  on   which   I   sought

clarification during the year.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill has been drafted on the

representations of the President and has been  agreed

to  with  him.  The main purpose of the  Bill  is  to

enable   the   setting  up  of  a  second  Industrial

Arbitration Court to deal with the increasing work of

the  Court.  This has been considered necessary,  not

only   because  of  the  disputes,  which  have  been

referred  to  the  Court  for arbitration,  but  also

because  of the large number of collective agreements

presented for certification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends the definition of

"Court"  and the definition of "President" to provide

for  the  setting up of more than one Court  and  the

appointment of a Deputy President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the appointment of

a Deputy President. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for

the remuneration and allowances payable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



to   him  and  gives  him  the  same  protection  and

immunities  in  the performance of his functions  and

duties as the President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill provides that for the purpose

of constituting the employee panel for the Court, the

Minister may invite nominations from trade unions  of

employees  instead of from the Singapore Trade  Union

Congress, which has ceased to exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Court will be required to take

the oath of allegiance and the judicial oath. This is

provided in clause 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill will enable the Minister to

intervene and direct a compulsory conference  in  all

cases  of  trade disputes. The power of certification

of  collective agreements is proposed to be given  to

the  Court.  But  for this purpose the  Court  is  to

consist of the President. Clauses 8 to 14 of the Bill

provide for this. The purpose of this is to emphasise

that   the  act  of  certification  is  the  act   of

the Court and to equate the status of a collective agreement to that of an

award. It will also enable proceedings to be taken to punish persons who are

guilty of offences against the Court or contempt against the Court as provided

in sections 65 and 66 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance. The Court is given

power to refuse to certify a collective agreement if it is of opinion that the

memorandum of agreement does not set out satisfactorily or adequately the terms

of the collective agreement between the parties.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill further provides that it will be an offence for the person or a trade

union to fail or neglect to bring a collective agreement or any of the terms of

such agreement to the notice of the Court in

accordance  with the provisions of the Ordinance,  or

to  deliver to the Registrar a memorandum which  does

not   contain   all  the  terms  of  the   collective

agreement. It is also made an offence for a person or

a  trade  union to enter into a collective agreement,

which is specified to continue in force for less than

eighteen months, or more than three years, and  which

cannot  be  registered under the  provisions  of  the

Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these amendments is to provide that

all  collective  agreements  shall  comply  with  the

provisions  of the Ordinance and shall be  registered

under the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill makes it an offence for a

person  or trade union to enter into negotiations  in

relation  to  industrial matters  otherwise  than  in

accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance.  The

purpose  of  this is to ensure that all  negotiations

relating  to  industrial  matters  are  conducted  in

accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance.  The

definition  of "industrial matters" has been  amended

so  as  to exclude individual agreements or contracts

of  service between employer and employee relating to

the   employment  or  terms  of  employment  of  such

employee. This is provided for in clause 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prohibition against representations and

negotiations is extended to all trade disputes.  This

is provided for in clause 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill provides that referees may be

appointed only from persons included in the  list  of

names  maintained by the Minister. It  also  provides

for an appeal from the decision of the referee to the

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 provides that no award or decision or

order  of  the  Court or the President or  a  referee

shall  be challenged or be subject to review  by  any

court.  The present position under which the decision

of  referees  may  be challenged in court,  with  the

result  that  costs  might  be  awarded  against  the

referees,  has created difficulties as  referees  who

have been nominated have refused to serve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been referred to the Bar Committee, but

I  regret  to say that there are certain  matters  on

which    there    appears   to   be   a   fundamental

misunderstanding of the functions of the court,  with

the  result that certain provisions of the Bill  have

not  been approved by the Bar Committee. The  purpose

of  the Industrial Arbitration Court is not to decide

disputed questions of law, but to register collective

agreements which are made between the parties  or  to

make agreements for employers and employees when they

cannot  reach  agreement on  their  own  account.  It

cannot therefore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



be  treated like an ordinary court of justice and  it

is  in  recognition of this fact that  the  Ordinance

provides that the Court shall not be bound to act  in

a   formal   manner  or  be  bound  by  the  Evidence

Ordinance,  but shall act according to  equity,  good

conscience  and the substantial merits  of  the  case

without regard to technicalities and legal forms.  It

is for this reason, too, that legal representation is

restricted. It will be disastrous if the work of  the

Court   could  be  delayed  by  arguments  on   legal

technicalities  or  questions of law.  The  Ordinance

itself  provides for a summary decision on  questions

of  law  by  reference to the State Advocate-General.

This  might not be perfect. It has at least the merit

of  having  a quick decision without long  drawn  out

legal  arguments and costs. All this shows  that  the

processes,  the  purpose  and  the  orders   of   the

Industrial  Arbitration Court cannot be  regarded  as

those  of courts of justice. The Court is, as I  have

said,  concerned with the registration of  collective

agreements made between the parties and the making of

agreements  for  employers and  employees  when  they

cannot  reach  agreement on their own  account.  Once

this  is  accepted, I feel it will be wrong to  allow

appeals from such agreements and awards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has already been accepted that the parties

should not be represented by advocates and solicitors

in negotiations under the Ordinance. This has, on the

whole,  worked very well in practice and the  parties

have been able to deal with the substantial merits of

their  claims  without regard to  technicalities  and

legal forms. As it is the view of the Government that

all   negotiations  should  be  conducted  under  the

provisions  of  the  Ordinance, it  is  logical  that

prohibition  against legal representation  should  be

extended  to all negotiations relating to  industrial

matters. The amendment to section 21 of the Ordinance

by  clause 7 of the Bill will enable a relaxation  to

be   made   in   the   general  prohibition   against

participation  in negotiations in industrial  matters

by advocates and solicitors. Where the Minister feels

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



the   presence  or  assistance  of  an  advocate  and

solicitor may be useful, he may direct such  advocate

and  solicitor  to attend for compulsory  conferences

under section 21 of the Ordinance. This was agreed in

a meeting which I held with the last committee of the

Singapore Bar Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the transfer of power of certification

of  collective agreements from the President  to  the

Court,  the purpose of it is to equate the certifying

of agreements with the making of awards and to enable

proceedings to be taken where offences are  committed

in  relation  to the Court and in the  case  of  contempts  of the Court under sections 65 and 66 of  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill

which  the Minister has moved amending the Industrial

Relations Ordinance contains certain provisions  that

will  bring  about significant changes in  industrial

relations in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, it will be remembered that the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance was  drawn  up  after

thorough  discussions  with  the  representatives  of

workers and trade unions. It is also well known  that

certain   provisions  in  the  Industrial   Relations

Ordinance  were themselves of a controversial  nature

and the overall Bill presented to this House was,  in

fact,  a  compromise Bill which contained as much  of

the   unions'  views  as  the  Government  considered

possible, and the unions agreed to certain provisions

as   a  general  compromise,  provisions  which   the

Government had advocated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be remembered perhaps that I was one

of  the  Members  of  this House  who  supported  the

Industrial Relations Ordinance. But that support  was

a  conditional support. I recall that I  did  clearly

say  that if it were the Lim Yew Hock Government then

proposing  the  Industrial Relations Ordinance,  then

there   would  be  pickets  outside  the  Legislative

Assembly  House. I said that the unions were prepared

to accept the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



Industrial  Relations Ordinance as it was  introduced

here  because  the workers and unions had  confidence

then  in  the Government and they believed  that  the

Ordinance would be put to use in a manner that  would

bring  great advantage to the unions and  workers  in

the    process   of   collective   bargaining.   Sir,

unfortunately,  experience  has  only  brought  about

disappointment  to  many  unions.  I  notice  in  the

amendment that the intention of the Government  seems

to be to provide another Court. I must say whether it

is  to be one Court or two Courts is not as important

as to what purpose these Arbitration Courts are to be

put to use. Sir, if the Arbitration Courts are to  be

looked  upon  by workers and employers  as  political

institutions of the Government, and if workers are to

regard  them merely as instruments of the P.A.P. and

even   if   employers  are  to  look  upon  them   as

instruments  of  the Government for taking  decisions

which are politically advantageous to the Government,

then  I  say  that one, two or three Courts  are  not

going to help industrial relations in any way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this does not mean that the Barisan Sosialis

are  against the amendment to provide for  more  than

one Court. We do realise that the present Arbitration

Court  is not able to cope with the cases. I am  told

that  some cases which were referred as early as late

last  year  are  still  to be  heard  by  the  Court.

Therefore,  in  principle, we have  no  objection  to

having  two or three Courts as the case may  be.  But

what  we  are  against is the use of the  Arbitration

Court  for political purposes. Sir, I do not have  to

go  into  examples  to  quote what  some  unions  and

employers have said about the Arbitration Court. I am

quite certain that the Minister for Health and Law is

aware  and I am quite certain that Members, generally

in the Government Benches, are aware of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Arbitration Court was appointed, it

was  stated  that  the purpose of the  Court  was  to

assist   in   industrial  relations.  The  Government

statement and the statement of the President  of  the

Court made at the opening of the Court, and even  the

Government manifesto made it quite clear that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



the   Arbitration  Court  was  not  going   to   mean

compulsory  arbitration, that the  Arbitration  Court

was  not  going  to mean interference  in  industrial

relations. Sir, there have been cases, but  before  I

come  to  them, clause 11 in page 4 of  the  amending

Bill  to  insert  a  new  section  to  the  Ordinance

provides  for  compulsory conciliation together  with

clause 7 in page 3. There have been cases in the past

where  the  Government  conciliation  machinery   had

thought   fit   to  interfere  in  legitimate   trade

disputes.  We  have  nothing whatsoever  against  the

Government  for  assisting  the  settlement   between

employers  and  employees. But  we  cannot  have  the

Government interfering in collective bargaining  when

it  is not called upon to interfere. We cannot accept

the  position  where  the Government  interfere  with

collective  bargaining to make political  capital.  I

need  only  quote,  Sir, the notorious  case  of  the

Government intervention in the Shaw dispute.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is important that if the Government

want  to  honour  what  they  said  in  the  election

manifesto and what the Court President and  what  the

Government  themselves stated at the opening  of  the

Court, that the actual purpose of the Court is to try

and  assist  both  unions and employers  in  bringing

about  a  settlement, then they must  try  and  avoid

unnecessary  interference  in  trade  disputes.  That

again,  I  believe, is well known to  Members.  Today

when  collective agreements are drawn up and sent  to

the  Court for certification, even in the wording  of

the  agreements, quite a lot of fuss is made by  some

people  in  responsible positions in the  Arbitration

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know whether the Minister for Health

and  Law will agree with me that it is necessary when

drawing  up collective agreements to have phraseology

that  is acceptable to the workers and the employers.

It  does not necessarily mean that the legal form  of

wording  is  necessarily understood and  accepted  by

workers  and by employers. Sir, it has been found  in

practice that a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



good  agreement  is  an agreement that  is  simple  and

straightforward    with   no    legal    jargon.    But

unfortunately,   in  practice,  we   have   found   the

Arbitration Court wanting to change "shall"  to  "will"

and  "but" to "and", and "a" to "b", and so  on.  I  am

sure,  Sir,  if the Minister wishes to be  serious,  he

will  agree  with  me that this is  not  the  important

criterion  for  wanting to certify an agreement.  There

have   been  cases  where  I  have  myself  been   told

personally  that because I have refused to  change  one

word  "will", the agreement must not be certified. Sir,

in  the  principal  Ordinance,  the  President  of  the

Arbitration  Court  can  only  refuse  to  certify   an

agreement  if  he  considers it to  be  against  public

interest. I notice there is an amendment moved here - and

basically that is maintained - viz, clause 8, at  page  3

of the Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Court may in its discretion refuse to certify a

memorandum  delivered  under subsection  (1)  of  this

section  if  it is of opinion that it is  not  in  the

public interest...'.



<br><br>And  principally  the  position is  that  only  if  the

Arbitration Court considers that a collective agreement

is  not  in  the interests of the public, then  it  can

refuse  to  certify a collective agreement.  But,  Sir,

there have been cases where collective agreements  have

not been certified for various other reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I have to say in respect of the various

clauses  I  would rather reserve until we come  to  the

Committee  stage. But what I do want to  say.  Sir,  in

conclusion is that this amendment Bill is being  rushed

through in quite some haste. We in the Barisan Sosialis

feel   that  the  unions  must  be  consulted  on  this

amendment before it is adopted. Thus, Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is  a  fair and reasonable suggestion that  we  are

making. The principal Ordinance was drawn up only after

consultation with the unions and their representatives.

And   I  say  that  the  amendments,  particularly  the

amendments  which  would in my view  bring  about  very

significant changes - for example, changes to provide for

compulsory  conciliation which is just one  step  below

compulsory  arbitration - we have reason to believe,  Mr

Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Government are, in  fact,  thinking  of

compulsory arbitration. We feel that amendments of this

nature  and of this significance are matters that  will

affect  radically all trade unions, all  employers  and

every  aspect  of  industrial relations  in  Singapore.

Therefore, we think it is only fair that the Government

arrange  to have proper consultation with trade  unions

and their representatives before they seek to pass this

Bill.



<br><br>2.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  are one or two points on which I wish to address

the  House. If I may say so, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  would

like  to  deal  with what I consider to  be  the  legal

aspects of this Bill, and my colleague, the Member  for

Cairnhill, will deal with what may be called the  trade

union aspect of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the Member for Thomson that the

purpose of moving the original Bill was, as he says, to

assist  industrial  relations  in  Singapore.  You  may

recollect,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that when that  Bill  was

brought  into  the  House  originally,  there   was   a

difficult situation prevailing in the industrial world,

a  situation that was tending to upset the  economy  of

the  country.  And  therefore it  became  necessary  to

introduce the Bill in order to bring some stability  in

industrial relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The justification for this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir,

from  my  point of view is this: the employer  and  the

employee as a result of this legislation would be  able

beforehand  to  know  where either  stands  in  matters

related to industrial disputes. So that unless there is

a  firm  base on which both parties to a dispute  could

work  on and unless that firm base continues throughout

the  dispute  and also throughout the  hearing  of  the

dispute  in the Court, we could have a situation  where

either party could have any confidence in this law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I wish to bring up arising out of the

point  I have now made, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this:  the

first   base - the   first  inescapable   base - on   which

industrial  relations can be regulated is the  base  of

the law. Now, both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



parties  to a dispute must clearly understand  the

law  affecting an industrial dispute; and how that

legal position will be effected in a dispute as  a

result of a decision by the Industrial Arbitration

Court  is a matter which concerns both parties  to

the   dispute.  Mr  Speaker,  I  agree  with  the

Minister  for Law that the Industrial  Court  must

have  a  great deal of latitude and that  it  must

have  a  great deal of room in which to manoeuvre - if  I  may  use that phrase, and I use  it  in  no

disrespectful sense - in order that industrial peace

might be maintained. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, if  in

the  latitude given to this Court it violates  the

law of the land, then that Court is bringing about

a situation in Singapore when neither party to the

dispute  can  have  any confidence  in  the  Court

because  neither party will know  what  the  Court

will do next, if it is not firmly anchored to  the

base  of  the  law.  To make my point  clear,  Mr

Speaker, I will refer to two cases which the Court

decided.  I think one is the case of the newspaper

known  as  the  Kerala Bandu  where  there  was  a

dispute between an employee and the employer,  the

newspaper. So far as I could read the judgment  of

the  Court,  it  held that the dismissal  of  this

employee  was  justified.  Having  held  that  the

dismissal of the employee was justified, the Court

then went on to order six months' compensation  to

the  employee whose dismissal was justified.  Now,

the  Court cannot have it both ways, Mr  Speaker,

Sir, If  the dismissal was justified, no question

of  compensation arises. That would be the  normal

decision in a Court. Now, is the Industrial  Court

then to be allowed to set itself above the law  of

the  country and while holding that the  dismissal

was  justified,  yet  to  say,  "I  feel  you  the

employer    should    give   him    six    months'

compensation"?  If it says six  months,  it  could

well  say  two  years. What point  does  one  then

reach,  Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Industrial  Court

is  allowed  arbitrarily to flout the law  of  the

land? Might I mention just one other case? I think

it  was  in a dispute between a transport  company

and  its  employees  where  the  Industrial  Court

ordered  that  the transport company  should  take

back the employees whose case the Court had tried.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first principle of law in a contract of

employment  is  that  there  can  be  no  specific

performance of a contract of employment.  That  is

the base of the law on which we all securely rest.

If  the Industrial Court is allowed to upset  that

base, I ask you, Mr Speaker, Sir, what confidence

can  there  be  in the employing  public?  In  our

economy  the employing public is just as important

as  that  section  of the public  which  is  being

employed.  Unless  both of them  know  what  their

rights  and liabilities are under the law  of  the

country, and how the Industrial Court will  honour

the law of the country, it will be impossible,  in

my  submission, Mr Speaker, Sir, to  establish  a

state of affairs where both parties could have any

confidence in this Court. That brings  me  to  the

present Bill by virtue of which the Government  is

now seeking to give this Court even greater powers

and   greater  latitude  by  trying  to  make   it

absolutely   impossible,  in  so  far   as   human

ingenuity can, to take any dispute from this Court

to  the  High  Court. It appears  that  there  are

certain  loopholes  under the  existing  Ordinance

through  which  the  decisions of  the  Industrial

Court  were taken to our normal Courts  and  as  a

result   of   which  certain  decisions   of   the

Industrial  Court have been queried. Some  of  the

amendments   here  are  intended  to  plug   these

loopholes.  I do seriously ask the Government  to

consider  this: whether it is their intention,  by

giving  the Industrial Court this immunity by  not

allowing  any  appeal to any  other  tribunal,  to

enable  the  Industrial Court  to  go  on  such  a

rampage as to over-ride the law of the land and to

formulate their own laws in making decisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second point is the

question   of   referees.   Under   the   existing

Ordinance, it is possible now for the President of

the  Industrial Court to be named a referee either

under  a collective agreement under section 23  of

the  Ordinance  or  under an  award  made  by  the

Court - where  either the parties privately  amongst

themselves  could  nominate the President  of  the

Court  to  be a referee or the Court itself  could

nominate  the President to be a referee.  Now  the

situation was reached where the referee's decision

was challenged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



and  the referee himself sat as a court on his own

decision - a  situation highly undesirable,  however

much  one may contend that it is quite legal under

the  provisions of the existing Ordinance.  I  see

that  the Government is taking steps to alter  the

existing  law  by making it not possible  for  the

President  or the Deputy President  to  sit  as  a

referee. I welcome that, because it is contrary to

the  accepted principle of law that a  person  who

makes  a  decision  should be allowed  to  sit  in

judgment on an appeal from his decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do draw the attention of the Minister to

this.  Under section 23 - these are matters on which

I  will  elaborate when we come to the clauses  in

Committee - it   would  appear  from   the   general

phrasing of the Industrial Relaxations (Amendment)

Bill  now before us that the right of appeal  from

referees  appointed  under  section  23   of   the

Ordinance  is  not the same as under  the  section

which  provides for an appeal from a referee under

a Court award.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point the Minister was making was that a

collective agreement will now go to the Court  for

approval,  meaning  the President  and  two  other

persons  appointed from the panels instead  of  as

now  to  the President alone, and thereby implying

that  the position is being made much better  than

it  is today. But what he gives with the left hand

he  takes  back  with the right by moving  another

amendment  to  section 55 of the  Ordinance  which

says  that the powers of the Court under  sections

23,  52,  53  and  54 of this Ordinance  shall  be

exercisable  by  the  Court  constituted  by   the

President alone. So although he says under section

23  the  agreements will be approved by the Court,

but  under  section 55 he brings in  an  amendment

whereby  the  President acting  under  section  55

means the Court itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do suggest to the Minister that wherever a

referee  has  given  a  decision, that  referee's

decision should go to an Industrial Court composed

of  three persons and not to the President  alone.

And  I  make  this further point. That any  appeal

from the decision of an Industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



Court  on  a  point of law should be treated  like

that  of an appeal from the normal courts  of  the

country.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the most

significant phrase of the speech of the Member for

Thomson  is this, "That the Industrial Arbitration

Court  is  made an instrument of the P.A.P."  When

the  Industrial Relations Bill was debated in this

House  in  1960 at that time there  was  only  the

genuine opposition of eight Members - I did say that

it  would  appear  that what  the  Government  was

trying  to  do was to make this law to  serve  the

P.A.P.  At that time, the 13 great Barisan Members

who  sat  on the other side of the House ridiculed

my  allegations. They laughed at me. They were not

content with that. They even cried out that had it

been  a Lim Yew Hock Government, such a Bill would

not  have  been  introduced  by  that  Government.

Strange to say, Sir, the shoe must now be pinching

the  foot of the Member for Thomson for him to use

the   same   words  as  I  used.  The   Industrial

Arbitration Court is intended to be an  instrument

of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Member for Farrer Park,

has  pointed  out the various points of  law.  But

what  I want to add now is just a little bit  from

the trade union angle. One thing that struck me as

being funny is that it is now the intention of the

Government, by the proposed amendment, to wipe out

the T.U.C. of which they were singing high praises

in  1960. They said that the T.U.C. was wonderful,

a  genuine organisation for workers, and  that  it

had  the support of the Government, and therefore,

it  must  be given due recognition. Now  it  seems

that the T.U.C. is to be taken out of the picture.

I  cannot  understand why, because, as  far  as  I

know - and   I  may  be  wrong,  I  am  subject   to

correction - the T.U.C. is still a legal entity.  It

has  not  been  dissolved in accordance  with  the

Constitution  of the T.U.C. It was  said  to  have

been  dissolved just because the Secretary-General

of  the T.U.C. had a few words with his colleague,

the  Minister  for Labour and Law, at  that  time,

along  these lines. "Things are getting dangerous.

The   Communists  are  getting  control.  We  must

dissolve the T.U.C." So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



said  Mr  Kandasamy,  the Secretary-General;  and

there  was the Minister for Labour and Law saying,

"Yes,  we  must dissolve the T.U.C." And  yet  the

T.U.C. is  today a legal entity. I am subject  to

correction. If I am wrong, the Minister  will,  of

course,  point out my mistakes. But as  far  as  I

know,  the T.U.C. is still a legal entity. Now  it

would seem that the great heroes of the T.U.C. - the

Ten  Tall  Men - plus the tallest of them  all,  the

Secretary-General, are now divided into two camps,

the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis. The T.U.C. is

no  longer  functioning, although  the  T.U.C. is

still  a registered body. I do hope that when  the

Minister asks for nomination from the trade  union

employees  he must take due note that  the  unions

which  will  be  asked to nominate  employees  are

genuine unions and they should not try to consider

it  from the point of view whether it is a  P.A.P.

union   or   a  Barisan  Sosialis  union   or   an

independent union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister for Health and Law were to

continue  the  evil practice that the  P.A.P. has

been  following for the past two and a half years,

before  the  disintegration of  the  P.A.P., life

would  be  unhappy  for all. It  could  not  solve

industrial  disputes  in  that  way.  It  is   not

possible.  In fact, I did say that the  Bill  they

were  introducing in 1960 would not help to  bring

peace  in the industrial field. In fact, it  would

encourage more industrial unrest. It has happened.

And now the Government, having learnt the error of

their   ways,  have  seen  fit  to  introduce   an

amendment Bill to help correct the mischief  which

they deliberately perpetrated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment Bill is important. When the

original  Bill was debated, we did urge  upon  the

Government that it should be referred to a  Select

Committee  because at almost the last minute,  the

Government introduced 50 rush amendments. We  were

defeated because the Barisan Sosialis were on  the

other  side and they were at that time in  cahoots

with  the  P.A.P. But now, although  the  amending

Bill  is such a small Bill, yet the effect of  the

amendments to be proposed is great.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge upon the Government, in order to

bring  a  healthier atmosphere to  the  industrial

field  and to give the trade unions an opportunity

to give their views on the proposed amendments, to

refer this Bill to Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

will  be  very  brief.  I am  conscious  that  the

Singapore  Bar  Committee  has  made  considerable

recommendations with reference to this Bill and  I

find   that  its  recommendations  have  not  been

considered.  I  am  sure  that  the  trade   union

movement  has  had no opportunity  to  study  this

Bill - it   having  been  sprung  on   us   at   the

commencement of this referendum debate - and I  rise

merely to support the Member for Cairnhill in  his

plea  that  important though it is that we  should

have  an  early  second Court, it is  nevertheless

even   more  important,  in  the  light   of   the

amendments proposed, that this Bill should be sent

to Select Committee, and that the trade unions and

others interested be given an opportunity to  make

their representations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will first deal

with  the  questions  raised  by  the  Member  for

Thomson  just  now. He has gained  the  impression

that,  by the amendment we have proposed in clause

11  of  the  Bill, the Government are  seeking  to

introduce   what   he   has   termed   "compulsory

conciliation". Clause 11 of the Bill introduces  a

new  section  27A in the Ordinance.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  I  do not follow how he could have got  that

impression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I did say clause 7 of the Bill on page

3.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I thought the hon. Member referred to

the new section 27A in clause 11. Which clause  is

it to which the hon. Member referred?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I referred to clause 7 of the amending

Bill  which  seeks  to  amend  subsection  (1)  of

section 21 of the principal Ordinance which would,

in effect, be compulsory conciliation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> If the hon. Member is referring to the

amendment  to  section  21 of the principal  Ordinance,

there  would  really be no point for  me  to  speak  on

clause   11   now.  There  has  been  no   interference

whatsoever  with the procedure laid down in respect  of

collective bargaining in Part III of the Bill. Although

this  procedure  is referred to in section  21  of  the

Ordinance, it was never followed in the sense that  the

Minister  could  always  compel compulsory  conferences

even   if   the  procedures  set  out  in  the  earlier

provisions of this part of the Bill were not  followed,

and   the   amendment  gives  effect  to  the  existing

practice. That is all it does. It was found in practice

that  there  were  unions  which  did  not  follow  the

procedures  laid  down in this part  of  the  Bill  and

circumstances  arose  where the Minister  had  to  call

compulsory conferences. In those circumstances, if  you

will  look  at  the  wording  of  section  21  of   the

Ordinance, the  Minister would legally  be  restrained

from directing persons to attend conferences where  the

procedures were not followed. But, in fact, he did call

compulsory conferences. And this amendment gives effect

to  that  practice.  I cannot see how  the  Member  for

Thomson  can say that the Government are intending,  by

this   amendment,  to  introduce  what  he  has  termed

"compulsory conciliation".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point he made was that we were amending

the provisions with regard to collective bargaining  to

make  it  more  difficult for the unions to  get  their

collective agreements registered. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it

was  found  in  practice that the unions were  entering

into  collective agreements with employers, and on  the

sideline entering into other agreements which were  not

shown  in the agreements which they brought before  the

Court   for  registration.  This  amendment  has   been

introduced to put a stop to those malpractices.  Surely

the  Member for Thomson cannot object to this amendment

in  view of his knowledge that there were such sideline

agreements  being  entered into between  employers  and

unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on his third point, the Member for Thomson said

that  there  must be consultation before any amendments

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



introduced. We agreed clause 83 of this Bill  with  the

"Ten Tall Men" in the former T.U.C. It is provided here

that  amendments should be made in accordance with  the

observations  on  the working of the Ordinance  by  the

President of the Court, and this amending Ordinance  is

introduced  in  consequence  of  the  Report  that  the

Government  have  received from the  President  of  the

Industrial  Court on the working of the Court  for  the

period 15th September. 1960, to 31st December, 1961. So

where   then  is  there  any  justification   for   his

contention  that there must be consultation  before  an

amending Bill like this is introduced?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me deal with the comments of the Member for

Farrer  Park. He said that there must be a legal  basis

for all judicial determinations. He has quoted the case

where  the Court found that the dismissal of a  certain

employee was justified and it still proceeded to  award

compensation.  He has also drawn the attention  of  the

House  to another case where an employee in a transport

company  was dismissed and the employer was obliged  to

reinstate  him in employment. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  those

are the very functions of this Court. It is provided in

section  56 of the Ordinance that the Court  in  making

its decisions



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`. . . shall act according to equity, good conscience

and  the substantial merits of the case without  regard

to technicalities and legal forms.'



<br><br>It  is  because of these considerations that the  Court

can  make  such orders. The Court is able to look  into

all  the  circumstances of the case  and  then  make  a

determination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of referees, we have realised that it

would  be  against  good legal practice  to  allow  the

President of the Court to be a referee in an award  and

for  him  then  as  the  President  of  the  Court   to

adjudicate on the award that he has made; and for  that

purpose these amendments have been made. In the case of

referees,  whether they are appointed by the collective

agreement itself or whether a referee is designated  in

an award, when he makes a decision,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



and  if  there is an appeal, it would have to  be  the

Court under section 40 of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for the submissions of the Member for Anson. Of

course,  he  knows  very little  about  this.  I  will,

however,  tell him that I held many meetings  with  the

Bar Committee on the amendments that we propose to this

Bill. They insisted that (here should be an appeal on a

point  of law to the Court of Appeal from the decisions

of  this Court. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have indicated just

now, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, when the

Member  for  Anson  was  not present,  why  it  is  not

possible for us to allow an appeal on the facts from an

award to a Court of Appeal.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not on facts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On facts or on mixed questions of facts

and  law  to the Court of Appeal. That is not possible

for   this  reason,  that  the  processes  are   quite

different.  The  common law, as we know  it,  enforces

private  agreements  between the parties.  The  common

law,  as  we  know  it,  never enforces  a  collective

agreement as such. Under the procedures of this Court,

the  parties  make  collective agreements  which  they

proceed  to  register.  If they  fail  to  make  these

agreements, it is this third party which is designated

the  Court which makes the agreements for them.  Under

that  procedure, it is not possible for points of  law

to  arise  in  the making of the agreement.  For  that

reason,  it is not possible for there to be an appeal,

from an award of the Court to the Court of Appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope I have adequately explained

to  the  Members  of  the House the  reasons  for  the

amendments to this Bill. I would say that we  are  not

attempting  any major revisions of this  Ordnance.  We

are  only  introducing improvements  which  have  been

suggested by the President of the Court on the working

of this tribunal for the past 18 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill.-[Mr Byrne].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<br><br>3.31 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand

part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on clause 2 (b), the

definition  of "industrial matters" is being  amended.

Sir,  in the principal Ordinance, "industrial matters"

means  "matters  pertaining  to  the  relaxations   of

employers and employees which are connected  with  the

employment   or  non-employment  or   the   terms   of

employment  or the conditions of work of any  person."

Now,   this  amendment,  Sir,  seeks  to  insert   the

exclusion   "but  shall  not  include  any  individual

agreement or contract of service between employer  and

employee  relating  to  the  employment  or  terms  of

employment of such employee". It appears to me that if

this  exclusion is inserted, it may very  well  affect

the  unions in their industrial relaxations  with  the

employers.  For instance, it may be that  an  employer

can  have an individual contract with an employee  who

may  be  eligible  to  join a  trade  union  and  such

contract  can  contain terms which may  be  considered

unsatisfactory. It does appear to me, if such  a  case

should  arise,  that the union will -  be  denied  the

right  to  negotiate on that issue with  the  employer

because  that  will not come within the definition  of

"industrial matters". I would like to ask the Minister

to  clarify this, Sir, If the Minister can  assure  us

that  this will not be the case, then we will have  no

objection to this amendment. But it does appear to me,

as  I  say,  that  there is every  possibility  of  an

employer  drawing  up a contract of  service  with  an

employee on unsatisfactory terms and then refusing  to

negotiate  with the union on such terms, because  such

terms do not come within the definition of "industrial

matters".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all that the amendment

does  is  to  shut  out  from the  provisions  of  this

Ordinance  any individual agreement of service  between

an  employer and an employee which does not  concern  a

union.  The Member for Thomson has not looked carefully

at  section  49  of the Industrial Relations  Ordinance

wherein  it is provided that an employee, bound  by  an

award, may   recover  in  any  court   of   competent

jurisdiction any amount which he is entitled to be paid

by  way  of wages or otherwise in accordance  with  the

award. An award, Mr Speaker, is both an award made  by

the  Court  and  the  collective  agreement  which   is

registered  with the Court. So that it is not  possible

for  employers  to  use this amendment  to  enter  into

individual   contracts  of  service   with   individual

employees  so  as  to  defeat  the  purposes  of   this

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 5 stand part of the

Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, clause 5 is a very significant

amendment.  Sir,  in the explanatory  statement  it  is

quite clearly stated that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The appointment of members to the employees panel is

to be selected by such trade unions of employees as may

be invited by the Minister.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment will mean the deletion of the

Singapore  Trades  Union Congress  from  the  principal

Ordinance and the substitution of the phrase  "a  trade

union  of employees". As is well known today, in  place

of  the  Singapore Trades Union Congress, there  is  no

central  organisation  of trade unions.  There  is  the

Singapore  Association  of  Trade  Unions,   which   is

awaiting registration, and the Singapore National Trade

Union Centre, which is also awaiting registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, Sir, the legal position of the

Singapore Trades Union Congress is still not clear.  As

the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



for  Cairnhill has already pointed out earlier on,  the

T.U.C. legally still functions. In fact, I believe  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Labour  in

this  House  itself once confirmed that the T.U.C. was

still  a legal body. While, on the one hand, the T.U.C.

legally exists, we have two other central organisations

seeking  registration. The Minister  proposes  to  have

appointments  made  to  the panel  of  the  Court  from

nominations  by  individual unions. If the  explanatory

statement  is  of any guide, it is quite  certain  that

such nominations will only be accepted from unions that

may  be  invited  by  the Minister.  Sir,  knowing  the

performance of P.A.P. Ministers in the past there is no

doubt  whatsoever  that it would  disregard  the  large

number of unions which do not come within the ambit  of

the  National  Trade Union Centre. There  is  no  doubt

again  that  the majority of the unions are within  the

S.A.T.U. group  of unions. If a proper  representative

panel  is to be had, then representation must be sought

from all unions irrespective of whether they belong  to

the  S.A.T.U. group of unions or the N.T.U.C. group  of

unions. I would like to ask the Minister, first of all,

whether  it is his intention to consult all  unions  or

just selected unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson

is  aware  of  section  6 (2) of  the  Ordinance  which

provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The employer panel and the employee panel shall each

consist of ten persons appointed by the Minister  whose

names shall be notified in the Gazette.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson was one of

the  Ten Tall Men when there was a T.U.C. As a Minister

I   had  written  to  the  T.U.C. umpteen  times   for

nominations from them. But the Ten Tall Men would  only

designate  four persons to serve on the employee  panel

of this Court. There have been differences amongst them

and  a  break-up of the trade union position, but these

four  persons are still members of the employee  panel.

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  we  would  be  glad  to  have   a

representative selection of the trade unionists  to  be

on  the  employee side of the Court.  I  can  give  the

Member  for  Thomson this assurance, if  it  is  really

necessary, that we would be glad to have nominees from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



these  respective groups on this Court.  He  knows  the

position,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. He is trying  to  make  a

political point, knowing it to be untrue, in this House

today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am glad the Minister is able to give an

assurance  on the lines that I have asked  for.  But  I

must   say   that  if  the  T.U.C. does  not  nominate

sufficient members to the panel, then it is as much the

fault  of  the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for  Culture as it is mine and any other member of  the

Secretariat.  Be  that as it may, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

want  to  ask  the  Minister what is the  necessity  in

wanting  to have the amendment made here to delete  the

Singapore  Trades Union Congress when the Trades  Union

Congress,  in  fact, at the moment exists  as  a  legal

body,  although the Secretariat of the T.U.C. does  not

function, although the Executive Council of the  T.U.C.

does  not function, because they have all read  in  the

papers   that  the  Minister  has  had  it   dissolved.

Nevertheless, it appears that the legal position of the

T.U.C. is such that it still functions. Surely if  the

Minister  wants to amend the provision to  provide  for

some other organisation instead of the Singapore Trades

Union  Congress, then it must necessarily be a  central

organisation  of trade unions. But if  he  just  simply

says  "a  trade union of employees" - Sir,  in  Singapore

there are on paper about 120 trade unions. About 30  of

them are ghost unions and about

90 of them are active. Surely the Minister is not going

to write to 90 trade unions in Singapore asking them to

nominate members to the panel.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we must accept the fact

that  the  T.U.C. is in a state of suspended animation.

Two  groups have broken away from it and set themselves

up  as  the  S.A.T.U. group and the National  group  of

trade unions. Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to accept  this

as  a  fact. We have had difficulty already in  getting

the  employee  panel for the Court that is  functioning

now.  We propose to introduce another Court. So we must

have more of these gentlemen to serve on these employee

panels.  We  are doing our best to get a representative

group  for  these panels. It is no use writing  to  the

T.U.C. when you know that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



there  will  be no response from that organisation.  We

are  practical people. We want to deal fairly with  the

unions. We know which unions have large followings, and

the  Minister should be left to exercise his discretion

to  write  to  the unions to submit their names.  I  am

telling  you, Mr Speaker, that some of these  powerful

unions  do not want to be associated with the  work  of

this Court. They want to keep outside and snipe at  it.

We have great difficulty in getting them to nominate to

the  panels  of  these Courts and  if  the  Member  for

Thomson  could urge them to serve in them we should  be

delighted indeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that the members of the Court here include

the  two  panel members. Could I ask the Minister  what

oath of allegiance and what judicial oath the Bill  has

in mind?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> These are oaths all magistrates and judges

take.  The President of the Court has taken both  these

oaths and we feel that it is right and proper that  the

members on these panels when they serve on these panels

understand  that they are there exercising  a  judicial

function.  If  they were to adopt a partisan  attitude,

then  there would be very little confidence in the work

of  the  Court. It is for that reason that  this  extra

provision has been added to section 13 of the principal

Ordinance.

that a trade dispute notified by the Commissioner under

section  18  or 20 of this Ordinance may be settled  by

conciliation or further conciliation, direct a  person,

whether  engaged in or connected with the trade dispute

or  not, to attend at a time and place specified in the

direction at a conference presided over by the Minister

or such person as the Minister directs.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is quite clearly provided here that the

Minister may only direct trade disputes that have  been

notified by the Commissioner under section 18 or 20  of

this  Ordinance. Whereas if the amendment  were  to  be

accepted, then it would mean any trade dispute. Sir,  I

do  not know the intention of the P.A.P. Government  as

to  exactly what they propose to do. But knowing again,

Sir,  their performance in the past and realising  that

there  is  a new clause moved to section 27A,  it  does

appear  to me that the intention of the Government  is,

in  fact, to make conciliation compulsory. Sir, I  will

be ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> shook his head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the Minister for Health and Law shakes

his  head.  I will be very glad indeed if the  Minister

will   stand  up  and  say  that  they  will  not  make

conciliation compulsory. At the moment, as the Minister

says,   he   has  the  power  to  call  for  compulsory

conferences. But he can only do so if the  dispute  has

been  notified by the Commissioner under section 18  or

20  of  this Ordinance. Sir, the Minister may say later

on  that the Communist group of unions are avoiding the

conciliation machinery and are not abiding  by  section

16  of  the  Ordinance which provides that negotiations

are  to  follow  as a set procedure. I  must  tell  the

Minister, Sir, that it is not that these unions want to

avoid the Ministry of Labour. It is not that they  want

to carry out negotiations outside the provisions of the

Industrial Relations Ordinance. The Minister knows full

well  that  there  are  numerous  disputes  that  arise

between  unions  and  employers every  day.  There  are

disputes as important as wage claims, claims in respect

of improvement of conditions of service; also there are

disputes like dismissals, pay cuts and so on. There are

hundreds



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



of these disputes. I shall deal with that point when we

come to discussing clause 11 of the amendment Bill. But

it  is however related to section 7 of the Bill. It  is

not  possible, in the first place, to have every single

dispute follow the provisions of this Ordinance. That I

think  the  Minister will agree. We have  no  objection

whatsoever  to  having  section 16  and  other  related

sections followed strictly in industrial relations. But

what  we  do  not  want is to give  the  Minister  wide

powers - a  blank  cheque - to compel any  dispute  to  be

referred to the Ministry of Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not out of place for me to mention once again

the Shaw dispute. In the Shaw dispute, the Minister for

Labour  unreasonably interfered with the  negotiations.

He  called  on  the  workers to attend  a  conciliation

meeting   in  the  Victoria  Memorial  Hall,   a   call

unprecedented in the history of the labour movement  in

Singapore,  a call that was made in complete  disregard

of  a  trade  union  that  was  legally  registered  to

represent the workers, a trade union which enjoyed  the

confidence  of the workers. I do not want  to  go  into

various  other examples. But I have no doubt whatsoever

in  my  mind, knowing the P.A.P., that the  purpose  of

this  amendment is to have the right to interfere  with

any  trade  dispute as they choose. As I said,  if  the

Minister  is  prepared  to give an  assurance,  and  if

provided he honours that assurance that it is  not  his

intention  or  the  intention  of  his  Government   to

interfere with trade disputes when they are not  called

upon to interfere, then I shall be much obliged indeed.

what  he can to try and bring the two parties together,

and  when  the  Commissioner feels it is his  duty,  he

shall then notify the Minister. And if the Minister  so

directs,  he  then  notifies  the  Registrar   of   the

Arbitration  Court. Section 20 is just an extension  of

section 16 where a notice has been served and where the

employer  has accepted the notice and the  two  parties

have  sat for a period of two weeks and tried to thrash

out  an  agreement,  and where no  agreement  has  been

reached,  any  party - the  union  of  employees  or  the

employer  himself - can  notify  the  Commissioner.   The

Commissioner  then will do what he can to  bring  about

peace through conciliation. It is only when he so feels

that his attempts at conciliation are unsuccessful that

he  notifies  the  Minister. The  Minister,  if  he  so

directs   the  Commissioner,  shall  then  notify   the

Registrar  of the Arbitration Court. Unless these  two

sections  of  this  Part of this  Ordinance  have  been

complied  with,  section  21  means  that  unless   the

Minister  has  been  notified of a trade  dispute,  he

cannot exercise his powers under section 21. The powers

conferred on the Minister under section 21 is to try to

bring  about  peace. The amendment will just  give  the

Minister  the extra power that is required  to  promote

industrial peace. With this amendment he can,  even  if

the  union  or the employer tries to hide  things  away

from  the  Commissioner, and even if  they  do  not  go

through  the  process outlined in Part  III  where  the

Commissioner  has not been notified of any negotiations

or  any dispute, the Minister can, if he feels that the

interests  of  the  country demand it,  bring  the  two

parties together by force and tell them that they have

to  sit  down  and find a solution to the dispute.  The

Minister  has  no power under section 21 to  force  any

party to accept anything.  What he has the power to  do

is to summon any trade union or any employer to come to

his  office for a discussion even though that union  or

that employer deliberately keeps it quiet and wants  to

keep  the  dispute outside the scope of this Industrial

Relations Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the procedure in respect

of  collective bargaining set out in Part III  of  this

Bill  was agreed to between the Government and the  Ten

Tall Men. Mr Speaker, Sir, they undertook



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



to follow these procedures. The moment this  Bill

was  enacted, Mr Speaker, Sir, they refused to  follow

the  procedure set out in this Part of the  Bill.  They

proceeded  to make agreements which they considered  to

be  in  pursuance of industrial relations  outside  the

provisions of this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will look at Part III of the Bill you will see

it  sets  out the procedure to be followed. Whenever  a

union   enters  into  collective  bargaining,  in   all

fairness and in all justice, it must serve a notice  to

treat  first.  It must give the employer  a  chance  to

consider its proposals. There must be a meeting between

the  parties.  Then if they cannot reach agreement, if

they  are  deadlocked, the dispute is referred  to  the

Commissioner for Labour. He tries to conciliate. And if

they still fail to reach agreement, then he refers  the

matter  to  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  or  to   the

Minister. These are the processes they have agreed with

us.  No sooner had this Bill been enacted, Mr Speaker.

Sir, then they refused to follow these procedures. They

said   that  there  was  such  a  thing  as  collective

bargaining outside the procedures of this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that is a loophole in the law. We

believed  that  we  were dealing  with  honest  people.

Because of their dishonesty, Mr Speaker, Sir, we  have

to  tighten up the provisions of this Bill. That is why

it  is  provided -  and  clause 7 so  provides - that  the

Minister  shall have the power to compel  a  compulsory

conference  whether they have followed these procedures

or  not. And clause 11 of the Bill, which introduces  a

new  section  27A, makes it an offence for  anybody  to

conduct negotiations otherwise than in accordance  with

the procedures set out in this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson knows the

position  very well that these procedures  have  to  be

followed  only  on occasions when, say,  a  union  puts

forward   proposals  for  a  collective  agreement   in

relation to any industrial matter. If it wants  to  ask

the employer for a collective agreement with regard  to

salaries  or conditions of service, then it  must  have

recourse  to  these procedures. But where  things  like

this  happen, where men are dismissed in the course  of

their work, Mr Speaker, Sir, these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



procedures  do not require that you serve a  notice  on

the  employer.  Why should you serve  a  notice  on  an

employer  with regard to a dismissal? That is the  view

the Member for Thomson was putting forward. If he looks

at  section 16 of the Ordinance, it is quite clear that

these  procedures must be followed only when there  are

requests  for  a proposal with regard to  a  collective

agreement.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the Minister for Health and Law is in

the habit of getting excited very quickly, Mr Speaker.

I must state quite clearly that nobody is against using

the   Government  conciliation  machinery.  Nobody   is

against going through the procedures laid down  in  the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance.  If  there  have  been

cases where notices for collective agreements were  not

sent under section 16 of the Ordinance, there have been

good reasons. As far as I know, and I am advised so  by

legal  men,  whether at the moment a notice  is  served

under section 16 or not, the Minister, if he wants  to,

can  refer that dispute to arbitration, because he  has

the power. Now, we as reasonable men, Mr Speaker, Sir,

expect   the   Ministry  of  Labour  to  interfere   in

industrial  relaxations  only  to  seek  to   use   the

conciliation  machinery when there is  a  deadlock,  or

when  there  is no progress made between  employer  and

employee  and  where either the employer or  the  union

requests conciliation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Government's opinion of conciliation is quite

different, Mr Speaker. To the Government, conciliation

means they just interfere wholesale, anyhow, and at any

time  they like. That, I say. Mr Speaker, Sir, is  not

desirable in industrial relations. Sir, it is one thing

to  expect  the  Government  to  assist  in  industrial

relations by making its facilities available, but it is

another thing to tolerate the Government interfering in

industrial relations purely for the purpose  of  making

political capital out of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister was saying that only notice for a

collective agreement need be filed under section 16 and

the  other sections of the Ordinance. He also said that

a collective agreement would only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



refer  to matters like wages and conditions of service,

and  so  on.  Sir, the Minister does not know  what  is

happening  in Singapore. Today there are many employers

who  refuse to negotiate with the unions on any  matter

that   comes   within  the  definition  of  "industrial

matters" as provided in the Ordinance, unless a  notice

is  served under section 16. All that the Minister  for

Law  has  to do is to consult his Conciliation Officers

in  the  Ministry of Labour to know the truth  of  this

statement.  Today, an employer can refuse to  negotiate

with a union on a dismissal case if the request to open

negotiations  on that case is not filed  under  section

16. And if the Minister does not know this, then he  is

not  aware  of  what  is happening in  the  industrial

world.  There  is no use seeking to provide  amendments

that will render the position impracticable. And I say,

Sir, quite honestly that the new section that they  are

proposing - section 27A - and this clause 7  will  simply

mean  that the Government have a free hand to interfere

in  industrial relations. That is exactly what we  seek

to  oppose. But this, again I repeat it, does not  mean

that  we do not want to use the Government conciliation

machinery.  The  Minister knows that  if  he  asks  the

Minister for Labour to compile statistics to show which

unions have sent in the most number of disputes to  the

conciliation machinery, the answer will be unions  that

they call Communist front organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if our intention is not to use the Ministry of

Labour - and  we do not have to go there - then what  more,

Sir,  we  have  had a situation where the  majority  of

collective agreements drawn up in Singapore  have  been

drawn  up  outside the Ministry of Labour. I  hope  the

Minister  will not stand up and say again that  we  are

against  the use of the conciliation machinery  in  the

Ministry of Labour, that we do not want to file notices

under  section 16 of the Ordinance, and that we do  not

want  to use the provisions in the Industrial Relations

Ordinance to carry on our negotiations. As I said,  the

position  is  such that today there are many  employers

who  refuse  to negotiate on any matter if notices  are

not filed under section 16 of the Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member for Thomson

just  now  referred to the Shaw case. He said that  the

Minister for Labour took unprecedented action in asking

the  workers  to  meet  him  in  connection  with  that

dispute.  Mr Speaker, Sir, he has also said  that  the

position today is this: that employers refuse to  treat

with  the unions unless they follow the procedures  set

out  in this Ordinance. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is  all

the  more  reason therefore why there  should  be  this

power  vested in the Minister. He should have the power

to send for the parties if they cannot reach agreement.

There   is  nothing  to  prevent  both  sides   getting

together, following these procedures outside the Labour

Ministry  and entering into agreements and then  taking

their  agreements and getting them registered with  the

Registry  of  the  Industrial  Arbitration  Court.   We

welcome  that. There will be no trouble for the  Labour

Ministry  and both sides can get together,  make  their

agreements and register them. It is only when there  is

a breakdown in negotiations, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the

procedures for conciliation available to both sides  in

the  Labour  Ministry  must be resorted  to.  And  that

procedure is indicated in this Part of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this section 21 and these

procedures  were  agreed with the Ten  Tall  Men.  They

wanted  it to be so. They wanted the Minister  to  have

these  powers. They mentioned to us, at the  time  when

this  Bill was drafted, that they were in an impossible

position  unless  the  Minister and  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  were vested with the power. They might  make

approaches  to an employer for a collective  agreement,

but he tells them, "Go and play." And it is because  of

their  representations that these powers were given  to

the  Minister. Now they say the Minister is  trying  to

force  his  will on them, that he is trying  to  compel

them  to  follow collective bargaining procedures.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, all this is laid down in the  Bill.  Why

does  he  make such a lot of fuss about it?  I  do  not

understand him at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> That is what you propose to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 8 stand

part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 8 deals with

section  23  of  the principal Ordinance.  One  of  the

amendments  there, Mr Speaker, Sir, is  that  wherever

the  word  "President" occurs, to substitute  the  word

"Court". As we know, Mr Speaker, the Court consists of

the  President, or the Deputy President as the case may

be,  and two members from the panel. When one reads the

amended clause, one gets the impression that it will go

to a Court of three. If you will be good enough to turn

to page 5 of the Bill, under clause 14:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subsection (1) of section 55 of the principal

Ordinance  is  hereby amended by inserting  immediately

after  the word "sections" appearing in the first  line

thereof the expression "23,".



<br><br>Reading  in  that  intended amendment to  the  existing

section  55,  the  amended  section  55  will  read  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The powers of the Court under sections 23, 52, 53

and  54  of this Ordinance shall be exercisable by  the

Court constituted by the President alone.'



<br><br>So  the  result of these two amendments - which,  as  I

said,  you  give  with  one  hand  and  take  with  the

other - really  leaves  in  effect  the  amended  section

23 - there  is the word "President" - exactly the  same  as

section  23 is today. Although the amended clause  that

is  agreed to will read "Court", yet the President will

exercise the power of the Court on his own as he is, in

fact,  now doing under statutory authority.  I  see  no

point  in  making such a song and dance about  altering

the   word   from   "President"  to  "Court"   when   a

corresponding amendment is made to the existing section

55. That is the first point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on the amendment "may be a person

designated  in  the agreement or" with which  I  am  in

entire agreement with the Government. This gets us away

from  the present position where the employer  and  the

employee  may  appoint  the  President  or  the  Deputy

President  of  the  Court, which  I  think   is   very

desirable.      I      welcome     that      amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, perhaps it might be convenient if I

deal  with  clause 12 at this stage because what  I  am

going  to  raise on this clause would impinge on  that.

Clause  12, Mr Speaker, Sir, gives the right of appeal

from the decision of the referee to the Court, and  the

decision of the Court on such appeal shall be final and

conclusive.  I  welcome that portion of  the  amendment

which allows an appeal from a referee to the Court  and

an  appeal  from a referee to the Court  in  that  case

would  be to a Court of three persons. That is  a  good

provision. I accept that.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if one looks at section 39, it refers to awards

and   referees  under  an  Award;  whereas  a   referee

appointed  under  an  agreement  is  dealt  with  under

section  23. Then the new subsection (3) to section  39

reads-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An appeal shall lie from the decision of the referee

to  the  Court  and the decision of the Court  on  such

appeal shall be final and conclusive.



<br><br>On  my reading of the Bill as it stands, it appears  to

me,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that the Government intends  an

appeal  both  from a referee under an agreement  and  a

referee under an award, that is, the Government intends

that  there should be appeals in respect of both  those

referees.  In  the form the amendments  have  been  put

forward to the Assembly, it would appear that there  is

only  a  right of appeal from the decision of a referee

under  an  award  by  virtue  of  section  29,  because

provision for an appeal, which is subsection (3)  under

clause  12, does not apply to an appeal from a  referee

under an agreement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is because this section, Mr Speaker,

only  deals with a referee under an award. I think  the

Minister also said that the Court may, upon application

made  by  a trade union or a person bound by an  award,

give  an  interpretation of an award. I cannot see  any

clause, if  I  could be enlightened on  this.  If  the

Minister  can  point to any clause  which  makes  it  a

statutory right for an appeal from a referee  under  an

agreement, I should be quite content to sit down. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



as  the  Ordinance now stands, with the amendments,  it

seems to me that there is ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Section 24 - "Collective agreement deemed to

be an award."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes. I am glad the Minister raised this

point.  But  it does not seem as of right, because  the

Minister  has to exercise certain powers under  section

37  of  this  Ordinance before an agreement  registered

under  clause  23 becomes an award for the  purpose  of

this Ordinance. It seems to me, Mr Speaker, not as  of

right.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Minister will be able to

explain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes. That is the second point. The other

point  is this. I was going to mention that so  far  as

the new sub-clause (5) , which would go in as subsection

5 to section 5 is concerned, I have no comment on that,

Mr Speaker. I welcome that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer

Park  referred to the amendment to section  23  of  the

Ordinance  which substitutes the word "Court"  for  the

word "President". Mr Speaker, I have already explained

in  the Second Reading speech that the purpose of  this

amendment is to emphasise that the act of certification

is  the  act of the Court and not only the act  of  the

President,  and  to equate the status of  a  collective

agreement  to  that of an award. It  will  also  enable

proceedings  to  be  taken to punish  persons  who  are

guilty  of  offences  against the  Court  for  contempt

against  the Court. Mr Speaker, Sir, there  have  been

cases  where the President has in open Court  certified

agreements. In those cases, there have been attacks  on

his authority. If there was not this amendment it could

be  held  that when certifying agreements  he  was  not

sitting as a Court, and to enable such contempts to  be

punishable, Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be necessary for

this amendment to be made to section 23.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point, Mr Speaker, Sir, that is, the

question  of an appeal lying from the decision  of  the

referee  to  the  Court, this is provided  for  by  the

amendment to section 39 of the Ordinance. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, a collective agreement which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



is  registered is in law the same as an award  made  by

the  Court. This amendment would allow an appeal to lie

to   the  Court  in  respect  both  of  the  collective

agreement which is registered and which is an award  as

well  as  in respect of an award which is made  by  the

Court.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> With respect to the Minister, I still

cannot  see  it. My point is this. Unless the  Minister

acts  under  clause 37, which brings it within  section

24,  it  is only then that it would be deemed an  award

for the purposes of this Ordinance. Under section 24:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A collective agreement, a memorandum of which has

been  certified by the President [in this case it would

be  the  Court]  shall, as between the parties  to  the

agreement  or  any  successor to, or  any  assignee  or

transmittee  of, the business of a party  bound  by  an

agreement, including any corporation which has acquired

or  taken  over the business of such a party,  and  any

persons or trade unions upon whom it is declared to  be

binding by order made by the Minister under section  37

of  this  Ordinance, he deemed to be an award  for  the

purposes of this Ordinance.'



<br><br>So  it  appears to me that it can only become an  award

for  certain purposes of the Ordinance if the  Minister

acts  under section 37. There seems to be a hiatus.  If

section 23 had said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The memorandum when certified by the Registrar shalt

be  deposited with and registered by the Registrar  and

shall  have  for  the  purposes of this  Ordinance  the

effect of an award.'



<br><br>or  something  like that, then there  would  have  been

absolutely  no  difficulty, and all doubts  would  have

been cleared. But the scheme under which this Ordinance

has  been drafted seems to proceed on the basis that  a

collective agreement will remain a collective agreement

as  opposed  to an award given by the Court  until  the

Minister  acts  under section 37 of this  Ordinance  by

virtue  of  the  provisions of section  24.  I  may  be

mistaken.  I  stand  subject to correction.  I  am  not

trying to be difficult.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member look at section 24 and

stop  at  "agreement" in lines 4 and 5,  and  skip  the

phrase  starting  with  "including"  and  ending   with

"Ordinance" - four lines down below that, and then  carry

on, "be deemed to be an award".



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Omit from "including" up to "Ordinance"?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> My point is this. If the Minister is, in

fact,  satisfied  that that is so - I merely  raised  it

because I thought there was an omission - if the Minister

is satisfied, I am quite happy with it, so that persons

who  come  under a collective agreement will  be  in  a

position to avail themselves of the right of appeal  to

the  Court.  That  is all I am interested  in.  If  the

Minister says that is so. I am quite happy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker, except that this

is  an  entirely  different proposition  which  is  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, if I may, I want to raise certain

points  which will clarify the position of  members  of

the Bar. It has been the contention up till now that in

certain circumstances and under certain conditions,  it

would  not  be  a  violation of the  provisions  of  the

Industrial Relations Ordinance if a solicitor acted  on

behalf either of a trade union of employees or a  trade

union  of  employers. That is accepted. Now,  does  the

deletion of the phrase "under this Ordinance" mean that

under  no circumstances should a solicitor in  any  way

advise or help either party when there is a dispute  as

between an employer and an employee? I ask the Minister

this  question,  Sir, because I think it  is  important

from  the point of view of the Bar. The Bar should know

exactly  what the position is, because any interference

with  the  provisions  of  section  25  results  in  an

offence. I do not think we want members of the  Bar  to

commit an offence unwittingly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I had met the last

Committee  of  the Bar Committee. They said  that  they

would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



happy   to  leave  the  parties  to  negotiate  between

themselves  and to follow the procedures that  are  set

out  under Part III of the Ordinance. But they said  to

me, Mr Speaker, that they would be happy to come in if

they  were  invited by the Minister to do so.  That  is

provided  for  by the amendment that has been  made  to

section 31 of the Ordinance, where it is provided  now,

as  amended, that the Minister may, where he  considers

it  possible that any trade dispute may be  settled  by

conciliation or further conciliation, direct a  person,

whether  engaged in or connected with the trade dispute

or  not,  to attend at the time and place specified  in

the  direction  at a conference presided  over  by  the

Minister  or such person as the Minister directs.  They

said  that  the parties would get together  and  follow

these  procedures.  If there are  deadlocks,  then  the

matter is referred to the Minister, and if the Minister

thinks  that  it  is necessary to compel  a  compulsory

conference,  then they can be invited to  attend.  From

then  on  they  can take over. That has  been  actually

agreed  between myself and the last members of the  Bar

Committee.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw

the  attention  of the Minister to the fact  that  very

often  members  of  the Bar give  assistance  to  trade

unions   in   clarifying  and  helping   them   to   an

understanding of the various issues before negotiations

are  undertaken.  It seems to me that by  omitting  the

words  "under  this  Ordinance" it is  now  being  made

unlawful both for the trade unions to consult a  lawyer

as to how to frame and formulate their demands, and for

a lawyer to advise them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this has proved a healthy procedure, but I must

confess I am more than surprised at the suggestion that

the Singapore Bar Committee is amenable to the proposed

deletion  and the proposed prohibition of the Bar  from

exercising a valuable function. I cannot understand the

need for preventing the Bar from giving assistance  and

guidance  before  the commencement of  negotiations.  I

will  put it no higher than this - is the Minister  sure

of his premise when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



he suggests that the Bar Committee is happy to see this

amended?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The last Committee. They have now a new

Committee. The previous Committee did agree  that  with

me.  They said, "Let the parties get together; let them

negotiate  on  their  own; let  them  comply  with  the

provisions in Part III of the Ordinance and we would be

happy  to  come in, if we are invited to do so  by  the

Minister."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I would put it no higher

than  this, Sir, from the information which  is  in  my

possession  as  a  member of the Bar Committee;  but  I

would  urge  the Minister to look at the correspondence

between   the  State  Advocate-General  and   the   Bar

Committee, particularly the letter of the 21st of June,

and  he will find that in fact both Committees - both the

previous and the present Bar Committees - do not consider

it  helpful,  for  the public interest,  that  the  Bar

should be excluded from assisting in the formulation of

demands or understanding of the legal provisions before

negotiations are commenced. I am happy to show  him  my

file  if  he would like to look at it for his  personal

information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, I am aware of that, it was in

pursuance of those representations that I held meetings

in  my  office  at  which members of the  previous  Bar

Committee  were invited to be present, and  the  State

Advocate-General was also present at those meetings. It

was   then   suggested,  as  a  compromise,  to   leave

negotiations to the parties, and that they  would  only

step  in  if they were invited to do so by the Minister

when there was a breakdown in the negotiations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Would the position then be this if this

amendment were passed. If there was some likelihood  of

a  dispute between an employer and his employees and if

either  the employer or the employees went to a  lawyer

and were to say, "It looks as if there is going to be a

dispute. Now, will you advise me as to what I should do

if a dispute occurs?", and if a solicitor should advise

either party, at the request of that party, would he be

committing an offence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



under  this  Ordinance? Is this amendment  intended  to

prevent such advice being given?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Minister will appreciate that he

could  not exercise the powers indicated in section  21

until,  in  fact,  there have been  negotiations  under

sections  16 and 17. What I am talking about,  Sir,  is

the - how  shall  I  say  it? -  pre-official  negotiation

period  when  it is sought to obtain clarification  and

guidance  on  the legal aspects. I cannot believe  that

the  Minister  should find that in any  way  offensive;

that  the  Bar should guide either employers  or  trade

unions   in   formulating   their   position   or    in

understanding the legal position. By deleting the three

words  in  question,  Sir,  he  would  be  making  that

illegal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgive me, Sir, I have been through this before, but

if  I  may  show you. At the present moment, Sir,  when

negotiations  are  under this Ordinance,  it  would  be

improper to offer or receive any proposal or to act  on

behalf  of a trade union except with the qualifications

under   section   60.  And  negotiations   under   this

Ordinance,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, start with  section  16,

when  a formal notice is served on an employer, or  the

employer  serves the notice, and there is an acceptance

under  section 17. When that happens, then negotiations

begin  under  this Ordinance. Any period prior  to  the

service   of   notice  is  negotiations   outside   the

Ordinance.  I understood the Minister to  say  that  he

would  be  very  happy  and would welcome  negotiations

outside  the Ordinance when the two parties can  really

get  together in a friendly spirit and bring  about  an

agreement which they can present to the Court and  have

it   registered.  Which  seems  a  very  sensible   and

commonsensical  approach, Sir, and  I  accept  that  he

wishes that. But in fact, by deleting these three words

for  whose  deletion there seems lo be no  real  reason

urged,  he will be preventing members of the  Bar  from

giving any assistance in that direction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> As I have told the House just now, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  there were these discussions  with  the

previous  members of the Bar Committee but  I  do  not

feel very strongly about it. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



would  be  happy to agree, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  the

three words remain in this section.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The position then is that the voting

will be against clause 10.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 11 stand part of the

Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I rise on a point of guidance, Sir. Did

I   understand  the  Minister - and  it  seems   that   I

understood  him correctly - that he would  welcome  those

negotiations between unions and employers in a  healthy

atmosphere  of  mutual respect which eventuates  in  an

agreement which can then be registered? But am I  wrong

in  thinking that this clause - the new proposed  section

27A - makes  it an offence for any person or trade  union

to  negotiate  otherwise than in accordance  with  Part

III?  So  it  will  be impossible to have  negotiations

outside Part III.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if my understanding is correct, then may I

understand   how   they   can   have   those   friendly

negotiations  without serving notices?  Perhaps  the

Minister would assist me?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> As I have said just now with regard to

section  16 of the Ordinance, it is only when,  say,  a

trade union asks an employer for a collective agreement

with  regard to industrial matters as defined  in  this

Ordinance  that  these procedures must be  followed - the

procedures  of serving a notice to treat  and  for  the

parties  to get together within a reasonable time,  for

the  employer to consider the proposals,  for  them  to

bargain,  until they reach a deadlock.  The  matter  is

then  referred to the Commissioner for Labour and  then

to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, that is only in respect of

cases  where  they ask for a collective agreement,  but

life  is not that alone in the trade union world. There

are  people who are dismissed every day, and  in  those

cases, Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be absurd to ask  the

union to comply with these procedures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



In these cases they would have to meet the employer and

ask  him  to consider the reinstatement of a  dismissed

employee, and if he is in any way difficult, the  union

can then use the procedures open to it under section 21

of the Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It appears that there are one or two

things  arising from what the Minister has  just  said.

Sir,  this new clause will make it an offence  for  any

person  or a trade union to enter into negotiations  in

relation  to  industrial  matters.  The  Minister   has

conveniently suggested that industrial matters may only

be  matters  that may end up in collective  agreements,

but  if  we  look  at  the  definition  of  "industrial

matters", we will notice that everything under the  sun

that  goes  on  between an employer and  the  employees

comes within the definition as stated in the Ordinance.

It  should simply mean, Mr Speaker, Sir, any person or

union  which enters into discussion on any matter  that

is  defined here as "industrial matters", or any matter

that  affects the employee in his employment. I do  not

know  whether the Minister was thinking of  section  16

alone  just  now, or was he answering in reply  to  the

Member for Anson after consideration of section 27  and

the definition of "industrial matters".



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Probably there have inadvertently been

some words omitted there. You will notice "a person who

or  trade  union  which  enters  into  negotiations  in

relation  to industrial matters". "Industrial matters",

Sir,  even with the present additional definition, does

not  cover merely collective agreements, but covers the

entire  relationship, whereas,  if  I  understand  the

Minister aright, he wants the words "which enters  into

negotiations for collective agreements in  relation  to

industrial matters". In that case, would he  accept  an

amendment  to  insert  the words  "negotiations",  "for

collective agreements"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir. The new section 27A

provides that "Any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



person   who   or   trade  union  which   enters   into

negotiations   in   relation  to   industrial   matters

otherwise  than  in accordance with the  provisions  of

this  Part  of this Ordinance ..."" this part  of  this

Ordinance" refers to Part III - the collective bargaining

part  of  the  Ordinance, Sir. There is no doubt  about

that,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, and all that is  required  is

that  the  procedures under this part of the  Ordinance

are   complied   with  in  respect  of  proposals   for

collective agreements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 13 stand

part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I have made my point on the Second

Reading of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I can understand that the right of

appeal  should  operate  in  service  for  which  this

legislation has been framed. I am fully aware of  that.

But the Minister will also agree that if one gives to a

Court  unlimited powers - as indeed this  Court  has,

for  has  not the Minister himself said that the  Court

can act in equity and good conscience - and, as a result

thereof,  the  Court  can over-ride  existing  law  and

substitute  therefor its notions  of  equity  and  good

conscience, then, in these circumstances, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  the Industrial Court would be more powerful  than

God himself for where God himself could be bound by his

own decisions, the Industrial Court would only be bound

by its notions of equity and good conscience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, such power could be abused, wittingly or

unwittingly.  I am not saying that there should  be  an

appeal  from his decision on points of fact, but  there

may  be points of law involved, particularly when  the

President of the Court is not being assisted by a legal

man, on which he could go wrong. What then could be the

harm if the provision for appeal is inserted in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



Bill?  In  order that there might not be any  abuse  of

that right to appeal, the State Advocate-General should

certify that there is a point of law on which an appeal

could be moved. The Minister himself has recognised the

difficulty.  There  do arise points  of  law  in  these

courts  and  those points of law, under the  Ordinance,

the  President is entitled to go to the State Advocate-General  for  advice. The State Advocate-General  gives

it,  which,  in effect, means that the Government  does

recognise  that  points  of  law  do  arise,  even   in

industrial  disputes. All I am asking the  Minister  to

say is whether the Government will consider, either now

in  this  Bill or at some future time, the question  of

enabling  any  litigant to appeal from  the  Industrial

Arbitration Court to a Court of Law in the  country  on

points  of law. In order to prevent frivolous  appeals,

the  State Advocate-General as I have indicated  should

certify. In England in respect of certain appeals there

are   provisions  whereby  the  Attorney-General   does

certify  and where a point of law is involved the  case

goes  to a higher tribunal. Similarly, here, the  State

Advocate-General could be given power to certify that a

genuine  point of law does exist and on this  point  of

law there could be an appeal.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I would like to add my voice to

that  of  the Member for Farrer Park with reference  to

this most unusual provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is necessary to give power, but absolute

power  it  is  never  necessary to give;  and  to  give

absolute  power, Sir, is to risk a tyranny.  Throughout

history, Sir, it has been repeatedly proved that it  is

wise  to  give the power of appeal to higher  tribunals

from the natural failings and errors to which perfectly

honest  individuals may be subject. Sir, I  would  draw

your attention to the possibility, for example, of  the

President  refusing  to certify  an  agreement  for  no

reason at all. He does not like one of the parties:  he

will not certify it. There is no power for an order  of

mandamus  to  direct him to do his duty.  Supposing  he

does  not like one of the parties and he sends  him  to

prison for contempt, because he does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



not  like the colour of his hair. There is no power  to

appeal from that order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like you to appreciate that I recognise the validity of the Minister for Law's stand

that  in matters of policy and in matters of fact, the

decisions  of this tribunal shall not be challenged.  I

accept  that,  Sir, and I give you as an analogy,  Sir,

not  in  Singapore but in Australia, for  example,  the

Income  Tax Board of Revenue. You cannot appeal, except

on  points of law, because the Commissioner himself and

the  Board  that  settles the disputes  are  themselves

experts in matters of assessing facts and the court  is

shut  out  from  examining the facts, which  they  must

accept.  But to shut out the court, Sir, from  deciding

on  points  of law is to create an island  of  tyranny,

however good the intention. I do urge upon the Minister

to  recognise that it is for the welfare of the courts,

for  the  health  of  the courts, as  well  as  of  the

country, that there should be provision permitting  an

appeal  on  a  point of law, not in fact making  doubly

worse  the  existing  section  but  improving  it,   by

introducing provision whereby an appeal on a  point  of

law exclusively could go to the High Court.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I should like to have an indication of

what  particular  orders of the  court  should  be  the

subject  of  an appeal. One matter that the Member  for

Anson referred to was the question of an appeal from an

order punishing a contempt. Mr Speaker, Sir, the other

suggestion of the Member for Anson just now was that if

the  President refused to certify an agreement  for  no

apparent  reason, then there was no appeal. But  surely

that is an absurd suggestion, Mr Speaker, Sir, If  the

President ever did that, there was the power to  revoke

his appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the case of the only matter which the Bar

Committee   thought  could  be  the   subject   of   an

appeal - that is a punishment for contempt - no such  case

has yet arisen. So I suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that we

wait  for  another year - let this Ordinance continue  to

operate - till  we  receive  a further  report  from  the

President - and there will be now another Court, a second

Court,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>





there will be a report that we will be receiving from the Deputy

President also - and when we recieve their reports, we can consider

what sort of appeals we should allow from the decisions of this court.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  to continue with my speech from last night, once

again I wish to express my surprise at the attitude of

some   of   the  Members  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis,

especially  the Member for Queenstown,  who  in  their

arguments  attempted to hide their  nefarious  designs

with  flimsy pretexts. They cannot expect to hide  the

carcass  of  an  elephant by covering  it  up  with  a

winnowing  pan,  as the proverb says.  Some  of  their

arguments  were  based on terms  such  as  a  sell-out

merger,  and  so  on, which I think  will  not  be  expressed by people who are normal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clear now, without my having

to  do  it,  they  have exposed themselves  and  their

designs.  The  Member for Queenstown stated  yesterday

that  before the Anson by-election the people had  not

expressed their desire to merge with the Federation of

Malaya. They thought that that would strengthen  their

argument  that  Singapore is not yet ripe  for  merger

with  the Federation of Malaya. If at all, this is  in

line  with the designs of the Communists who hope that

their  Party will control the whole of Malaya at which

time  they  expect  to  do as  they  please  with  the

Constitution of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true to say that the P.A.P. have no mandate to

carry  out  merger, as was alleged by the  Member  for

Queenstown?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply, permit me to ask them to open their minds

wide  and  to try to recall their pledges  before  the

1959  elections were held. Let me put it to them that

in  1954  when  the  P.A.P. was  formed,  the  first

manifesto was issued at its inaugural meeting. I  will

read page 4 of the Malay version thereof. This was  in

1954  before  the  Federation of Malaya  achieved  its

independence.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the hon.

Member read that passage again? I think he was reading

too fast. There was some difficulty about translation.

Will he read that passage again slowly?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I will speak a little further from  the

microphone. On page 4, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our Party opposes the new constitutions to be

inaugurated  in  the Federation and Singapore  because

they   still   retain  the  essential   features   of

colonialism.  We shall use every constitutional  means

to   get  a  constitution  for  an  independent   and

democratic  State, one which recognises the  unity  of

Singapore  and  the Federation and  which  places  the

ultimate control over the affairs of this country  in

the hands of a Government elected by its nationals and

responsible only to them.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objectives of Petir to bring about merger with

the Federation of Malaya came to life at the inaugural

meeting of the P.A.P. in 1954. Then in 1958, after the

Federation  of  Malaya achieved its independence,  the

Executive  Committee of the P.A.P. issued  its  Fourth

Souvenir  which was passed by the General Meeting  as

the  basis of its future policy. This is my answer  to

the  Member's  allegation. I  shall  read  the  Malay

version on page 3.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) to end colonialism and establish an

independent national State of Malaya,  comprising

the  territories now known as the  Federation  of

Malaya  and the Colony of Singapore; to create  a

democratic and united Government of Malaya (here,

it  includes Singapore] based on universal  adult

suffrage  of all those who are born in Malaya  or

who have adopted Malayan nationality.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is our basic policy that

is upheld by every loyal member of the P.A.P. and

it is our duty to carry it out in the interest of

our people. When the elections came in 1959, as I

said yesterday, the P.A.P. had placed foremost in

its  manifesto the fact of wanting to strive  for

independence  through merger with the  Federation

of  Malaya.  With these basic policies  and  with

what  is contained in this manifesto, we went  to

the  people in 1959 and it was by virtue of  this

manifesto that we were duly elected by the people

by  a  big majority and returned to this Assembly

with a total vote of about 54 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if the S.P.A. and U.M.N.O., who have obtained a few seats, claim that in their manifesto they have merger as a platform, it will

be  true,  therefore, that those people who  want

merger number more than 54 per cent and therefore

it  is  logical to assume that they expect  their

representatives  to fight for merger.  With  this

victory, Mr Speaker, Sir, would anyone  say  now

that we have no mandate to bring about merger, as

was  alleged we did not have, as we heard in this

Assembly yesterday? Have they forgotten this fact

or  have  they not read the Anniversary Souvenir?

They  should not continue to remain in this House

because  they  were elected in the  name  of  the

P.A.P. who  promised to fight  for  merger,  but

these  people have since run away from the P.A.P.

Wherein lies the value of their self-respect, Mr

Speaker,  Sir?  And this becomes a challenge  and

strengthens   our  firm  desire  to   fight   for

independence  through merger with the  Federation

of  Malaya. I feel, Mr Speaker, that  there  are

many  tainted  Reds who accuse us  of  having  no

mandate  from the people. This is only  to  wreck

our  efforts. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have known them

long in the field of politics since October 1954;

so  I  know their tactics well. When these people

wish



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



to  besmirch their opponents, they will find ways

and  means to do so - whether it is right or wrong.

So I say they cannot stand being stared at in the

face.  The  objective  of  achieving  merger  was

regarded  as a long-term objective. But according

to   what   the   Member  for  Queenstown   said

yesterday, in the speeches of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara,  no  mention  was  made  of  merger.  The

changes that will take place and are taking place

in  the  political arena are not something  which

anybody can foretell. Merger will soon be a fact.

The   Member   for  Queenstown,  in  moving   his

amendment,  stated that this House resolves  that

the people of Singapore be asked to express their

wishes on the inevitable reunification of the two

territories.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  this  sentence

which  is  the subject of the Member's  amendment

clearly  shows  his acceptance of the  fact  that

reunification   is  inevitable.  Therefore,   our

society   is  confused.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   if

reunification  is inevitable, the  question  then

arises:  what is the mode and manner of  bringing

about the reunification acceptable to our friends

in  the  Federation?  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  in  all

sincerity,  once again, I must express  my  great

surprise; if the Member for Queenstown  and  his

colleagues  are  sincere and are  truly  keen  to

bring  about  the  reunification  of  these   two

territories,  they  will surely  not  attempt  to

bring  about  this amendment. It is because  this

amendment  will definitely be defeated that  they

have  tabled other amendments and other  motions.

This,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, is merely to  bait  the

hook  in  order to fish in troubled waters.  From

this  it  becomes abundantly clear  who  are  the

people  who waver and shift their stand; and  who

are  the  political adventurers who have  exerted

every  effort  to  bring about confusion  to  the

people.  We  realise and recognise, Mr  Speaker,

that our island State with its teeming population

comprises  various races of various cultures  and

religions.  With full earnestness and  sincerity,

we should bear in mind these facts. We must carry

out  our  objective  in  the  true  interest  and

welfare  of  the people to bring about prosperity

and  harmony.  Mr Speaker, Sir, in carrying  out

its  objective, the Government is always firm  in

its   stand.  The  Government  has  carried   out

negotiations   with   the   Government   of   the

Federation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



Malaya  to get a suitable basis which will not  be

detrimental  to  any  Party  and  which  will   be

acceptable to the majority of the people  in  both

territories - fully respecting our  own  rights  and

privileges. As a result of that, Command Paper No.

33 came into being. Mr Speaker, all these efforts

have  gone on smoothly and successfully but a  few

political adventurers have stepped forward to  try

to  belittle these successes in order to wreck the

merger that is to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another problem faces us

because everyone of us wants merger. The mode  and

manner  of bringing about merger is either as  has

been spelt out in the White Paper Command No.  33;

or  a complete and unconditional merger as a State

on  an equal basis with other eleven States; or is

it to be that we are to enter Malaysia on terms no

less  favourable  than the  terms  of  the  Borneo

territories?  Do  they want to  reject  all  these

three   alternatives   and  place   Singapore   in

jeopardy?  I am truly confused, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

to see the stand of the Barisan Sosialis. As I see

it, it is not the alternatives for bringing about

merger  that is the crux of the matter; it is  the

desire  to  wreck  merger itself.  Therefore,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  if merger is wrecked,  then  those

people  who  claim themselves to be  fighters  for

democracy and fighters against colonialism are the

real  colonial stooges who wish to place Singapore

under  the  feet of the colonial power. This,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, is the true position regarding these

people.  They would like to appear as  sheep  when

they   are  actually  wolves.  I  would  like   to

reiterate  that we will fight colonialism  whether

it be from the West or from the East.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because of this, in the name

of our sacred fight in the interests of the people

in this State of ours, and in the interests of the

welfare  of  our future generations, I would  urge

upon  Members of this Assembly to heed this  call:

if  you have gone astray, if you have gone off the

path,  pray do come back to the main road. At  the

same time, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to sound

a  word of warning. If we are true representatives

of  the people, fighting for the interests of  the

people,  let  us prove our sincerity. I  reiterate

once more, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  Sir,  if we have taken a wrong  step  as

individuals, the danger that may befall  us  would

only  affect  our own family, but  if  we  make  a

serious  mistake as political leaders  responsible

to  the  people,  then  the  danger  is  that  the

consequences will be suffered by the people  as  a

whole.  And great suffering will be borne  by  the

generations yet unborn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, to cut my speech

short, I say once again, if you have gone off  the

path, do come back to the main road, but  if  you

are  truly fighting for merger, let us have  proof

of it. We should in all our efforts be sincere and

not  act  like  the proverbial crab in  the  Malay

saying,  which asks its baby crab to walk straight

ahead  while  she, the mother crab herself,  walks

sideways.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  we were debating the Referendum Bill we  did

say   that  the  P.A.P. was  going  to  pose  two

unacceptable questions to the people of  Singapore

to  choose.  What we said before  has  now  become

true.  It  is a tragedy for the P.A.P.  Government

who, having known that the people do not want them

anymore,  are  now trying to sell  the  people  of

Singapore  to  the  Federation  of  Malaya,  first

conditionally, then unconditionally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also a tragedy for our people to have

such  an  irresponsible Government who  now  force

them to accept two unacceptable types of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper on merger of the P.A.P. was

debated  in  this House. Since it was debated  and

approved  in  this  House, it is  only  right  and

proper for the P.A.P. Government to ask the people

whether  or  not  they accept the White  Paper  on

merger proposed by the P.A.P. but approved in this

Assembly.  It is only by this that the  democratic

right of the people can be exercised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people and the Opposition will not blame the

P.A.P.   Government  for  its   undemocratic   and

irresponsible attitude if it is prepared to  allow

our  people  to  exercise their  basic  democratic

right by giving them a chance to say "Yes" or "No"

to the White Paper proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government not only do not allow our people

to say "Yes" or "No" to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



the  White  Paper on merger, but they  are  also  even

prepared to pose another type of merger which is  even

worse  than  the White Paper on merger  by  which  the

Government can force the people to be trapped  in  the

referendum plot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very irresponsible for the P.A.P.

Government to ask the people to choose a complete  and

unconditional merger as a state on an equal basis with

the   other   11   states  in  accordance   with   the

constitutional documents of the Federation of  Malaya.

This  question has not been discussed and  debated  in

this  Assembly. Therefore, it is not right and  it  is

improper  for the P.A.P. Government to bring  up  this

question for our people to choose. Their aim is clear.

They  try to trap the people by forcing them to choose

between  the  White Paper on merger and  unconditional

merger.  By  this way, they think they  can  trap  the

Barisan Sosialis. But they have mistaken the fact that

the  Barisan Sosialis is a political organisation.  It

can survive under any form of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the interest of the people is above the interest

of  any political Party. If the P.A.P. believe in this

principle,   then  it  should  not   pose   two   such

unacceptable questions for the people in order to trap

the  Barisan  Sosialis, because  they  also  trap  the

people  who will suffer most. So the people  will  not

forget the treacherous act which the P.A.P. Government

is now doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to warn the P.A.P. Government that the way

they go about it can only create more trouble and more

hatred  for  the  Governments  of  Singapore  and  the

Federation.  When  the people become  anti-government,

then, Mr Speaker, Sir, you know what happens.

Paper  on  merger, then the Barisan Sosialis  will  be

finished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the matter is not as simple as that. If merger

is  being carried through by force against the  wishes

of the people, then the people will suffer under such

merger.  Then  any political Party may  stand  up  and

fight  for the abolition of the White Paper on merger,

and  in  such a situation the people of Singapore  are

sure  to  stand  behind  this  political  Party  which

to arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our amendment seeks to protect the basic right

of  the  people that they should be given a chance  to

say "Yes" or "No" to the White Paper on merger. It can

also  prevent any unexpected disaster they  may  cause

under such an undemocratic sell-out merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are aware, Sir, under the White Paper on

merger  we  will  have  to hand over  our  rights  and

privileges,  which  we  are  now  enjoying,   to   the

Federation of Malaya for nothing; Sir, for nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is bad for our people. But the Government say that

it  is  good. Since they say it is good, then let  the

people choose. But the Government will not want.  They

say if you do not want our P.A.P. type of merger, then

you  can choose unconditional merger. By their  twists

and  turns they say merger is inevitable. Their simple

logic  is  this: To die is inevitable;  therefore  you

must  die by shooting yourself with a gun; or you must

die by hanging yourself with a rope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister in

his  recent  radio  talk  on merger  did  mention  the

referendum in Newfoundland. He said that the people in

Newfoundland,   when  deciding  their   constitutional

changes, were also not allowed to say "Yes" or "No" in

that referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he was telling a lie to the people of Singapore,

because the people there were actually given a  chance

to  say  "Yes" or "No" in a different form. They  were

given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



three  questions to choose from. One,  to  merge  with

Canada;  second, to become independent; and third,  to

remain a British colony.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> That is what you want.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, let us say they voted against

one  and  two. But let us put the questions this  way.

One,  do you want to merge with Canada or not? Second,

do  you want to become independent or not? But if they

vote against these two, that means they want to remain

in  a  British  colony.  That  proves  the  people  of

Newfoundland were actually given a chance to say "Yes"

or "No" to decide their future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You have to decide now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, now the people of

Newfoundland  are  treated  equally  as  citizens   of

Canada, but in this P.A.P. type of merger the citizens

of  Singapore are not going to be treated as  citizens

of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has stated that it has fought a

special  privilege for the people of  Singapore,  that

is, the privilege of autonomy in labour and education,

hut  they  have forgotten the fact that the  so-called

privilege is ours which we are now enjoying, it is not

a  special gift offered to us. This so-called  special

privilege   of  autonomy  in  labour  and   education,

although  in  name is in the hands of  the  people  of

Singapore,  in fact, is in the hands of the Government

of  the  Federation, because the Government  machinery

that controls these two departments is in the hands of

the Federation Government. In other words, when merger

takes place conditionally or unconditionally and under

any circumstances, the people of Singapore do not gain

anything but they lose everything, including the basic

rights of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We oppose the Prime Minister's motion firstly because

the  citizens of Singapore cannot automatically become

the  citizens of the Federation; secondly, because  we

cannot have proportional representation in the Federal

Parliament;  and,  thirdly, because  the  citizens  of

Singapore  cannot  enjoy  the  same  rights  as  those

enjoyed by the people of Federation;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



and, fourthly, because the voters are  deprived

of  the right to say "Yes" or "No" to the questions or

question  posed to them. This type of  merger  can  do

nothing good to the people. But it will make Singapore

a colony of the Federations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I listened with

some  astonishment to what the Member for Changi said.

It is obvious from his very puerile statements that he

has  not  even understood the basic elements  of  what

appears in the White Paper, the basic elements of  the

Federal  Constitution  and the  simplest  elements  of

parliamentary democracy. Sir, I am not going to  waste

the  time of the House in rebutting his arguments, but

I  want to take this motion before the House in a very

serious  light  and  consider  certain  basic   issues

involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear from what has been said in this

Assembly  that  the  simple issue of  the  alternative

merger  proposal to be presented in the referendum  is

citizenship.  What  will happen  to  the  citizens  of

Singapore under the alternative form of merger?  These

are  important matters and I want to discuss  them  at

length. I also want to discuss purely for the sake  of

argument,  what happens to Singapore citizens  if  the

Barisan  type  of merger with automatic conversion  is

implemented  by some miracle. But first, Sir,  let  me

deal  with  what  happens to Singapore citizens  after

merger  in  accordance with the White Paper proposals.

The  Barisan Sosialis keep on repeating the  falsehood

that   Singapore  citizens  will  become  second-class

citizens,  but  they  have never stated  in  what  way

Singapore  citizens will become second-class citizens.

They  have  not  given one concrete instance  of  what

rights  and  privileges the Singapore  citizens  would

lose  under  the  White  Paper  form  of  merger.   We

repeatedly  asked them to answer this  question.  Each

time  they  evaded the issue. I hope that during  this

debate  the  Barisan  Sosialis  Members  will  give  a

straightforward   answer   to   this   straightforward

question.  I  say,  Sir,  that  it  is  an  outrageous

falsehood  to say that Singapore citizens will  become

second-class citizens after merger in accordance  with

the White Paper proposals. Now, if there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



are  people who will not take my word for it, then may

I  refer  them to what the Member for Anson  has  said

about  second-class citizens, and  I  quote  him  from

Hansard  of 23rd November, 1961, column 577.  Sir,  he

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The leader of the Barisan Sosialis spoke of second-class citizenship, and I completely agree with the

Minister for Culture that there ain't no such animal".

Of  course,  there  is not. There is  no  question  of

second-class citizenship.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that was in November 1961 and on the 28th of

June,  1962, the Member for Anson reaffirmed his  view

in this very Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have not changed my view.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have never said he has changed

his  view,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I said he has reaffirmed

his  view.  Now  everybody knows  that  if,  in  fact,

Singapore citizens become second class citizens  under

our merger proposals, then the Member for Anson, as  a

lawyer,  will  be  able  to  find  real  solid   legal

arguments  to prove his point. The fact of the  matter

is  that  he  has  not done so, nor  can  the  Barisan

Sosialis  present any argument or evidence to  support

their charge of second-class citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the truth of, the matter is that Singapore

citizens  retain all the rights that they now possess.

In  addition, they acquire new rights as nationals  of

the  new  Federation. Now, let me explain. A Singapore

citizen now enjoys certain basic political rights.  He

has  a right of franchise, that is, he has a right  to

choose  who shall govern Singapore. He has a right  to

stand for election, and as a citizen he enjoys certain

real   and   concrete  privileges  in  the  State   of

Singapore. He is eligible to apply for low-rent houses

built  by the Government. His children enjoy the right

to  free  primary education; and if they  are  clever,

they  can  get  free education right up to  university

level.  As  a Singapore citizen he can hold office  in

the  Government, and there is a full range of  welfare

services  available to him. Sir, these are the  nights

and  privileges  of a Singapore citizen  as  they  now

stand. He loses none of these rights



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



after  merger. Not only he retains these rights  after

merger according to the White Paper proposals, but  he

acquires  new  ones.  He  has  a  right  to  vote  for

representatives to the Central Parliament.  He  has  a

right to stand for election to the Central Parliament.

In  addition, he acquires the status of a national  of

the   new  Federation.  As  a  national  of  the   new

Federation,  the  rights he enjoys are  equal  in  all

respects to those of the Federation citizens who  will

also  be nationals of the new Federation. These rights

are   defined  in  various  Articles  of  the  Federal

Constitution. The more important ones are Articles  8,

9,  10,  47,  119  and 123. These deal  with  equality

before  the  law,  freedom  of  movement,  freedom  of

speech, assembly and association, freedom of religion,

qualifications    for   membership   of    Parliament,

qualifications  of  electors  and  qualifications   of

judges  before  the Supreme Court.   I  want  to  draw

special attention to Article 8 (2) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution,

there  shall be no discrimination against citizens  on

the ground only of religion, race, descent or place of

birth  in any law or in the appointment to any  office

or  employment  under  a public authority  or  in  the

administration of any law relating to the acquisition,

holding or disposition of property or the establishing

or  carrying  on  of any trade, business,  profession,

vocation or employment.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister said in the debate on merger

last  year,  the rights of a Singapore citizen  and  a

Malayan  national will be incorporated in the  revised

Constitution of the Federation, and this Article  will

then  guarantee him a status of complete equality with

all   other  citizens.  The  only  difference  between

citizens  of the Federation and citizens of  Singapore

is  that they will elect and be elected to the Central

Parliament in their respective territories.  Those  in

the  Federation will vote in the Federation, and those

in    Singapore    will   vote   in   Singapore    for

representatives to the Central Parliament.  Similarly,

if they want to stand for election, they will do so in

their  respective  territories.  These  are  the  only

differences. There is no inequality here and therefore

no  question  of second-class status under  the  White

Paper merger proposals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now deal with what happens to Singapore

citizens  under  complete merger for  Singapore  as  a

constituent State of the Federation. First, I wish  to

deal  with the extraordinary claim made by the  Member

for  Queenstown last night that complete merger of the

Penang or Malacca type has never been advanced by  the

Barisan  Sosialis. He said, and I quote the transcript

of yesterday's Assembly sitting at page 41 second last

paragraph. [Vol. 19 No. 1, col. 62]. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Let me now expose why the P.A.P. have wanted to put in

this  so-called Penang type merger, why they  invented

this  Penang  type merger. There are two good  reasons

for  the  P.A.P. First, the P.A.P. want an  excuse  to

justify  posing  two questions to the  people  in  the

referendum.'



<br><br>And then in page 42, second paragraph, second sentence

[col. 63]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The P.A.P. object is to identify the Barisan

Sosialis with the unacceptable fictitious Penang  type

merger.'



<br><br>Sir, I am amazed to learn that the P.A.P. invented the

Penang type of merger. The Member for Queenstown  must

have suffered from a temporary mental blackout when he

said  this,  for it was he who proposed this  form  of

merger in a letter from him to the Leader of the House

dated  1st September, 1961. Now this letter  has  been

quoted so often that I will not quote it again, but  I

will cite other evidence in corroboration. Sir, may  I

read  from the Straits Times, 30th August. 1961,  page

18,  part  of a long article on the Barisan  stand  on

merger?  And  this  is what the Barisan  stand  is  as

described in the Straits Times:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The way for real unification was in one of two

directions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) an immediate, full and complete merger with

Singapore   joining   the   Federation   as    a

constituent State like

Penang or Malacca.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) an autonomous unit within a confederation with

Borneo territories coming in when possible.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is clear, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Penang or

Malacca type of merger was not invented by the  P.A.P.

We  are  quoting statements straight from the  horse's

mouth.  Now, if the Barisan Sosialis do not  like  the

Penang  or Malacca type of merger as they now pretend,

then they can propose merger like any other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



State.  Even if we regard Penang and Malacca as merely

being offered as illustrations, the fact remains  that

the Barisan Sosialis have come out fully in favour  of

full and complete merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just to make sure that we the P.A.P. will not be

accused  in  future  of inventing  further  fictitious

types  of complete merger, may I be permitted to quote

several  statements  of Barisan  leaders  which  prove

beyond all doubt that they wanted complete merger with

the   Federation?  My  first  quotation  is  from  the

typescript  of  the  famous radio forum  on  the  21st

September, and I quote from page six of the typescript

with   the  Member  for  Queenstown  saying  in   very

forthright terms:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We come out with our stand, straightforward, one and

all  the time the same, namely, that we are asking for

full   complete  merger  with  the  Federation,   with

Singapore  coming  in  as the  twelfth  State  of  the

Federation. Only in that way can you call it merger.'.



<br><br>Now,  Sir,  in  a  letter to our Party  Chairman,  the

Deputy Prime Minister, dated the 11th September. 1961,

the Member for Queenstown said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We note with some satisfaction that following the

proposal  for  the constitutional future,  the  P.A.P.

Government  has shifted its stand and is now  prepared

to  put  forward complete merger as an alternative  to

its own proposal.'.



<br><br>Sir, they say that they are very satisfied that we are

prepared  to  put forward an alternative  of  complete

merger.  So why all this fuss and bother when  we  are

doing so now? Again, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member  for

Queenstown  in Hansard of 20th November, 1961,  column

314, said in this Assembly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, we have already stated in the most unequivocal

terms  that we are fully prepared to accept a complete

merger,  and we will only be too glad to say "yes"  if

the  Tunku says tomorrow that we should have  complete

merger.'.



<br><br>Now,  Sir,  lest  it be thought that  the  Member  for

Queenstown was speaking out of turn - and one must admit

that  he  does that very frequently - I will quote  what

the real Party boss said on this subject. I will quote

Mr Lim Ching Siong in the Straits Times dated 18th



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



September, 1961, on his Party stand on merger. Mr Lim

was quoted as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lim said that recently critics had described the

Panty  as anti-merger and as being prepared to  accept

merger only as an alternative.'.



<br><br>Now, he asked the question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`How can anyone who likes only half-boiled potatoes

accuse  those who like boiled potatoes of being people

who  do  not like potatoes? We are serious and genuine

in  our  stand  for full and complete merger.  If  the

Federation  Government says tomorrow  that  they  will

accept  us  as an integral part of the Federation,  we

will only be too glad to support it whole-heartedly.'.



<br><br>So  now,  Sir,  when  we  offer  them  fully  boiled

potatoes,  they  say  they never wanted  it  and  they

wanted  something else. No, obviously they are  up  to

some  game.  What is this game, Mr Speaker,  Sir?  To

understand  this, let us examine what the words  "full

and  complete merger" mean. The Member for  Anson  has

added another adjective "unconditional" merger to make

the meaning even clearer. Therefore, when you talk  of

full  and  complete  and  unconditional  merger  as  a

constituent State of the Federation, you  join  in  on

the  same  terms enjoyed by any of the present  eleven

States.  Sir,  you can ask for more. The Barisan  have

asked  for  more. The Workers' Party  have  asked  for

more. But if these terms are rejected, then it is  not

open  to  them to grumble and say that they have  been

deprived of anything to which they were entitled. This

is  a  proposition  which is self-evident  even  to  a

schoolboy. Now, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis having come

out   with  this  clear  and  unambiguous  demand  for

complete  merger  discovered  that  they  had  made  a

serious   mistake  and  then  they  begin  to   attach

conditions.  Now, Sir, it is no use for  them  to  say

that they have not made a mistake, for their allies in

the  anti-merger campaign, the Member for Hong Lim and

the  Member  for Anson, publicly declared in  a  radio

forum  on  the  14th of June, 1962, that  the  Barisan

Sosialis  had  made a mistake. What was this  mistake?

The Barisan Sosialis realise ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir, because he

said  that I have publicly declared, quoting me,  that

the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



had  made  a  mistake. I said, "If  they  had  made  a

mistake.  .  .".  That  was the  commencement  of  the

sentence, and I did quote it yesterday, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this matter has been gone

through  already, and he said that not only  did  they

make  a mistake but he said, "It is withdrawn,  it  is

withdrawn,"  as  he claimed on behalf of  the  Barisan

Sosialis. Now the Barisan realise that complete merger

means that the citizenship laws of the Federation must

apply  to  Singapore.  Those  who  were  not  born  in

Singapore will have to re-apply in accordance with the

laws of the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that is a most astonishing

interjection,  but I will deal with that  point,  Sir.

Now,  they therefore say that Singapore citizens  must

automatically convert to be Federal citizens and  they

say  that  Article  22 of the Federation  Constitution

makes this possible. Now, Sir, when we discuss what is

possible  and  what is not possible, I think  everyone

will  agree  that it is only proper that  we  talk  in

terms  of  actual possibilities and not  in  terms  of

academic  possibilities. And  here,  the  position  is

clear  beyond doubt. The Member for Anson has  written

to  the  Tunku over this question. He had  received  a

reply  from  the Tunku which he is rather  bashful  to

publish,  but  if  he still maintains  that  automatic

conversion of citizenship is possible, then  we  shall

be extremely delighted and grateful if he will publish

the  Tunku's reply. Now, Sir, Mr Lim Ching Siong  has

also written to the Tunku.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> For what?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> But he has not dared to publish

the  contents of this letter or the Tunku's  reply  to

it,  if there is any reply. So these people know  what

the real position is. Then why do they keep on harping

on automatic conversion? Sir, this subject should have

been  settled last November when the letters exchanged

between   the   Prime  Ministers  of   Singapore   and

Federation were tabled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



in the Assembly on 24th November last year. May  I

quote a passage from the Tunku's letter? He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to emphasise that it cannot be

assumed  that the analogy of Penang or Malacca  is

necessarily relevant to the status of Singapore in

merger  with  the Federation. Article  22  of  the

Federation  Constitution  makes  provision  for  a

merger  of  new  states  on  terms  which  do  not

necessarily  have  to follow  Penang  and  Malacca

which were already members of the Federation  when

the  1957  Constitution came into  force.  If  the

stricter  laws  of other states  were  applied  to

Singapore, Singapore would be entitled to not more

than  twelve  seats since less  persons  would  be

eligible  for  citizenship  and  consequently  for

franchise,  quite  apart  from  the  question   of

weightage for rural areas.'



<br><br>So  here  we  have a definitive statement  on  how

Article 22 can be applied in the event of complete

merger. Now the Barisan are not happy that Malacca

and   Penang  citizenship  laws  will   apply   to

Singapore   in  a  complete  merger.   They   want

something  more  favourable  and  the  Tunku   has

pointed out that the conditions of conversion  may

well  be  even stricter than those of  Penang  and

Malacca  under complete merger. So in the face  of

all  this,  this  talk about automatic  conversion

strikes  me  as  having more than a lunatic  tinge

about  it.  The Barisan Sosialis have  added  this

condition with just one intention and that  is  to

frustrate  merger.  They know  that  complete  and

automatic conversion is not possible, and in  fact

this  is  why they ask for it. There is one  other

motive  which  may  be in their minds.  By  laying

stress   on  automatic  conversion  into   Federal

citizenship, they hope to convince the  people  of

Singapore  that somehow they are missing something

good  by  not  being allowed automatic conversion.

Let  us  examine this aspect very closely. Let  us

ask  ourselves,  what in fact would  the  ordinary

citizen gain if automatic conversion were granted?

Is  he  better  off  than under  the  White  Paper

proposals?  The answer is `Yes'. He is better  off

in  two  respects - and only in two respects. First,

he  will  be  able  to stand for election  in  the

Federation   general   election,   not   only   in

Singapore,  but  also in the Federation.  This  is

something  not  of  great  value  to  the  average

citizen who, if he wants to stand for election  to

the Central



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



Parliament, can do so in Singapore. The other

additional benefit the average citizen  gets  from

automatic  conversion is that he will be  able  to

vote more easily in the Federation when he changes

his  address  and moves there. The  procedure  for

registration  will be much easier than  under  the

Singapore  White Paper proposals. But  here  again

the  advantage  is  not something  of  fundamental

importance.  These  are  the  only  gains  to  the

citizen,  and I challenge the Opposition  to  cite

any other advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, against these two advantages - the

ability  to  vote  and stand for election  in  the

Federation and not only in Singapore - what are  the

losses  to  Singapore under complete and automatic

conversion  in  full merger? The losses  are  both

extensive and immediate. First, under the complete

and  unconditional  form  of  merger,  only  those

citizens  who  are educated, who are  sufficiently

educated  in  Malay  and  English  can  stand  for

election  to  the  Singapore  Assembly;  in  other

words,  large  numbers of Singapore citizens  will

lose their present right to stand for election  to

their  own  State Assembly. Next, Chinese  schools

will have to conform to the Federation's education

policy and eventually take the examinations either

in  English  or Malay. Then there is no  guarantee

for  our  businessmen that Singapore's  free  port

status will remain so long as we so desire. And 90

per  cent of our taxes will be handed over to  the

Central Government. The Bank of China closes  down

and imparts of textiles and other goods from China

will  be  severely restricted, thereby  disturbing

our  entrepot  trade. Let us  therefore  strike  a

balance  sheet of profit and loss for the  benefit

of  being able to vote and stand for election both

in  Singapore and in the Federation to the Central

Parliament. The Singapore citizen loses so many of

his  existing rights and privileges, and all this

is   assuming  that  there  is  full  merger  with

complete and automatic conversion of citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if there is no automatic conversion,

then  some 340,000 registered citizens, or  nearly

half  the  electorate,  run  the  risk  of  losing

completely all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



their  political rights. The Barisan Socialis  and

the Workers' Party can say this cannot be. But the

laws  of  the Federation are there and  they  will

apply  to  Singapore if we ask  for  complete  and

unconditional merger. The Barisan Sosialis make  a

hue and cry about proportional representation.  As

regards   proportional  representation,  this   is

expressly  provided  for in  Article  116  of  the

Federal   Constitution.  If  in  the   matter   of

citizenship, Singapore conforms to the laws of the

Federation,   then   proportional   representation

follows automatically. On the other hand,  if  the

Barisan  want  more favourable treatment  than  is

provided  for in the Federation citizenship  laws,

how  can they sustain their claim for proportional

representation?  These  matters  were  raised  and

discussed  during  negotiations  between  the  two

Governments,  and the exchange of letters  between

the  two  Prime Ministers to which I have referred

deals with this specific point. Our Prime Minister

referred to this point in his letter and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the other hand, the claim that Singapore

citizens should automatically become Federation

citizens and thereby increase the representation

of Singapore was, and still is, in the view of

the Federation Government too absurd to merit

serious consideration.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now deal with the amendment moved by

the  Member  for  Cairnhill. He  wanted  a  third

alternative  posed,  that  is,  whether  Singapore

should  enter the Federation of Malaysia on  terms

not  less  favourable  than those  of  the  Borneo

States.  The  Government  has  announced  that  it

accepts  this  amendment. There is a lurking  fear

among   some   people - a  fear  that  is   actively

encouraged    and   fostered   by   the    Barisan

Sosialis - that Singapore will somehow be treated as

an inferior partner in the Federation of Malaysia.

The   acceptance, of  this  amendment   by   the

Government,  which  shows  that  such  fears   are

completely  unfounded,  makes  nonsense   of   the

Barisan's  claim that we shall be relegated  to  a

second-class  status in future Malaysia.  Sir,  in

his  more ebullient mood, the Member for Anson has

likened   both  the  White  Paper  proposals   and

complete  and  unconditional merger  on  an  equal

basis with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



any of the 11 States to imperialist annexation  of

the  State  of  Singapore  by  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  These  words were uttered in  the  Select

Committee on the Referendum Bill, If there are any

persons who are foolish enough to be misguided  by

the  Member for Anson and believe in what he says,

then  the third choice of equality with the Borneo

States  offers  a way out. But I say  that  events

will  show  that the White Paper merger proposals,

from  the  point  of  view of  advantages  to  the

citizens  of Singapore, will be found far superior

to the other two alternatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the stage is set for the final act in

the  drama  of  merger and Malaysia.  It  was  the

Communists  and  their  stooges  in  the   Barisan

Sosialis  who, by their mad campaign of  agitation

against  merger  and  Malaysia,  made  merger  and

Malaysia  come  to  its realisation  with  greater

speed   than  otherwise  would  be  possible.   By

launching  a  wild  and  indiscriminate   campaign

against merger and Malaysia, they have opened  the

eyes  of  everyone, including the leaders  of  the

Federation  of Malaya, to the urgency of  speedier

establishment of Malaysia. Whatever  the  form  of

merger  the  people of Singapore will choose,  the

end result will be the same for the Communists and

their  stooges.  Their  own  mischief  making  has

hastened the very danger to themselves which  they

wanted  to avoid in trying to obstruct merger.  We

have  warned these foolish and opportunistic  men,

who  are now playing with the Communists,  of  the

consequences  that will befall them. Our  warnings

were  given in good faith, in an attempt  to  save

these  misguided  persons  from  the  consequences

which we see very clearly ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Save yourself.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> --- must follow upon their

reckless actions. I regret to say, Sir, that these

warnings  have  gone unheeded.  Indeed  they  were

resented  and  even  regarded  as  threats  in  an

attempt  at intimidation. May I once again counsel

caution  and  ask them to take heed of  our  words

before  it is too late? Even now it is much  later

than they think.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

after the British return on the conclusion of  the

World War, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



were forced by the rising nationalism unleashed in

this  region by the Japanese occupation  to  bring

into  existence a new national entity out  of  the

existing  separate States of Malaya.  The  British

conveniently kept out Singapore. Singapore is left

out,  not  because  of  the  lack  of  nationalist

feelings  but  it  was thought perhaps  that  this

island  State  would serve as a Gibraltar  of  the

East - a   secure  military base  isolated  from  the

surrounding  turbulence in the political  cauldron

of  Asia;  as Gibraltar in the West has been  safe

and  sound  despite the wake of rising nationalism

in   Africa   and  the  surrounding  Mediterranean

countries.  The history of nationalism  in  Malaya

would  have  taken  a different  emphasis  if  the

British had not kept Singapore out of the Malayan

entity.  Singapore was the hot-bed of  nationalism

in  the Malaysian region. However, after 17  years

of  separation, a new chapter has opened. With the

development     of     nuclear     weapons     and

intercontinental missiles the use of Singapore  as

a military base is doubtful. On the other hand, if

Singapore  takes a different political  road  from

the  rest  of  Malaya, it could pose a  formidable

challenge to the preservation of the status quo of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, history cannot be reversed, and, therefore,

we  today  bear  witness to  all  these  political

debates  in this Assembly intermingled with  party

bickerings  which have highlighted the proceedings

of  this  House. We have sought to rise above  the

petty   squabbles  that  are  inevitable  in   the

conflict  of party interests, so that  the  issues

that  face  the people of Singapore can be  placed

squarely  before them away and isolated  from  the

heat of personal rancour and party differences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there would have been no White Paper nor

referendum  law if the British had  not  separated

Singapore  17 years ago from the rest  of  Malaya.

And   I  would  say  that  today,  with  very  few

exceptions,  all  citizens of Singapore  would  be

citizens of the Federation of Malaya enjoying  the

same    rights    and   shouldering    the    same

responsibilities. I say this, Sir, quoting no less

an  authority  than  our Prime Minister - the  Prime

Minister  of the State of Singapore - who  has  been

instrumental  in negotiations with the  Federation

Government   on  the  White  Paper  Constitutional

proposals. Sir, let us go back to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



year 1957. The All-Party Constitutional Talks with

the  United  Kingdom had just been finalised.  The

Assembly  had  endorsed  the  basis  for   a   new

Constitution for Singapore. Arising from the  All-Party  agreement  and from negotiations  with  the

United Kingdom, the Singapore Citizenship Bill was

introduced  in  this very House. After  the  First

Reading,  the Prime Minister, then the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar,  sitting on the Opposition  Bench,

gave  his  approval and support  of  the  Bill  in

principle,  and  thereafter  the  Bill  went  into

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Select Committee on the

Singapore  Citizenship Bill, the  Chief  Minister,

the   present  Member  for  Cairnhill,  moved   an

amendment  to  clause  9 of  the  draft  Singapore

Citizenship  Bill  to  reduce  the  residential

qualification   of   applicants   for    Singapore

citizenship from 10 years to 8 years. Mr Speaker,

Sir, may I refer you to column 655 o, the Official

Report of the Select Committee on the Bill,  dated

28th  September, 1957? The Member  for  Cairnhill,

who was then the Chief Minister, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, this ten-year residential qualification

was  agreed  by the All-Party Conference  held  in

February  1957. It was endorsed by the Legislative

Assembly  in March this year, and was subsequently

accepted by the Colonial Office when the All-Panty

Delegation  negotiated for the  new  constitution.

Since  then,  the Government has  gone  into  this

residential qualification of ten years.  The  All-Party  Delegation has had further discussions  and

it  felt that an amendment to eight years would be

easier for administrative purposes in view of  the

fact that identity cards were issued late in 1948.

It   is   for   that  reason  that  the  All-Party

Delegation  felt that an amendment to eight  years

would  make  it  easier for the administration  to

register all those persons who are qualified under

this proposed legislation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar in those

days - he is at present the Prime Minister - supported

the  reduction from 10 years to 8 years, but based

on different grounds and reasons from those of the

Chief Minister. He said, in column 656:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lee Kuan Yew: Mr Chairman, as I have said

in  the Assembly during the Second Reading of this

Bill,  if  the amendment from ten to  eight  years

does  not  result  in our citizenship  laws  being

further  away  from the citizenship  laws  of  the

Federation,   then  we  are  in  favour   of   the

amendment.  As far as I can see, the amendment  to

eight years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



will  make our citizenship laws more akin to those

of the Federation and I support the amendment.'



<br><br>May I repeat again, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As far as I can see, the amendment to eight

years will make our citizenship laws more akin  to

those  of  the  Federation,  and  I  support   the

amendment.'



<br><br>There  is  no  doubt  in my mind  that  the  Prime

Minister made this decision in Select Committee in

1957  on  the spur of the moment. As a  matter  of

fact,  he had given careful thought to the problem

of  citizenship  when merger was  to  take  place.

About two weeks earlier, during the debate on  the

Second Reading of the Citizenship Bill, the  Prime

Minister,  who  was  then the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar,  said - may  I refer you,  Sir,  to  Hansard,

column 2575, dated 11th September, 1957, about the

fifth line from the top:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If we are honest about merger and the building

of  one  nation,  when we draw up our  citizenship

laws,  we  must see where it is going to  dovetail

into  the Federation citizenship laws because  the

moment the principle of merger is accepted we have

to discuss the conditions for it.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in 1957 thought that the original proposal of qualification for Singapore citizenship of 10 years was slightly higher than that for Federal citizenship and therefore supported the move to reduce the qualification, to

bring  it  into line with the Federal  citizenship

laws. Sir, the Prime Minister had in mind not only

the   comparative  provisions  of  the  Federation

citizenship  laws  but he had  in  mind  also  the

citizenship  laws  of the Commonwealth  countries,

because all the citizens of Commonwealth countries

are  called Commonwealth citizens. It seems to  me

that  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  United

Kingdom   Government,  as  the   leader   of   the

Commonwealth, to see that no member of the British

Commonwealth deviates substantially from the  norm

of  Commonwealth citizenship laws. It appears that

the  Federation citizenship laws and the Singapore

citizenship  laws  are all based substantially  on

the norm adopted by all Commonwealth countries and

applicable to all Commonwealth citizens, with some

slight variations to suit local conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now refer you to the Report of the

All-Party Singapore Constitutional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



Conference,  1957, paragraph 49? This  report  was

the  result of negotiations between the  All-Party

Mission  and  the  U.K. Government.  Paragraph  49

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It had already been agreed at the previous

Conference  that a separate Singapore  citizenship

within  the  Commonwealth should  be  created.  We

recognised that it would consequently be necessary

to introduce legislation in Singapore establishing

the  conditions and qualifications  for  Singapore

citizenship.  We  agreed that the  Singapore  Bill

should  be  prepared  in  consultation  with   Her

Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in view

of  the  proposal in paragraph 51 that the British

Nationality   Act  should  be  amended   so   that

Singapore  citizenship  would  be  recognised   in

United  Kingdom law as conferring  the  status  of

Commonwealth citizen.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is, therefore, my contention that

Singapore citizens have acquired their citizenship

rights on qualifications based on the norm adopted

in  other  Commonwealth countries and  in  general

conformity, as the Prime Minister in 1957  agreed,

with  the  Federation citizenship laws.  At  least

that  was what the Prime Minister told us in 1957.

Those who have satisfied the minimum qualification

of  8  years  in  1958  when they  obtained  their

citizenship  papers, will now  satisfy  a  minimum

residential period of 12 years in 1962.  Moreover,

the  vast  majority  of those  who  have  acquired

citizenship by registration have been staying here

for  decades, making this island city  their  home

and  the  object  of  their loyalty.  I  therefore

cannot agree with the Prime Minister on the  first

alternative  in  the question to  be  put  in  the

ballot  paper. The main reason against  the  White

Paper  is that I cannot agree with his citizenship

proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now come, Sir, to the distortions of the

Prime  Minister in his opening speech on the stand

of  the Opposition towards merger. When the merger

issue  was debated in the House, the views towards

merger  were split into two. The P.A.P., supported

by  S.P.A. and U.M.N.O., supported the White Paper

proposals;   the  Workers'  Party,   the   Barisan

Sosialis and the U.P.P. supported the principle of

automatic  conversion of Singapore  citizens  into

Federal  citizens and proportionate representation

in the Central Parliament. Under the Federation of

Malaya



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



Agreement  of 1948 all citizens of the  respective

States  which they term State nationals, excluding

Malacca  and Penang, automatically became  Federal

Citizens  by  virtue of section  125  (a)  of  the

Agreement.  Section 125 (a) of the  Federation  of

Malaya Agreement of 1948 reads as follows :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Citizens by operation of law ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On and after the prescribed date, the following

persons  shall  be citizens of the  Federation  of

Malaya by operation of law;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any subject of His Highness, the Ruler of

any States;",



<br><br>which is the best analogy to our present Singapore

citizenship. Now, Sir, Johore citizens then became

Federal  citizens automatically, Selangor citizens

became Federal citizens also automatically, Perlis

citizens     also    became    Federal    citizens

automatically, Pahang citizens also automatically,

Perak,  Trengganu, Negri Sembilan and so on.  Sir,

why   should   Singapore   citizens   be   treated

differently?  The Prime Minister's  case  for  the

White  Paper is based on the premise that most  of

the  citizens  of Singapore by registration  could

not  have  obtained their citizenship  under  more

stringent   laws  applicable  in  the  Federation.

However, his stand in 1957, as I have stated  just

now,  was  different and his views in  the  Select

Committee  on the Singapore Citizenship Bill  gave

one the impression that the proposed qualification

in  the draft Bill is higher than the Federation's

qualification and therefore should be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I will come to the second alternative

in   the   Prime  Minister's  motion.  The  second

alternative in the ballot paper posed by the Prime

Minister   is  vague  and  therefore  capable   of

distortion.  What  is meant  by  "a  complete  and

unconditional merger as a State on an equal  basis

with  the  other eleven States in accordance  with

the  Constitution documents of the  Federation  of

Malaya"? Does the Prime Minister take it  to  mean

that  all  Singapore citizens by registration,  on

Merger  Day, would be deprived of their  Singapore

citizenship,  and have got to re-apply  separately

and  individually for Federal citizenship? If that

is  the  case, Sir, the chances are that  many  of

them  could not get it, not because they are  not

qualified - the Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



did  not  think  so in 1957, but by administrative

obstacles  and delays which may be  posed  by  the

Central Government which would have the control of

the  administration of citizenship. I  would  also

wish  to  ask  the Government whether  the  second

alternative  has  been the basis  of  negotiations

between   the   Singapore   and   the   Federation

Governments,  and if that is so,  whether  it  has

been  set  up in concrete proposals as  the  White

Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of the Prime Minister puts forward

two alternatives, the first one is the White Paper

proposal. The White Paper proposal is not  genuine

merger - and  here, Sir, I can do  nothing  better

than  to  quote  the P.A.P.'s ally  on  the  White

Paper, the S.P.A. The S.P.A., in a sense, are more

honest,  and  in  their speeches and  their  party

publications  they have repeatedly said  that  the

White  Paper proposal is not merger but a form  of

closer   association  with  the  Federation.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I refer to page 61 [col.  93]  of

yesterday's  Official  Report.  The   Member   for

Cairnhill - about seven lines from the bottom said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now proposal No. 1 of Command Paper No. 33 is,

in  fact,  not  merger. It is  a  form  of  closer

association. It is a form which the P.A.P.,  as  a

Government,   has  secured  from  the   Federation

Government.'



<br><br>And may I refer again to the July 1962 addition of

the S.P.A. organ, page 4, which reads:



<br><div align="center">'CLOSER ASSOCIATION NOT MERGER</div><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement between the Federation Government

and the Singapore Government is not merger. It  is

a  form of closer association along the lines of a

Confederation.  We  support it  as  a  first  step

towards the eventual merger and the sooner we  all

become  Malayan conscious and behave  as  Malayans

the sooner will merger take place.'



<br><br>And the article continues on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The simple unadulterated truth is that because

the agreement reached is not merger but a form  of

Confederation,  the  citizens of  Singapore  shall

remain  as citizens of Singapore and the  citizens

of  the  Federation shall remain citizens  of  the

Federation.'



<br><br>In  other words, Sir, what the S.P.A. is trying to

drive  at  is  that only in a genuine merger  will

Singapore   citizens  and  Federal   citizens   be

converted  into one common citizenship. Therefore,

based on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



the S.P.A.'s arguments, from the S.P.A., a Party which

supports the White Paper of the P.A.P. Government, the

second alternative in the motion of the Prime Minister

cannot  be merger because then all Singapore  citizens

and all Federal citizens shall come together under one

common  citizenship. Then, Sir, what could this second

alternative in the proposed ballot paper mean but  the

deprivation of Singapore citizens by registration from

the  present  citizenship they now have, and  becoming

stateless  persons, which means half  of  the  present

624,000  Singapore  citizens  would  become  stateless

persons.  Sir,  of course, the P.A.P. can  argue  that

this  is  S.P.A. distortion either by the  Member  for

Cairnhill in his speech or by the S.P.A. organ of what

is  meant  by merger and of what is the constitutional

relationship  between Singapore and the Federation  as

envisaged  in  the  White Paper proposals.  Therefore,

Sir,  I shall quote from the P.A.P. organ itself,  the

Petir. In the issue dated 31st May, 1962, page 5,  the

Petir said



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The present merger proposals are but steps towards

full integration and under conditions satisfactory  to

all  concerned.  Nobody  believes  that  these  merger

proposals are final and absolute.'



<br><br>Sir,  what does this clause mean? It means and admits

that  the  White  Paper is only a  step  towards  full

integration.  Does it not also mean,  Sir,  that  full

integration  is therefore the ideal objective  of  the

people of Malaya which includes Singapore, but that at

present  it  is not possible to achieve it?  In  other

words, it is not possible to have a common citizenship

until  conditions are ripe. In the same page the Petir

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This demand for complete integration would be

unacceptable to the Federation leaders at the  present

time.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is meant by this article is

that  the  ideal  is  complete  integration  which  at

present  the  Federation leaders are not  prepared  to

give.  Therefore, Mr Speaker, the second  alternative

in the Prime Minister's motion can only mean something

else  but  not  the  complete  integration  which   we

understand,  on  the  complete integration  which  the

P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



organ  understands - the P.A.P. organ,  the  Petir,  as

different from the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first alternative, which is the White Paper, is

unacceptable to the people. The second alternative has

never  been put forward even in broad generalities  as

the  White Paper proposals. It is vague, and therefore

can   lead   itself  to  all  sorts  of   distortions,

manipulations  and interpretations  and  is  therefore

equally unacceptable. Proposal one is unacceptable and

proposal two is even more unacceptable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore are not prepared to give a

blank cheque to the second proposal posed by the Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the first proposal, the Government is singing

high  praises for the White Paper. The Prime  Minister

said  that  under  complete integration - and  this  was

repeated just now by the Minister for Finance - many  of

the  Assemblymen in this Chamber would not be eligible

to  stand  for  election as there would be  no  multi-lingualism. Mr Speaker, Sir, are they then  appealing

to these Assemblymen to support the White Paper? I am

sure,  Sir, if such personal sacrifices are necessary,

they  will be prepared to rise to the occasion in  the

interest  of  the  people. The so-called  autonomy  in

education, and labour is more imaginary than real.  It

is  my  view that in matters under the control of  the

Central  Government - either absolute control, or  under

concurrent  powers - such as the control of defence  and

internal  security,  of  law  and  the  machinery   of

government, of financial and industrial policies,  and

so  on,  a  Central Government can bring the Singapore

State  Government down to its knees if  the  Singapore

State  Government refuses to accept the  "advice"  and

"direction"  of a Central Government on  matters  over

which  the  State  Government  is  supposed  to   have

exclusive  jurisdiction, for instance,  education  and

labour. This, Mr Speaker, Sir, is my analysis of  the

so-called autonomy in education and labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to collect only 75 per cent of the revenue

to  administer the respective subjects like  education

and labour is similar or akin to a P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



branch  collecting 75 per cent of its  membership  dues

itself in order to defray branch expenses on behalf  of

the  Central  Executive  of  the  P.A.P.;  because  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, financial, economic, fiscal and taxation

policies  would  be  decided  under  the  White   Paper

proposals  by  the  Central Government.  The  Singapore

State  Government would not be able, for  instance,  to

exercise a flexible fiscal and economic policy to  cope

with  its special economic and social responsibilities.

For  instance,  we  would have the responsibilities  of

administering health and social security,  but  without

the  corresponding power and the means to discharge our

obligations to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for special privileges to Malays, Sir, which the

Prime  Minister mentioned in his speech  yesterday,  we

are  not  against  them, so long  as  they  are  within

reasonable limits and are for the benefit of the under-privileged Malay masses. What we oppose is  to  keep  a

small  privileged  group  of  Malays  and  ignore   the

interests of the poor Malay masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now come to the third alternative put

forward  by  the  S.P.A. which  is  acceptable  to  the

Government.  This  third  proposal,  Sir,  is   equally

unacceptable to the people of Singapore.  It  is  vague

and  the  same argument against the second  alternative

applies equally well to the third proposal. It could be

interpreted in the same way, as I see it,  as  the  so-called  Penang  and  Malacca type of  merger,  and  the

people would be asked as in the second proposal to give

a blank cheque for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my opinion, therefore, that the second and third

proposals could be interpreted to mean something  worse

than  the  White  Paper  proposals.  The  Minister  for

Finance stated at the conclusion of his speech that the

White Paper proposals on merger are far superior to the

two  other  proposals. He has admitted  it.  Therefore,

Sir,  the  Government's tactic of putting  alternatives

more unacceptable than the White Paper still stands and

has not changed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this motion is to seek

justification  in  the  eyes  of  the  world  that  the

referendum which is soon to come is a democratic and an

honest  referendum and that the White  Paper  proposals

have  been  approved by a majority  of  the  voters  by

including all blank votes as pro-White Paper votes. The

alternatives  posed  in  the  Newfoundland  and  Uganda

referenda were genuine alternatives. Let me illustrate,

Sir;  if the people of Singapore are asked whether they

prefer   potatoes  or  bread,  they  are  not   genuine

alternatives,  because  the  people  of  Singapore  are

divided  into  those who eat bread and  those  who  eat

rice.  Similarly,  Sir, if the people  of  Ireland  are

asked  whether they prefer rice or bread, they are  not

genuine  alternatives, because the  alternatives  there

would be potatoes and bread.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government were sincere in thrashing out

the  genuine  alternatives in the  merger  issue,  they

should  have long ago convened an All-Party Conference,

as  it  was done during the 1957 constitutional  talks;

the   result  then  was  unanimity  and  everybody  was

satisfied.  Sir,  it  is still not  too  late  for  the

Government to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of the Prime Minister only serves as an

attempt  to  win  the  argument  on  merger  over   the

Opposition  Parties  who are against  the  White  Paper

proposals  and  that, Sir, will fail.  Nothing  arising

from  this  debate  could alter the Government's  basic

tactical  position,  which  is  to  put  proposals   or

alternatives  more unacceptable than  the  White  Paper

proposals. And you have no better proof than  from  the

horse's  mouth of the Minister for Finance. Any genuine

alternative  could not be accepted by  the  Government.

Therefore,  Sir, by putting in more alternatives,  more

proposals  or  amendments which are acceptable  to  the

Government,  they would only be serving to confuse  the

issue at stake. The issue is that the people should  be

asked  to accept or reject the White Paper. If that  is

the question to be posed, there would be no doubt about

the  outcome.  But as things are, the Government  would

push



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



through  this  sham  referendum and  steam-roller  its

White Paper proposals through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should the people do in the circumstances? If

the  voter does not go and vote, he loses his vote  in

future elections. If he tears his vote or defaces  it,

he will go to gaol. If he writes his name and address,

he  is  afraid of being intimidated. Sir, if he throws

in  a  blank  vote  it  would  be  considered  a  pro-Government vote. But faced with these possible courses

of  action, our stand is that the people should  throw

in  blank  votes, which is the least of the evils.  If

the  blank votes are more than the votes for the White

Paper,  then the Government would keep quiet.  But  if

the  votes for the White Paper exceed the blank votes,

not  for  any reason but merely because the  voter  is

faced with impossible alternatives, and in desperation

throws his vote for the White Paper proposals, then we

may  be  giving Government the opportunity to announce

separately  the number of votes supporting  the  White

Paper  and  thereby  mount a  propaganda  campaign  to

convince  the  world  that the majority  of  Singapore

citizens have supported the White Paper and have  done

so without counting the blank votes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member for Anson

stated  in  this House yesterday that the  Federation

Constitution  makes provision for state  nationals  to

become  Federal  citizens  from  the  moment  it  took

effect.  Why then, he asked, could not state nationals

in  Singapore  automatically have Federal  citizenship

under Article 22 of the Federation Constitution, which

is   the  article  providing  that  whenever  any  new

territory is admitted into the Federation in pursuance

of  Article  2, the Federation Parliament may  by  law

determine what persons are to be citizens by reason of

their  connection with that territory and the date  or

dates  for  such  persons to be citizens.  He  further

argued  that  it was not the spirit of the  Federation

Constitution  to bar state nationals, whether  of  the

Federation  or the State to be admitted,  and  to  put

technicalities in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



their  way would be a fraud, in view of the fact  that

since  1957  there has been accorded a new  status  of

Singapore citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he knew that in this House on the 22nd of

November, 1961, Hansard, Volume 15, columns  474,  475

and  476,  I  had  taken the trouble  to  explain  the

distinction in the Federation citizenship laws between

those  who were born in any of the territories of  the

Federation  before  Merdeka  Day  and  who  were   not

qualified  to  be Federation citizens by operation  of

law  under  the Constitution, and the state  nationals

and  others  who  were qualified  to  be  citizens  by

operation of law. Sir, I referred on that occasion  to

the  provisions  of section 124 of the  Federation  of

Malaya  Agreement,  1948, and  section  125  of   the

Federation  of Malaya Agreement (Amendment) Ordinance,

1952, and pointed out that a person born in Penang  or

Malacca,  which  was referred to in the  Agreement  as

British  Settlements,  became Federation  citizens  by

operation  of  law  on  the  operative  date  of   the

Federation of Malaya Agreement. 1948 - that is  the  1st of February, 1948.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also pointed out that a person born in any

part of the Federation outside Penang and Malacca  did

not become a citizen by operation of law unless (1) he

is  a subject of the Ruler. Subjects of the Ruler  are

defined  as aborigines, Malays and persons naturalised

as  subjects of the Ruler; and (2) if he is a  British

subject  or  a  citizen  of  the  United  Kingdom  and

Colonies,  and one of his parents was born in  any  of

the territories of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also mentioned that the Federation of Malaya

Agreement  (Amendment) Ordinance,  1952,  deleted  two

earlier   provisions  in  the  Federation  of   Malaya

Agreement,  1948, providing  that  (1)  persons  born

before,  on or after 1st of February, 1948  (i.e. the

appointed  date of the Federation of Malaya Agreement)

in  the  Federation  who habitually  spoke  the  Malay

language and conformed to Malay customs and (2)  other

persons  born  before, on or after the  1st  February,

1948,  in  any  of the territories of the  Federation,

both of whose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



parents were born in any of the territories of the

Federation and were before or at the time of their

birth or thereafter became permanently resident in

any   territory  of  the  Federation,  were   also

citizens by operation of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by the deletion of these two earlier

provisions  of the Federation of Malaya Agreement,

1948,  a  person  who  was  born  in  any  of  the

territories of the Federation outside  Penang  and

Malacca  could only become a citizen by  operation

of  law if he was a subject of the ruler, or if he

was  a British subject, or a citizen of the United

Kingdom  and Colonies, and one of his parents  was

born  in any of the territories of the Federation.

To  that  extent the more lax provisions obtaining

from  the  operative  date of  the  Federation  of

Malaya   Agreement,  1948,  for   the   grant   of

citizenship by operation of law were tightened  up

by  the  provisions  of the Federation  of  Malaya

Agreement (Amendment) Ordinance. 1952. Sir, before

Article 16 of the Constitution came into force  on

Merdeka  Day, the 31st of August, 1957, those  who

were  born in any of the other territories outside

Penang and Malacca and who were not qualified  for

citizenship  by operation of law were required  to

make an application for Federation citizenship and

had  to satisfy the requirements laid down in  the

Federation   of  Malaya  Agreement,  1948.   These

requirements  were  those  of  residence  and   an

adequate - not an elementary - knowledge of the  Malay

language.  On or after Merdeka Day, under  Article

16  of the Constitution, any person who is born in

the  Federation before Merdeka Day and who is  not

qualified to be a citizen by operation of law must

make  an  application to the Federation Government

to be registered as a citizen and is entitled to a

grant   of   citizenship  if  he   satisfies   the

Federation Government, (a) that he has resided  in

the  Federation during the seven years immediately

preceding the date of the application for a period

amounting  in the aggregate to not less than  five

years;  (b)  that he intends to reside permanently

in   the  Federation;  (c)  that  he  is  of  good

character; (d) that he has an elementary knowledge

of the Malay language.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



Where   citizenship   is   granted   by   way   of

registration  to  those  born  in  the  Federation

before  Merdeka Day under Article 16, even if  all

the  requirements for citizenship by  registration

are  satisfied, citizenship can still  be  refused

and  there is no appeal from such refusal  to  the

courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious inference to be drawn from a study

of  this legislation is that there must be a large

number of Indians and Chinese who are born in  the

States  of  the  Federation  outside  Penang   and

Malacca  before  Merdeka Day  who  are  still  not

qualified under Federation citizenship laws for an

automatic  grant  of Federation  citizenship.  The

important consideration is that unlike those  born

in  Singapore, these persons who were born in  the

associated States of what became, on the  31st  of

August,  1957, the independent sovereign State  of

the  Federation of Malaya would be in  a  stronger

position  to  claim  automatic citizenship  rights

than  those  born in Singapore by virtue  of  this

association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a claim for automatic citizenship rights

for  the local born in Singapore would, in effect,

be  a  claim  that  they should  be  granted  more

favourable terms than the terms accorded to  those

who  were  born  in the associated States  of  the

Federation   outside  Penang  or  Malacca   before

Merdeka  Day  and  who  are not  eligible  for  an

automatic   grant   of   citizenship.   In    this

connection,  Sir, I would like to  repeat  what  I

said in this House on the 22nd of September, 1961,

during  the  debate on the White Paper  proposals,

Hansard, Volume 15, 22nd of November, columns  479

and 480. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Even if we were able to persuade the Federation

Parliament to grant more favourable terms  to  our

local-born by asking that they should be  accorded

the  same  citizenship terms as those accorded  to

persons  born  in  Penang and  Malacca  under  the

Federation  of Malaya Agreement, 1948, as  amended

by  the (Amendment) Ordinance of 1952, could  this

not  be  construed to be selling out the political

rights  of the larger number of Singapore citizens

who   have   acquired  Singapore  Citizenship   by

residence?  And, Sir, if the Federation Parliament

has  not  granted automatic Federation Citizenship

to  persons born in the associated States  of  the

Federation, outside Penang and Malacca,  would  it

be  reasonable to expect the Federation Parliament

to grant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



automatic citizenship rights to persons  who  have

only  acquired citizenship rights in Singapore  by

residence?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad the Member for Anson has at last

acknowledged  that  there can be  no  question  of

Singapore citizens automatically becoming citizens

of the Federation, because there are no provisions

for  such  automatic transformation of citizenship

in the Federation Constitution. He agrees that the

question of automatic conversion of citizenship on

merger  is  a  matter  for  negotiation  with  the

Federation   Government.  He  has   made   certain

proposals to the Tunku on automatic conversion  of

citizenship on merger, but in spite of a challenge

in  this  House, he has not dared to  publish  the

Tunku's   reply.   Sir,  it  is   a   self-evident

proposition  that  politics  is  the  art  of  the

possible,   and   it   is  also   a   self-evident

proposition that it takes two to make  a  bargain.

If  it  can be shown from a careful study  of  the

Federation  Constitution  that  it  would  not  be

practical   politics  to  expect  the   Federation

Government to grant more favourable terms  to  all

Singapore citizens than it is prepared to grant to

its  own  local-born, then any contention that  an

uncompromising  demand  for  automatic  conversion

should be pressed as a condition for merger can be

dismissed  as a dishonest claim advanced  for  the

purpose of frustrating merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position in Singapore is very unlike

that  in  the Borneo territories where the  local-born  out-number  the  residents  and  where   the

greater   proportion   of   the   local-born   are

indigenous.  An  automatic  grant  of   Federation

citizenship  in  the situation  obtaining  in  the

Borneo  territories  does  less  violence  to  the

application  of Federation citizenship  laws.  But

the  irony  of  it  is that the people  of  Borneo

themselves  should  want  merger  with  a  greater

degree of local autonomy than that accorded to the

constituent eleven States of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also referred to the

Constitution   (Amendment)  Act  of   1962   which

materially  altered the citizenship provisions  of

the   Federation  Constitution.  He  inquired   if

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



should  be  asked to opt entry into the Federation

on  a  basis  much worse than that of any  of  the

other eleven States which entered in 1957, because

of   these  additional  provisions  of  the   1962

Constitution (Amendment) Act. Sir, of course, this

is  a rhetorical question and would be the sort of

question  which one who did not want merger  would

ask.  Article  14  of the Federation  Constitution

provided   that  every  person  born  within   the

Federation  on  or after Merdeka Day  would  be  a

citizen  by  operation of law. The effect  of  the

amendment  is to modify the principle of  the  jus

soli,  the  refusal  of  an  automatic  grant   of

Federation citizenship by operation of the law  to

persons born in the Federation on or after Merdeka

Day, neither of whose parents are citizens of  the

Federation  and  neither of whom  is  a  permanent

resident  therein. Persons born in the  Federation

before  this  amendment to Article  14  came  into

force  and persons who would as a result  of  this

amendment  not  be a citizen of  any  country  are

expressly   excepted.  There  were  formerly   two

exceptions to the principle of the jus soli  which

granted  citizenship by operation  of  law  on  or

after  Merdeka Day. These were in respect  of  the

child of an envoy of a sovereign power to the Yang

di-Pertuan  Agong and the child of an enemy  alien

born  in  any  place under enemy occupation.  This

constitutional amendment added a third  exception,

namely,  a  child  born  after  the  coming   into

operation  of New Clause 2 of Article 14,  neither

of  whose  parents was a citizen of the Federation

and  neither  of  whom  was a  permanent  resident

therein. The Constitution (Amendment) Act of  1962

also repealed Article 17 of the Constitution which

authorises  registration  as  a  citizen  on   the

grounds of long residence starting before the 31st

August,  1957. This amendment was made to  conform

to  the usual practice that citizenship should  be

obtained    by   naturalisation   and    not    by

registration, by all those who claim  to  acquire

citizenship  on  the ground that  they  have  made

their permanent homes in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation is an independent sovereign

State, and is free to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



such  laws as it deems fit in respect of  its  own

citizens.  If  it is contended by the  Member  for

Anson that this whittling down of the jus soli  in

respect  of  those  born in the Federation  on  or

after  Merdeka  Day would also  be  applicable  to

Singapore  citizens,  if  there  is  merger   with

automatic conversion of citizenship, does  he  not

advance  this argument for the purpose of opposing

merger?  Of  course, his purpose in  referring  to

this  amendment  to Article 14 of  the  Federation

Constitution is to pretend that any form of merger

for Singapore after this amendment will be on less

favourable terms than the terms of merger accorded

to  the  eleven States of the Federation in  1957.

But  this  is  not  a rational  argument  as  this

modification of the jus soli is now  in  force  in

all   the  States  of  the  Federation.  Even   if

Singapore   is   to  be  merged   with   automatic

conversion of citizenship, it could have no  legal

entitlement  to  more favourable consideration  in

respect  of  the jus soli. It is quite clear  from

what  the Member for Anson has said in respect  of

the  Constitution (Amendment) Act of 1962 that  he

opposes  merger and that his contention  that  the

White  Paper  proposals should be improved  and  a

common citizenship granted so that the majority of

the people would make common cause in an effort to

achieve integration with the Federation on a basis

of  common citizenship, is just a smoke-screen  to

hide  the hypocrisy of the stand. Like the Barisan

Sosialis he opposes any form of merger, but he has

not got the courage to say so openly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have quoted many examples to show that

there are good precedents for placing a choice  of

questions  to  the electorate on the  question  of

merger  which  would  take  account  of  what  the

Barisan  Sosialis, the Member for  Anson  and  the

Member for Hong Lim have said should be the  basis

on  which  there  should be a  merger.  I  do  not

propose  to  repeat  what has been  said  in  this

debate.  There  is no good reason  why  the  White

Paper proposals should be the only proposals to be

placed to the electorate in the coming referendum.

I ask the House to reject the amendment to the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,     Sir,    the    P.A.P.    Government's

constitutional  arrangement is unreasonable.  This

has been known by the people of Singapore and flow

the true facts have become clarified, that is, the

P.A.P.'s  merger  plan is a  sell-out.  Today  the

attitude of the people towards the P.A.P. is  not

only  centred  on the question of merger.  On  the

other hand, whether the P.A.P. Government has  got

the  right to govern, it has expressed its doubts,

because its so-called phoney merger plan cannot be

covered  by its excuses. They shout the slogan  of

independence  through merger  and  the  coming  of

prosperity,  but  all  these  schemes  have   been

exposed  by  the people and the interests  of  the

people of Singapore will be subordinated to  those

of  the  Federation Government, and the people  of

Singapore  do  not  have their  basic  citizenship

rights,  equal citizenship rights. It  is  another

kind  of  colonial domination - this kind of  merger

whereby  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  from

taxation  and revenue will be handed over  to  the

Federal  Government. Once again this  has  exposed

the P.A.P. scheme and it has created doubts in the

people's minds. Their merger scheme is only for  a

few leaders in the P.A.P. They have got the S.P.A.

to support them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the national referendum

should  be  used  to ascertain the  views  of  the

people  on  the questions on the merger  proposals

passed  by this House. The people should have  the

right  to  accept or reject any proposal which  is

passed by this House. That is the true meaning  of

a  national referendum. That is why the Government

should pose only its White Paper proposals to  the

people  and  not two questions. These White  Paper

proposals   were  negotiated  by   the   Singapore

Government  and  the  Federation,  and  they  were

passed  by  this  House with the  support  of  the

S.P.A. and U.M.N.O.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>







last  year.  Since the P.A.P. has the  support  of  the

Right-wing Party of the Assembly for its Command  Paper

No.  33,  this has made the people of this  State  more

confused. Therefore, the P.A.P. leadership, in order to

save the political situation, let the people decide  on

the  referendum  issue. Now we can see that  the  Prime

Minister has brought up two questions to let the people

choose.  He  has brought up this proposal as  posed  in

Paper  Command No. 33. He does not let the  people  say

yes  or  no  to this White Paper Command  No.  33.  His

intention  is  to confuse the people. We  have  already

made  all-out  efforts  in this House  to  caution  the

Government  not to suppress the people into acceptance;

otherwise  they  will have to face the consequences  of

their act.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, since this motion was brought

up  we have debated it for two days. We have been  very

disappointed. The Marxist and Leninist followers  have

defended their arguments by means of logic. Let me now,

as  an  outsider, use common sense to  talk  about  the

purpose of their amendment. Everything is divided  into

two   aspects.  One  is  constructive;  the  other   is

destructive.  From the basis of the  question,  we  can

reach the aim we want to achieve. Let me talk about the

factors  involved in the constructive aspect. First  of

all,  we must understand where the basic question lies.

Secondly, what should be our objective and the shape of

our  objectives. Who is more adamant in pushing through

the  proposals? On the contrary, if their arguments are

based  on  the  destructive aspect, then  it  would  be

dishonest.  You  want to find the  true  cause  of  the

matter and not to find fault. We should not destroy  in

order  to achieve our purpose. In the two days'  debate

we have seen more clearly the purpose of the Member for

Queenstown's  amendment. There is  no  honesty  in  the

amendment. To put it simply, the main purpose is not as

appears in the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me explain the balance of interests in the

matter. We know that if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



a  person wants to corrupt or destroy a matter,  it  is

easy  for him. Conversely, if you want to do it from  a

constructive  point of view and you want to  prevent  a

thing from being destroyed and not to be changed in its

appearance, it is not an easy thing. For example, if we

have  a  white cloth and we want to dirty it purposely,

we  can do it within a second. If we want to destroy  a

very grand building, that process will not require more

than two seconds. If we want to restore it back to  its

original appearance, it is a difficult and long process

and a lot of methods have to be adopted in order to  do

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk further. Today the merger between

Singapore and Malaya - it is just like a foetus not  yet

born. Those people with malicious intentions will  wish

that the foetus is a female. This is not correct and it

is  malicious. In our understanding, if the  foetus  is

born, whether it is complete or not, wholesome or  not,

it will depend on whether the parents are healthy. This

is  a  point of view. From here, we can understand that

in  this amendment it has been stated very clearly that

its   purpose  is  to  achieve  the  reunification   of

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya through  merger.

The first thing is through the White Paper method, that

is,  preserving the labour and education autonomy.  The

other  method  is  unconditional merger  and  Singapore

becoming a component part of the Federation as any  one

of the other 11 States of the Federation. That is the ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  just now I was talking about the proposal (b).  I

was  talking  about the second point, i.e.,  about  the

forms  to be chosen to achieve merger between Singapore

and the Federation. Earlier I also said that what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



we  want  now  is  to find out in which  form  our

purpose should be achieved. But it is a matter for

regret that the Barisan Sosialis have been beating

about  the bush and saying that this motion  could

not  achieve  their wishes. In the course  of  the

debate  in the past two days, we have been hearing

only  such  phrases as "sell-out", "undemocratic".

But  the  truth will come out in due  course.  The

Barisan  Sosialis  have  not  substantiated  their

arguments.  They  have not advanced  any  concrete

evidence to support their arguments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to criticise a Bill,

that  is  something you can do in different  ways.

Let  me  give an example. For instance, a girl;  a

person  criticises  a  girl; from  a  constructive

point  of  view, he can say the girl is  beautiful

and  can  even describe her as a fairy or goddess.

But  if  a  person is malicious, he can very  well

describe  that girl as a devil, or  some  kind  of

goblin, or a witch. Now, to take the first person;

his   criticism   is  more  or  less   with   good

intentions. But the latter one is not so. That  is

why   in  respect  of  our  proposals,  the  first

question  posed is to ascertain the views  of  the

people and to get their constructive views. But as

for the second person mentioned, his intention  is

to  try  to  destroy, to create  misunderstanding,

hatred  and a bad impression in the minds  of  the

people, and to try to confuse and mislead them, so

as  to  achieve their own ends. Libel and  slander

can,  perhaps,  prevail for a  short  period,  but

truth  will  ultimately triumph. We can  also  say

that  truth will never be killed or destroyed.  We

can  positively say that in 1959, we had a mandate

from  the people. That is why today we have a duty

to  fulfil this mandate from the people.  What  we

are  concerned with is the livelihood and  welfare

of  the  people.  We  do not mind  the  slanderous

statements  made of the Party and of its  members.

That  is  how responsible citizens should  behave.

Here,  let me quote a Chinese poem to explain  our

intention.  It  is written by Wen Tien  Hsiang,  a

Chinese poet. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In one's life, death is always waiting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should bare our hearts to show our intentions

clean.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



That should be our intention and our attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the inception of

our  Party, we have repeatedly stressed  that  our

Party  is  a  non-Communist Party. In the  present

situation,  our  political  opponents  have   been

saying that we are anti-Communist. If we have been

anti-Communist, then it must be so because we want

to  defend ourselves. Everybody has the  right  to

defend  himself  especially when it  concerns  the

interests of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me caution those who play with fire.

There  is  a saying that these who play with  fire

will be burnt by fire. I would especially like  to

remind the Member for Anson of this. I recall that

he  asked  a  question  in this  House  about  the

refugees  fleeing into Hongkong from m  China.  He

appeared to be very concerned about them. I  would

say   that  we  are  not  the  comrades  of  these

refugees.  We are not concerned with  events  that

take place in China because these are all internal

matters of Communist China and have nothing to  do

with  us. Our duty is to protect and to take  care

of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is another point

which  we cannot understand. The Member for Anson,

in   the  one  hand,  has  strongly  attacked  the

Communists in this House and, on the other  hand,

he  has  been supporting the people who  are  pro-Peking.  That is something which is very difficult

to understand. What we are concerned with today is

the  security of our State. We should not let  the

same tragedy which happened in Communist China  to

happen here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding, let me quote a moral from

Aesop's Fables to remind the Member for Anson, "Do

not  carry  a  frozen snake in  your  bosom."  Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, as regards the  survival  of

the Member for Anson, we do not care. What we care

for  is  the  interest and the livelihood  of  the

people of Singapore. That is very important.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the motion tabled by the

Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



Minister,  we  can  prove the  dishonesty  of  the

P.A.P.   Government.   This   also   negates   the

propaganda about the merger plan in the past year.

All  this completely exposes their dishonesty.  We

have  also proved that the P.A.P. do not  dare  to

put their merger proposals to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. merger proposals alone will not be

submitted   to  the  people  for  their  decision.

Instead the Government will pose two questions for

the  people  to  choose. Apart from  the  original

White  Paper merger proposals, the other  question

is  the so-called unconditional merger. But may we

ask  what  is  meant by the phrase  "unconditional

merger"?   Has   any   detailed   plan   on   this

unconditional merger been submitted to this  House

for a decision?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the statements and

speeches  of the Ministers and the Prime Minister,

the  so-called unconditional merger will be  worse

than the White Paper merger proposals proposed  by

the   Government.  We  would  not  only  not  have

autonomy  in labour and education, but,  according

to  the  Prime Minister and the Minister for  Law,

half  the  non-local  born citizens  of  Singapore

would lose their citizenship rights under this so-called  unconditional  merger.  This  is  a   very

shameful  act on the part of the P.A.P.  Ministers

and the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister and the

other Government Ministers have found out that the

people of this country will not accept their White

Paper  merger proposals. That is why they have  to

think  of all sorts of ways and means to  try  and

distort the stand of the Barisan Sosialis  on  the

merger issue. Our demand is for a real merger,  an

equal merger, under which the 624,000 citizens  of

Singapore   will   automatically  become   Federal

citizens.  And the Government Ministers  say  that

this  demand  is  not reasonable. They  have  even

spoken   on  behalf  of  the  Prime  Minister   of

Singapore   saying  that  he  cannot  accept   the

automatic conversion of the 624,000 citizens  into

Federal citizens. The Prime Minister has said that

the  worth of the citizenship rights of  the  non-local  born citizens is only one dollar.  The  so-called



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister,  who  represents  the  people  of

Singapore,  is  really  insulting  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. leaders have

not  only  distorted the stand of our  Party,  but

they  have  also  insulted the reputation  of  the

624,000 citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the fact that they were elected by

the  people  to  become  the  Prime  Minister  and

Ministers, we can see very clearly from their past

behaviour  and performance that their continuation

in  office  is  illegal. All the actions  and  the

measures taken by the Government in the past  will

not  become valid. The P.A.P. were elected by  the

people,  but today they have considered  that  the

citizenship  right  of the  people  is  worth  one

dollar  and  that the people are not qualified  to

become Federal citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the constitutional

arrangements before us today have been proposed by

the  PAP.  Government. They are  embodied  in  the

White Paper merger proposals which were passed  by

this House sometime ago. Therefore, the people  of

Singapore  should have the right to say  "yes"  or

"no"  to  the constitutional arrangements proposed

by the Government. The question to be posed to the

people  should be the White Paper merger proposals

put  forward by the P.A.P. We hope that the  Prime

Minister   will   not   bring   forward    another

proposal-the so-called unconditional merger.  They

should not pose another question so that when  the

people  go to vote, they will not be able  to  say

"yes"  or "no" to the questions posed. Their blank

votes will be construed as votes in favour of  the

Government's merger proposals. Therefore,  we  are

of the opinion that the P.A.P. and their Ministers

are not honest. They will be malicious if they try

to pose these questions. These questions are posed

for  the  sake  of  a few Ministers.  We  strongly

oppose  this sort of national referendum in  which

two questions are to be posed to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, earlier on we have heard the Prime Minister say in his speech that he also

accepted the amendment proposed by the Member  for

Cairnhill. This amendment is such that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



when the two questions are posed, there will be  a

third  alternative question. That is,  the  people

will   be  asked  to  choose  another  alternative

question. That is "to enter Malaysia on  terms  no

less  favourable  than the terms  for  the  Borneo

territories". From the Prime Minister's acceptance

of  the  Member for Cairnhill's amendment, we  can

once   again  expose  their  behaviour  and  their

motives.  We do not know at present what  are  the

merger  conditions  for the three  territories  in

Borneo. The Government is now ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  just  now I talked about the Prime  Minister

accepting  the amendment moved by the  Member  for

Cairnhill  regarding the proposal for merger.  The

Government's  action was completely dishonest  and

showed their true colours too. I want to point out

to  the  Member for Cairnhill that he  should  not

think  that by bringing up this amendment  he  can

confuse the people in regard to the proposals  for

merger.  The merger stand of the Barisan  Sosialis

does not permit any distortion by other people. In

the  past,  the  P.A.P. Ministers  and  the  Prime

Minister, and the P.A.P. Political Bureau used all

measures  and  made  all efforts  to  distort  our

stand.  The Prime Minister even went to the extent

of saying that in his merger proposal, the meaning

of "citizen" and "national" is the same and that a

citizen enjoys the same rights as a national. This

has  already been clearly seen by the people,  and

now   they  are  trying  to  distort  our   stand.

Conversely, although the Ministers and  the  Prime

Minister continue to distort our stand, they  have

made  the people understand more about our  stand.

Their  efforts to distort our stand have  not  had

any good result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to reiterate the Barisan

Sosialis  stand. The people of the two territories

should  have  equal rights, that is,  when  merger

comes,  and  all the citizens of Singapore  should

automatically become citizens of the Federation of

Malaya.  Secondly, there should  be  proportionate

representation in the Federal Parliament. If these

conditions  are not acceptable to the  Federation,

we  suggest a closer relationship between the  two

territories,  that the people of Singapore  should

reach  a basis of confederation. This is the stand

we   have   been  advocating  to  the  people   of

Singapore. We do not allow anybody to distort this

stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for Law,

in  his  speech, quoted many laws  passed  by  the

colonial  governments to show that if merger  were

to  take place, the people of Singapore would  not

automatically become citizens of the Federation of

Malaya.  If that is the logic of the P.A.P.,  then

we say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P. leaders have completely regarded  the

colonial  laws as true, and in doing so they  have

acted contrary to the people's wishes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance also repeated in his speech

that the merger plan was very good. At  the same   time,

he  also  advocated   the   unequal citizenship rights in

the merger proposal. In  the past, we have pointed out

that the P.A.P.'s merger

proposal,  if it were to be realised,  would  make

the  people  of  Singapore second-class  citizens,

i.e.,  in  the  arrangement  of  the  P.A.P. type

merger, the people of Singapore will have only the

right  to  get the same passport as  that  of the

citizens  of  the Federation and will also  enable

the  Federation Government to conscript our youth.

Can  the citizens of our State move freely in  the

country?  Can the people of Singapore  under  this

type  of  arrangement have the right to apply  for

lands   in   Johore  for  cultivation?   Can   the

unemployed  in  Singapore have equal opportunities

of getting jobs as the citizens of the Federation?

These are questions which cannot be replied to  by

them.  The Finance Minister just now only repeated

his  past  statements, but  he  has  not  told  us

whether  after merger we will have common benefits

and  rights  as the citizens of the Federation  of

Malaya.  These  are  questions which  they  cannot

answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we also heard the

Government  Parliamentary Secretaries saying  that

we  have gone against the original merger stand of

the  P.A.P. We do not know what they were pointing

at.  For example, in the past we have pointed  out

the reason why the P.A.P. has gone down to such  a

low level now. The main reason is that the P.A.P. has only adopted a policy planned by a few leaders

in  the  P.A.P.  We know there  is  no  democratic

discussion  in the P.A.P., and what a good  merger

plan  is like. From the announcement of the Member

for Bras Basah when she left the P.A.P. we can see

this.  She  said, "I do not want to think  of  one

thing any say another thing as I did and had to do

when  I was in the P.A.P." The P.A.P. Members  say

things without any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



conscience. The Member for Bras Basah pointed  out

very  clearly in her announcement that there  were

only  a few leaders in the P.A.P. who had any  say

in  policy matters. Now, the P.A.P. has come  down

to  this low level and yet these few leaders still

have  not repented and listened to the people.  So

we  can  say that the Prime Minister is  a  clever

person. The Minister for Law is one who knows  the

law.  They  should  not  use  the  law  itself  to

obliterate their future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang) (In Mandarin):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in the past the Prime  Minister

has  reminded  Members  of this  House  that  when

playing games one should keep to the rules of  the

games.   But  today  the  P.A.P.  Government   has

entirely  acted  against  such  rules.   In  other

words,  the  motion  before this  House  today  is

completely contrary to the spirit of democracy and

the  Constitution.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the  Prime

Minister, on the 24th of September last year, at a

Press conference held at Radio Singapore, promised

that  the people of Singapore could express  their

views on the P.A.P.'s White Paper on merger  in  a

referendum.   But  today the  Prime  Minister  has

entirely forgotten about his promises made in  the

past.  Instead, he asks the people of Singapore to

choose from the three unacceptable proposals,  one

containing  the  P.A.P. type  of  White  Paper  on

merger.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister,  in

moving  his motion yesterday, said this.   Let  me

quote  what the Prime Minister said yesterday - this

is the Nanyang Siang Pau of the 10th of July:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When faced with the White Paper proposals and a

complete merger like Penang and Johore and another

merger   proposal  not  inferior  to  the   merger

conditions   for  Borneo  territories   as   their

choices,   the people would definitely choose  the

White   Paper   on   merger  in  an   overwhelming

majority.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, that is the intrigue behind the

Prime  Minister's motion.  That is the way he  has

set  a  trap in order to let the people fall  into

it.  From this quotation of the Prime Minister, we

can  fish out the motives and the scheming of  the

Prime Minister in this motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, the Prime

Minister  has  mentioned the  White  Paper  merger

proposals.  I  do  not intend  to  deal  with  the

contents of the White Paper, but I would  like  to

point  out  to  you  that Paper  Command  33,  the

constitutional  arrangements  arrived  at  by  the

P.A.P.  Government and the Federation  Government,

was  introduced to this House on the 15th November

and  the  House was asked to decide on this  White

Paper  arrived at by the Governments  of  the  two

territories. Later, with the support of the S.P.A.

fellow  travellers,  these White  Paper  proposals

were approved by this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before the passage of this

White  Paper,  the P.A.P. Government  had  exerted

their  utmost  in giving wide publicity  to  their

White Paper proposals. The Ministry of Culture was

used  as  propaganda machinery for the  P.A.P. to

publicise  the  White  Paper  proposals  in   four

languages.   The   Ministry  of  Culture   printed

thousands and thousands of pamphlets on the  White

Paper  on merger for distribution to many  people.

The  travelling  vans of the Ministry  of  Culture

went   to  various  places  to  distribute   these

pamphlets. From this we can know very clearly that

the people of Singapore are rather clear about the

contents  of  this  White  Paper  on  merger.  The

Government have achieved the purpose they want  in

their  propaganda activities. But  today,  we  see

that  the  P.A.P. and the Prime Minister have  not

the  guts  to  carry  out what they  promised  the

people  on 24th September last year, that  is,  to

let  the people decide whether they want to accept

this  White Paper on merger. The P.A.P. think that

autonomy  in labour and education, as embodied  in

the  White Paper, would receive the support of the

majority  of  the  workers  and  the  Chinese   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have also made use of the State

Advocate-General to issue statements to  say  that

the terms "citizen" and "national" are the same in

meaning, but all these propaganda activities  have

failed  the P.A.P. because the people of Singapore

have come to know the actual contents of the White

Paper on merger, and that is why everywhere



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



the people are opposing the conditions as embodied

in  the  White  Paper. The P.A.P. leadership  have

also  got  wind of this information and they  have

come  to  realise that if they were  to  put  this

White  Paper  on merger to the people  to  decide,

then  it would be like an earthen cow dropped into

the  ocean never to come back again. It has become

a   foregone  case  for  them.  That  is  why   in

introducing the motion the Prime Minister has  not

posed only one question to the people. Instead  he

has  proposed two questions: one is a complete and

unconditional merger on an equal basis  as  Penang

and  Malacca, which he has turned into the present

(b) proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, our stand on merger was clearly enunciated

during  the time when we were debating the  merger

proposals in this House and on other occasions.  I

am  not  prepared to go into details and to repeat

so  many  things already uttered by my colleagues,

but  I  would  like to point out  clearly  to  the

P.A.P. leadership our stand on  merger.  I  would

like  now to quote from Hansard, Volume 15, No.  5

of  21st November last year, from a speech made by

our  Party  Chairman  to explain  our  stand.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Member for Queenstown,  in  the

middle  of  column  400  to  column  401,  clearly

enunciated our merger stand. I do not want to read

all  the words there, but the Minister for Finance

just now, when touching upon our Barisan stand  on

merger,  has distorted it. He has also quoted  out

of  context. He has explained things according  to

the   P.A.P. dictionary  and  has  entirely   and

completely distorted our stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, columns 400 and 401 of this

particular Hansard have clearly stated our  stand,

and  I will not repeat what the Member for Queenstown  has  said there. I would like only to  point

out  that  the  P.A.P. Government  think  that  by

distorting  our  stand they  may  defeat  us.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we have not changed  our  stand  on

merger. We will struggle to the end to secure  and

preserve the basic and democratic rights which the

people  of Singapore now enjoy. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

when  introducing  his motion the  Prime  Minister

said   that   he   unconditionally  accepted   the

amendment of the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



for Cairnhill - "to enter Malaysia on terms no less

favourable   than  the  terms   for   the   Borneo

territories".  Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask,  what  are

the terms for the Borneo territories? We are still

in the dark. You will remember that yesterday when

the  Prime Minister was making a speech the Member

for  Anson asked him whether he could disclose the

terms  of merger for the Borneo territories before

the  referendum  was  held,  but  he  evaded  that

question. He did not give an answer to that.  From

this,  we  can see very clearly that the so-called

terms  of  merger  for the Borneo territories  are

worse  terms which the people of Singapore  cannot

accept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you can see why the Prime

Minister  in his speech showed so much  confidence

that   the  people  would  overwhelmingly  support

Command  Paper 33 of 1961. Proposals (b)  and  (e)

will be worse than proposal (a). The people do not

know  what are the contents of proposals  (b)  and

(c), but they do know that the poison in proposals

(b)  and  (c)  is  worse than  that  contained  in

proposal (a).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill

yesterday  said that the White Paper proposals  on

merger  were the best the P.A.P. Government  could

get,  but  strangely  enough,  he  introduced   an

amendment  as  another  proposal.  Why  should  he

introduce the third proposition when he knows full

well   that  such  a  proposition  will   not   be

acceptable to the people of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember that on Friday last

the House received the amendment of the Member for

Cairnhill. On Saturday, the Prime Minister and the

Member for Cairnhill went together to Kuala Lumpur

on  a pilgrimage to pay their homage there, and as

a  result  of this joint trip, the Prime  Minister

accepted the amendment of the Member for Cairnhill

as  the  third alternative for the people to  vote

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has

said  many times that the interests of the  people

and the State must come first before the interests

of the political Parties. He has also prided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



himself   on  the  fact  that  his  Party   is   a

responsible  Party and that he  is  a  responsible

Member. He described the debate in this House as a

battle  between the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P.  This

specious  argument  of  the Member  for  Cairnhill

should  be  rebutted. He said yesterday  that  the

P.A.P.'s merger proposals were the best that  they

could  get and yet he introduced another  proposal

which  is worse than the P.A.P.'s proposal, hoping

that  he  could deceive and mislead the people  of

Singapore  into  voting  for  either  alternative.

Therefore,  we can point out that the  Member  for

Cairnhill  is not concerned with the  interest  of

the  people of Singapore; he is responsible to the

P.A.P. only  and  not  to  the  people.   He   is

interested  in  saving the P.A.P. Government  from

collapsing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill knows

that  the  P.A.P.'s White Paper  merger  proposals

will not be acceptable to the people of Singapore.

He  says that if these proposals were to be put to

the  people, they would reject them. He termed the

Command  Paper 33 as a form of closer relationship

between the two territories and not as merger. The

Prime  Minister of the Federation  of  Malaya  has

issued  several statements to the Press confirming

that the present constitutional arrangement is not

merger but a closer partnership. I believe he  was

very  honest when he said that. However, the  Back

and Front Benches of the Government have said that

the Barisan Sosialis are opposed to merger. But as

a  matter of fact, this is not merger. We have not

seen  the Prime Minister and the Ministers of  the

P.A.P. deny the statement by the Prime Minister  of

the Federation of Malaya and the leaders of S.P.A.

Therefore, we can clearly see that the P.A.P. has

acquiesced in the fact that the White Paper merger

proposals  are only a form of closer  relationship

and  not  merger. But the P.A.P.'s  Ministers  and

Members always accuse us of having delayed  merger

or  of  opposing merger. Their pretext and excuses

can   be   explained  only  by  their  own  P.A.P.

dictionary.  The common run of the  people  cannot

accept their explanation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister yesterday said

that  we,  the  Barisan Sosialis, have made  a  mistake

about  the so-called Penang and Malacca type of merger.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, let me quote the speech by the Prime

Minister.  He  said  that  the Barisan  Sosialis  later

expressed the hope that the citizens of Singapore could

automatically become citizens of Malaya. On this  point

they  had the support of the Member for Anson and  the

Member  for  Hong Lim. The Prime Minister  pointed  out

that if the constitutional documents could give support

to   their   assertion  that  the  citizens  here   can

automatically become citizens of Malaya, then let it be

decided  by  impartial Judges. If these  constitutional

documents  do not include these terms as the  basis  of

their  arguments,  then  all these  arguments  will  be

rejected.  What  he meant was that if  we  the  Barisan

Sosialis demand automatic conversion of citizens,  then

we  must find a constitutional precedent, otherwise our

demand will have to be rejected. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

Prime Minister is an expert on law, but when we debated

the National Referendum Bill and the question of merger

in  this  House, their tactics were to cite precedents.

When these precedents could not be found, they tried to

distort the stand of the Opposition. If that was of  no

avail to them, then they would say the Opposition  were

Communists or Communist stooges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us presume that what the Prime

Minister said is correct; then at least we are able  to

find  one  precedent to show the P.A.P. that  there  is

such  a  precedent.  You know that  the  administrative

rights of the eleven States in the Federation of Malaya

are  vested in the Central Government, that is to  say,

they have no autonomy. You cannot find any autonomy  in

any  of  the eleven States in the Federation of Malaya.

But  if,  according to the logic of the Prime Minister,

we  can  find this precedent in the White Paper  merger

proposals,  Singapore  will  become  a  State  of   the

Federation  of Malaya. But according to the details  of

the  White  Paper merger proposals Singapore will  have

autonomy in labour and education, but this is not to be

found in other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



States  in the Federation of Malaya. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

therefore  we  can  see  very  clearly  that   if   the

Federation  Government can create  this  constitutional

precedent, why cannot our 624,000 citizens in Singapore

become  citizens of the Federation of Malaya?  And,  in

fact,   according  to  Articles  17  and  22   of   the

Constitution of the Federation of Malaya, the  citizens

of  Singapore have all the necessary qualifications  to

become citizens of the Federation of Malaya. Therefore,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, we can clearly see his  argument  in

defence of himself cannot hold water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister yesterday mentioned the letter which our Secretary-General wrote to the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya. Let me quote a small paragraph from this. The Prime Minister said, "Any political Party in the Assembly can directly contact

the Government of the Federation of Malaya to negotiate

for better terms on the question of merger. As a matter

of  fact, the Member for Cairnhill tried to do so,  and

he also knew the actual position. Similarly, the Member

for Cairnhill also knew the views of the Prime Minister

of  the  Federation on this matter.  Even  the  Barisan

Sosialis, which is controlled by the Communists through

their  open  front organisations and their leader,  Mr

Lim  Ching Siong, publicly in April wrote to the  Prime

Minister  of  the  Federation of  Malaya.  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to talk about the contents of the

letter  between  Mr  Lim Ching  Siong  and  the  Prime

Minister  of  the Federation of Malaya.  I  believe  my

Party  Chairman  will  disclose the  contents  of  this

letter  at  an  appropriate time. But what  I  want  to

stress  here  is  that  the Prime Minister  accused  my

Secretary-General  as  the leader  of  the  open  front

organisations of the Communists. But the Prime Minister

of  the  Federation of Malaya, when questioned  by  the

reporters,  said that he could not describe the  letter

as  one  addressed to him by a Communist. He personally

believed  that this letter could not be one sent  by  a

Communist.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, this  statement  of  the

Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



published on the 29th of March in the English Press and

the Chinese Press in big headlines. I wish to point out

here  that  the  Prime Minister of  the  Federation  of

Malaya  openly  admitted that the letter  sent  by  the

Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis was not  from

the  Communists. In other words, the Prime Minister  of

the Federation of Malaya has admitted that my Secretary-General  is  not  a  Communist.  But  the  P.A.P.,  the

Ministers  and  the Prime Minister have every  now  and

then accused us of being the stooges of the Communists,

and  that  our Secretary-General is the leader  of  the

open  front organisations of the Communist Party.  From

the  statements of the two Prime Ministers, we can  see

clearly  that the Prime Minister of Singapore  is  very

dishonest.  He is now trying to use all sorts  of  ways

and means to smear the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis,

hoping  that  there might be some people who  could  be

misled  by  their  smears and their  intimidation.  His

speeches  are  intended  to  prevent  the  masses  from

supporting us. I wish to tell the Front-Benches and the

Back-Benches  of the P.A.P. that their  smear  campaign

will  not  be able to prevent the broad masses  of  the

people front rallying to our side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education talked at great

length.  I am delighted to hear from him. At least  the

Parliamentary  Secretary in his speech  yesterday  also

admitted  that  our  stand on the  merger  question  is

correct.   If,   my  memory  is  not   incorrect,   the

Parliamentary  Secretary said that what  he  meant  was

that  the  624,000  citizens of  Singapore  can  become

citizens of the Federation of Malaya. He went on to say

they  would  not  trouble the Barisan Sosialis  to  put

forth their merger proposals. From the speeches made by

the   Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for

Education  it  proves  that our  stand  on  the  merger

question  is  based  on the interests  of  the  624,000

Singapore citizens. At the same time, the Minister  for

Finance  also  confirmed this in the last radio  forum.

The  Minister for Finance described our merger proposal

as a kind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



of super merger. Therefore, we can clearly see that our

stand  on  merger is consistent. We have never  changed

and  it is correct. But our stand has been deliberately

distorted by the P.A.P. It has been turned into  a  so-called  unconditional  merger. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the

people  of Singapore now pay a lot of attention to  the

outcome  of the constitutional future of Singapore.  In

the   coming   referendum,  they  will  decide,   their

political power in the future. Therefore, the amendment

moved  by the Member for Queenstown is the only way  to

express  their views. I believe that since  the  P.A.P.

have  already made a lot of propaganda about the P.A.P.

type of merger for about a year, they have not got  the

trust of the people. What the people want to decide now

is  the merger proposal contained in Cmd. Paper 33. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, when I began my speech, I said  that  in

playing  games,  we  must follow the  rules.  Now,  the

P.A.P. and their fellow travellers, i.e., the  S.P.A.,

have  played a game not based on the rules. But I  will

tell  them not to forget that when they play this  type

of  game  without rules, they must remember  that  they

have 624,000 citizens as an audience watching them.  If

they   really   do  not  regard  the  consequences   as

important,  and continue with this type of a  game  and

disregard the anger of these 624,000 people, then  they

had better consider the interests of these people.



<br><br>10.36 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu) (In Mandarin): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the oligarchy of the P.A.P. has made  all

sorts  of  tricks to popularise their merger plan.  But

this  merger  plan  is not acceptable  to  the  people.

Therefore,  they  purposely distort the  stand  of  the

Barisan Sosialis and try to smear it. They have already

clouded  the  issue  by  their proposals  in  order  to

confuse  the people and reap some harvest  out  of  the

confusion. Mr Speaker, Sir, from the various steps  in

the   P.A.P.'s  plan  on  merger,  we  know  they  have

distorted  the honest opinions of the Opposition.  They

have brought out two proposals which are almost similar

in nature to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



let  the people choose. They have already told us  that

they  want to bring up two questions, but we feel  that

both  questions are the same and not beneficial to  the

people.  Then, under such circumstances,  how  can  the

people  choose?  The intention of the P.A.P. has  been

contrary to what the Prime Minister has said previously

at  various  Press conferences, that  is,  to  let  the

people decide on the merger issue. What should be  left

to  the people to decide? What does this mean? That is,

the  people  should be allowed to say  `yes'  or  `no'.

Since  the two questions in the motion are exactly  the

same,  the  P.A.P. leaders are afraid  of  putting  the

merger  proposal as contained in Cmd. Paper  33  to  be

decided by the people. Real gold will stand the test of

the touchstone. But the P.A.P. dare not put this to the

people  for approval or rejection. They have repeatedly

distorted our Barisan Sosialis stand on merger and they

have  included clauses like that of blank votes  to  be

deemed  as  in  favour of the Government's  view.  From

this, we can see that the Prime Minister's intention is

to  push  through merger. This is a matter of "Heads  I

win: tails you lose." This is a trick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to state here the basic

stand  of  our  Barisan Sosialis. These few  days,  the

Member  for  Cairnhill  and the  P.A.P.  Members  have

continued to distort our stand. I would like to clarify

a certain point. The P.A.P's oligarchy has insisted on

putting the Malacca and Penang type of merger out,  and

let  labour  and education policies be decided  by  the

Central  Government.  They  figure  this  is  what  the

Barisan  Sosialis want. This we have heard  repeatedly.

They  have  emphasised it many, many  times,  But  they

still  bite on it. What is the intention? The intention

is  this.  If  they  can hoodwink the  people  on  this

question,  they  can  bring up  two  questions  in  the

referendum,  and  they can achieve their  purpose  very

easily  in  this way. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Penang  and

Malacca type of merger - whose proposal is it? In  August

1961,  the  Barisan Sosialis already clearly  announced

publicly  in the papers that we want to have a complete

and  true merger immediately on the basis of the Penang

and Malacca type of merger and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



that  the citizens of Singapore should be automatically

converted  into  Federation citizens,  and  that  there

should  be proportionate representation in the  Central

Parliament. Our stand has been very firm.



<br><br>10.44 p.m.





<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also very simple and clear. The White Paper on

merger in this House was brought out in November  1961.

We  have allowed a few months before the tabling of the

motion. Why do the P.A.P. want to distort our stand and

say  that  we advocate the Penang and Malacca  type  of

merger?   Why  do  they  not  talk  about  proportional

representation and automatic conversion of citizenship?

We   want   Singapore  citizens  to  be   automatically

converted  into  Federal citizens. But the  P.A.P. say

that  in  this way we will sell out the rights of  over

half  of the 624,000 Singapore citizens. We only quoted

the Penang and Malacca type as an example, but this has

been  misconstrued  by others. The P.A.P. leaders  are

very  good at distorting other people's stand and  also

quoting them out of context. They have manufactured the

Penang  and  Malacca type of merger and have attributed

it  to  the Barisan Sosialis. Fortunately the  Workers'

Party in the Opposition has seen this clearly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all these facts bear out our

past argument that the P.A.P. have tried to confuse the

people by bringing in two questions for merger. The two

questions to be posed are similar in nature. Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, if the P.A.P. oligarchy had observed  the

rules  of  democracy  and were just,  they  would  have

proposed  in the motion of the Prime Minister only  one

question,  and  that  should be  the  question  in  the

referendum for the people to decide. Unfortunately, our

request was defeated by the P.A.P. and the S.P.A. out-voting us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, the definition of "merger" ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr G. Kandasamy): Point of order. I think we

are short of a quorum.

<br><br>10.50 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (In Mandarin): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  what is the definition of the term "merger"?  The

meaning of merger is to unite two States together. Now,

if  merger  between  Singapore and  the  Federation  of

Malaya  is  to be a true merger, then it  should  be  a

reunification   of   the  two  territories,   and   the

Governments  of the two territories should resolve  and

the  political  Parties of the two  territories  should

face  the  people  and let them  decide  as  to  which

political  Party can meet the wishes of the people,  so

that  a Central Government can be elected by the people

of  the  two  territories, and the two territories  are

thus  united  into one. That is what we  understand  by

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Member for Cairnhill expounded his

theories  in this House. But we the representatives  of

the  people  of Singapore understand his attitude  very

well.  That is his usual practice. All his actions  are

taken with the motive of doing something at the expense

of  the  people,  and  the  people  will  pass  correct

judgment on him. Under British colonial directions, the

merger plan regarding the two territories has become  a

controversial topic in the political arena.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of people. One insists on abiding

by  the will of the people. This is in accordance  with

the wishes of the people. In other words, this type  of

people would seek a type of merger that is supported by

and  wanted by the people. The other type of people  is

like  the  Member for Cairnhill and the P.A.P. Members.

All  their  activities are based on personal  interest.

They are used to fooling the people and to intimidating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



and coercing them into accepting their schemes in order

to   realise  their  purposes  and  so  to   help   the

colonialist plot succeed. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  the

Member  for  Cairnhill is of this type. The  speech  he

made in this House yesterday mainly revolves round  the

point  that  it  is correct and proper  for  the  Prime

Minister  to  move a motion providing two  propositions

for  the  people to decide. From this we can  see  that

they are harping on the same tune.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that when the White Paper

on  merger of the Government was introduced and debated

in  this  House, it got the support of the  Member  for

Cairnhill. As a result of that support, it was  passed.

We  tried our best to boycott their scheme and  to  let

the people see through their scheming and to understand

our  stand.  Now,  since the Member for  Cairnhill  has

supported  the White Paper on merger, why  has  he  not

persuaded the P.A.P. Government to pose

only  one  question, i.e. on the White Paper on  merger

alone?  Why should he allow the Government to pose  two

or  more  questions? Perhaps it is because he  and  the

P.A.P. Members are people of the same nature. It is  no

wonder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance

once  again stressed his argument that the citizens  of

Singapore  would not become second-class  citizens  and

that  their type of merger has met with the  wishes  of

the  people.  I think he was only trying to  give  some

reason  to  justify the posing of two  propositions  as

mentioned in the motion. I  am sure all the people  know

that  all this is humbug, because in the past they have

been  used to the terms "citizens" and "nationals" over

Radio Singapore and at forums. Since according to  them

citizenship is similar to nationality, why should  they

not  straightaway  put their merger  proposals  to  the

people  for a decision? Their type of merger  does  not

meet  with the wishes of the people. According to their

merger  proposals, a  lot of people  will  lose  their

citizenship rights and one-quarter of our revenue  will

be given to the Central Government. That will amount to

$90  million.  Our internal affairs  will  have  to  be

controlled by the Central Government. I think  the  sum

required  to be spent on the administration of internal

affairs would amount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



to  tens  of  millions of dollars. Why  should  we

contribute  more  than what is actually  required?

From all this we can see that the arguments of the

Minister  for Finance are not sound. By that  type

of  merger  we will be giving away our rights  and

many  other things. On the other hand, we  do  not

get  equal benefits. How could this type of merger

be  acceptable? Now I want to stress this  because

the  Minister for Finance has said so many things.

I  urge  the Prime Minister to withdraw his motion

and  put his White Paper merger proposals  to  the

people as the sole question for them to decide so

that  we  may know whether his White Paper  merger

proposals are good or bad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members will remember

that when we were debating the National Referendum

Bill   in  Committee  we  pointed  out   to   the

Government   that  it  was  essential   that   the

questions  to  be  posed in the merger  referendum

should  be questions that have been fully  debated

in  the Assembly and that they should embrace  all

possible   and   practicable  forms   of   closer

association  with the Federation  of  Malaya.  The

Prime  Minister in his motion has  suggested  two

questions. One is that of Command Paper 33 and the

other  is complete and unconditional merger on  an

equal  basis  with  the  other  eleven  states  in

accordance  with the constitutional  documents  of

the  Federation of Malaya. This the Prime Minister

says,  covers the stand of some of the  Opposition

Parties,  particularly  the  Workers'  Party,  the

Barisan Sosialis and the U.P.P. Sir, the S.P.A. is

indeed  very anxious that the referendum on merger

should   contain  all  possible  forms  of  closer

association  and I therefore during the  Committee

stage  of the National Referendum Bill brought  to

the notice of the House that I intended to move an

amendment posing a third question. I want it to be

understood  in  this House lest the distortionists

start distorting again that the proposal that I am

moving now is not a S.P.A. question. It should not

be taken to be a S.P.A.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>





question  put into a merger referendum. It  should

be  taken  as  a contribution from the  S.P.A. to

assist the Assembly to pose all possible forms  of

closer   association  for  the  decision  of   the

electorate.  The S.P.A. - Alliance  still  stand  by

Command Paper 33.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now examine the three questions that

are  before the House. The first question is  that

of  Command  Paper 33. A full and  lengthy  debate

took  place  on the agreement reached between  the

Singapore  Government and the  Government  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya.  Full  details   of   that

agreement  have been published and are well  known

to the electorate. The P.A.P. brought confusion to

the  minds  of  the electorate by describing  this

form  of  agreement as merger. We have  said  that

this  is  nothing but a form of closer association

and if the word "merger" is to be used, perhaps we

can describe the agreement reached between the two

Governments  as  a form of half merger.  It  is  a

first step ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I trust the hon. Member is

not  reopening the debate on the Prime  Minister's

motion. He can just touch on it in passing. I hope

he  is  not reopening the debate. He is moving  an

amendment. But I did make it very clear the debate

should  range  over not only the Prime  Minister's

motion,  but  also the amendment proposed  by  the

Member for Queenstown and also the amendment which

is now being proposed by the Member for Cairnhill,

and the other two notions.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I do not

propose to reopen the debate on command Paper  33.

What I am trying to point out to the House are the

various  forms of closer association and  want  to

take my argument step by step. Command Paper 33 is

half  merger.  Call  it  a  50  per  cent  merger.

Therefore,   what   is  the  next   possible   and

practicable   question?  That  is  proposal   (b),

complete  and  unconditional merger  on  an  equal

basis  with  the  11  states  at  present  in  the

Federation. That is something which the  public

know.  That  is something which we  all  know.  We

cannot  as  an alternative ask for a 75  per  cent

merger or 125 per cent merger, because it will  be

meaningless.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



The  electorate will not know what a 75  per  cent

merger is, or what a 125 per cent merger is.  They

know  what the White Paper is, and they know  what

complete and unconditional merger is. It is indeed

unfortunate that in this tussle between the P.A.P.

and the ex-P.A.P. a lot of extraneous matters were

brought  into the debate to confuse the  minds  of

the electorate. The P.A.P. claims that proposition

(b)  does  not mean automatic citizenship  rights;

the Barisan Sosialis claim that what they mean  by

complete   and   unconditional   merger   includes

automatic citizenship right. All this argument  is

unnecessary. The citizenship rights are spelt  out

in  the constitution and there is no need for  the

clever  wigs  of the P.A.P. to try to  give  their

interpretation of what the constitution means.  In

the same way, the Barisan should not try to do the

same thing. The Workers' Party representative, the

Member  for  Anson,  tries  to  explain  his   own

interpretation,  and  his interpretation  is  such

that  not  one citizen of Singapore can  become  a

citizen  of  the Federation of Malaya, and  things

are getting more and more ridiculous. It gets more

and  more ridiculous through the unnecessary party

warfare  that has been waged over the question  of

merger  for a long, long time, so much so that  at

times Members of the Assembly do get confused too.

If it is the desire of some Opposition Parties - the

Barisan  Sosialis,  the  Workers'  Party  and  the

U.P.P.   -  to  clamour  for  complete   and

unconditional  merger, then it is up  to  them  to

hold  referendum meetings to tell  the  electorate

what  they  mean by what they want.  If  they  can

convince   the   electorate  that   complete   and

conditional    merger,   even    with    automatic

citizenship rights, will mean that the citizens of

Singapore,  when  they  become  citizens  of   the

Federation, must accept all that is implied in the

Constitution  of  the Federation of  Malaya  where

provision has been made for a number of things, it

would,  in my view, be difficult for the  citizens

of   Singapore  to  accept  that  at  the  present

juncture.  They  can have all the privileges  that

they  want,  but they must not overlook  the  fact

that they too must accept all the limitations that

are   imposed  under  the  Constitution   of   the

Federation  of Malaya. So if they were to  conduct

referendum meetings and present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



their  particular  case  in  a  straightforward  manner

without  trying  to mislead the public  into  believing

that complete and unconditional merger is going just to

mean  automatic citizenship rights for the citizens  of

Singapore, then the public would have been misled  into

voting for something which is not true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have heard it talked about in coffee shops and

elsewhere by the opponents of Cmd. Paper 33 that it was

not right that the Singapore Government should accept a

position  of not having the same status as the  Bornean

territories. The opponents of Cmd. Paper 33, of course,

tried  their best to confuse the electorate. They  said

that Cmd. Paper 33 would place Singapore in an inferior

position when compared with the position of any one  of

the Bornean territories, and because Malaysia is in the

process   of   formation  and   because   the   Bornean

territories are coming into this association  with  the

Federation of Malaya and Singapore, therefore, I say it

is but right that the electorate of Singapore should be

given  the  opportunity to pass judgment on whether  or

not they prefer Singapore to enter Malaysia on terms no

less  favourable than the terms offered to  the  Borneo

territories.  I  do  not  know  which  political  Party

represented in this Assembly would be wanting  to  take

up  that  line  of closer relationship, but  it  is,  of

course,  free to those that have preached this line  of

argument to hold referendum meetings and try to get the

people  to their line of thought and vote for  proposal

(c), brought in by me as an amendment to the motion. To

me,  Sir,  these are the only possible and  practicable

forms of closer association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have said that they have a

further  proposal  to put forward, a  fourth  proposal,

which  should  be  put as one of the questions  in  the

referendum merger. We have not heard what that proposal

is, but we are prepared to listen to what they have  to

say.  But if I, as an old Member of this Assembly,  can

give  a  little  bit of advice to the  Members  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  if  they  want  their  case  to  be

properly, thoroughly and carefully considered, it would

be  in  their  interest  to present  their  case  in  a

straightforward, understandable manner without bringing

in any extraneous matters like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P. is  trying to cheat  the  electorate,  the

Barisan  Sosialis is trying to look after the interests

of  the  electorate, and that it is a Barisan  Sosialis

question.  Questions to be posed in a merger referendum

should  have  no party political content. It  is  vital

that  in the consideration of the questions to be posed

in  a  referendum, the interests of the country  should

come  first, and that the questions to be posed  should

be   questions  that  are  easily  understood  by   the

electorate and that the proposal should be one that has

some  known  form.  It would be wrong  if  the  Barisan

Sosialis  were  to  put  up a proposal  that  bears  no

relation  to  facts. It would be wrong if  the  Barisan

Sosialis  want to put a proposal in order to appeal  to

the  emotions  of the public instead of  putting  up  a

proposal  that  would best serve the interests  of  the

public.  And  what is more important is  that  whatever

proposal  we  put forward to the electorate  for  their

decision, it must be one that can be acceptable to  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Original Question was,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

<br><br>11.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is good to

see the Member for Cairnhill being so considerate and

solicitous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



of  the welfare of the people of Singapore. He says  he

would  like  to see all forms of merger  offered  in  a

referendum.  But  let us ask: what  are  the  forms  of

merger  that will be offered in the referendum?  He  is

also very modest - he does not want to claim that it  is

a  S.P.A. question. It is merely a contribution towards

the  giving of more forms of merger for the  choice  of

the  people  of  Singapore. Yet in his explanation,  we

have  heard no explanation. What is this term "no  less

favourable than the terms for the Borneo territories"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill always

talks  of the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P., and somehow  or

other  he  always appears to come out best.  All  those

things  that are false belong to the P.A.P. and to  the

ex-P.A.P. All the good things belong to the S.P.A.  But

see what a somersaulter the Member for Cairnhill is! We

saw  that somersault when he was talking about  clauses

28 and 29 in the Referendum Bill. And now we again see

another somersault. Why do I say this? If you remember,

Sir,  the Member for Cairnhill very categorically said,

"If  you  want  to offer questions to the people,  then

first  of  all  you  must have  an  unqualified  and  a

qualified  answer." If, for example,  in  the  case  of

merger,  the first question to be posed to  the  people

should be "Do you want merger?", and if the answer came

back  with  a  "no",  he  said  that  it  would  be  an

unqualified  "no". But if it should come  back  with  a

"yes",  then it would be a qualified "yes".  Therefore,

his  contention was that if you want to test the  views

of  the  people on this merger issue, you should  first

pose  the  simple question asking whether  or  not  the

people wanted merger. And if the answer came back  with

a  "yes", then you can pose the various types and forms

of merger to the people. All these records can be found

in   the   proceedings  in  Select  Committee  on   the

Referendum Bill. And not only in Select Committee.  His

Secretary-General,  Mr Lee Kim  Chuan, also  publicly

stated  the same stand in the University Forum a couple

of  weeks back; and again in the Anson mass rally, also

a  couple  of weeks back. So we see now the  somersault

again of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



wanting three forms of merger without giving the people

a  chance  to say "no", Of course, at one time  he  was

very  much against the dictatorship of the P.A.P., but

it  appears that the Member for Cairnhill is now hoping

to   get   a   Ministership  of  the  depleted   P.A.P.

Government.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, in spite of the fact that the

Cobbold  Commission Report has not yet been  published,

it  is  quite obvious to us on this side of  the  House

that  the Member for Farrer Park, as well as the Member

for  Cairnhill,  and as well as the  P.A.P.  Ministers,

already known what the Cobbold Commission Report is all

about. Otherwise it is very difficult for us to imagine

how the Member for Cairnhill can ever propose such  an

alternative question. It is even more difficult for  us

to understand how it has been so easily accepted by the

P.A.P.   Government.  Probably  this  is  another   new

alternative  which  already) has the  blessing  of  the

Tunku. If you will remember, Sir, only a few days  back

it  was  publicly stated in the papers that the  Member

for  Cairnhill, together with the Prime  Minister,  had

conferred with the Prime Minister of the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Point of explanation, Sir.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It would seem that the

hon.  Member has lost the historical dates of  all

these  happenings.  I  said  that  during   the

Committee  stage I would move a  motion  in  this

form.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to Kuala Lumpur last Saturday on private

business.  And  because I always  stay  with  the

Tunku,  I  saw  the Prime Minister there.  If  he

wants  to  think  that there is collaboration,  I

hope   to   God  that  there  will  soon   be   a

collaboration to knock out the Communists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It was indeed a happy

coincidence that the Member for Cairnhill  should

also happen to be in K.L. together with our Prime

Minister.  Of course, one plays golf;  the  other

carries  the sarong or hides behind the sarong:

I  do  not  know  which. The Prime Minister  always

says,  "Pay  my compliments to the  Member  for

Cairnhill."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what, Sir, are the terms for the Borneo

territories?  As far as we know, there  was  this

Malaysia Solidarity Consultative Committee that

was supposed to have been a consultative body but

which was very smoothly turned into much more  than

a  Consultative  Committee. In fact,  the  P.A.P.

tried their level best to make it into an executive

or a legislative body. They wanted to make it a

body that was to lay down the blueprint for their

pet design of Malaysia in order that everything

might  fit  in  with the plans of the  British.

Therefore,  what  are  these  terms  that   are

offered for the Borneo territories? Are they  the

terms  that  the  people of Borneo themselves

want?  That is what we like to know. Or are  they

merely terms which have been imposed on them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, Sir, that in Singapore certain terms as

embodied in the White Paper Cmd. 33 are terms which

the  P.A.P. Government would like to impose  on

the  people. In the case of the Borneo territories,

as  far  as we know, there is not even  a  single

White  Paper.  Only recently, Sir,  a  couple  of

days  back, we read in the papers about  people

in  British North Borneo clamouring to know  what

is  happening and what actually is in the  Cobbold

Commission Report.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>

seems to have known all about the Cobbold Commission

Report.  Our  Prime Minister seems to  have  known  all

about  the  Cobbold Commission Report. Otherwise  he

only  the Chinese are against Malaysia. Yet in Sarawak

and  they are all against Malaysia and merger. What has

the Prime Minister got to say? It only proves that what

the  P.A.P. have been saying to the people  are  all

falsehoods.  Sir, we felt the intensity of  the  anti-Malaysia feeling in Sarawak recently. I had occasion to go along to Sarawak recently, Sir ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Has all this got anything to do with

with the amendment? We are talking

about  the  terms - "to  enter  Malaysia  on

terms no less favourable than the terms for the Borneo

territories". I  do not think the feeling of the people in

Sarawak would alter the terms.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is the whole trouble, Sir. We

people  in  Sarawak want. This has been  expressed  not

only  through political Parties but also through  civic

organsations. There were also other forms of  protest.

But, of course, such news has to be suppressed by Radio

P.A.P.,  and  a lot & people in Singapore  do  not  know

about  the intense feelings against Malaysia. That  is

why  when you talk of terms not less favourable for  the

Borneo territories, it is very puzzling, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is impossible to believe that

this  alternative which the Member for Cairnhill  wants

to pose as a third question in the referendum is really

an  honest one. But as regards the alternative and  how

it compares with the others, I think I will only deal

with it when I come to speak on our own amendment.  But

we  believe that if there's any alternative on  the

terms  of the Borneo territories, then it must  be  the

terms which express the wishes and aspirations of

the  people in Borneo. If they are merely terms imposed

on them by the colonial Government, then they are not

terms   which   can   be  very  favourable   to   those

territories.  The only way to find out  whether  such

terms  express the wishes of the people on not is  to

first   have   a  general  election  in  those   Borneo

territories. Only then do we consider that it  is  a

fair alternative and an honest one. As it is, Sir, it

is  like  buying a pig in a poke, and it is  definitely

unfair  to  the people of Singapore. Surely we  do  not

expect the people to choose something they hardly know

anything  about. Does the Member for Cairnhill  suggest

that  we  give a blank cheque to the P.A.P. after  all

their distrtions and dishonesty? That is asking a  bit

too much, Sir. For this reason we oppose this amendment

to  put  this third question to the people. Of course,

we must try and understand the motivation   behind  this  so-called  third  alternative

which  the  Government so willingly accept as  a  third

alternative   to  be  posed  to  the  people   in   the

referendum.  They hope to gain a great  deal  from  the

confusion  that will be caused in the  minds  of  the

people  by having more alternatives. I do now know  how

their  mathematical calculation  works,  but  by  the

division  of  votes which oppose the White Paper,  they

hope  they  would thereby be able to confuse  a  good

section  of  the  people  of  Singapore  to  supporting

their  White Paper merger proposals. It becomes  more

difficult  to understand this third question suggested

by the Member for Cairnhill especially when we remember

that  S.P.A. have publicly stated that they  support

this White Paper merger proposals. How do you reconcile

their contradiction? It does not work out. The S.P.A.

support the White



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



Paper   merger   proposals.  The  White  Paper   merger

proposals are going to be posed as one question.  Yet

the  S.P.A. are now suggesting a new question. Do these

two  questions amount to the same question? Or are they

different?  If  they are different, then  the  S.P.A.

must come out openly and say that they oppose the White

Paper merger proposals. How do they reconcile all  this

contradiction?   There  seems  to  be   some   confused

thinking.

able to enlighten us. But all in all, we do not believe

this alternative which they want to suggest to  the

people  is an honest one. It is meant to  help  the

P.A.P. and to further confuse the people  as  regards

how  they  should  oppose the  P.A.P.  White  Paper

merger  proposals. I hope that if the  S.P.A. were really

sincere in their offering an alternative to the people, then

let them go back to their original stand, namely, let them

suggest , and let the P.A.P. accept, their orginal stand of first

posing a question that asks for a "yes" or "no".

If it is a "no" it becomes

himself.  Let  him come to a different tack.  Only  two

minutes more.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I intend to

finish, Sir, I just want to remind the S.P.A. that if

they  were sincere, then they should go back to  their

stand  and  not keep on somersaulting. Their stand,  as

orignally  stated and as appeared in black and  white

in  the Select Committee proceedines, is, let there  be

first a question on merger itself, "yes" or "no"; and

following a "yes", let the different forms of merger

be  posed. As it is, we feel that the S.P.A. and  the

P.A.P. are  just  in cahoots hoping  to  deceive  the

people in order that they may push through their  White

Paper merger proposals.
