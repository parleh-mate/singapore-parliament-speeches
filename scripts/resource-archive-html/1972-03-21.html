motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the

reclamation by Government of those portions of  the

foreshores   at   Pulau  Brani  and   Brani   Shoal

containing a total area of approximately 116  acres

as  shown  coloured in orange on  the  plan  marked

"LAND  OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 2/72"  which  is

deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Pulau Brani which has been allocated for use

by  the  Port  of  Singapore Authority  and  MINDEF

(Ministry  of Defence), as indicated  on  the  plan

marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMAXTION PLAN NO. 2/72",  a

copy  of which is displayed in the Library of  this

House  for  the  information of Members,  is  being

developed to provide the following facilities:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) coastal wharves for MINDEF Maritime Command;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) coastal wharves for the Port of Singapore Authority;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) an oil tank farm for storage and bunkering; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) other uses that may be compatible with the

above.



<br><br>For the purpose of the development, it is necessary

to reclaim about 86 acres of the foreshore at Pulau

Brani  and about 30 acres at Brani Shoal, as  shown

coloured orange on the plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation will be carried out by the Port

of Singapore Authority, as agent of the Government,

at  an  estimated  cost  of $29.2  million  and  is

expected  to  be  completed within two  years.  The

necessary fill for the proposed reclamation will be

obtained  from the high land at Pulau Brani  within

the  area  now being developed by MINDEF  and  will

also  be  obtained from the dredging of the  nearby

channels  and  from  the Sister Shoals,  which  are

scheduled  to  be  removed to  widen  the  existing

navigational   channel  and   to   do   away   with

obstructions to shipping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of the reclamation, the reclaimed

land  will  be proclaimed as State land  and  will,

thereafter,  be alienated to the Port of  Singapore

Authority on terms and conditions to be agreed with

the Land Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1301 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last week when I took part in the debate on

the  Budget presented by the Minister, I  mentioned

that  it  was  a  progressive Budget,  which  would

benefit   the  development  of  our  commerce   and

industry. Today, I still hold this point  of  view,

and  that  is,  that the Minister for  Finance  has

prepared a healthy and progressive Budget.  What  I

would  like  to raise here is the question  of  the

various  provisions and whether they are adequately

allocated.   On  7th  March,  when   the   Minister

presented  the Budget in this House, he  emphasised

that  the main reason why it has not been necessary

to  increase  taxes over the last three  years  was

because  of  the rapid development of our  commerce

and industry leading to an increase in revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch upon the provisions

for  the  various  departments. I think  there  are

certain areas which we need to discuss and examine.

The  total  provision amounted  to  the  figure  of

$1,448,692,350.   In   terms   of    the    various

departments,   the  allocation  for   Defence   and

Internal  Security  is  38.9  per  cent.  This   is

necessary in order to strengthen our defence and to

maintain  our  internal security.  Social  Services

accounted  for 26.6 per cent, Statutory Expenditure

accounted for 15.1 per cent, and Economic  Services

accounted for only 7.8 per cent. What I would  like

to  raise  here is in regard to Economic  Services.

7.8  per  cent  appears to me as  rather  low.  The

Minister himself has mentioned that the increase in

revenue is due



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



to  the  rapid  development  of  our  commerce  and

industry,   and   these   Economic   Services   are

beneficial to economic expansion and industrial and

commercial  development. Therefore, we should  have

adequate  provision for Economic  Services.  If  we

compare  Economic Services to the goose  that  lays

the  golden  egg,  then we should provide  adequate

nutrition  for this goose. It is only by  providing

adequate  nutrition that this goose can be expected

to  lay a great quantity of golden eggs, so that we

can  have better results in our economic expansion.

Otherwise, this goose, suffering from malnutrition,

will  be sickly and contract a lot of diseases.  If

this is the case, I believe we will not be able  to

get  any eggs from this goose. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it

is for this reason that I believe the provision for

Economic  Services  is inadequate  and,  therefore,

should  be increased. In addition, I would like  to

ask the Minister to explain the details related  to

Economic Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is in

regard  to  external trade. Last  year,  our  trade

deficit  has increased to the phenomenal amount  of

$3,000  million. The Minister for Finance explained

to us last year that we do not have to worry unduly

about  trade deficit because this can be offset  by

incomes  received from other sources, such as  ship

repairing, port services, and tourism. I would like

to  know  whether the $3,000 million trade  deficit

last  year  has been sufficiently set  off  by  the

incomes from other sources. Can the Minister please

explain to this House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to mention is in

regard  to  the  stability  of  price  levels.  The

Minister has already acknowledged that there is  an

increase in the general level of prices. Therefore,

I think he should take adequate measures to control

prices  to  ensure a better standard of living  for

everyone.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Speaker, Sir, with

your  would  like to range my to my next amendment*

in respect of subhead 1041.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows: -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1041.



<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

Prime   Minister  has  announced  the  "13th  month

salary"  for  civil servants, I  presume  they  are

quite  satisfied  with  it. I  wonder  whether  the

Minister for Finance will also consider giving  the

"13th  month salary" to pensioners who had  put  in

many  years of loyal and patriotic service  to  the

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the practice in some departments to

retain the services of retired civil servants. This

has  caused  a  lot  of  frustration  among  junior

officers,  because they feel that their chances  of

promotion  are  nullified by  these  retired  civil

servants who are re-employed in some of the  senior

posts.  I  am not objecting to their re-employment,

but  whether their experience is necessary for  the

betterment of the civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a certain amount of brain drain

among the civil servants who, after having received

their  scholarships, come back only to resign after

serving  for a few years. This form of brain  drain

must  be  stopped, because the civil servants  make

use  of  the civil service as a stepping stone  for

their  own betterment. We cannot have them  holding

the civil service by the throat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would suggest that better conditions

of  service  should  be considered  for  the  civil

servants.  As  far  as possible,  the  gap  in  pay

between  the public and private sectors  should  be

narrowed, and so prevent a brain drain in the civil

service.  Furthermore. I would suggest  that  civil

servants  should be recruited on a contract  basis,

so that the knowledge and experience that they gain

will not be lost to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



Government after a short employment. Otherwise,  it

would  be  a  waste  of Government  expenditure  to

recruit and train these people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether a varying scale

of  a  maximum  of three annual increments  in  the

various  salary scales can be granted to an officer

for  any  one  year. Entitlement  to  this  special

increment   should  depend  on   the   merits   and

capabilities  of  the individual.  It  will  be  an

incentive for the officers to give of their best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the low income group is concerned, I

have  the  greatest sympathy for them.  There  have

been complaints about the rising cost of living  in

Singapore,  although the Minister  for  Finance  is

making  every effort to bridge the gap between  the

lower  and  higher  income groups  by  way  of  tax

reliefs  which he has announced in Parliament  last

week.  However. I still feel that the lower  income

group  should get more benefits in the revision  of

their  emoluments,  and I hope the  National  Wages

Council will look into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one example of dissatisfaction in the civil

service  can  be  seen  in the  case  of  temporary

officers   engaged   on  a  month-to-month   basis.

Sometimes  they are asked to act in a senior  post.

However,  when  a vacancy for the  senior  post  is

advertised,  these  officers are unfortunately  not

eligible  to apply. Some other officers, with  whom

the temporary officers are familiar, will take over

the  post.  Why cannot these temporary officers  be

confirmed  as  permanent officers in  their  senior

posts?  Can  the Minister look into it and  rectify

the matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our local population has a

prejudice  against locally-made products.  This  is

justified to a great extent. If one were to  import

a certain product which is also produced locally, a

certain  difference in quality can be noticed.  For

example,  a  certain brand of tooth-paste  made  in

Malaysia foams better in the mouth than the  tooth-paste   of   the   same  brand  produced   locally.

Similarly, cars manufactured and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



assembled by the parent company overseas are  of  a

superior  quality  to cars of  the  same  make  but

assembled locally.. Surely something can be done by

local  manufacturers who produce goods of a certain

quality   for  local  consumption  and  of  another

quality for export purposes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am obliged  to  the  Member  for

Sembawang  for  his  comments  and  sentiments  for

adequate  provision for the Economic Services  and,

in particular, industrial development with which  I

must  fully  agree. He has asked for  some  details

regarding the allocation for Economic Services. May

I  refer him to Appendix F of the Main Estimates of

Revenue  and Expenditure for 1972-73,  in  which  a

very detailed breakdown is given of expenditure  by

functional classification. It will be observed that

all  the  departments  and Ministries  involved  in

providing  economic  services have  been  allocated

adequate funds for their needs. As I have explained

in  the Budget Statement, the apparent reduction in

the  provision for Economic Services is due to  the

fact  that the Telecommunications Department is  to

become  a  statutory authority and,  therefore,  no

provision   has   been  made  for   its   recurrent

expenditure  which was allocated  a  sum  of  $19.4

million in the 1971-72 Estimates. If this is  taken

into   account,  it  will  be  observed  that   the

provision for Economic Services has, in fact,  been

increased from $107.5 million in 1971-72 to $113.14

million  in 1972-73. I should also like  to  remind

the  Member that the amount we have entered in  the

Ordinary  Estimates  does not  constitute  all  the

budgetary  provision  for  Economic  Services,   as

provision is also made in the Development Estimates

for  expenditure  on Economic Services.  It  should

also  be  noted that with the increased  allocation

for  Defence and Social Services, the proportionate

share  of  the  expenditure for  Economic  Services

would tend to be marginally smaller, even when  the

actual   quantum   of  funds  provided   has   been

increased. I can assure the Member that adequate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



funds will always be made available for departments

providing economic services, and that there  is  no

intention  on the part of the Treasury  to  curtail

their expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also asked a

question  on  the  widening trade gap  of  $3,283.7

million  in 1971 as compared with $2,778.0  million

in  1970. This should give no cause for alarm.  The

preliminary  figures  for  the  1971   balance   of

payments  show that we have some $847.5 million  in

our  favour compared with $416.5 million for  1970.

This  represents  a 103 per cent  increase  in  our

reserves.  Some  reasons  for  the  trends  in  the

balance  of payment figures had been given  in  the

1970  and  1971 Budget debates. If I may summarise,

it  should  be appreciated that the widening  trade

gap is fairly common in a developing country, owing

to  the  need to purchase large amounts of  capital

goods,    particularly    heavy    machinery    and

transportation  equipment.  Of  the  trade  gap  of

$3,283.7  million in 1971, import of machinery  and

transportation   equipment  alone   accounted   for

$2,209.1  million. Even if we discount  the  $740.5

million  for export of machinery and transportation

equipment  from  Singapore,  the  retained  imports

still amounted to $1,568.0 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which has to be made is that the

trade balance is not the only factor in the balance

of  payments.  It is offset by increased  invisible

earnings  from,  firstly, entrepot trade  services,

including  finance, banking, insurance and  freight

earnings.   Secondly,   unrecorded   purchases   by

tourists and transportation personnel, such as ship

and   air   crew.  Thirdly,  ship  building,   ship

repairing,  supplies  to  vessels,  oil  rigs   and

aircraft  using Singapore as a base. Fourthly,  the

substantial  under-coverage by  the  trade  balance

figures,  which is indicated by the large balancing

item of $3,045.2 million in our balance of payments

balance   sheet.  Some  redistribution   of   these

balancing  items could be attempted  and  would  be

largely  made  on the credit side  of  the  Current

Account, particularly on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



merchandise  trade, also on Capital  Account.  This

attempt to redistribute the balancing items has not

been  made since comprehensive data on these  flows

are  not available to enable this to be done  on  a

reliable  basis. Nevertheless, I think it would  be

healthy  to see our exports increase substantially.

Singapore's total exports in 1971 registered  a  13

per  cent  increase over the 1970  performance.  In

addition   to  the  introduction  of  the  Economic

Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax)  Act,

a  new export promotion unit is being set up in the

Trade  Division in 1972-73 to undertake studies  of

export  markets and to take full advantage  of  the

preferential treatment offered by various developed

countries   to   assist  developing  countries   to

increase exports of locally manufactured goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's last comment on the matter of

price  increases, the Government is doing  what  it

can   to   stabilise  the  prices  of   foodstuffs,

especially    basic   necessities.   Manufacturers,

importers,  and  members of the distributive  trade

have been warned against taking undue advantage  of

any  situation  that presents  itself  to  jack  up

prices.  In this respect, I think officers  of  the

Supplies Office are continually checking on  prices

of  foodstuffs  in  all  localities  in  Singapore.

However, Singapore cannot remain totally immune  to

changes  in  supply  and demand  for  food  in  the

international  scene. Nevertheless, the  Government

has  to  step  in  to  help the consumers  wherever

possible.



<br><br>3.00p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail price of locally refined sugar has

remained stable at 39 cents a katty, or $550 a  ton

ex-factory,  with duty, since February  last  year,

despite  the  fact that world prices of  raw  sugar

have  shot up from œ49 or $360 per ton to over  œ90

or  $661.50 per ton currently -- I think it will be

appreciated  that there has been concern  in  other

countries  over  the  rise in the  price  of  their

sugar. To safeguard the consumers in Singapore,  an

export  control  is also placed on locally  refined

sugar.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as wheat flour is concerned, the retail

price  of  25  cents per katty has remained  stable

since the beginning of 1971. Rice prices have  also

remained  very  firm.  Since  January  last   year,

wholesale  prices for the two Thai  top-grade  rice

have declined from $33.50 and $26 per picul to  its

present   price   of   $32  and   $25   per   picul

respectively. The price of China top-grade rice has

also dropped during the same period from $26.25  to

the present value of $23.50 per picul.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On condensed milk, the price of popular brands

has  remained at 60 cents for a 14-ounce tin  since

September  last year. Over this period, the  prices

of raw materials have gone up considerably. Skimmed

milk  prices have increased on an average of $1,000

to $1,200 a ton, while butter fat prices have risen

from  $2,400  to $3,300 a ton. The Government  has,

therefore, done a fair amount of work in trying  to

stabilise the prices of basic commodities. However,

I  welcome  the  establishment  last  year  by  the

private  sector  of the Consumers'  Association  of

Singapore,  which is very active in  looking  after

the  interests of consumers and is working  closely

with our Trade Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I understand the National Trades Union

Congress  is presently studying the feasibility  of

setting  up a Consumers' Co-operative, and  that  a

pilot  project will be launched in the near future.

With  the  close  co-operation of  consumers,  this

project should prove successful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson, first of all, raised the

point  of  the 13th monthly salary to  be  paid  to

pensioners. I think the intention of the scheme  is

really .a 13th month salary payment. So it is not a

13th  month pension. In the circumstances, it  does

not  fall within the scope of the 13th month salary

scheme or the non-pensionable annual allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also made some comment on the question

of  terms  and  conditions  of  service  for  civil

servants and, particularly, for those who have just

returned from overseas. I believe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



his   comment  is  prompted  by  concern  over  the

possible resignation of civil servants to join  the

private sector. The present practice, of course, is

that  the Public Service Commission appoints higher

level   personnel,   including   professional   and

technical personnel, to the permanent establishment

so as to offer them a long-term career in the civil

service. The Member suggested offering contracts. A

small number of officers have been appointed  on  a

temporary basis because they so prefer it. In other

cases, it is because they are required for specific

projects of a temporary nature only. However,  such

temporary  officers with proven ability  have  been

and  will be offered permanent appointment if  they

wish.  Those  who  were appointed  initially  on  a

temporary  basis  because  their  jobs  were   only

temporary  jobs can apply when permanent  vacancies

arise.  The  policy  of the P.S.C, is  to  conduct

frequent  promotion exercises so  that  outstanding

and  promising  officers  will  obtain  accelerated

promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion in the professional services is now

based  on  merit rather than for filling posts,  so

that where there are deserving officers, the P.S.C.

will  recommend their promotion even  though  there

are insufficient established vacancies. As an added

incentive  to promising officers, the  policy  with

regard  to acting appointments is that these should

also  be made on merit and not on seniority.  Also,

pensioners  are  not  normally  re-employed  unless

there   are  exceptional  reasons,  such  as  acute

shortage  of  experienced  staff  in  a  particular

grade.  In  every  case  of  re-employment   of   a

pensioner,  Government ensures that  this  is  done

without  depriving  the serving officers  of  their

promotion prospects. With near-full employment,  it

may,  in  fact,  become increasingly  necessary  to

employ  more  pensioners who are still  healthy  in

mind and body and who can contribute positively  to

the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it difficult, however, to accept the

Member's  suggestion to replace the present  annual

incremental practice with a three-year increment in

all cases.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also made one comment with

regard  to locally-made products. I heartily  agree

that  these  products should be made  more  popular

among  our own consumers. I think the schemes which

have been instituted by the Singapore Institute  of

Standards  and Industrial Research should  make  it

plain   to  all  local  consumers  that  our  local

products  are  just  as good  as  those  which  are

imported. I hope they will give their full  support

to  the  consumption of local products, instead  of

imported products.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  thank  the Minister for answering  all  my

three  questions. He has given a very comprehensive

and adequate answer. Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> (Punggol): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1251.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I would like to

refer the Minister for Finance to two Reports which

have  been  presented to this  House.  One  is  the

Report  of  the  Auditor-General for the  financial

year  1969-70 contained in Paper Cmd.  14  of  1971

presented  to Parliament on l7ti July,  1971.  The

other  is  the First Report of the Public  Accounts

Committee  contained  in  Paper  Pan.  1  of   1972

presented  to  Parliament on 12th  February,  1972.

Sir, whilst browsing through the Auditor- General's

Report,  I was given the impression that losses  of

public  funds in the various departments  were  the

result   of   the  officials  in  the   departments

concerned  not being conversant with the  financial

procedures  or  that they have been  overworked  in

some cases. The First Report of the Public Accounts

Committee  bears testimony to this  fact.  I  would

like to quote the comments in page 2 of this Report

under the heading "Irregularities":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`8. Perusing the Audit Report your Committee

noted  the number of irregularities which were,  in

the main, due to weaknesses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



in  the  accounting system or because the financial

officers concerned were not sufficiently acquainted

with and did not follow the safeguards laid down in

the Instruction Manuals.'

<br><br>Further  down,  the Public Accounts Committee  made

some recommendations, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`9. As an immediate measure, your Committee

recommend that attention of all accounting officers

should  be  drawn  to  these two  common  areas  of

weaknesses  so that they may be more  vigilant  and

take necessary action to prevent the occurrences or

recurrences of such irregularities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. As a long term measure, your Committee feel

that the whole problem should be tackled on a wider

basis  of co-ordination and improvement of  general

financial administration and supervision, including

the  use  of  modern mechanical aids and computers,

and  that  a  proper training scheme  for  officers

should  be  formulated  and  implemented.  For  the

immediate future, your Committee recommend that the

Ministry  of  Finance look into the feasibility  of

creating  a cadre of trained financial officers  at

various  levels  for  posting  to  Ministries   and

Departments  to strengthen financial administration

and  supervision as well as improve  efficiency  of

financial work in all sectors.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know whether the Minister

for Finance will take immediate remedial action  as

a  result of the two Reports. Of course, I am fully

aware  that  the  Public Accounts Committees  First

Report  was  presented only last  month,  lest  the

Minister  should say, "We have just  received  this

First  Report  and it is now being studied  with  a

view to taking appropriate action as soon as a full

evaluation of the Report has been made."



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to take this opportunity to enquire from

the  Minister for Finance whether his Ministry will

consider  allowing aided school teachers  to  apply

for   holiday  bungalows  in  Changi,  which   were

recently acquired by the Government from the  Royal

Air  Force,  on  the same terms  offered  to  their

counterparts in the Government service?



<br><br>3.15p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making this inquiry, I am prompted by two

considerations:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The recent policy of the Finance Ministry is

to allow members of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



public  to  occupy such bungalows, thus  indicating

that  the availability of holiday bungalows exceeds

the needs of civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That aided school teachers are granted

medical facilities like their counterparts  in  the

Government service. That being so, will  they  also

be   granted   the   same   privileges   as   their

counterparts in the Government service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, regarding the irregularities

in  the accounting system, whether indicated by the

Auditor-General in his Report which has  just  been

received,  or  whether they  are  detected  by  the

Ministries  or  Departments themselves  or  by  the

Ministry of Finance, they are always very carefully

studied and, where possible, remedies are taken. In

any  big organisation, however, we must expect that

occasional flaws in the accounting system  will  be

discovered. The other area of weakness,  which  has

been  suggested as being responsible for losses  of

public  funds,  is overworking the staff.  On  this

matter  I  have,  in response to questions  in  the

debate  on my annual Budget Statement, stated  that

the  remedy  to prevent civil servants  from  being

overworked is to try and retain more of them and to

recruit  them  on a more acceptable basis.  On  the

whole,  the Government accounting system  is  on  a

firm   and  sound  base.  Nevertheless,  there   is

considerable scope for improvement, and  steps  are

being  taken  to increase the use of computers  and

other  mechanical aids, as suggested by the Member,

so  that  the element of human fallibility  can  be

reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion was that the weaknesses in

the   accounting  system  may   be   due   to   the

unfamiliarity  of the financial officers  concerned

with  the  proper financial procedures.  To  remedy

this, courses on financial administration are being

conducted  by  the  Staff  Training  Institute  for

Divisions  I and II officers. Subjects on financial

system  and  procedures, annual budgets,  financial

control, losses of public moneys



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



and  stores,  contract  and stores  procedures  are

included  in the courses conducted by the Institute

for administrative and executive officers, and they

will continue to be included in future courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein asked whether the Finance

Ministry will allow aided school teachers to  apply

for holiday bungalows in Changi. The answer is that

they  are  eligible  to apply  as  members  of  the

public.  I  believe,  however,  the  suggestion  is

prompted  by the desire to give them priority  over

other  members of the public, in the  same  way  as

facilities   are  given  them  in  the   Government

hospitals.  However, I will look into  this  matter

and,  assuming that we have an over-supply of these

holiday   bungalows,  we  will  certainly  consider

making them available to the aided school teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In the light of the Minister's

reply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1501.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I bring up this matter in order to assure

myself of the quality of the goods supplied by  the

Central  Supplies Office. A few months ago  when  I

had occasion to be in hospital for a short time,  I

was  surprised  to hear complaints made  by  senior

staff  members about an item of furniture,  namely,

armchairs, supplied by the Central Supplies  Office

to  the  Ministry  of Health. They were  complaints

that  the  item of furniture received showed  early

signs of deterioration, and on one occasion a chair

collapsed under the weight of a patient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I would like to ask is whether

Government  departments are forced  to  accept  the

goods provided by the Central Supplies Office, even

if  they  are reluctant to accept the goods because

they  are  able to get similar items  of  equal  or

better  quality and at a cheaper price  than  those

supplied. Is adequate care taken to ensure that the

quality of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



the    goods   supplied   conform   to   reasonable

expectations of those who place orders for them? In

any case, I would imagine also that when orders are

placed  with  the Central Supplies Office,  quality

specifications  are also given.  Can  the  Minister

enlighten me on this score?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, all purchases by the Chief

Supplies Officer for the requirements of Government

departments  are  made by the open  tender  system,

which  ensures  that  materials  supplied  are   of

accepted   and  specified  quality  at   the   most

competitive  price  possible.  Wherever   possible,

samples  are  examined before the actual  purchases

are   made.  It  must  be  recognised  that   large

quantities of supplies are usually consumed and, as

public  funds  should  be spent  judiciously,  they

cannot always be of the best quality available.  On

the  other  hand, I accept the Member's point  that

the   cheapest   are  not  necessarily   the   most

economical and that mistakes of judgment, which are

occasionally    made   in   regard    to    quality

specifications  should  be  corrected  by  constant

review  of  such specifications. On the  particular

example of the hospital chair, I am obliged to  the

Member  for  the information, and I  will  ask  the

Chief Supplies Officer to look into the matter.  We

cannot  guarantee to supply, however, luxury chairs

made by Parker Knoll or Eero Saarinen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's

reply, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I would like to

present  a  bouquet  to the Minister  for  Law  and

National Development for his achievement in  public

housing.   In  doing  so,  I  observe   a   radical

phenomenon.  The  more successful  we  are  in  our

housing, development, the more the State would have

to pay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



in  the  form  of  subsidy  to  every  Housing  and

Development  Board flat dweller.  This  burden,  of

course, is reduced by our scheme of home ownership,

but  the  bulk  of dwellers in rented  flats  still

receive this privilege of rent, though they do  not

see or are even aware of it themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that there is an increase of $3 million

under  this subhead. I would appreciate it  if  the

Minister  will  inform the House  as  to  how  this

increased  amount is to be expended. I should  also

like  to  know  the total number of  housing  units

completed  last year. How many of these were  sold,

and   the  amount  of  subsidy  incurred  for   the

remaining units which were rented out?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, this information is to a

certain  extent the responsibility of my colleague,

the  Minister for Law and National Development, but

I will try to answer for him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Thank you very much.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The amount of subsidy given to

the  Housing and Development Board in any one  year

is  calculated  on the deficit between  the  annual

income  and  expenditure of the Current Account  of

the  Board  in  the preceding financial  year.  The

deficit itself is largely due to the fact that  for

the one-room and two-room flats the rentals charged

are  not  sufficient to cover the  operating  cost,

including   the   provision   of   amenities    and

maintenance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in subsidy required is due to two

factors;  firstly, the increase in  the  number  of

tenants living in one-room flats and, secondly, the

increasing  cost of providing amenities and  proper

maintenance of the housing estates. As at  the  end

of  1971,  the  number of Housing  and  Development

Board flats under rental was 89,500, of which  one-room and two-room flats amounted to 69,982. In 1972

the  Board is planning to build another 9,100  one-room  flats. Most of these flats are being used  to

house  families affected by the various development

projects  under  the  urban  renewal  schemes,  and

industrial and other development schemes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in the number of tenants living

in  subsidised Housing and Development Board flats,

it is inevitable that the Government subsidy has to

be   proportionally  increased.  It  may  also   be

mentioned   that  the  rentals  for   Housing   and

Development Board flats were fixed in 1960-61,  and

since  then there have naturally been increases  in

the  cost  of  providing services,  amenities,  and

management  of  estates.  It  is  not  possible  to

provide  separate  data on the  various  components

that  make the subsidy, as these increases are only

reflected  in the overall deficit in the  operating

expenses  of  the Board. The preliminary  financial

statement of the Housing and Development Board  for

the   year  1971-72  indicates  that  the   subsidy

required will be in the region of $10 million.  The

final  figure will be determined when  the  audited

accounts of the Board become available around  June

or  July,  1972.  The total number of  Housing  and

Development  Board  units  completed  in  1971  was

16,147.  Of these, 6,898 units were sold,  and  the

rest were for rental.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, in respect of the subsidy to

the  Housing and Development Board, I also  presume

that,  as the Minister has said, this sum is  being

used  for  certain amenities - in the  case  of  my

constituency,  the  construction  of   a   swimming

complex. However, the Housing and Development Board

has  written  to  the Ministry of  Finance  to  get

clearance  with  regard to additional  land  -  and

perhaps  the  demolition  of  a  couple  of  houses

belonging   to  the  Government  -  in   order   to

accommodate this swimming complex. The Housing  and

Development Board has not yet received a reply  for

a  few  months  now. I wonder if the  Minister  for

Finance could look into this matter on behalf of my

constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> If this involves a matter of

subsidy, it could be looked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



into.  If it is just a matter of detail to  provide

additional land and facilities, perhaps this can be

referred to my colleague, the Minister for National

Development.  We  do  meet the  difference  between

current  income expenditure. At the  same  time,  I

think  we expect the Housing and Development  Board

and   the  Ministry  of  National  Development   to

exercise  care in reducing costs as far as possible

so  that  we  do not have to raise the  subsidy  on

rents.  When  the cost of the subsidy goes  up  too

high,  it  may be necessary for us then to  request

the  Ministry of National Development  to  consider

whether  rentals should not he raised, but  I  hope

that will not be necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced  by  the  whole sum in respect  of  subhead

2096.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know from the Minister the

reason for the almost 50 per cent increase for this

subhead. Sir, who are the people to be entertained,

and  what are the forms of entertainment?  I  would

also  like  to know if this vote is meant  for  the

Ministry  as  a  whole,  or  for  the  use  of  any

individual officer in the course of his duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I observe the anomaly that whilst entertainment

allowances  are  budgeted for  Ministers  and  even

Permanent Secretaries, there is no provision at all

for Parliamentary Secretaries. May I know if it  is

the  Minister's view that Parliamentary Secretaries

have  no  occasion to entertain?  I  know  they  do

entertain  foreign guests, particularly,  but  with

funds out of their own pockets. Sir, I also want to

know  the reason why Parliamentary Secretaries  are

not entitled to these allowances?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I am given to understand that when

Parliamentary Secretaries travel abroad on official

duties,  they are given economy class air passages.

Are Permanent Secretaries given first-class air



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



passages   when  they  travel  abroad  on  official

duties? If so, why?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Parliamentary Secretaries have to-date

maintained a silent and reluctant restraint on this

matter  for  reasons best known  to  themselves.  I

cannot  see  the  reason and logic  that  Permanent

Secretaries    should    take    precedence    over

Parliamentary Secretaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, this subhead is provided as

a   general   or   central  vote   to   cover   the

entertainment   expenses  of  all  Ministries   and

departments  of Government. In other words,  it  is

not specifically for the use of one Ministry or any

individual officer. Persons entertained under  this

vote are usually officers of other governments  and

international organisations visiting  Singapore  on

official  missions,  or for hi-lateral  talks.  The

type  of entertainment provided is usually  in  the

form  of  dinners, lunches, and light refreshments.

The  rate  per  person  is usually  worked  out  at

approved   standard  rates.  Every  such  occasion,

including  the number of persons to be entertained,

has  to  have  the prior approval of  Treasury.  In

recent years, with Singapore's growth as a regional

and   international  centre,  there  has   been   a

substantial  increase in the number of such  visits

and meetings. For the financial year 197l-72, there

has   been   an   increase  in   such   activities,

particularly     concerning     telecommunications,

technical  education, and science  and  technology.

The  estimated expenditure for 1971-72 is  expected

to  exceed the provision of $5,000 by about $2,500.

In  view of the fact that the provision is to cover

expenditure  for the whole year of all departments,

the  sum of $9,000 in this year's Estimates is  not

considered extravagant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the central vote for

entertainment,   there   is   also   a   vote   for

"Entertainment  Expenses"  in  each  Ministry,  and

another   vote  for  "Entertainment  Expenses   for

Permanent Secretary." to be spent at the discretion

of  the  political  head and of the  administrative

head of the Ministry respectively. These provisions

are necessary perhaps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



because   Treasury  control  was   considered   too

restrictive. In cases where there are Ministers  of

State  or  Parliamentary Secretaries, the vote  for

the  Ministry  is  larger, say, $3,000  instead  of

$2,000.   Therefore,  in  regard  to  entertainment

expenses  incurred by Parliamentary Secretaries  in

entertaining official foreign guests, such expenses

can be charged to the "Entertainment Expenses" vote

of  the  Ministry.  In fact,  I  thought  all  such

expenses  are currently being paid out of the  vote

which   is  more  commonly  referred  to   as   the

Minister's     entertainment     expenses     vote.

Parliamentary Secretaries can and do, in fact, make

use of this vote with the concurrence, implicit  or

otherwise,  of  the  Minister  concerned.  It   is,

therefore,  incorrect  to  say  that  Parliamentary

Secretaries are not benefiting from such  facility.

If  any  of  them are out of pocket, it is  because

they do not make a claim; it is not because of  any

discrimination  against  them.  If  there  is   any

shortage  of  funds, they can always apply  to  the

Treasury for reimbursement from the central vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, my question on the air

passages for Parliamentary Secretaries has not been

answered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, this expenditure does not

come  under this particular entertainment  expenses

vote.  But I would say that this is a long-standing

regulation, and I have had no complaints against it

by  any of the Parliamentary Secretaries so far. If

they wish to raise this matter with me, I shall  be

pleased to consider it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2281.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a provision for contributions and

financial  assistance  to  cultural  organisations.

Looking at the Estimates, this provision of just  a

mere  sum  of $10,000 is too small as  a  means  of

contribution and financial assistance  to  cultural

organisations.   It   is   inadequate   for   their

activities.  It is common knowledge  that  cultural

activities certainly require an assistance of  more

than $10,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the policy statement of the Finance

Minister we know that our economy has established a

firm  foundation.  At the same  time  we  are  also

promoting a gracious living in Singapore because we

do   not   want   to  produce  ugly   Singaporeans.

Therefore,  I  would like to ask the  Minister  for

Finance  to  allocate more funds as a  contribution

for   the  promotion  of  cultural  activities   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the largest theatre in Singapore

is  the  National  Theatre.  Though  it  is  called

National  Theatre, it is not run by the State,  but

by the National Theatre Trust. Notwithstanding this

fact,  Sir, under the planning and organisation  of

the  National  Theatre Trust,  various  significant

activities  have been carried out in  the  cultural

front. But this is not a direct management from the

State. Because of this, the National Theatre  Trust

is  annually faced with financial deficits of  more

than  $200,000  per annum. It has  to  make  public

appeals  for  donations  every  year  to  meet  the

deficit. What I fail to understand is why  has  the

Government  not allocated a sum of  $200,000  to  5

300.000  to the National Theatre Trust to  make  it

possible   for  the  National  Theatre   Trust   to

successfully   promote   cultural   activities   in

Singapore?  I  would like to ask the  Minister  for

Finance not to stinge on the cultural expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read in the newspapers that a cultural

mission  was sent to Adelaide to take part  in  the

cultural  festival  under  the  leadership  of  the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Culture. It was a great success and the performance

was  applauded by thousands of Australians, thereby

enabling them to have a better image of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this basis I would like the Minister for

Finance  to  allocate more sums to the Ministry  of

Culture  to set up a permanent cultural mission  to

visit and perform in various countries overseas. In

the   first  place,  this  will  promote   cultural

activities  in Singapore. In the second  place,  it

will  give  added  publicity to Singapore  and  the

promotion of our tourist trade. I think a  cultural

mission  is  a better means of promoting  Singapore

than  mediums or trishaws organised by the  Tourist

Promotion Board. I hope the Minister will  consider

this matter seriously.

<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is considered unnecessary at this stage for the

Government to take over the National Theatre  Trust

as  it  is running the National Theatre quite well.

At the moment, the National Theatre Trust has a 40-member  Chinese  orchestra and  a  38-member  choir

comprising  amateurs who rehearse and perform  from

time  to  time.  It is envisaged  that  if  such  a

Chinese orchestra and choir were to be formed  into

a  permanent, or even a semi-professional  body,  a

large  amount of money would have to come from  the

Government.  I  quite  agree with  the  Member  for

Jurong that more money should be allocated to  this

subhead  so that we can assist cultural  bodies  in

the   Republic   to   carry  out   their   cultural

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment on the suggestion of the

Member with regard to organising a permanent troupe

to  perform  overseas  as a promotional  effort  to

publicise  Singapore and to project a  true  multi-racial  image of Singapore. As Members know,  early

this  month  we  sent  a 62-member-strong  cultural

delegation  to  Adelaide. This  delegation  put  up

performances   which   were  well   received.   The

performances  were  spectacular and  colourful  not

only  in  themselves but also in the  costumes  and

presentation  and made a tremendous impact  on  the

Australian  audience. Apart from the  audiences  in

Adelaide, the performances were telecast live over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



television  throughout Australia. I have  no  doubt

that the performances by this troupe have made  the

Australians  much more aware of the  multi-cultural

and  multi-racial  content of Singapore,  and  will

certainly implant in their minds a desire  to  come

to  Singapore or at least to stop over at Singapore

and see things for themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This no doubt will be a big boost to the tourist

trade,  and  with  it the hotels,  restaurants  and

night  -club  businesses. If  the  sending  of  one

cultural   delegation  abroad  can  have   such   a

reaction, it logically follows therefore that if we

send more cultural troupes overseas, the image will

be  even more pronounced provided, of course,  that

the standard of performances is of a high level.  I

should  point  out, however, that  my  Ministry  is

considering  the possibility of organising  such  a

cultural troupe either on a permanent or on a part-time basis, and also how best this troupe should be

organised and maintained, and the best way in which

this  can  be  done. But whilst we may provide  the

wherewithal to present our cultural activities,  we

are  not in a position to promote Singapore's image

overseas principally because of the lack of  funds.

This  is  essentially  a  matter  for  the  Tourist

Promotion Board. As Members may be aware, sending a

cultural  troupe  overseas costs a  lot  of  money,

quite   apart  from  the  time  spent  on  constant

rehearsals and training. There is also the question

of   providing  air  fares,  costumes,   insurance,

allowances and other incidentals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the suggestion of the Member is worth

pursuing  as  the  promotion of  Singapore's  image

abroad  is  a matter which, I consider, rests  with

the  Tourist Promotion Board. I would suggest  that

the    Tourist   Promotion   Board   give   serious

consideration  to such ventures in  the  future  by

providing,   in  liaison  with  Mercury   Singapore

Airlines, which will be soon our national  airline,

and  the  hotels  and other tourist establishments,

the necessary facilities for travel, accommodation,

allowances,  etc.,  to  make  such  overseas  trips

possible, thereby propagating the idea of Singapore

as a multi-racial,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



multi-cultural   Republic,   and    thus

attracting  more tourists to our island.  I  cannot

think  of  a  more potent way in which the  Tourist

Promotion Board can help itself to fulfil its  main

function  of  attracting tourists to Singapore,  as

has been suggested by the Member for Jurong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  somewhat taken by surprise by the reply. I  was

trying to speak for the Ministry of Culture to  get

the  Ministry  of Finance to give  more  money  for

cultural  activities.  However,  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  does  not  seem to think  that  this  is

necessary.  The question is this. Is  the  National

Theatre  worthy  of financial assistance  from  the

Government?  If so, it should give  more  money  so

that  it would not have to run into annual deficits

of  more  than $200,000, which can only be  met  by

contributions  or  donations from  members  of  the

public. If it has to carry on like this every year,

the difficulties will be great. What will happen to

the  National Theatre if it fails to get sufficient

donations?



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I

have  said just now, I fully agree with the  Member

cultural  activities. I promise I  will  look  into

this  matter, and also draw my Minister's attention

to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while we appreciate very

much  that cultural activities should be subsidised

by  the  Government, there are always other  claims

and  my  Ministry can only allocate funds according

to  the  priorities set down by the Government.  In

the  particular case of the Adelaide  Festival,  to

which  we  sent a very successful cultural mission,

may  I  point out that no provision was,  in  fact,

made in the 1971-72 Estimates. However, because  of

the  importance of participation in this particular

festival,  the Ministry of Finance did provide  the

money  even  though there was no provision  in  the

Estimates.  Therefore, it  can  he  seen  that  the

Government   is,  in  fact,  placing   considerable

emphasis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



on   culture.  Like  the  Member  for  Jurong,  the

Government does not want our people to become "Ugly

Singaporeans'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think what my

colleague,  the Member for Jurong,  was  trying  to

point out is that the allocation of $10,000 towards

cultural  organisations is  rather  a  paltry  sum.

Therefore, he was trying his level best to convince

the Minister of State for Finance that a larger sum

of  money  should be allocated to this subhead.  He

has   also  pointed  out  that  we  have   a   huge

organisation like the National Theatre Trust  which

depends  on public donations year after  year.  His

question is whether or not it is advisable for  the

Trust to carry on in this way, in view of the  fact

that  it  is  difficult to go out for donations.  I

appreciate the reply of the Minister of State  that

the  Government  has  set down  priorities  on  the

allocation of funds but, in respect of the cultural

troupe  to  the Adelaide Festival, much  money  was

spent although there was no provision for it in the

1971-72 Estimates. Therefore, Sir, it would  appear

from the reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Minister for Culture that his Ministry  is

well  aware  of the fact that the National  Theatre

Trust is doing quite well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I too share the concern of the

Member  for Jurong that the Government should  give

more  financial help to cultural organisations,  so

that we could eventually evolve a national identity

in our national culture.

view.   However,  as  I  have  pointed   out,   the

Government always has to balance between  competing

claims.  Our opinion is that while the sum may  not

be  enough  to cover everything, it does  at  least

give  encouragement  to cultural  organisations  to

initiate   their  cultural  activities.   Moreover,

culture  cannot  he fostered from  above.  It  must

spring from the grass-root level. We can only  give

encouragement. It will be a truer type  of  culture

if it springs from the grass-roots.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly

agree  with the Minister of State for Finance  that

we  should  encourage culture to  spring  from  the

grass-roots. However, the point at issue is whether

or  not  his Ministry will consider increasing  the

contribution to cultural organisations from $10,000

to  a bigger sum. That is the main question, and  I

think it is quite simple to answer it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also

like  to  suggest  to  the Minister  of  State  for

Finance  that one of the ways to encourage  culture

to  develop  from  the ground is  to  increase  the

financial assistance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the provision

in  the Estimates is, in fact, what we thought  the

appropriate   sum   that   would   encourage   such

development.  The  Government is  more  than  aware

that,  unless our country has some form of culture,

we  cannot  withstand the stresses and  strains  of

industrialisation. And for Singapore as a nation to

long endure, we must promote culture. But as I have

said,  the  sum  allocated is,  in  fact,  what  we

thought would be adequate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not agree

with what the Minister of State has said. We cannot

give  lip  service  only if we  want  to  encourage

cultural  activities.  Without  adequate  financial

aid, it would not have been possible for us to send

a  cultural mission to Adelaide. Therefore, I would

like the Minister of State for Finance to seriously

consider  increasing the allocation for next  year.

Instead  of  $10,000,  I  hope  he  will  give   an

assurance  that there will be more funds  for  next

year. Otherwise, I will not withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I cannot give him that

assurance  at all. I can only give the  undertaking

that  we  shall consider providing an adequate  sum

for cultural promotion in next year's Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, in that case I am not

prepared to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2654.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this amendment, I wish to seek

elucidation  from  the  Minister  as  to  why   the

contribution  to the ASEAN Fund has  to  remain  as

high  as  over  $3  million. Do the  other  member-countries  contribute just as much? Furthermore,  I

would  appreciate if the Minister could inform  the

House  on the cost benefit of continuing with  such

contributions.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Changi  has  asked why and how the  ASEAN  Fund  is

expended.  Since  the setting up  of  the  Fund  in

December 1969, Singapore has committed itself to an

expenditure totalling US$67,735 on six projects. To-date, Singapore has spent US$3,782 on two projects.

The  details of commitment and expenditure on these

two projects are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) ASEAN Theme Music Competition. The commitment

per country is US$1,275 and the amount expended  by

Singapore is US$1,153.33.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) There were four project tours of civil

aviation  experts. The commitment  per  country  is

US$4,260  and  the amount expended by Singapore  is US$2,629.15.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be observed that, in the two projects I

have  mentioned,  Singapore  spent  less  than  the

amount budgeted for by the ASEAN countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There is a joint participation in the ASEAN

Pavilion   at  the  1971  Jakarta  Fair   held   in

Indonesia. It was decided that Singapore's cost  of

participation of US$2,000 would be drawn  from  the

ASEAN  Fund and the rest of the cost, estimated  at

about US$18,000, would come from other sources. The

statement of accounts for this project has not been

finalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there were project tours of

telecommunications experts, international telephone

operators and satellite earth station engineers and

technicians. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



estimated  cost  of  the  project  per  country  is

US$5,940. While the statement of accounts  for  the

project has not been finalised, the actual cost  to

Singapore is expected to be substantially less than

what I have given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another four project tours of civil aviation

experts have been planned with a budget of US$4,260

per  country.  A tourism marketing  plan  has  been

planned  for  1972 with a budget of  US$50,000  per

country.  For  1973,  our  contribution   will   be

US$100,000 per country, thereafter increasing by 20

per cent per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are contributions to the Fund by

member-countries. The Fund totalling  US$5  million

is  made  up of contributions of US$1 million  from

each member-country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for benefits - direct or indirect - to

Singapore  from participation in the  projects,  it

would be really difficult to measure the extent  of

benefits  in anything which is cultural by  nature.

But if this will satisfy the Member, I can say that

the  ASEAN  theme music will be used  to  introduce

joint-ASEAN radio and T.V, programmes and at  ASEAN

functions whenever they are held. It will serve  to

give the Association of South-East Asian Nations  a

regional identity of its own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project tours of civil aviation experts,

telecommunications experts, international telephone

operators and satellite earth station engineers and

technicians were organised to carry out a survey of

operational and other facilities available in  each

country  with a view to co-ordinating the  services

among  member-countries. It is envisaged that their

findings would result in better services within the

region.  Singapore's participation in  the  Jakarta

Fair  is  in  support  of the decision  of  member-countries to promote trade and commerce of  member-

countries  jointly. As for tourism marketing  plan,

it is a follow-up of the "Visit ASEAN Year" held in

1971  for publicity and promotion campaigns and  is

expected  to  boost  tourism  in  the  region  from

Europe,  the  United  States  of  America,   Japan,

Australia and New Zealand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund may be used only for the purposes of

implementing projects which have been  approved  by

the  Foreign Ministers of ASEAN and, in  accordance

with  the rules governing the control, disbursement

and  accounting of the Fund. The agreed cost of  an

approved project will be shared equally by  member-countries.   However,   in  cases   where   certain

countries  derive a greater share of the  benefits,

the  Foreign Ministers may decide on the proportion

of the cost to be borne by member-countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead concerns the Management

like to know what is the function and scope of this

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Management

improving the administrative methods and procedures

adopted  and  also  to introduce mechanisation  and

computerisation.   Whereas   the   work   of    the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



on  matters  relating to organisation, and  methods

and requirements of office machinery and equipment,

the   Management   Services  Unit   will   function

essentially as a management consultant group with a

much   wider  scope  and  with  authority  to  make

substantial   changes   in  the   organisation   of

departments and the working systems and  procedures

currently adopted. One of the main areas of work of

the Management Services Unit will be the making  of

specific  studies and recommendations  for  greater

use  of  office  machines  and  equipment  and  the

computerisation of activities at present undertaken

manually.  In this task, it will work very  closely

with  the reorganised Computer Services Department,

which  was  formerly known as the  Electronic  Data

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff of the Unit will comprise, in addition

to the staff of the former Organisation and Methods

Branch  as  well as the former staff inspectors  of

the Treasury, senior management officers trained to

undertake this type of work, This will include  not

only  administrative officers but also accountants,

systems analysts and engineers. From time to  time,

experienced  staff from the various Ministries  and

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1306 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1041.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment I would like the

Minister to explain one point as regards the policy

for   the   collection  of  taxes  from   societies

registered  under the Societies Act.  I  think  the

Minister  will  agree  with me  that  the  existing

societies in Singapore play a very important



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



part  in  our efforts to build a closely-knit

society.  The Minister should be aware  that  these

societies  are organised on a voluntary  basis  and

depend  on their members' subscriptions and  public

support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these societies are going to raise funds for

the   construction  of  their   premises   or   the

establishment  of scholarships or other  meaningful

projects,  they  will have to  carry  out  a  fund-raising campaign.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from what I know a large -proportion of

these  funds which the societies have raised  after

great  pains and efforts goes to the Inland Revenue

Department  in the form of income tax.  Since  they

are  working for public good or charity, this  tax,

in fact, serves to discourage them to continue with

their efforts. I think the tax measure is not fair,

and  should be abolished. Income tax should not  be

levied  on  societies. If these  societies  can  be

exempted  from  tax,  then  they  will  be  greatly

encouraged to carry out their meaningful activities

-for  the  welfare of the public. This,  I  believe

will  be  of great benefit to our society  and  our

country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, not all voluntary

organisations  registered under the  Societies  Act

are  subject to income tax. Voluntary organisations

which are charitable in nature and are organised to

relieve distress, to advance science and education,

or  to promote health or services conducive to  the

welfare of the public as a whole, are exempted from

income   tax.   These  organisations  include   the

Singapore  Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Singapore

Association for the Blind, Singapore Arts  Council,

Society  for the Aged, and many others.  There  are

other  voluntary organisations which are formed  to

serve  a more sectional interest and which  do  not

cover  the well-being of the community in  general.

It is, therefore, not appropriate to subsidise such

organisations through income tax exemption, as they

do  not  serve the community at large  and  do  not

comply  with  the  requirements  for  a  charitable

organisation. The tax liability



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



of such organisations depends on the ratio  of

their  income from members or non-members. If  more

than half its income is from members, then it would

not  be liable to tax, but if more than half of its

income  is from non-members, then it will be liable

to  tax.  To  suggest that voluntary  organisations

should  one and all be exempted from income tax  is

to  invite tax evasion, as potential taxpayers will

soon    run    their   businesses   as    voluntary

organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the Member's suggestion that

certain  projects  run by voluntary  organisations,

for  example,  an education fund, be exempted  from

income tax, if such an education fund is, in  fact,

for  the benefit of the community at large and  not

just   covering  sectional  interest,  it  can   be

exempted from income tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  there is one matter  which  is  not

satisfactory. The Government has just  set  up  the

National Sports Promotion Board for the purpose  of

promoting  sports  activities in our  country.  The

Government  has also given some money as  financial

assistance to the other sports organisations in our

country.  These individual sports bodies,  such  as

the  Basketball Association of Singapore, also need

to   have   sufficient  funds  to   promote   their

activities in particular sports under their charge.

If  there  is  any  surplus of  funds  raised,  the

Government will levy tax on the surplus,  which  is

regarded as profits. I think, in the view of  these

sports bodies, this is not a reasonable attitude.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I am not quite clear as to

what  the  Member's  point is,  because  there  are

various  sports promotion groups that it would  not

be  possible really to give tax exemption to  every

little  group that promotes any type of sports.  To

do  so  would only be inviting trouble. But as  the

Member rightly pointed out, we have, in fact, given

tax  exemption  to  the National  Sports  Promotion

Board. This is one national organisation that looks

after  sports promotion. The Member should be quite

happy that Government is giving every encouragement

to sports.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I think the

Minister of State is not very clear about  how  the

National Sports Promotion Board is promoting sports

activities. The National Sports Promotion Board  is

promoting  sports  through its  various  affiliated

sports  bodies, such as the Basketball Association,

for  the  promotion of basketball. To take  another

example,  table  tennis  is  promoted  through  the

Singapore    Table   Tennis   Association.    These

Associations raise funds from members of the public

for this purpose. Therefore, should these funds  be

regarded as income, and taxed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to

ask the Minister of State whether he is willing  to

exempt the Basketball Association of Singapore from

income tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, to answer the Member for

Jurong, first. I really cannot say whether  or  not

we  will  exempt  the Singapore Amateur  Basketball

Association from income tax. Maybe he would like to

put in his application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the Member for Tiong Bahru, the best

thing  would  be for these various groups  to  come

under the umbrella of the National Sports Promotion

Board.  As this Board is a statutory body  and,  in

fact, being given tax exemption, the various sports

groups  can get subsidies from the Board.  Can  the

Member for Tiong Bahru imagine what will happen if,

for example, every little sports group calls itself

a  sports  promotion group and is entitled  to  tax

exemption?  Of course, if that were  the  case,  we

will  not be able to collect any revenue at all.  I

could  easily set up an XYZ sports promotion group,

and  put  every cent of my income in there and  get

exemption  from income tax! Then, where do  we  get

our revenue from? We would only he inviting serious

tax evasion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

although   I  am  not  quite  satisfied  with   the

explanation given by the Minister, but  because  of

time I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1306 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1191.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister of State for Finance enlighten

me  as  to  why  the owner of a television  set  is

charged  a licence fee at the same rate as one  who

owns  both a television set and a radio set? Surely

anyone  who possesses just one item should only  he

charged  a  fee for that item only. We  should  not

charge  a  flat  rate of $36 for a television  set,

irrespective of whether or not one possesses also a

radio set.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, it is, of course, always

possible to impose an additional tax on a radio set

owned by a person who also has a television set.  I

wonder  whether  the Member for  Anson  would  like

Treasury  to consider that! However, I gather  that

by  asking: whether or not something can be done to

regularise  the position, he does not  really  want

this to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, therefore, set out the way of our

thinking  about  the tax to show that, we  do  not

discriminate between running: a television set  and

running  both, a television set and  a  radio  set.

First, let me explain that the technical difference

between  a  radio  set  and a  television  set,  as

defined   by   the   Broadcasting  and   Television

Regulations,  1963. A radio set, as we  understand,

is  a  broadcast  sound  receiver  used  for  aural

reception of broadcast matters transmitted by radio

waves,  wire or cable; whereas a television set  is

a, broadcast television receiver capable of  aural

as well as visual reception of broadcast matters by

radio  waves,  wire or cable. The only  distinction

between  the two is the visual or picture reception

in  a television set. The common feature in both is

the aural or sound reception. A fee of $12 per year

is charged for sound reception in a radio set or in

a   television  set  or  both.  However,   as   the

television   set  is  also  capable  of   receiving

pictures,  it  is charged an extra  $24  per  year.

Thus,  the licence fee for a radio set is  $12  per

year,  and that for a television set $36 per  year.

It is still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



$36  per year for both a television set and a radio

set,  or  for  that matter two or even three  radio

sets.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think  so.  If a man owning a radio set is  charged

$12,  and  another  man with a  television  set  is

charged  $36, then in that case, everyone will  not

want  to  buy  a radio; he would prefer  to  buy  a

television.  It is better to pay a $36  fee  for  a

television  set because there will be no  necessity

then  to  buy a radio. Is it the intention  of  the

Minister  of  State that everyone must  not  buy  a

radio but a television?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, members of the public are

entitled  to  do  what they want.  If  they  buy  a

television set, they will have to pay $36  a  year.

But then they will not be able to receive any radio

broadcasts.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> That is a very good

explanation  coming from the Minister  of  State  -

that  as  a television set can receive both picture

and  sound, and therefore they charge $36, a  radio

set   can   only  receive  sound  broadcasts,   and

therefore  they  charge  $12.  I  agree  with   the

Minister  of  State, and therefore I beg  leave  to

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1306 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1251.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Anti-Evasion Unit which was set up only

very  recently has already done much work. In other

words,  they  have collected lots  of  taxes  which

otherwise  could  be lost through  tax  evasion.  I

would   like  to  highly  commend  them  for  their

efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister of State for Finance inform

this  House  as to the number of cases detected  by

this  Unit  and the amount involved, and  also  how

much  taxes  were recovered last year?  Further,  I

will  be  grateful if he can also  indicate  the  -

number of cases that have been prosecuted in  court

and the number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



of  cases  settled out of court. Sir, I  read  with

some interest in the papers recently that there are

some persons, who have outstanding taxes to pay  in

respect   of  their  incomes,  are  now  at   large

overseas. May I know what steps are being taken  to

ensure  that  such tax dodgers do pay  their  taxes

either by extradition or other means?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, the Anti-Evasion Unit

became  operational in 1970, and in  that  year  it

successfully  completed  investigations  into   107

cases. In 1971, the Unit succeeded in dealing  with

136  cases. The amount of income tax and  penalties

recovered  was  $3.9  million in  1970,  and  $11.6

million  in 1971. I am afraid, Mr Speaker, Sir,  at

the moment I do not have the figures for the number

of cases prosecuted in court and also those settled

out of court. However, if the Member is interested,

I will be happy to supply him with the figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps have been taken to ensure that taxpayers do

not escape tax by going overseas - for example,  by

withholding their passports as soon as  we  have  a

definite case of tax liability. However, in, cases

where taxpayers are already abroad, I am afraid  it

is  not  possible to extradite the taxpayer because

this  is  a  revenue case and extradition  is  only

applicable in criminal cases. I want to  point  out

that  as  a  result of the work of the Anti-Evasion

Unit,  this  operation has also  helped  to  induce

taxpayers  voluntarily to make  more  accurate  and

complete   returns  and  to  pay  their  taxes   in

accordance with their true incomes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am indeed grateful to the

Minister  of State for his reply, and am  anxiously

waiting for the figures which I have asked for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of those taxpayers who are

abroad,  I  am  surprised to  hear  that  there  is

nothing  we  can do about it. Surely  the  Ministry

concerned can look into this matter. I am told that

those taxpayers who are abroad have got large  sums

of money for which they have got to account for and

for which they have to pay taxes. If a taxpayer had

made  so  much  money and was able to  get  out  of

Singapore scot free, I think there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



must  be  something wrong with the  department.  In

this  respect,  Sir,  I  would  strongly  urge  the

Minister  for Finance to seriously look  into  this

matter  to  deter others who might  be  tempted  to

avoid  having to pay vast sums of money for  income

tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Punggol can be rest assured that everything will be

done,  in  cases  where a tax  liability  has  been

established, to ensure that collection will be made

as   far  as  possible,  but  in  cases  where  the

taxpayers have already gone overseas, the law, as I

said,  is  such  that  extradition  is  simply  not

applicable.  However, if we can trace or  find  out

that  there  is  any property in the  name  of  the

taxpayer who has gone abroad, such property can  be

proceeded against for the recovery of tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, that explanation is quite

irrelevant,  because  the  Anti-Evasion  Unit   was

primarily  established  for  two  reasons:  (1)  to

investigate into cases, and (2) to try and  recover

taxes. If it is a case in reverse, I would ask  the

Minister of State for Finance whether this Unit  is

able to locate the persons who should have declared

their  properties, sources of income, etc., to  the

Income Tax Department but had not done so. I myself

do  not  know.  But  surely his  department,  being

primarily concerned with this problem should  know.

There  was  an article in the newspapers  not  very

long  ago that certain persons whom the Income  Tax

Department were looking for, had left Singapore. It

is possible that the Extradition Act might not have

any  provisions to act in cases of this nature, and

if  that  is so, could they not be included?  After

all, the Minister of State for Finance is a learned

man,  and therefore, Sir, he could consider my very

humble  suggestion and take it up with  authorities

concerned.  That being the case, Sir, I would  like

to  close the debate on this topic, and I beg leave

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead l00l*.(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Yeo Choo Kok, Ho Kah Leong, Low Yong Nguan, and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past year, the Ministry of Culture

has  undoubtedly  contributed tremendously  to  the

promotion of healthy cultural activities. It has  a

creditable  record  of achievement,  by  organising

cultural  nights, concerts, solos, and monthly  art

exhibitions  in  the various community  centres  in

Singapore.  The  Ministry of  Culture  has,  so  to

speak,  brought  art and culture to the  grass-root

level.  Sir,  it  has  also  recently  organised  a

cultural   mission  to  participate  in  the   arts

festival in Adelaide, South Australia. Through this

cultural  mission,  it  has  publicised  the   fine

cultural  traditions of Singapore. The mission  was

very  well received and applauded by the people  of

Australia. This is indeed a great encouragement  to

the cultural workers and artistes of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the cultural mission has a very

high  standard of performance. I attended  a  dress

rehearsal  of  this cultural group at the  Victoria

Theatre on the eve of their departure. They put  up

a  very  good  and  tight programme  consisting  of

Malay,   Chinese  and  Indian  traditional  dances,

including a lion dance and ballet. All the artistes

who  took  part in the show had high standards  and

put  up a spectacular performance. It is no wonder,

therefore,  that  they received such  a  tremendous

applause in South Australia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the splendid performance by our cultural

mission  has  rebutted  the wrong  conception  that

local  artistes  are  not up to  standard  and  has

strengthened  the confidence of local artistes  and

cultural  workers.  In order that  our  people,  in

general, will be able to enjoy such cultural  shows

by  the  mission, I would like to  propose  to  the

Minister concerned to allow the mission to  perform

in the rural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



areas to promote healthy cultural activities. These

shows  can  be held regularly at parks or community

centres, and I am sure that the people of Singapore

will  give them a good reception. As you know, Sir,

culture  and art play an important role  in  nation

building because they help to strengthen the morale

of   our   people  an-d  also  inculcate   national

consciousness   and   patriotism.   Therefore   the

Ministry  of  Culture must actively  shoulder  this

role.  On  the other hand, it is also my hope  that

the  cultural  workers in Singapore will  similarly

match the efforts of the Ministry of Culture.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to suggest several proposals

for  the  consideration of the  Minister.  Sir,  to

encourage more local artistes or cultural  workers,

the   Ministry  of  Culture  should  send  cultural

missions overseas more often, like the one we  sent

to Adelaide in Australia. As a matter of fact, Sir,

sending   cultural  missions  overseas  have   many

advantages.  On the one hand, we can publicise  our

fine culture and art and, on the other hand, we can

strengthen  our friendly ties with other countries.

We  can  kill two birds with one stone. In view  of

this,  Sir, I would like to ask whether  this  year

the  Ministry of Culture has any plans to send  any

cultural mission abroad. Secondly, Sir, in order to

propagate our culture and art, I propose  that  the

Ministry  of Culture should hold a massive cultural

festival  every  year. In fact, 1  have  made  this

proposal  many  times over the past  few  years.  I

remember  that, during the last Budget debate,  the

Minister  of State concerned agreed that it  was  a

good  idea and he would consider it. One  year  has

passed, and I would like to ask the Minister or the

Parliamentary Secretary concerned what decision has

been  arrived  at  regarding  the  organisation  of

cultural  festivals in Singapore. May  I  have  his

views  on  this matter? Thirdly, I wish to  propose

the  setting up of a Cultural Fund. I remember this

proposal  was also made last year and the  Minister

in charge had agreed that a Cultural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



Fund be set up so that this would give an incentive

to  our local talent. I do not know whether or  not

the  scheme for the setting up of the Cultural Fund

has-been implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we set up a Cultural Fund in

Singapore,  it  will  contribute  greatly  to   the

promotion   of  cultural  activities.   From   this

Cultural  Fund we can also finance various cultural

activities  and  even  produce publications.  Local

talent will thus be encouraged and assisted. I hope

the  Minister  will give serious  consideration  to

these proposals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

not speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  the  Member for Sembawang has pointed out  just

now   the   Ministry  of  Culture  has   a   record

achievement last year in the promotion  of  healthy

cultural activities. In this-respect, I wish to say

that the Minister for Culture himself has been very

active  in the cultural front. Although he has  not

been  able to participate in this debate  today,  I

have  to  show  my  appreciation for  his  efforts.

Through  his  hard  work we are  able  to  see  art

exhibitions in the various community centres almost

every  week, and local artists are now able to  use

the  art  centre  at Outram3 Park  at  a  very  low

rental.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I take this opportunity to make three

proposals  to  the Parliamentary Secretary  in  the

field of cultural promotion? First, the setting  up

of  a permanent Art Gallery. Mr Speaker, Sir, there

are  many  artists in Singapore. Many of  them  now

enjoy  a  great reputation overseas. They are  well

known  not  only  locally but also internationally.

However, so far there is no permanent place or  Art

Gallery   to  display  their  work.  Although   the

proposal  to  build an Art Gallery  was  made  last

year,  so  far nothing has been done. Therefore,  I

wish  to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what

progress has been made-in this respect?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next proposal is this. Will the Ministry of

Culture ask for a piece of land to be used for  art

displays in the open air? For example, we  can  ask

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



some space along Queen Elizabeth Walk for our local

artists  to  display their work in the  open.  This

open   air  art  exhibition  will  attract  foreign

tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third suggestion is whether the Ministry of

Culture  will  seek  the assistance  of  the  other

Ministries concerned to put up sculptural works  on

our   traffic  islands.  The  traffic  islands  are

decorated only with plants and rocks. There are  no

sculptures.  Apart from a few pieces of  rocks  and

plants. I do not see any proper decoration  on  the

traffic islands, except one in Tiong Bahru. We have

many  sculptors in Singapore and we can  very  well

display their work on the traffic islands. We  have

some  well  known sculptors in Singapore,  and  the

Ministry  of  Culture  can liaise  with  the  other

Ministries  concerned so that the  traffic  islands

can be a venue for the display of statues and other

sculptural works produced by our sculptors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think these proposals merit

some consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore

there   are  only  two  daily  issues  of   English

newspapers, one in the morning and the other in the

afternoon.  These two issues are  produced  by  the

same  organisation. As a result, during the  recent

Straits  Times strike the English speaking  members

of  the  public were deprived of their daily  news.

Radio   and   Television  Singapore  was   a   poor

substitute.  Besides the short news  bulletins,  it

failed to keep the English speaking public properly

informed of local and world news.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to raise one point in this House.

Last  Monday in this House I spoke about the  Prime

Minister's  salary. I mentioned that  a  Minister's

salary  is $4,500. But I read in the Straits  Tunes

that it was reported as $4,200. I cannot blame  the

reporters. They are very busy reporting the debates

in Parliament. Most probably the correct figure was

left  out. However, the vernacular papers  reported

as  $4,500. Only the English paper reported  it  as

$4,200.  I  do not want to blame the reporters  and

the newspapers. But the people of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



must  be  made aware of what is happening  in

Singapore. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister for

Culture  that  he should request the newspapers  to

carry  more Singapore news instead of foreign news.

I   cannot   blame  the  reporters;  otherwise   in

tomorrow's  issue,  I  will  find  that  they  have

reported me differently. Instead of P. Govindaswamy

speaking, they might print as "Govindasamy".  I  do

not want that to happen. I am just mentioning it in

this House hoping that they will verify their news,

and will not allow such things to happen again.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first

of  all,  I  wish to thank the Member for Sembawang

for all the nice things he has said, especially  on

the success of our cultural mission to Adelaide.  I

appreciate the compliments made by him. Now he  has

also   advocated  the  sending  of  more   cultural

delegations aboard. I share with him the hope that,

with  further  effort  and planning  by  all  those

interested  in  the performing arts and  with  some

financial  support from Government and the  public,

we can send more cultural troupes abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier in replying to a question

raised  by  the Member for Jurong, my  Ministry  is

considering  how  best  to organise  more  cultural

missions  overseas.  Now that we  have  a  cultural

troupe   which   has  successfully   performed   in

Adelaide,  this  can  form  the  nucleus  of   such

cultural  troupes.  With  the  valuable  experience

gained  particularly in meeting  all  the  problems

involved in the preparation of a cultural troupe of

this  nature,  and possibly also, in  general,  the

establishment of a dance company, we are now  in  a

better position to consider how best Singapore  can

begin  to  form  either a strong  amateur  cultural

group  or a modest semi-professional dance company,

which  will  give cultural performances  abroad  as

well as locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Sembawang also suggested

that  cultural troupes should give performances  at

community  centres so that the people will  have  a

chance to see cultural shows, thereby



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



increasing  the  number of cultural  activities  in

Singapore,  in this case, the performing  arts.  He

has  also asked whether the Ministry of Culture has

any plans to organise cultural festivals. There are

no specific plans to organise cultural festivals at

the  moment.  However, in view  of  the  tremendous

success  of  the cultural mission to  the  Adelaide

Cultural  Festival, serious consideration is  being

given  to further develop our cultural performances

and  to  organise more cultural troupes. This  will

mean  greater expenditure. I have no doubt that  at

the  right  time  provision will be  voted  for  in

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also suggested that a Cultural Fund should

be  set up so that any moneys collected can be used

to  finance various cultural organisations  in  the

Republic  to  carry out their cultural  activities.

This  is  a  good suggestion, and I can assure  him

that we will look into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of a permanent Art Gallery raised

by  the  Member  for  Jurong,  at  the  moment  the

Ministry   of  Culture  is  finalising   plans   to

establish  an  Art  Gallery to  be  housed  in  the

National Museum building. This Art Gallery will  no

doubt  be  of considerable interest to  both  local

visitors  and overseas tourists. With the reversion

of  the  National Museum to the Ministry of Culture

from 1st April, 1972, we intend to convert the back

portion of the National Museum building into an Art

Gallery.  In  this connection, the  Singapore  Arts

Council  has  made an offer to contribute  $650.000

towards  the  conversion. The proposed Art  Gallery

will provide facilities for a permanent display  of

about  150  paintings and sculptures on a  rotation

basis.   Facilities  will  also  be  provided   for

temporary art exhibitions and the sale of paintings

and  sculptures. In addition, there will also be  a

small multi-purpose theatrette for about 150 to 200

persons so that all those who are involved  in  the

visual and the performing arts can make use of this

theatrette for their cultural activities.

<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Art Gallery should not only be a display

centre  but  also a focus of dynamic  and  forward-looking  activities  in  the  field  of  the  arts,

especially among the younger generation. As I  have

said  earlier,  plans are now  being  finalised  to

establish the Art Gallery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's other proposals that the

Ministry  should try to get a piece of  land  along

the  Queen  Elizabeth Walk area for the purpose  of

holding art exhibitions in the open and also to put

up  sculptures on traffic islands, I am taking note

of  his  proposals and will let  him  know  of  the

developments in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned that when the

staff  of  the Straits Times Group went on  strike,

there  were no English and Malay newspapers  during

the  period  of the strike, except for Chinese  and

Tamil   newspapers.  And  the  Member   experienced

difficulty  during that period and  suggested  that

the  Ministry of Culture should issue bulletins  in

the absence of newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff of the Straits Times Group went on

strike  from  24th to 31st December,  1971.  During

this   period,  the  English  and  Malay   educated

segments of the population were deprived of printed

news. Apart from Chinese and Tamil newspapers,  the

only other source of Malay and English news was the

radio   and   television.  Radio   and   Television

Singapore  at  the  time gave greater  coverage  to

local and foreign news. The strike mentioned was of

very  short duration. Had it continued, steps would

have been taken to remedy the position. As a matter

of interest, certain measures were being considered

to  provide for such a situation should it occur in

the future. All newspapers in Singapore are run  by

private  concerns.  Although local  newspapers  are

licensed by my Ministry, there is no press  control

in  Singapore, and the policy of the newspapers  is

dictated   by   persons  owning  and  running   the

newspapers.  If the general public is  strongly  in

favour  of  more  local news, then they  can  quite

easily  make their opinions felt by writing to  the

newspapers in the man-in-the-street



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



column  or  letters  to  the  editor

column.   There  is  no  doubt  that  any  socially

responsible  newspaper  will  respond  to  such   a

reasonable   request  if  it   is   backed   by   a

predominance  of its subscribers. I have  no  doubt

that  there  will be the balancing factor  in  that

other  subscribers will ask for more foreign  news.

Then the newspapers concerned will have to strike a

happy  medium between the subscribers and  in  this

way able to give the public what they want.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank

the   Parliamentary  Secretary  for  answering   my

questions.  But  there is one point  which  he  has

overlooked.  He  only quoted what I  have  said.  I

suggested that the cultural mission should  perform

in  the  various community centres. But he did  not

indicate whether or not he agreed to this proposal.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Sir, I will look into

this  matter. We had two performances on  the  18th

and  19th March for the public and school children.

But  since the Member has made his request, we will

try to organise these shows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Make sure you have a show in

Sembawang!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

refer  to  the Parliamentary Secretary's  statement

about the proposed Art Gallery, especially to  what

he  said regarding the exhibitions of paintings and

sculptures. I would imagine that there should  also

be  some  emphasis  on participation  in  art,  not

merely  on a passive spectator-approach to art.  In

that  respect,  I  think there  should  be  greater

encouragement of response from schools. In relation

to  this,  I  think  there  should  not  be  simply

encouragement given to exhibitions or expression in

paintings and other forms of art, but there  should

be some emphasis on art in relation to industry. In

this   way,  and  in  order  to  bring  about  this

relation,  there  are materials in the  forthcoming

Art  Gallery  that  could  lend  themselves  to   a

highlighting of such a relationship between art and

industry.  By  placing emphasis on  this  relation,

such as encouraging design competitions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



competitions  in respect of motifs for  silverware,

ceramics, and so on, one can make this relationship

clear, so that ultimately there may be some support

from  the  industrial sector for this Art  Gallery,

which otherwise would remain unrelated towards what

is  going  on  around us. In respect  of  what  the

Parliamentary  Secretary has also said  that  there

should be greater public support, I think the point

that I have made is relevant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I feel that Government should

more  actively  encourage  cultural  expression  in

general.  Ten  thousand dollars as contribution  to

cultural  organisations, as we have heard  a  while

ago,  is  chicken-feed  in  relation  to  what  the

Minister  of  State for Finance has said  regarding

grass-roots.  If you want to fertilise grass-roots,

$10,000 will not be enough even for fertilisers  in

a  good  orchid  industry  in  Singapore!  I  would

imagine  I have to give support to the Ministry  of

Culture  in any of its future attempt to  get  more

money for the encouragement of arts in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the dome of the Victoria Memorial Hall and

Theatre  is  very plain in appearance.  Since  this

building  is in the heart of the city  and  also  a

tourist  attraction, something should  be  done  to

better  its  appearance. I suggest that  the  State

crest be erected on the dome.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, both

the Victoria Theatre and the Victoria Memorial Hall

with the clock tower were completed as one unit  of

a  building in 1906. Previous to that, the  Theatre

section of the present building was built as a Town

Hall  in  1862.  Subsequently,  it  underwent  many

changes and was completely renovated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



and  redecorated  in  1958.  At  present,  Victoria

Theatre and Victoria Memorial Hall building is more

than  60  years  old.  It has become  a  historical

landmark.  Architecturally, it evinces interest  as

it  stands  in  imposing  contrast  with  the  many

buildings,  which were erected by local architects,

both in its vicinity and throughout the Republic. I

do  not  think  that it would be  an  advantage  to

modify old buildings merely because they were built

in colonial times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member's suggestion that the State crest

should be erected on the clock tower, I think  this

matter   has   to   be  referred  to   the   proper

authorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Broadcasting Division of the Ministry of

Culture   has   by  this  time,   despite   a   few

resignations,  gained  considerable  resources   in

terms  of  experience and expertise of  its  senior

staff.  I  wonder. Sir, what training opportunities

are being organised to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



give  the younger staff members the benefit of  the

knowledge  and experience garnered by  older  staff

members.  From what may be observed of broadcasting

programmes, I am sure that the Programmes  and  the

News  section  staff,  like  Programme  Assistants,

Comperes, Interviewers, News-readers, and the like,

can  improve their performance through exchange  of

views,   supervised  guidance,  seminars,   special

training  programmes  organised  on  an  in-service

training  basis, and so on. I would  like  to  know

what  is  being  done in this regard  to  make  the

presentation  of both entertainment and  news  more

lively  and polished. Apart from the local training

of  personnel,  it  will be  useful  to  send  them

abroad,  or to take advantage of visiting  experts.

The    T.V.-radio   media,   as-entertainment   and

educational media, are constantly undergoing  rapid

changes-and  are  exposed to  constant  changes  in

style and selection of themes for presentation.  We

have  to keep in constant touch with what is  going

on in the-international broadcasting scene. I would

like   some   elucidation  from  the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture in respect of

training overseas-as well as locally.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the

Budget  session  last year, one  of  my  colleagues

brought up the question of late screening of  Tamil

films  on  television  on  Thursdays  and  Fridays.

Nowadays, Tamil films are still being shown on  TV.

every  Thursday and Friday at 10 p.m, and not  many

people   have  the  opportunity  of  viewing   them

satisfactorily.  In view of the fact  that  workers

have  to sleep early, is it not possible to  screen

Tamil  films  on Mondays and Tuesdays at  an  early

hour? Surely this is not asking too much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The F.M. Stereo section has failed miserably in

that  it  is not aware of the existence  of  stereo

records  in Hindi and Tamil. It is high  time  that

Radio  and  Television Singapore introduced  stereo

programmes  for  Indian listeners  too.  After  all

there  is  no  shortage of such  records,  if  only

R.T.S, would make an effort to purchase them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, Sir, I would like to mention

something   about  uniforms,  which  I  raised   in

yesterday's Committee of Supply. Speaking  on  that

amendment. I had asked for something to be done  to

the  postal  uniforms to distinguish the  different

grades  of  officers. But the R.T.S, have  reported

that   Mr  N.  Govindasamy  had  said  that.   Most

probably,   all   the  reporters   think   that   P

Govindaswamy  and N. Govindasamy are brothers.  No,

we are not related.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I mentioned a matter regarding the

Straits  Times.  Now I have to  mention  about  our

radio broadcasts. Radio is under our control.  They

must  be very careful in their report, and also  to

see   to   the  need  for  Tamil  stereo   records.

Yesterday,  I  moved  an amendment  to  the  Postal

Services. I was from the Postal Department, and  so

I  must show my postal colleagues that I have  done

something  for them. Tomorrow, when I go  out  they

might ask, "What have you done for us?" And I  must

have  an answer. Therefore, I ask the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Culture  to  rectify

this error. Do not let this kind of wrong reporting

happen again in future, i.e., reporting the speaker

as N. Govindasamy instead of P. Govindaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I

disclaim any responsibility for that!



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Sir, in reply to the

Member  for Katong who said that he was  very  much

concerned  with  the  quality  of  interviews,  and

reports,   etc, and  also  that   more   training

opportunities should be given to the younger  staff

of the Broadcasting Department, I have this to say.

Training  for  Programmes staff, i.e.,  Announcers,

Producers   and   Assistant   Producers,   includes

lectures  as  well  as  practical  work.   A   good

interviewer  is not made after attending  a  single

course on the art of interviewing. He needs  to  be

given  time  to  build up confidence  and  to  gain

practical experience. A follow-up of this programme

has  to  be done. We have also sent members of  the

Broadcasting staff for training overseas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that there is room for improvement

in  the  standard of interviewing by R.T.S, staff,

including  its  news  reporters.  For  reasons   of

economy, R.T.S, do not recruit staff purely  to  do

interviews,  that is, they are employed  with  only

the qualifications for that specific job. To accept

the  proposal  that  we have  such  specialists  in

R.T.S, would mean a radical change in staffing  and

equipment,   with  a  corresponding   increase   in

financial   provision.   R.T.S, announcers    and

producers  are  presently expected to  be  able  to

announce,  compere, read the news,  write  scripts,

produce  programmes, interview and  comment  either

for  radio  broadcasts or for  television,  or  for

both.  Some  of them do their jobs more competently

than others, while some are only able to do one  or

two  of  these  jobs well. The same versatility  is

expected  of R.T.S, reporters, who also cover  both

for  radio  and  television. Persons  recruited  as

R.T.S, reporters  generally have  no  journalistic

experience, and therefore they have first to  learn

the job about news reporting. Subsequently they are

also  expected  to do interviews for television  as

well  as  radio.  Here again, some  reporters  have

shown  more  ability  in this  area  of  work  than

others. Courses in the art of interview have in the

past   few  years  been  conducted  for  new  staff

recruited  for programme work. Since  last  year  a

Colombo  Plan expert for radio has been  conducting

training  courses for the staff, which include  the

art  of  interview.  This and  other  courses  will

continue to be held. Training for our reporters  in

this  field was started last month under a  Colombo

Plan  expert for television. It is hoped that  such

in-service  sessions will help improve the  quality

of  interviewing for radio and television.  I  hope

the Member for Katong is satisfied with the answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member for Anson's complaint

about  the Tamil programmes, R.T.S, do not telecast

the Tamil film either on Channel 5 or 8 on Mondays.

Tamil films usually appear as a regular feature  on

Channel 8 on Thursdays at 9.45 p.m, and Fridays  at 10.00 p.m. There is, however, a light



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



musical    programme   in   Tamil   entitled    Nam

Isainyarkal,  i.e.,  Our  Music  Makers,  which  is

telecast at 8.05 p.m, on Mondays on Channel 8.  For

the  Family In Tamil is telecast on Channel 8  at 8.45  p.m, on Wednesdays. Also on Channel 8 at 6.10

p.m, on  Saturdays there is a Tamil drama, Naadaga

Arangam.  On  Sundays,  a  variety  show,   Amuthum

Thenum,  is  telecast at 5.45 p.m. It can  be  seen

from  this that Tamil programmes are evenly  spread

throughout  the week's hours of transmission,  with

some  programmes scheduled in early  evening  slots

and  others a little later. This is also  the  case

with  programmes in the other languages. It is  not

possible  to  telecast programmes in  a  particular

language  only at peak hours. Because of  the  long

unpredictable duration of full length Tamil films -

I hope the Member for Anson takes note of this - it

is difficult to schedule them between 6.00 p.m, and 9.50  p.m.  News telecast takes place  during  this

period and this has to be at stipulated times.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I cannot agree with the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Culture.  I  want the drama film, Naadaga  Arangam,

changed to other days, and in its place put another

Tamil  film.  R.T.S, can also change  the  telecast

time for Amuthum Thenum. There is no harm.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> I will consider that.

quality,  then  I hope something will  be  done  to

improve  the  position. However,  in  view  of  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the National Library is doing a

magnificent  job, it can still further improve  the

facilities  it  offers through its  mobile  library

service.  At present too many areas are  completely

neglected, so much so that many children of school-going  age  are deprived of the library service.  I

quote,   for  example,  Thomson  Road,  Nee   Soon,

Sembawang, and Naval Base area.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

National  Library at present has 12 mobile  library

service  points. These are at community centres  in

Pasir  Panjang, Bukit Panjang, Kampong  Cheng  San,

Kampong  Tengah,  MacPherson, Nee Soon,  Changi  10

ms.,  Bukit Timah, Tanjong Pagar, Paya Lebar,  Kaki

Bukit  and  Chong  Pang Village.  Rural  areas  are

served through mobile library points, which include

those  at Bukit Panjang, Kampong Tengah, Changi  10

ms.,  Kaki  Bukit and Chong Pang Village  community

centres. The mobile library makes weekly visits  to

these  community centres. The National Library  has

plans to extend its mobile library service to other

rural   areas   such  as  Woodlands,  Punggol   and

Tampines.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, what about the other

rural areas? Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree

to send a mobile library to serve those areas?



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Sir, generally priority

consideration  has  to be made  in  the  choice  of

service points. This includes accessibility of  the

mobile  library  van  to  the  service  points   of

community  centres. The van is a large vehicle  and

requires  a  fair amount of space for  parking  and

manoeuvring   around.  Another   consideration   is

whether  a  spare  room is available  to  house  an

emergency  book stock in case of vehicle breakdown,

thus  ensuring  no  disruption  in  service.  Other

considerations  are  how  well-used  the  community

centre is by the residents of the district, and how

close the centre is to the nearest library service.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> In view of the explanation by

the   Parliamentary  Secretary,  I  beg  leave   to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1751.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we all know, films are a popular form of

public  amusement. Because of the advances in  film

techniques,  we  can  see  the  performances   with

realistic  detail on the screen. This is  a  common

everyday form of amusement indulged by the  people.

Therefore, because of its extensive influence  over

cinema-goers, we should exercise strict  censorship

on  them, so that those decadent, erotic, fantastic

or  undesirable films shall not adversely influence

our children and youths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although we have all along censored films,

however, some films being exhibited in the  cinemas

consist  of  merely  cruelty,  violence  and  other

undesirable themes, which will have adverse effects

on   our  young  people.  So  we  must  adopt  more

stringent  measures in the censoring of  films.  On

the  other  hand,  we should allow  more  films  of

artistic  taste  and  educational  content  to   be

imported  into Singapore, in order to  provide  our

people with more healthy and cultural films.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that the Ministry of Culture

has  set up a film classification committee.  As  1

understand it, the committee has already given  its

recommendation to the Minister. I would like to ask

the Minister whether any decision has been made  on

film  classification. I personally do not agree  to

film  classification because, in  my  opinion, our

people   would   all  like  to  see   healthy   and

educational  films.  If  certain  films   are   not

suitable for screening to youths and children, then

they  belong to the bad category of films, in which

case,  even  adults should not see them.  What  the

people  want  is  the kind of  films  that  can  be

enjoyed by the whole family. Therefore, I am of the

opinion that we should not implement this system of

film classification. According



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



to  my  information, the film classification system

now  being implemented in our neighbouring  country

has  aroused certain disturbances there. I hope the

happened in our neighbouring country in respect  of

film classification before he makes his decision on

this matter.

<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Ministry of Culture has always been very strict  in

censoring  violent  films, and  all  Chinese  films

which show excessive violence are either banned  or

appropriately censored before they are released for

public   exhibition.   As  a   result   of   strict

censorship, coupled with the change in the trend of

production,  the  number of violent  Chinese  films

released  for  public exhibition has  been  reduced

considerably  in recent months. It  is  anticipated

that  this year's import of films of this  category

by   local  distributors  will  be  lessened.   The

Ministry   will   continue   to   exercise   strict

censorship  to  eliminate  scenes  of  callousness,

violence and bloodshed. As was pointed out  in  the

last Budget session, despite discussions among film

distributors, exhibitors and ordinary cinema-goers,

there  was  no definite consensus of opinion  among

the   parties  concerned  on  the  system  of  film

classification  and  whether or  not  a  particular

system would definitely be better than the existing

film censorship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an advisory committee on film classification

was  set  up  by  the Minister in May  1971.  After

considering its report, tt was considered that  the

advantages  accruing from classification  of  films

were  marginal as compared with the problems  which

have  to be overcome. Among these were the problems

of enforcement and what may be termed the differing

standpoints of the different cultural groups, e.g.,

vis-a-  vis-  risque scenes on the  one  hand,  and

violent  sword-fighting scenes  on  the  other.  No

decision  has, therefore, been taken as to  whether

film  classification should be introduced  for  the

present. I hope I have answered the Member's  query

satisfactorily.

hearing   the  reply  given  by  the  Parliamentary

Secretary,  I am not satisfied because he  has  not

been  specific  whether  his  department  wants  to

implement film classification.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> As I said just now,

there   was   an   advisory   committee   on   film

classification headed by Dr Peter S. J.  Chan,  and

was  set  up  by  this Ministry in  May  1971.  The

committee  has submitted a report which recommends,

among   other   things,   that   a   simple    film

classification  system be introduced.  It  suggests

that   films   should   be  classified   into   two

categories, one for general exhibition, and another

for  restricted  screening to adults  aged  18  and

above only. Owing to the difficulty of checking the

ages  of  audiences and the fact that the trend  of

producing pornographic films has declined  somewhat

in  the  West,  most of our local film distributors

and  exhibitors are not keen on film classification

as   they  have  expressed  satisfaction  with  our

present censorship system. That is the position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, since that

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two years ago, we heard that structural

alterations to and the presentation of exhibits  in

the Ministry is going to do this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may offer

some  clarification  to the  point  that  has  been

raised.    The   reorganisation    is    not    the

responsibility  of  the Ministry  of  Culture.  The

Member for Anson is talking about the Museum as  it

was  two  years ago. The Museum was then under  the

Ministry  of Science and Technology. In respect  of

reorganisation,    the    different    method    of

presentation of exhibits is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



reference  to  the reorganisation  of  the  natural

history exhibits of the Museum, and this aspect  of

reorganisation is taking place in that the exhibits

are  being shifted to the Science Centre in Jurong.

The  other  aspect  of reorganisation,  namely,  in

respect  of  Art  and  Anthropology,  will  be  the

responsibility of the Ministry of Culture.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I

said  in my reply to the question raised by one  of

the  Members just now, from the 1st of  April,  the

under   the   Ministry   of   Culture.   With   the

the  Member  for Katong has already mentioned,  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1824.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this provision is for an

Education Officer in the Museum. We know there  are

lots  of precious exhibits in the Museum. All these

exhibits  are  very  valuable  teaching  aids   for

schools.  Students  can obtain a  useful  knowledge

from  these  exhibits, especially in the  field  of

history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know something about the post of

Education Officer. In the Estimates, I can see that

there  is provision for only one Education Officer.

I  have  some doubts as to whether this  person  is

capable  of  doing all the work involved.  We  know

that  our  country practises the policy  of  multi-lingualism,  and  I am doubtful if  this  Education

Officer  can satisfy the requirements  of  all  the

four language stream schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

support  what the Member for Jurong has  said  with

regard to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



Education  Officer  in  the  new  Art  Gallery  and

Museum. I agree with him that one Education Officer

is  not  adequate  because we  have  to  cater  for

different  language media schools. The  past  staff

position in the National Museum, where its  natural

history  responsibilities were  concerned,  was  to

have  two  Education  Officers  seconded  from  the

Education  Ministry  and paid for  by  the  Science

Centre  Board. I would recommend that some move  be

worked  out  so  that there can  be  two  Education

Officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would imagine that it is important to involve

schools  in the Art Museum, which is in the process

of being set up. I would imagine also that it would

be  good  if  the Education Officers of the  Museum

staff  could  organise  a special  section  in  the

Museum related to interests in art and craft in the

schools, in the same way as such a section has been

organised  with special attention to the  interests

of  schools in natural history, especially as  laid

down  in the syllabuses for schools. It would be  a

good  idea  to emphasise early school  activity  in

art,  both  in  the  primary and  later  stages  of

education  because a love for, and an interest  in,

art must be inculcated at a very young age, and one

wants  to tap the potential, at as early an age  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this special section to encourage art

expression   emanating  from  the  schools,   other

activities can also be carried out, like  seminars,

film  shows, courses for art teachers, guided tours

of the Museum itself, in such a way that a constant

activity is taking place, and that there is  not  a

passive  response  to art. In as  much  as  I  have

spoken   about  the  necessity  to  encourage   the

industrial and applied aspects of art, I hope  that

where  schools  are concerned, every  encouragement

will  be given so that the function as well as  the

aesthetic  aspects of art could  be  emphasised  to

benefit  not only school children, but  the  Museum

itself.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

full  duties and functions of the Education Officer

are:   the  conducting  of  tours  in  the   public

galleries and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



lessons  in  the  school's museum;  organising  and

conducting   regular  -  specialised  courses   for

screening    films    on   Saturdays;    organising

illustrated  talks  and  demonstrations   to   Pre-University   and  upper  secondary   students   and

teachers   once  a  month;  assisting  schools   to

establish  science  clubs  and  giving  illustrated

talks    and   demonstrations   to   these   clubs;

supervising the preparation of biological specimens

for loan to teachers; and organising special talks,

demonstrations  and  film shows  for  students  and

teachers when requested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member for Katong's suggestions that we

should  also  include all the other  aspects,  like

art,  etc., I am sure we could look into  them.  At

present,  the courses are conducted in English  and

Chinese. It is hoped that in future they would also

be  conducted in Malay and Tamil. However, students

and  teachers  from all the four  language  streams

have  participated in the school service activities

because   those  in  the  Malay  and  Tamil   media

understand  English  and can follow  the  lectures,

demonstrations, and film shows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st April, 1972, two Education Officers will

be  seconded from the Ministry of Education to  the

service  in  the  National Museum where  a  limited

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the 7th Grand Prix will be held

at  the Sembawang circuit next Fri-day. Grand  Prix

has become a national event in Singapore and it  is

participated   not   only   by   local   but   also

international competitors. In fact, Sir, it is  one

of the very few international sporting events which

is  held  in  Singapore. Singapore has  a  rightful

place in the international motor racing calendar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, can we say that we have a suitable

circuit?  What  we need is a permanent  Grand  Prix

circuit, and this question was raised not less than

twice  previously.  Sir, though next  week's  Grand

Prix  is  the  seventh in our series, we  have  had

motor  racing  events  for many  years.  The  local

participants in the racing events are always  at  a

distinct  disadvantage because of  the  lack  of  a

permanent  circuit  where  they  can  practise  and

compete  with  one another in order that  our  best

talents  can participate at the annual  Grand  Prix

event.   A   permanent  circuit  will  provide   an

opportunity for our young speed enthusiasts to test

their  skill and their motor cars or motor  cycles.

We  hope  it will also put an end to the  hide-and-seek that our young motorists are playing with  the

traffic police at odd hours in various places, like

Orchard Road, Nicoll Highway, Nicoll Drive,  Jurong

and  other venues. Our motorists and motor-cyclists

have  not  been  able to offer keen competition  to

international  competitors in our Grand  Prix,  not

because  they lack talent but because there  is  no

permanent  circuit  where  they  can  practise  for

competitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last March, Sir, our sporting Minister for Social

Affairs  told us that a committee had been  set  up

and  it had submitted a comprehensive report to the

Government  on  an  alternative  site   and   other

requirements.  He  also told us that  the  proposed

multi-purpose  circuit would be in a good  location

with  scenic surroundings and away from residential

areas.  He also told us that there would be  social

amenities  and  it  would  thus  become  a  tourist

attraction. May I inquire what has become  of  this

committee's report? It is high time we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



had  a  permanent racing circuit.  We  should  stop

using  the  Sembawang circuit  with  its  attendant

inconveniences, although it is not an inconvenience

to  me  because  I am staying just a stone's  throw

from it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I wish to take this opportunity to talk about

the  progress  of  sports in Singapore.  In  recent

years  sports  have  been  promoted  by  the   able

leadership of the Social Affairs Ministry and great

progress has been made. The standard of the various

kinds  of  sports has improved. There is  no  doubt

that  sports play a very important role  in  nation

building.  It is through organised activities  such

as  sports  that we build a rugged society.  Sports

make  our  people physically strong  and  cultivate

good  moral virtues. Therefore, sports deserve  our

close  attention. I am sure we all agree  that  the

Ministry of Social Affairs has done a great deal in

the promotion of sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Promotion Division has organised an

inter-constituency soccer competition in  order  to

popularise   sports.  In  order  to  support   this

competition  the  Prime  Minister  has  donated   a

Challenge Trophy. The Sports Promotion Division has

done  a great deal in the promotion of sports.  The

object  is  that  more people will  participate  in

sports.  However, what I cannot understand is  that

it  sometimes  does something which  obstructs  the

promotion of sports, especially when it attempts to

raise  funds  for the setting up of soccer  fields.

There  is  a soccer field in my constituency  which

was  handed  over  by  the  British  Armed  Forces.

Previously  it  was free for any football  team  to

practise there, but now there is a charge of $5 per

day  for  the use of this field. This has caused  a

financial burden on the football teams which intend

to  practise  there. I know that in  some  football

fields  a charge of $2 is levied. In any case,  why

is  it that for the Naval Base football field $5 is

levied  for  each  day? I hope  the  Minister  will

reduce  this fee, or better still, make it free  of

charge.  This  will  encourage  everybody  to  play

football and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



standard of soccer will improve. I do not know what

the Minister thinks about this idea.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the

Member  for Telok Blangah that my Ministry attaches

the   highest  priority  to  the  provision  of   a

permanent Grand Prix circuit in Singapore. However,

the choice of a proper site and its availability in

the  context  of the general shortage of  land  for

development  purposes, besides the heavy  financial

investment, are relevant considerations which  have

delayed  our decision to go ahead with the project.

It  is still under very active consideration  by  a

committee with representations from the Ministry of

National  Development, the Ministry of Finance  and

the  Ministry of Social Affairs, working  in  close

consultation with officials of the Singapore  Motor

Club.  I  hope they will be able to finalise  their

investigations and come to a definite conclusion in

the  not  too  distant future. It is  invidious  to

encourage  motor racing in general, as  the  Member

has  said, and the annual Grand Prix in particular,

without having a permanent circuit, but it must  be

seen  within competing alternatives and  priorities

for  land and money. I am personally confident that

we will be able to resolve this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the query raised by the Member for

Sembawang, the Sembawang football field is  one  of

the  facilities recently handed over to us  by  the

British Forces. The rental has been fixed at $5 per

session, and this is the normal payment far half  a

day. This means that for such payment each side can

play  football for half a day if they want  to.  As

the  Member has said in other places, for  instance

at  Farrer  Park,  the charge  for  the  use  of  a

football field is only $2 per match. The fields  in

Farrer  Park are heavily utilised and there can  be

two or three matches on the field in one day. I  am

afraid I cannot allow the use of the football field

in  Sembawang without any charge, because there  is

always the question of maintenance. However, if the

Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



for Sembawang still thinks that he cannot afford to

pay  the $5, he can always approach me and  I  will

consider his request.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  think the rental of $5 for the  use  of  a

football field is not going to promote sports.  The

Ministry  of Social Affairs has adequate funds.  It

can  raise funds by various means, for example, the

selling  of lucky draw tickets. He should  consider

the  fact  that many football teams  are  short  of

funds.  It is not only $5 which they have to  incur

by  way of expenses. The players have also to spend

money  on  drinks  and  refreshments,  laundry   of

jerseys  and uniforms. After the practice  session,

some  of  the  players  have  to  spend  money   on

transport. If we can allow these teams a  free  use

of  the  football  field, this  will  serve  as  an

encouragement  and more and more people  will  play

football.  The standard of soccer will  improve  in

the long run.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what is

$5?  There  are  many  Father  Christmases  in  his

constituency.  Once  I allow  the  free  use  of  a

football  field  in  his constituency,  many  other

Members  of Parliament will make the same  request.

As I have said, should he find difficulty in paying

the $5, he can come and see me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am rather curious as to what a

Psychologist  is  doing in the Ministry  of  Social

Affairs  headquarters.  Perhaps  the  Minister  can

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, obtaining

my  Ministry's  plan to improve the adjustment  and

rehabilitation  programme  operating  in  both  the

Social  Welfare  Department and the  Probation  and

Aftercare Section. The Psychologist will  not  only

deal  with  the  problems  of  children  and  young

delinquents but also normal children who  sometimes

need  guidance  to ensure the full  development  of

their  personalities and the formation of wholesome

attitudes,  outlook, habit and  adjustment  to  the

institutional   setting   in   which   they    find

themselves, as well as their adjustment to  society

and  life.  Even  adults who  have  approached  the

Counselling  and  Advice  Section  for   assistance

sometimes  require  the help of a  Psychologist  in

view  of  their deep-seated emotional conflict  and

personality  problem.  In the  treatment  of  young

delinquents,  especially those who take  drugs  and

are  put  on  probation,  the  rehabilitation  team

requires the services of a Psychologist to  conduct

a psychological examination to enable the Probation

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to know what sort of

complaints  the Director of the Central  Complaints

Bureau  receives.  Perhaps these  complaints  would

fall  neatly into certain categories.  It  will  be

interesting to know what sort of complaints  people

lodge   with  this  Bureau,  and  how   are   these

complaints solved, and what steps are taken to meet

the needs of the complainant.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the Central Complaints

Bureau  receives  various kinds  of  complaints  by

telephone,  through correspondence, or  in  person.

All the complaints are classified as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Discourtesy - rudeness in speech,

discourteous     in    manner,     including

disrespect by using force;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Misconduct;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Petty bureaucracy or red tape;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Unnecessary delay of service; of course, a

certain delay may be unavoidable;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Discrimination of service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Illegal acts of any person, including any

member of the public;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Protest for sympathetic consideration from

the Government; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Private disputes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaints are sorted out by tactful and

proper  representation  of each  case  through  the

competent  authority  to  ensure  that  appropriate

departmental, disciplinary or enforcement action is

taken.  Otherwise a remedy or a realistic  solution

is always suggested. Normally, complainants are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



informed  of  the  result of the  investigation.  I

think it is interesting to note that the results of

the  775 cases dealt with by the Bureau in 1971 are

as follows



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dismissal - two cases;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning - 27 cases;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insufficient evidence for further proceedings - 153 cases;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misconception of facts - 12 cases;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsubstantiated complaints - 147 cases;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending investigation - 35 cases;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remedial action - 399 cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau has to operate like a watchdog

organisation  to ensure that the services  provided

by  the  various Government departments  and  their

staff  ore  both  efficient as well  as  courteous.

Therefore, constant observation of duty has  to  be

performed,  even  in the absence  of  any  specific

complaint being made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of late, prospective pilgrims from Singapore

faced a lot of difficulties, particularly those who

wanted  to go to Mecca by ship. In previous  years,

prospective  pilgrims  can  board  their  ships  at

Singapore. But last year they had to go to the Port

of Klang. They made no preparations for the trip to

the  Port of Klang as they were first scheduled  to

board  ship in Singapore. However, because of their

great  desire  to  go  to  Mecca,  they  faced  the

problems  and difficulties with patience  and  with

the  full  conviction  that they  would  definitely

reach the destination. To assist future pilgrims of

Singapore, the President of the Majlis Ugama- Islam



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



in  his  press  statement  recently  said  that   a

Pilgrimage  Fund would be established in Singapore.

I  would like to know what plans have been made  to

assist  prospective pilgrims. To obtain the support

of  Muslims  in Singapore, the Majlis  Ugama  Islam

should  make  the  scheme  attractive  and  provide

amenities  to the prospective pilgrims. Apart  from

providing   amenities  and   facilities   for   the

prospective  pilgrims, the Majlis should  encourage

Muslims   to  save  mores-  through  the   proposed

Pilgrimage  Fund for their journey to the  Haj,  in

which  they  would  have  to  face  all  sorts   of

difficulties in Mecca and N4edina, particularly  in

respect  of welfare and health. Many pilgrims  from

Singapore  were  ignored by the pilgrim  agents  in

Mecca  who  have contacts with one or  two  pilgrim

agents in Singapore. Most of the pilgrim agents are

concerned with their own welfare and with making  a

lot  of profit. As such, it is important to provide

assistance  and amenities to pilgrims of  Singapore

at Mecca and Medina.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another matter, which I would like to bring

to  the  attention of this House is that the Majlis

Ugama  Islam  or  the Minister for  Social  Affairs

should consult the Central Provident Fund anti  the

Ministry  of Labour to allow Muslims who  have  got

funds  in  the  CP.F, to withdraw  part  of  their

contributions and deposit it in the Pilgrimage Fund

in  order  to enable them to go on a pilgrimage  to

Mecca. Sir, I would like to stress that it is  only

a  part  and not all of their contributions  or  an

amount which is sufficient for their fare to Mecca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the proposed Pilgrimage Fund will get

a  good response from Muslims in Singapore and,  in

this  way, will allow Muslims, while they are still

young  and strong, to go to the Haj when  they  are

fit to do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know how many mosques

and  suraus  are  under the administration  of  the

Majlis?  Are all the mosques and suraus  under  the

administration of the Majlis, and are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



they  allotted funds for extension and  improvement

purposes? What steps are being taken by the  Majlis

for  the  smooth administration of the mosques  and

suraus in the Republic?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to know how many

kathis  and assistant kathis there are at  present,

and  how  were  they recruited by the Majlis  Ugama

Islam.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to know

whether  the  Majlis  Ugama Islam  knows  how  many

Muslim  religious schools are there  in  Singapore,

and  how  many of them are teaching Muslim subjects

at  the primary level and teaching subjects in  the

secondary level. How many Muslim students have gone

abroad  for further studies, for example, in Egypt,

Saudi   Arabia,  Indonesia  and  the  other  Muslim

states?   From  which  Muslim  colleges  do   these

students  obtain  their  qualifications?  And  what

assistance has the Majlis Ugama Islam given in this

regard?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  thank the Member for Kampong Kembangan for  his

interest  and  concern over the  projects  that  he

mentioned,  which  the  Majlis  Ugama   Islam,   is

actively  considering.  The  Majlis'  plan  is,  of

course,   intended   to  help  Muslims   in   their

pilgrimage to Mecca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are actually two matters involved. Firstly,

it  is the arrangement for charter flights to Mecca

and,  secondly, the formation of a Pilgrimage  Fund

or  Tabong  Haji.  Regarding the  proposed  charter

flights,  the  Majlis  is  still  considering   the

project  and  there  is  a need  to  ascertain  the

response  by  local  pilgrims through  registration

which  will  be carried out soon. It  is  important

that  there must be a sufficient number of pilgrims

who  are interested in this project. Otherwise,  it

is  not  worthwhile to embark upon  such  a  costly

venture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the formation of Tabong Haji, again

this depends upon the response



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



the Majlis can get from the Muslim public who

wish   to   travel  to-Mecca  by  air.  Exploratory

discussions are now being held with the experts  in

the  various fields and, as far as can be  gathered

from  our preliminary discussions, there is  likely

to  be  no difficulty in the establishment  of  the

Pilgrimage  Fund.  It must be recognised  that  the

Pilgrimage  Fund  serves a real  need  in  that  it

ensures that prospective pilgrims will save  enough

money  for  the pilgrimage when they  register  for

pilgrimage by air, and it discourages the  practice

of  selling  or mortgaging property to raise  money

for pilgrimage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will be pleased to know that the

arrangement    for    pilgrimage    through     the

establishment of Tabong Haji or the Pilgrimage Fund

will  include-the provision of welfare  and  health

facilities  for  pilgrims during their  sojourn  in

Mecca,  Medina and Jeddah. The Pilgrimage Committee

is considering the provision of medical facilities,

including the services of a doctor and a nurse  for

the  pilgrims when they are in Mecca. The provision

of  a  welfare  officer to look  into  the  welfare

aspects  of  the  pilgrims and the  services  of  a

reputable pilgrim broker, and matters such  as  the

offering of special gifts and life insurance, etc.,

are also being looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the use of C.P.F, contributions by

Muslim  contributors for the purpose of pilgrimage,

the  answer  has already been given before  by  the

Minister of State for Labour. The basic aim of  the

C.P.F, is to provide workers with some savings when

they  retire  from employment or when they  are  no

longer  able  to work. To allow withdrawal  of  the

money,  either  in full or in part, from  the  Fund

before  a  member  is qualified for  withdrawal  in

order to proceed on a pilgrimage to Mecca will  not

be  consistent  with  the purpose  for  which  the

Central Provident Fund was established.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with Section 74 (1) of the

Administration of Muslim Law Act, 1966, all mosques

are now administered by the Majlis. The number that

has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



vested  with  the Majlis, however, is only  17,  in

view  of the fact that under the law, those mosques

which  are  on  State land cannot be vested  though

they are administered by the Majlis. The Majlis has

already taken steps to ensure that all mosques  are

properly  managed.  Management committees  nowadays

work  very closely with the Majlis in rendering  an

advisory,  consultative and supervisory service  to

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the appointment of Kathis and Naib

Kathis, the Member may wish to note that Kathis are

Government servants appointed in the normal  manner

through the Public Service Commission. As for  Naib

Kathis,  there  is a special -selection  committee,

comprising  representatives of the Majlis  and  the

Shariah Court, which select suitable candidates for

appointment by the President of Singapore. To-date,

two  Kathis and 10 Naib Kathis have been appointed.

Five  vacancies  for Naib Kathis still  exist,  and

these have been advertised in a local newspaper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to note that the Member for

Geylang Serai has taken a special interest  in  the

progress   of   Islamic  religious   education   in

Singapore.  There  are  now  24  madrasahs  in  the

Republic  which  have  been registered  as  Islamic

Religious Schools, of which 18 are under Government

grant-in-aid   and  six  private.  Two   of   these

madrasahs  are  running both primary and  secondary

religious  classes,  while the rest  are  providing

primary  education only. The subjects  provided  by

these  madrasahs  include  Koran  reading,  Islamic

Religious  Knowledge, Arabic and  Malay  languages.

The  total enrolment of students attending  the  24

madrasahs  stands at 3,667. As for  the  number  of

students   who   have  graduated   from   religious

universities abroad, I would like to point out that

some  of  our  religious  students  go  for  higher

studies  at their own expense, while others proceed

to  the  universities and then apply to the  Majlis

for scholarships. Of those in receipt of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



M.U.I.S, scholarship, four  have  since  graduated

from   the   following   universities:   Al   Ahram

University,  Cairo, 3; University of Indonesia,  1.

The  Majlis has over the past three years  received

applications   for  scholarships  from   university

students  who  are  pursuing courses  of  religious

studies  in  the  United  Arab  Republic   and   in

Indonesia.  The  following breakdown  figures  were

recorded,  based  on  the  awards  made  in   1971:

U.A.R.-6, Indonesia-2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of aids to the madrasahs, regular

annual  grants are not provided to these  religious

institutions.  However, appropriate donations  have

been  approved from time to time following  appeals

for financial assistance.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, the

Minister  said earlier that the setting up  of  the

Pilgrimage   Fund  depends  upon  the  support   it

receives.  I  think the support  depends  upon  the

preparations, the plans and facilities which can be

provided  by the Majlis to the would be members  of

the  Fund.  I  had suggested that  they  should  be

allowed  to  use part of their C.P.F, deposits  to

meet the cost of passage for the Hai. If the Majlis

can  draw  up a plan to provide more amenities  and

facilities,  I think the response from  the  Muslim

community in Singapore will be tremendous.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, as I have said, this is

being  looked into. I am sure that if  both  sides,

i.e.,  the  pilgrims as well as  the  Majlis  Ugama

Islam, do their jobs well, I think we will get good

support and we can proceed forthwith.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On that note,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at a time when the rate of industrial and

road  accidents is on the sharp increase,  I  would

like to take the opportunity of urging the Minister

to  consider directing the Legal Aid Bureau to  set

up  a  special  section  to  handle  the  road  and

industrial  accident  cases.  The  general   public

somehow does not seem to be aware of the fact  that

the  Legal Aid Bureau, apart from the normal  legal

aid,   does  also  undertake  cases  of  road   and

industrial  accidents. There is also an unfortunate

impression that if they go to the Legal Aid Bureau,

the  result normally is rather slow. I do not  know

how  far  this is true, but that seems  to  be  the

general  impression. Perhaps it is because  of  the

inadequacy  if  the Bureau that a great  number  of

unfortunate   victims   of  road   and   industrial

accidents  have.  I believe, become  easy  prey  to

unscrupulous lawyers who have come to he  known  as

"ambulance chasers". Once you are in the  hands  of

such  operators  then,  by the  time  you  get  the

compensation,   that  is,  if  you   do   get   any

compensation, the amount of what you  are  entitled

to  will  be reduced by about 40 to 50 per cent  or

even  60 per cent. This matter does not come  under

the Ministry of Social Affairs. Until such time  as

we  have  more  adequate measures  to  control  the

activities of such unscrupulous operators, I  think

one way we can go about it is to extend the service

of  the  Legal Aid Bureau to help these unfortunate

victims of road and industrial accidents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I wanted to ask the same

question as the Member for Jalan Kayu in respect of

workmen's   compensation  claims  that   might   be

processed by the Legal Aid Bureau. Perhaps I  could

ask  the  Minister, therefore, to  quote  how  many

instances  of claims of such nature that the  Legal

Aid Bureau has succeeded in.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, while on

this question of Legal Aid Bureau, I wonder if  the

Minister  would  consider extending  legal  aid  to

criminal  cases  as  well, if  not  for  crimes  of

violence,  at  least  for  many  of  these  traffic

offences and other forms of offences



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



which  are penal in nature. There is quite a  large

section of the population who just cannot afford to

see lawyers.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, since both the Members for

Jalan Kayu and Katong have raised the same point, I

will  attempt to answer them in one breath.  As  no

separate   statistics  are   kept   of   industrial

accidents,  it is not possible to give  the  actual

number of applicants who have applied for aid under

this category under the heading of Accidents, which

include  both  industrial and road  accidents,  the

Legal  Aid Bureau dealt with 255 cases in 1970  and

355 cases in 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With record to industrial accidents, applicants

who  are  within  the  means test  commenced  their

proceedings  with  the Legal  Aid  Bureau,  or  are

referred  to  the  Bureau by the  Commissioner  for

Labour.  The  referrals are only  cases  where  the

Commissioner  for Labour is of the  view  that  the

complainants  have a reasonable  chance  to  pursue

their  claims  at  common  1aw  on  the  ground  of

negligence,  or  cases  where  the  injuries   were

sustained not in the course of employment.  In  die

majority  of  cases the Legal Aid Bureau  has  been

successful in obtaining compensation for  them.  In

cases  where  there is no course of action  against

employers  for industrial matters, the  Bureau  has

also  been  able to obtain compensation on  an  ex-gratia  basis. There is no necessity, for the  time

being  at  least, to set tip a special  section  to

deal  with  such  accidents, but if  the  necessity

should arise, it will be looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the query raised by the Member for Bukit

Panjang  who  suggested that criminal cases  should

also be considered by the Legal Aid Bureau, I think

that  if  we agree to it, there will be a  flux  of

requests  for aid from people involved in  criminal

activities. As the Department has not enough staff,

I  do  not think we can consider this. We  will  be

pleased  to  refer  all such cases  to  the  Member

himself so that he can take over.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, before I withdraw my

amendment, I would like to suggest to the  Minister

that perhaps it is about time we took the raps off



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



some  of  the departments in a particular Ministry.

Some  of  the  departments are offering  very  good

services, but somehow, I think, the public does not

seem  to  be aware of it. We have the "Fire Brigade

Week", "Police Week" and all sorts of "Weeks".  Why

not   co-ordinate  some  of  these   lesser   known

departments  and hold a particular Exhibition  Week

for  the  Ministry of Social Affairs, and  you  can

have all the departments in the Ministry come under

the  same  Exhibition.  Will  the  Minister  please

consider that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that two years ago I brought

this matter up with the Minister requesting him  to

grant  assistance to our fishermen and  farmers  to

set  up co-operatives. But today, after a lapse  of

two  years,  nothing has been done at  all  by  the

Ministry concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, I also brought up the question of

the plight of farmers and fishermen in Singapore. I

pointed  out  that they are in a state of  hardship

and   they   have  been  exploited  by   middlemen.

Therefore, in order to help improve the lot of  the

fishermen and farmers in Singapore which, in  fact,

is   one  of  the  aims  of  the  P.A.P, socialist

Government, it is perhaps time for us to  help  the

farmers  and  fishermen to set up co-operatives  so

that they may be freed of any exploitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will also recall that two years ago when

the  Minister replied to my question he pointed out

that  due  to the shortage of staff in the Registry

of    Co-operative   Societies   and    to    other

difficulties, it was not possible at that  time  to

help  the  farmers and fishermen  to  organise  co-operative  societies. Sir, I would like  to  remind

the    Minister    concerned   to   give    serious

consideration to the request for assistance to help

farmers   and   fishermen   set   un   co-operative

societies.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when a co-operative thrift and loan society is self-

sufficient  and has made great profits,  and  after

contributing  the  necessary 10  per  cent  of  its

capital into the statutory reserve funds and  other

formalities, why does the Registrar object  to  the

society's declaration of a dividend of six per cent

for  its  members? As a result of  this  objection,

many  members would feel that they are not  getting

proper  returns  for the money they  have  invested

because  other  financial organisations,  like  the

banks,  and  chit fund companies are paying  better

returns.  If members were to note that  it  is  not

easy for a co-operative thrift and loan society  to

declare  a  six  per cent dividend as  embodied  in

their   rules  and  regulations,  I  will  not   be

surprised if a great majority of the members resign

to   invest   their   money  in   other   financial

organisations. Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



may I suggest to the Minister to take a  look

into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, previously when Singapore was

part of Malaysia, the co-operative societies in our

country  had been contributing a two per cent  levy

to  the  Co-operative College  of  Malaya  for  the

purpose of co-operative education. Thereafter, when

Singapore  separated from Malaysia,  this  two  per

cent   contribution  to  the  Co-operative  College

ceased,  and  the  individual  societies  are   now

holding  on to this co-operative education fund.  I

wonder whether it is possible for legislation to be

introduced  to  get  this two per  cent  levy  from

individual  co-operative movements  into  a  common

pool  and  to use it for co-operative education  in

the Republic.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the idea of

forming co-operatives for fishermen and farmers  is

not  a  new  one.  As  it is, the  Padang  Terbakar

Fishermen's  General  Purpose Co-operative  Society

Ltd, was  formed  in  1959.  Another  co-operative

society,  the Punggol Co-operative Credit and  Fish

Marketing Society Ltd., was formed in 1956: but  it

died  a  natural death four years later.  Five  co-operatives for farmers were formed between 1954 and

1956,  one of which, the Jurong Road 14 m.s.  Rural

Co-operative  Credit Society, still  exists  today.

These  co-operatives have, however, become inactive

and  membership  is  poor: and their  members  give

little  support  to the management. Leadership  and

management  of  most of the co-operative  societies

are of a low standard, with the result that they do

not  function  properly and members  derive  little

benefit from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is merit in the establishment of co-operatives for fishermen and farmers at Jurong.

Initially,  they can start on a modest scale.  They

need  not  be as elaborate as the co-operatives  in

other countries. But the important thing is that co-operatives must be well managed and those concerned

with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



establishment  and  management  must  have  a  real

interest.  I am, therefore, inclined to favour  the

formation  of such a co-operative by the  fishermen

and  farmers  in  Jurong themselves.  I  think  the

initiative  must come from them. My Ministry  will,

of  course,  provide  the  necessary  guidance  and

provision to ensure that the project launched  will

be  a viable one. If necessary, the Registry of Co-operative-Societies will also assist in the initial

planning  of  the  co-operative  and  provide'  the

necessary  training and education to build  up  the

knowledge and experience required in the management

of co-operatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for

Anson,   Sir,   under  the-Co-operative   Societies

(Modification)   (Amendment)   Order,   1954,   co-operatives  are  not obliged to contribute  two-per

cent  of  their  net  profits to  the  Co-operative

College  of  Malaya.  However,  any  society  which

contributes two per cent of its profits to the  Co-operative   College   shall   be   exempted    from

appropriating to its reserve fund for the  year  an

amount equal to the sum contributed to the College.

For example, a co-operative society is required  by

law to-appropriate 25 per cent of its profits to  a

reserve fund. If it contributes two per cent of its

net  profits to the Co-operative College of Malaya,

that co-operative society is allowed to appropriate

only  23 per cent of its net profits to the reserve

fund.   If  there  is  an  alternative  educational

institution engaged in the teaching of theory of co-operation  and  other  allied  subjects,  and   the

administration  is  run to the satisfaction  of  my

Ministry, then my Ministry will consider making the

necessary amendment to the Order to channel the two

per cent levy into such institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a co-operative society may declare and pay a

dividend  of  six  per cent if it  contributes  the

statutory 25 per cent of its net profits  into  the

reserve  fund.  Under  the  Co-operative  Societies

(Modification) Order, 1954, a co-operative  society

is allowed to appropriate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



up  to  10  per  cent of its net profits  into  the

reserve  fund if it has been in existence for  more

than  10  years.  However, one  of  the  conditions

attached to this reduction in appropriation is that

the rate of dividend on the subscription should not

exceed  four per cent. This is because one  of  the

principles  of  co-operatives  is  that  the  share

capital should only receive a strictly limited rate

of  interest,  if any. A society which  contributes

only  10  per  cent  of its net  profits  into  the

reserve fund is permitted to utilise the balance of

the 15 per cent only in the following manner:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to reduce the interest on loans to members;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to create common-good funds:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to create building funds;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) for propaganda:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) for education; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) for any other similar purpose approved by

the Registrar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  his  reply,  the  Minister said  that  the  co-operative  societies  closed down  because  of   poor

administration  and management.  In  this  respect,

Sir, I think the responsibility should fall on  his

Ministry.  We  know that all farmers and  fishermen

are of comparatively low educational level and they

lack    experience   in   organising   co-operative

societies.  As they also do not have  the  time  to

engage  themselves fully in the activities  of  the

societies,  so  the main bulk of the organisational

work  should fall on the shoulders of his Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this head of expenditure concerns the

allocation   of   funds  for  the  Social   Welfare

Department. It amounts to-$7.04 million,  which  is

slightly  less than the allocation for  last  year.

Probably  this  is  a reflection  of  the  economic

prosperity  and increased employment  opportunities

in  Singapore, resulting in a decline in the number

of  poor people. Sir, a reduction in social welfare

expenditure  is  a  normal sign.  If  there  is  an

increase,  it  can  be taken as  an  indication  of

abnormality in our financial and economic position.

Notwithstanding all these remarks, Sir, it is still

our  responsibility to look after the poor and  the

needy in our Republic. On this ground, I would like

to  request the Minister concerned to increase  the

funds  for  public assistance, so that we  will  be

able  to  help  these  poor  and  needy  people  to

subsist. This is because during the period of price

fluctuations,  the  cost  of  living  has  gone  up

particularly in respect of daily necessities. So if

public assistance is to be paid at the old rate  to

these  poor and needy people, then it will be  more

difficult  for  them to live at the  same  rate  of

subsistence. Furthermore, Sir, since we are  making

considerable  progress in our economic  development

we   have   enough  funds  to  give   more   public

assistance.  I  hope  the Minister  will  seriously

consider this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to raise with the Minister

is  the  Boys' Homes. Mr Speaker, Sir, I  am  quite

concerned about the Boys' Homes. We know that these

boys,  being  of tender age, have been misled,  and

therefore    kept   in   the   Boys'   Homes    for

rehabilitation  and training. We should  give  them

vocational  training in the Boys' Homes  to  ensure

that  when  they  leave these-Homes  they  will  be

equipped  with a skill to earn their own living.  I

would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  what  kind  of

training  facilities are available in  the  various

Boys' Homes.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with

the Member for Sembawang regarding the increase  in

public  assistance because the cost of  living  has

gone  up. So the amount paid to the poor people  is

not  sufficient. The Minister will have to consider

increasing  public  assistance  to  those  who  are

unable  to  work, disabled persons, especially  the

medically unfit. I think this is a proper  time  to

increase public assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to bring a few points regarding

the   Woodlands  Home  for  the  Aged.  The  living

conditions are bad. The old people are served  with

poorly cooked food, There are a lot of bugs in  the

beds.  Toilet  facilities are  poor.  Most  of  the

toilets  are  dirty and damaged, and  the  flushing

system is unsatisfactory. Despite the anti-mosquito

campaign,  there are a lot of mosquitoes and  flies

in  the Home. Spot checks and investigations by the

proper  authorities should be carried no  into  the

old  people's  complaints. We  cannot  treat  these

people  as fourth-class citizens because  of  their

age   and  neglect  them  completely.  I  was  also

informed  that  the inmates of the  Home  are  each

getting $4 as pocket money every month. But  I  was

told they have reduced it to only $1. Whether it is

true  or  not  I  am not sure, but the  people  are

getting  $1 each. That also should be checked.  Now

although we want to increase the pocket money  from

$4  to  $6,  we cannot do so because  it  has  been

reduced to SI. I do not know whether or not this is

true.  I  hope  the Minister will  look  into  this

matter and see whether there is a ruling on that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> If Members care to look at

subhead  2061, they will observe that  there  is  a

reduction of $600,000 in the provision as  compared

with fast year's estimates. This is because some of

the  recipients  of  public assistance  have  found

employment. I would like the Minister to re-examine

the  criteria  in deciding the quantum  of  payment

granted to recipients of public assistance, in view

of the high cost of living today. I appreciate that

the  Government should not be too liberal or unduly

generous in this particular form of social  welfare

service for it might encourage irresponsibility and

indolence. However, I strongly feel that  in  cases

where  the  recipients  are  not  employed  due  to

illness,  old  age  or  handicapped,  consideration

should be given to the fact that the amount granted

should  be reasonably sufficient to enable them  to

live  a  reasonable  life.  Another  factor  to  be

considered  in this respect is that  sonic  of  the

recipients may be employable but cannot take up any

employment  as  they have to perform the  necessary

domestic routine, for example, a widowed mother has

to  look  after  their young children.  It  is,  of

course, morally wrong for the otherwise able-bodied

persons to live on welfare dole almost permanently,

but unfortunately the situation is such that it  is

beyond help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would request the Minister to conduct an

immediate  exercise to revise the rates  of  public

assistance  allowances, taking  into  consideration

the   different  social  environment  and   today's

minimum  standard  of  living.  Sir,  the  dreadful

situation  some of our public assistance recipients

are  in cannot meet with our claim that we have the

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in December last year when I raised the

question  of  public  assistance,  I  remember  the

Minister   concerned  replied  that  his   Ministry

proposed to ask the Ministry of Finance to increase

the  rates  of public assistance to those  families

who  needed  aid, and that the Ministry of  Finance

was  considering it. However, when we  examine  the

present  Budget we are rather disappointed, because

while  we  are  able to give an additional  month's

salary  as  allowance  to our civil  servants,  the

public  assistance vote has not been  increased  as

expected,  but  instead  it  has  been  reduced  by

$600,000  as compared with that of last year.  Does

that  imply that those recipients under the  scheme

will  get less financially? If I am not wrong, Sir,

the present public assistance scheme was formulated

in 1962. According to this current scheme, a family

receiving public assistance could get a minimum  of

$21  per month. The maximum should not be over $60.

These  were the rates fixed ten years ago. A decade

has  passed and our social environment has  changed

tremendously. Our standard of living  is  now  much

higher than it was ten years ago. If the family  of

a recipient is staying in a Housing and Development

Board flat, the meagre sum of public assistance  is

not  sufficient even to meet the expenses for  rent

and   P.U.B, charges,  not  to  mention  food  and

sundries. The present amount is not sufficient as I

have  mentioned earlier. In these circumstances,  I

wonder whether the Public Assistance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



Scheme will be of actual help to those who need  it

under  the  scheme.  I hope the Minister  concerned

will explain the position.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the views expressed by

several of my colleagues just now. The question  of

public  assistance must be reviewed in  respect  of

the  rate  to be given per month. As we  have  just

heard  from the Member for Tiong Bahru, these rates

of allowances are more than ten years old. In fact,

if  we look around, much water has flowed under the

Merdeka  Bridge  in the past ten  years!  Liken  to

that,  I  would  say that Ministers' salaries  have

been increased from $2,500 to $4,500 per month; the

allowance  to  each Member of Parliament  has  been

raised   from  $500  to  $1,000  per   month.   The

Parliamentary  Secretaries and Ministers  of  State

have also had increases in allowances. Recently, it

has  been announced that one month's salary  as  an

annual  allowance would be paid to civil  servants.

Now we have these cases of poor people depending on

public assistance. An upward revision in the  rates

is  long overdue. Why does the Minister for  Social

Affairs  not take this into consideration?  Instead

of   an  increase  in  the  allocation  for  public

assistance, we see a decrease. In fact,  last  year

in  this august Chamber, he assured the House  that

he  would  look into this matter. Does he  mean  to

tell us that when he looks into a matter there will

be a reduction in the allowance?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had occasion to meet cases of hardship. A

poor washerwoman had come to me and said, "Can  you

please  help me. The Public Assistance  Section  of

the  Social Welfare Department has now asked me  to

refund the allowance paid, and it has threatened to

cut  the assistance." I asked her why, and what was

the  amount  she was given. She told  me  that  she

received  only  a  small allowance  with  which  to

support   so  many  children,  including   herself.

Therefore, she said that she could not go on.  What

could  she do but to take up some additional  work.

Even that does not help her much. However, whenever

the Social Welfare Department officials discover  a

case  whereby a recipient has found employment,  it

will  proceed to cut off the assistance. There were

quite  a number of cases where the allowances  have

been cut. I personally know of a lot of other cases

where  the recipients turned to me and said, "I  do

not want public assistance. This is bitter bread of

charity.  I  do  not  need  it.  What  I  want   is

employment." Unfortunately, Sir, both the  Minister

for  Finance and the Minister of State for  Finance

are  not  here  in this Chamber, or  I  would  have

pressed  this  matter further. However,  Sir,  when

these  poor  recipients  go  and  register  at  the

Employment Exchange, they are found either too  old

or maybe a little handicapped physically, and as  a

result  they cannot get employment. What  can  they

do?  Is  it not the responsibility of the State  to

look   after  these  poor  people?  A   good   many

illustrations  have been given  in  this  House  in

which the small amount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



of  public assistance given is barely sufficient to

pay for rent and public utility services, let alone

to subsist on it. I appreciate that there may be  a

reduction in the number of cases, and the  Minister

will  get  up to say that this is a good  sign.  At

least  I hope the Minister for Social Affairs  will

consider  the  matter. I am  not  saying  that  the

Minister is not considering it, but how much has he

thought of it?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Very much.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Very much? But then why is there

a  reduction instead? This is the irony of  it.  He

fought for it so hard that in the end the amount is

reduced.  The  Minister for Finance has  painted  a

very  beautiful picture of the economic  growth  of

Singapore. Everything is going up. As I  have  said

the  other day, the Gross National Product is going

up,  but how far it is going up I do not know.  But

then what about the people at the lower levels  who

cannot and will never be able to catch up? What  do

we do?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Shed tears.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Are you shedding tears? Crocodile

tears  maybe! I join my colleagues in appealing  to

the  good sense and kindheartedness of the Minister

for  Social  Affairs to press  on  with  an  upward

revision of the rates of public assistance, so that

at  least the recipients of the dole will get  more

and  be  able to subsist on what they are given  by

the Social Welfare Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I also have an amendment* on this subject of Public Assistance,  and since

Members have now  spoken  on it, I  wish to take

this opportunity to  join  my colleagues in strongly

requesting the Minister  for Social  Affairs

to  give active  consideration  to review

and  to  increase  the  public  assistance allowance

to the poor and needy. I do not  think  I can

say  much  on it now since many  Members  have

already expressed their views very well. However,



<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The amendment, standing in the names of Messrs Sim Boon Woo and Seah Mui Kok, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be reduced by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 2061.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



I  would  strongly  urge the  Minister  for  Social

Affairs  to  recommend at least 15 to 20  per  cent

increase  in  the public assistance  allowance,  as

they really need it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support   of  my  very  eloquent  colleagues,   but

speaking on this subject* I would like to  be  very brief.  I  feel

that it is not only  the  rates  of public

assistance allowances that need looking into

but  also  the rules. I have a case recently  of  a

woman  who  is  in  receipt  of  public  assistance

allowance of $21 per month and as soon as she found

herself  an  odd-job paying only $20, the  Ministry

pounced  on  her  straightaway  and  cut  off   the

allowance by $10. I think this is extremely unfair.

How  can we expect a person to live on $31?  Surely

it  is our policy to encourage them, no matter  how

old  they  are,  to try to stand on their  own  two

feet,  And this is a case of a woman of  55  or  56

years of age. She really wants to be on her own two

feet,  and  what we are doing is to discourage  her

from taking odd jobs.

<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I am glad to see this year so many voices  in

support  of  a plea which I made last year  for  an

increase   in   the  rates  of  public   assistance

allowances. I think the only case that we can  make

against  raising the rates is making it  too  high.

But we are so far below the disincentive point that

we can safely proceed to double, if not triple, the

current rates. We must have in mind the people  who

are  old, especially those who are decrepit.  As  I

pointed  out in the past, we are a rapidly changing

society.  The traditional extended family has  been

breaking down. One of the effects of living in high-rise  modern-type  flats  is  the  breaking  up  of

families into smaller units. People no longer  stay

with or take care of their parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, as we modernise, as we build

spanking new hotels, new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



roads  and  so  on, I am afraid we are  restricting

options to people. The land for cultivating  simple

things  to  live on is shrinking. The opportunities

for  hawking are also shrinking. One has to  be  on

the  register of hawkers for the last two years  in

order  to  qualify for a licence in a new  hawkers'

centre.  One cannot just go out and try to  make  a

living. One could get hauled up before a court  and

fined  $5  for  the  first time and  $15  for  each

subsequent  offence.  We  are  trying  to  build  a

modern,  dynamic,  progressive society,  double  or

quadruple  our national income. But,  at  the  same

time,  we  should  be a society  with  a  heart,  a

society  that  does not neglect people  who  cannot

keep up with the competitive pace because they  are

old,  decrepit  and because they  simply  lack  the

education  and  the skills to keep up  with  modern

times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I think we have plenty of room,

Sir,  given  the current rates, and  I  would  once

again  very  strongly urge the Minister for  Social

Affairs,   the  Minister  for  Finance,   and   the

Government  as a whole, to seriously  revise  these

rates and as quickly as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, having heard so much from the Members opposite

talking  about  the  old and  the  poor,  I  almost

believed  that in Singapore, which is  an  advanced

country  in  South-east Asia,  families  are  being

broken  down, as one Member has put it, because  of

high-rise   buildings,   and   that   because    of

modernisation  families  cast  their  older  people

away.  But after listening to all of them, in fact,

I  am gaining back the confidence in believing that

such  a  thing is not apparent and is  not  at  all

happening in Singapore because we have got so  many

Members  who have a keen interest in the old,  even

though they are not their own relatives.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> We are representatives of the

people!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Yes, the voice of the people.

And  that in taking care of the poorer sections  of

the  people, the needy ones must be given a  higher

rate of public assistance. In fact, we are all  for

them.  I  almost thought that this theme  is  being

spoken by my Minister and officials in my Ministry,

because all the time we thought that the old people

have  been putting up in the Welfare Homes  without

much  care  or tribute from members of the  public.

They are left to the care of Welfare Homes and  the

Ministry of Social Affairs. Now, I know it  is  not

the case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, I must congratulate our old

people  in  the Homes because they have  many  good

honour-able  Members who do think of them  and  are

trying  to  fight very hard for them. The education

system of Singapore is not that bad because we have

all along believed that in other countries the rich

people  put their old folks in Homes. They have  to

pay  in  order to get somebody to look after  their

old people in the Homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It happens here too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> I do not think so. In our

Ministry,  we do not accept any old people  in  our

Homes.  If their families are well off, they  jolly

well look after their old people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, there is indeed a reduction of

$600,000 in the provision for public assistance for

the next financial year. This is due to a reduction

in  the number of public assistance recipients. The

number  of  public  assistance cases  has  shown  a

steady  decline from 27,435 cases in 1964 to  8,915

cases  in  1971. Therefore, the provision  of  $2.8

million for public assistance allowance under  item

(1)  of  subhead  2061, Head 1002, in  the  1972-73

Estimates  is  expected  to be  adequate,  provided

there  is no change in the existing rates of public

assistance allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the rules governing the public

assistance scheme, they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



designed  to assist those who are in real  need  of

financial assistance. As the Member for Changi  has

so  ably  put it, the quantum of payment should  neither  be  too liberal nor unduly generous  as  to

encourage   irresponsibility  and  indolence.   The

quantum of payment is based on the means test which

takes-   into  consideration  the  status  of   the

recipient according to the number of dependants  he

has.   In  administering  the  scheme,  the  Social

Welfare  Department has always seen to it that  the

genuine  cases  of  hardship are given  sympathetic

consideration  and, wherever necessary,  additional

allowances,  payable under the other schemes,  such

as  the Silver Jubilee Fund, will he given to  such

hardship cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the upward revision of the present

rates  of public assistance allowance, I am pleased

to  inform the House that steps have, in tact, been

actively taken to revise the rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> By how much?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> At the present moment, the

matter  is  being  reviewed  by  the  Ministry   of

Finance, an-d a decision is expected soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How Soon?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Very soon!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Sembawang  wanted to know about  the  training

schemes  in our Social Welfare Homes. It will  take

too  much time to describe all the training schemes

that  are  being provided. The Member may  wish  to

know that, apart from academic subjects, moral  and

religious     instruction,    physical    training,

participation in uniformed groups, a wide range  of

vocational   and  recreational  types  of   general

courses  are  also provided in the  Social  Welfare

Homes.  The types and levels of such courses-  vary

from  institution  to institution.  In  the  Gimson

School for Boys, for example, courses include motor

mechanics, electric wiring, metal craft, carpentry,

handicraft   work,   making   of   souvenirs    and

signboards,  noodle-making and cooking  (restaurant

style).  In  the Mount Emily Girls'  Home,  on  the

other

hand,  such courses as commercial laundry,  ladies'

hair  dressing  and styling, sewing and  embroidery

work,  cake-making,  food catering  and  handicraft

work,  including the making of dolls, are provided.

Suffice  it  for me to say, everything possible  is

being  done to provide adequate and useful training

for  the boys and girls in Social Welfare Homes  so

as  to  enable  them  to  fit  into  the  world  of

employment upon their discharge from the Homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member for Anson, it is indeed

gratifying  to hear that he is so deeply  concerned

with the welfare of the old people at the Woodlands

Home  for the Aged, which is now undergoing repairs

and  renovations.  Four new  dormitories,  a  large

workshop,  and a recreational hall have  just  been

completed,  and  workmen are  now  building  a  new

dining hall and making improvements to the existing

kitchen.  Repair  of  leakages in  water  cisterns,

pipes and taps, has been completed. Members of  the

Board  of Visitors appointed to inspect and  advise

on the running of this Home are generally satisfied

with  the conditions and amenities in the Home.  In

fact,  the  Social  Welfare  Department  has  taken

considerable pains to improve the amenities for the

residents.  For  example, several  television  sets

have recently been installed in the dormitories.  A

pergola  and a decorative fountain have  also  been

constructed  for  the enjoyment of  the  residents.

Through  the  combined efforts  of  the  staff  and

residents,  the Home, together with  its  extensive

grounds, has been kept quite clean and green. Flies

and  mosquitoes  did present a problem  before,  in

view  of the fact that the Home is located  in  the

vicinity  of  animal  and  vegetable  farm   lands.

However,  the Ministry of Health has already  taken

action on the farm lands adjacent to the Home,  and

the situation has improved considerably. The health

authorities have also confirmed that there  are  no

breeding  grounds for flies and mosquitoes  in  the

Home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware that the allowance for any inmates

of  th-e Homes for the Aged has been reduced to $1.

If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Anson  can give me the  names  of  the

inmates who have been paid an allowance of only  SI

per  month.  I  will immediately have  their  cases

investigated. Previously, aged residents its Social

Welfare  Homes were paid a fixed monthly  allowance

of   $5  for  male  residents  and  $4  for  female

residents,  irrespective  of  their  conduct.   The

system  has  led  to  abuse in  that  many  of  the

residents  failed  to comply with  the  regulations

which  are  designed  for the-welfare  of  all  the

residents.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to devise a system that encourages good

discipline  and  order, a new  payment  system  was

introduced on the 1st August. 1969. Under this  new

system,  the  residents  are classified  into-three

groups, according to their conduct and industry  in

the  homes  and  not  according  to  sex.  Grade  I

residents receive $10 per month; Grade II residents

$5 per month, and Grade III residents $2 per month.

In  addition to that, an incentive scheme has  also

been  introduced  to  enable the  more  industrious

residents to share 50 per cent of the profits  from

the   sales  of  manufactured  articles  and  other

products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to extend an

invitation  to all Members of Parliament  to  visit

the  Woodlands Home for the Aged at any time to see

for themselves the conditions existing therein.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of Mr J. F. Conceicao, the

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2009.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have just heard a minute ago about giving care

and  attention to old people. This subhead 2009  is

just another relevant matter concerning the care of

the  old people in the Homes for the Aged. The  sum

voted  is to provide free coffins and free  burials

to  the dead inmates of the Homes. I consider  this

sum  too  meagre. I feel that the dead  inmates  in

these  Homes  are  given  something  worse  than  a

pauper's  burial. I wish to appeal to the  Minister

for an exercise in this provision. So much money is

being   spent   on  less  important  matters,   and

therefore  we should not save on our last  services

to  the dead. Therefore, I advocate for an increase

for this subhead in next year's budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Sir, I agree with the

sentiments expressed by the Member for Mountbatten.

Every effort is being made to ensure that the  poor

old  people in the Homes are given a decent burial.

The  provision of $200 under subhead 2009  is  also

used  to meet the cost of burial in those cases  in

which  the  dead  bodies are sent to  the  hospital

mortuary.  It  is  the  normal  practice  for  such

burials  to be undertaken by an approved contractor

at  the  same  rates as those payable  in  hospital

cases.  Expenditure under this subhead  during  the

last two financial years had not exceeded $100  per

year.   Therefore,  the  provision   of   5200   is

considered adequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial grants for burials for other cases are

normally  paid  from  either the  Cheang  Hong  Lim

Burial  Ground  Charity Fund or the Silver  Jubilee

Fund.  There  is also a provision of  $3,000  under

subhead 2061, item (4), to cover burial subsidy for

Malay  families  affected by  development  schemes.

Thus the Social Welfare Department, in fact, has  a

Burial  fund  at  its  disposal  to  assist  -needy

families to defray their funeral expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The last point that the Member raised concerns

the  possibility of reviewing the emoluments of the

staff of the Fire Brigade Department. This is being

done,  and  it  is hoped that the  review  will  be

completed in the near future.'



<br><br>This  is  found in Hansard [Vol. 30, No.  14,  col.

1041]  of  22nd  March 1971, Sir,  every  time  the

Minister replied, he has these qualified terms  "in

the    near   future",   "soon",   "under    active

consideration" or "very soon". I want a categorical

answer this time as to whether or not this is being

done. If it is not done, why not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, with the

increasing  number of our factories  and  high-rise

buildings coming up in Singapore, I consider it  of

utmost  importance  that our Fire  Brigade  service

should be well equipped in manpower so that it  may

be  able to deal with any emergency that may arise.

May  I  also  ask the Minister how many experienced

senior  officers have left the service for  greener

pastures in the private sector, and what steps  are

being  taken  by his Ministry to fill  such  vacant

posts caused by the resignations?

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, my Ministry has already

reviewed the salaries and conditions of service  of

the  Fire  Brigade service, and our recommendations

are now with the Ministry of Finance. No doubt this

proposal  will have to be considered in  the  broad

context of the salary structure of the entire civil

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the point raised by the Member for Toa Payoh,

there  has  not  been  a spate of  resignations  of

Senior Officers in the Fire Brigade. In fact, since

March  1971  there have been only two resignations,

and   both  these  officers  are  in  the   Station

Officer's  grade.  Sir, the  approved  strength  of

officers  in  the  Singapore  Fire  Brigade  is  as

follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Fire Officer -one post

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divisional Officer - 4 posts

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Divisional Officer - 6 posts

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Station Officers - 33 posts.



<br><br>There  are  a  total  of six vacancies  out  of  an

authorised strength of 44 Senior Officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, with the hope that I

would not have to raise the same problem next year,

I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1003 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2016.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the sentiments expressed by the

Member  for  Toa Payoh when he mentioned  that  our

Fire  Brigade should be well-equipped  in  view  of

industrial  developments, and so on.  I  am  rather

surprised to see that this item on training courses

has  remained static at 5100 a year. In view of the

increasing complexities of fire hazards because  of

industrialisation and urban renewal,  I  feel  that

members  of  the Fire Brigade should be given  more

training  not  only  locally  but  sent  abroad  to

countries  which  have  more  experience  in  fire-fighting.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the Member can be rest

assured  that applications for training awards  are

submitted  yearly to the Public Service  Commission

to  enable  Senior Fire Officers in  the  Singapore

Fire  Brigade to attend courses to study the up-to-date   techniques   in   fire-fighting   and   fire

prevention. For this year, that is, 1972,  we  have

requested  the  Public  Service  Commission  for  a

training  award to enable a Divisional  Officer  to

attend a fire prevention course at the Fire Service

College. United Kingdom, followed by attachment  to

the Fire Prevention Section of the larger brigades.

Sir,  a  Divisional Officer was sent  to  Japan  in

September  last  year to attend  a  group  training

course  in the fire service administration. Another

officer  will be leaving for the United Kingdom  in

July this year to attend courses for six months  at

the Fire Service College.
