   <b>WORKERS' PARTY DEMOCRACY DAY DINNER</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Refusal of licence)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will explain why a licence under the Public Entertainments Act was refused for the Workers' Party Democracy Day Dinner on 14th November 1992.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Police rejected the application because they considered the proposed venue, being a narrow strip of land between a major road and an HDB apartment block, was unsuitable for such a gathering organised by a political party. It was also too small to accommodate the 1,300 to 1,500 persons expected to attend it, and the available car parking facilities were insufficient.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, on 9th November 1992, the applicants proposed an alternative site which was approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that the site has been approved by MND as a wayang site?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, a site for wayang is very different from a site for a political meeting organised by a political party. I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> think the difference must be very obvious to all and the potential for breaches of the peace, law and disorder are considerably different.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Just now, the Minister mentioned about the suitability of the site and he said that it was a narrow strip of land. A wayang will also encourage crowd forming.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, these are professional decisions which the Police must make, taking into account various factors. A wayang may attract a certain kind of crowd but a meeting organised by a political party, whether the PAP or opposition parties, has different connotations. The Police's concern is not to stop such meetings organised by political parties. Where political parties want to organise a gathering with speeches it, in fact, becomes a political meeting. Police's concern is that if it is held outdoors, close to HDB residential areas, then there is potential for mischief and disorder because it is difficult to distinguish those who are genuine supporters and invited guests and those who are not and might be heckling and causing trouble. In fact, there have been instances where objects have been thrown down from HDB flats. So these are some considerations which the Police take into account. It is not good enough to say that that site was used for a wayang and therefore it must automatically be approved for political parties. There are various law and order considerations which the Police have to take into account.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned about public disorder and mischief. Would the Minister explain or clarify whether the Workers' Party Democracy Day Dinners in the past 10 years have caused any public disorder or mischief?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I am not sure whether the Police have had any problems in past Democracy Day dinners. But their concern is the potential for trouble and that is the prime consideration for approving such sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister agree that the potential is something which is perceived?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> It is not only perceived, but there have actually been cases, both during election periods and outside election periods, where there have been breaches of the peace, disorder, unruly behaviour and, therefore, there are very good reasons for the cautious approach taken by the Police.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, have Democracy Day dinners of the Workers' Party in the past caused any public disorder? Please do not compare it with election rallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I think we can go on and on. I have answered the question which he had already asked.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister mentioned just now that car parking facilities were one of the considerations. Does the Minister know the number of car park lots in the vicinity of the site?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> If Ministers have to carry all these bits of information, then they will not be able to do any work.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> For the information of the Minister, there are 344 motor car parking lots in the vicinity and 106 motor-cycle parking lots. Why did PELU (Public Entertainments Licensing Unit) consider car parking facilities as a criterion for refusing to grant the licence?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I fail to understand the purport of the question. I have just mentioned some of the considerations that the Police have to take into account and one of the considerations is, of course, the congestion that can be created by people coming into the particular area, the displacement of car parks for residents in the area and the congestion that will be created after the dinner or the political meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is the Minister saying that if the permit were given for this instance and there were speeches, it may pose a security threat to Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>

   <b>10-YEAR COMPULSORY EDUCATION SCHEME</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Timing and mode of operation)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Education if he will give details of the timing and mode of operation of the 10-year scheme of compulsory education for every child in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, starting from 1991, the Ministry of Education has introduced refinements to the education system to provide every child with at least 10 years of general education - six years of primary education and at least four years of secondary education. However, education is not compulsory in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary education comprises two stages - a 4-year Foundation stage and a 2-year Orientation stage. The Foundation stage aims at providing pupils with a good foundation in English, the mother tongue and Mathematics, while the Orientation stage offers a differentiated curriculum to match the different learning needs of pupils. At the end of Primary 6, all pupils will sit for a modified Primary School Leaving Examination, which will place them in an appropriate secondary course.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the present Special, Express and Normal (Academic) courses in secondary schools, a new course - the Normal (Technical) course - will be introduced in 1994. This course will be technical-oriented and will prepare pupils for further technical-vocational education and training at the Institute of Technical Education. These pupils will take the GCE N-level examination at the end of four years and those who are able will do an additional year and take the O-level examination.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of 10 years of general education, pupils may pursue further education and training at junior colleges, polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education, depending on their interests and abilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Why is the Minister not willing to make 10 years of education compulsory for every child?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whether a pupil benefits from being in school and whether he learns and progresses depends on his interest and motivation. We feel that if we just force the pupils to remain in school, it will not really solve the problem. There are cases, for example, where pupils, because of family problems, have to leave school. The principal and teachers will counsel these pupils and their parents and persuade them to stay on. Our drop-out rate from school is very low compared to other countries. On balance, we feel there is no need for us to introduce compulsory education.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Would the Minister agree with the Advisory Council for Youths' figure that 6.8% of the young have less than PSLE education? That is one supplementary question. Can I go on to the second supplementary question, Sir?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Does the Minister not agree with the wish expressed in the Next Lap that every Singaporean should have at least 10 years of education? The third supplementary question is: With the new organisation of the ITE, you can only get in if you have at least 10 years of basic education. So the school drop-outs would not have an opportunity to join this institution.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have the figure with me but I think the figure of 6-7% of pupils not completing primary education is probably within the ballpark. It goes to show that the drop-out rate is very low, especially in the primary school stage. The ones who leave tend to be the ones who are in the Extended stream. They are 13-14 years old and the problem is that usually they will go, for example, for vacation jobs. Once they have tasted the working experience and they have money, they tend not to come back. There is a tendency to try to drop out. It is important that the schools persuade and counsel them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drop-out rates are higher in the secondary level. That is the stage when
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the children are older. Our system tries to keep them in school for 10 years. So I fully agree with her that we should, as far as possible, keep the children in school for at least 10 years. But it is no point forcing them to stay. It is only through persuasion, teaching and motivating them that we can achieve the result.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the ITE, the intention is that eventually they will accept pupils who have completed secondary education. But this is still a plan and, if necessary, we may modify it to take in some of the other pupils or we may, for example, help to place them in factories through apprenticeship programmes. The whole point is to prepare our young people with education for proper employment eventually. While I agree fully with her on this point, it is a matter of approach. We feel that compulsion is not the way to do it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister then agree that there is a relationship between early school drop-outs and youths at risk? The Minister has not convinced me that there is no need for compulsory education.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> This problem of school drop-outs is a very big social problem in many countries. Fortunately for us, it is contained to very small proportions. For example, at each level, the drop-out rate is less than 1%. And if we take a cohort going through the whole 10 years of schooling, it comes up to about 6-7%, as she has mentioned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a total social problem. The Ministry on its part will do its best. We counsel the parents, we counsel the students, we try and give them more opportunities to come back to school if they want to. But in the end, we have to work with other groups, eg, SINDA, MENDAKI and CDAC. The intention is that we will henceforth refer some of these cases to these other organisations to look more closely into their social background, whether they have financial difficulties, whether they have learning difficulties and try to keep them in school and motivate them to learn, but not through compulsion.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Ministry of Education have records to monitor children who have reached school-going age but whose parents have not registered them for school?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned about counselling for parents whose children have left school. I would like to know from the Minister what sort of counselling the Ministry is providing and in what way.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, as for the first question, I believe we do have the records, but I have to confirm this because I am speaking from memory.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second question, counselling is done by the teachers who know the pupils. As soon as they find that the pupils have lost interest and are showing signs of wanting to leave school, the teachers counsel them, the principals counsel them and the Ministry also gets involved with the counselling process. It is a matter of talking to them and trying to understand their problems and explaining to them why they should stay in school. So it depends on the case involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, does the Minister not agree that there is a need to have a structured mechanism to follow up on these drop-outs? What the Minister has mentioned is what happens at the initial stage, but there is no structured mechanism to follow up on what these drop-outs do and then to fit them into maybe apprentice systems or some other system. From the figure of the National Council of Social Service, is the Minister aware that there were 57,000 disadvantaged youths in 1990, most of whom dropped out from school?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with her that we should have a proper mechanism to counsel and, if possible, to follow up. But it is a total problem involving not only ourselves. It has to involve, for example, community organisations. It has to involve the families especially. In a practical sense, it is a big problem because the numbers are big. The schools are already loaded with their problems of providing general education. We do our best to persuade them and to keep track of them. But it has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> got to be a total approach involving not only ourselves but other groups. And to some extent, I think Members are straying away from the main line of the Question. If Members have interest in this topic, we can discuss it in the Budget debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I want to remind Members that supplementary questions should be related to the original Question and they should not stray too far away from the subject under discussion. Dr Toh.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, as some students have dropped out because they cannot fit into the usual school system because of a structured syllabus, will the Ministry consider a special programme like tutelage to bring these children back to school?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The schools are already providing remedial lessons. For pupils who have difficulties in various subjects, the teachers will get them to stay back after school and provide additional lessons. I think a lot of pupils on their own have tuition. There could be other cases, eg, where the pupils need special help and they could be referred to special schools, schools for the disabled and so on. There are various special schemes available.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether his Ministry has data on the extent of smoking in the Singapore Armed Forces, in particular among national servicemen; (b) whether national servicemen who smoke picked up the habit during National Service; (c) whether his Ministry has or will consider measures to help SAF servicemen cut down on smoking; and (d) whether, in support of the National Anti-Smoking Programme, the SAF will consider prohibiting its servicemen in uniform from smoking in public.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) (for the Minister for Defence):</b> Sir, I am answering on behalf of the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF pays close attention to the health and fitness of SAF servicemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Smoking is a health hazard that can lead to serious diseases and early death. It also undermines the physical fitness and performance of our soldiers. As part of its overall anti-smoking effort, MINDEF has been conducting annual smoking surveys among SAF servicemen since 1986. The survey results enable MINDEF to monitor the trend and take corrective actions. The surveys show that fewer servicemen are smoking than before. In 1986, 41% of all active servicemen smoked. This was reduced to 23% by 1991. The same year's survey showed that 24% of national servicemen smoked. Unfortunately, in line with an increase in smokers nationwide, these figures have increased to 27% and 29% respectively in 1992. The overwhelming majority, ie, 93% of national servicemen who smoke acquired the habit before entering service. 42% of them started smoking before they were 15 years old while 51% started smoking between 15 years old and the time of their enlistment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986, MINDEF started a three-pronged smoking control programme to discourage smoking in the SAF and to protect non-smokers from the hazards of side stream smoke. The smoking control programme serves, firstly, to educate SAF personnel on the harmful effects of smoking; second, to help smokers quit the habit and, third, to deter smoking. The SAF runs inhouse smoking cessation clinics to help smokers to quit the habit. These measures have resulted in reducing the prevalence of smoking in the SAF.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF is currently studying additional ways to discourage smoking among its servicemen and to help those who smoke to quit. Prohibiting servicemen in uniform from smoking in public is one of the measures being considered.

  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, Government companies are held under three group companies, namely, Temasek Holdings, MND Holdings and Singapore Technologies Holdings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the group level, Temasek Holdings and MND Holdings have been profitable in every year from 1988 to 1991. In the case of Singapore Technologies Holdings, it was profitable in 1988, 1989 and 1990 but suffered a loss of $91.1 million in 1991. The loss arose as a result of losses incurred by a subsidiary company, Singapore Technologies Ventures, and reasons for the loss were given in this House in response to a question from Mr Low last year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1992 results for the three holding companies are not yet available but all the three are expected to be profitable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Question No. 7, the number of Government-owned companies including the three holding companies, namely, Temasek Holdings, Singapore Technologies Holdings and MND Holdings and their first tier companies which were profitable since 1988 are as follows:
  <pre>

         1988      -   34 companies

         1989      -   33 companies

         1990      -   36 companies

         1991      -   34 companies

</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These companies which lost money during those years were 6 in 1988, 7 in 1989, 7 in 1990 and 10 in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of profitable companies therefore exceeded the number of companies which incurred losses in each of the years from 1988 to 1990.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excess profits over losses of these companies are as follows:
  <pre>

            1988      -   $1,215 million

            1989      -   $2,764 million

            1990      -   $2,521 million

  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, annual values of HDB flats are determined by the Chief Assessor of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. Like any other property, HDB flats, whether upgraded, new or old, will be professionally valued based on prevailing market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point to note is that HDB flats are owner-occupied and, therefore, enjoy a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> concessionary property tax rate of 4%. As an example, a 3-room HDB flat would attract an annual property tax of only $100 on the average. So even if the property tax were to increase by 10%, it will not be more than $10 on the average.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flat owners are required to share a certain percentage of total upgrading cost. As the Upgrading Programme is expected to take between 15 and 20 years, both Government and flat owners' share of upgrading cost in dollar terms will increase over time as a result of inflation.

   <b>CAR PARK LOT SURCHARGE</b>

   <b>(Reduction)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether he will reduce the car park lot levy so that parking lots currently fenced off in private car parks can be released into the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1975, a surcharge has been imposed on private car park lots in and around the Restricted Zone. The surcharge, currently at $60 per lot per month, is part of a package of measures to reduce traffic congestion in the city by promoting the use of public transport rather than private cars for commuting. The surcharge helps to ensure that owners of private car parks in the city do not set car park charges at so low a level that it becomes more attractive to use cars instead of buses or the MRT.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the policy of encouraging use of public transport, in preference to private cars, remains valid, it would not be appropriate to reduce the surcharge. Owners of buildings with car park lots in excess of the minimum provisions can, if they wish, apply to the planning authorities for permission to convert the excess space for other allowable uses.

  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, kerbside parking lots for overnight parking of heavy vehicles are currently provided along selected roads in HDB and industrial estates. PWD, in consultation with the Traffic Police, has identified stretches of roads where parking of heavy vehicles will not pose a danger to other road users.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To control indiscriminate parking of heavy vehicles, PWD has announced a comprehensive plan to introduce a Vehicle Parking Certificate Scheme for heavy vehicles by the end of this year. The Scheme requires each heavy vehicle to have an authorised lot for overnight parking. HDB and URA have tendered out eight off-street sites to the private sector to develop heavy vehicle parking facilities. More sites will be tendered out for heavy vehicle parking. In addition, PWD will allow some car park lots in industrial and commercial premises to be used for overnight parking of heavy vehicles.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat</b> asked the Minister for Education, in order to reduce unnecessary workload in relocation, whether placement in junior colleges will be deferred until the release of `O' level results.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Tay Eng Soon)(for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> each year, there are two admission exercises to junior college: the provisional admission exercise in January and the Joint Admissions Exercise in March after the release of the 'O' level examination results. The provisional admission is based on the students' school preliminary examination results. The admission under the Joint Admissions Exercise is based on their 'O' level examination results.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admitting students provisionally into the junior colleges in January benefits them in two ways:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it provides the students with more time over the two years to cover the 'A' level syllabus. Otherwise, the three months from January to March will be lost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, students entering junior college in January can experience the 'A' level course and assess their own interest and aptitude for it. When the 'O' level results are released, they are in a better position to decide whether to continue in the 'A' level course or change to a technically-biased course at the polytechnics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of having the January and March intakes outweigh the extra work in schools. My Ministry will therefore continue to conduct the two exercises for admission to junior college.

   <b>PREPARATION OF STUDENTS FOR OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Education if his Ministry has formalised plans for schools to prepare students to take up overseas employment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon (for the Minister for Education):</b> Sir, the preparation of students for overseas employment is best directed at the more mature students in the junior colleges, polytechnics and universities. They are closer to the employment stage and are more likely to be the ones to take up overseas employment later on. Whilst the emphasis in schools has to be on general education, students will be made more conscious of our external environment and the need to venture overseas through their studies and extra-curricular programmes, for example, student exchange programmes and visits to neighbouring countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the five-day residential seminar for the 500 pre-university students will focus on the theme: "Growing the Second Wing - our External Economy". With guidance from teachers and resource persons, the students will learn about the need and the opportunities for Singaporeans to venture abroad. They will study successful entrepreneurs locally and overseas. Several students will visit Hong Kong for their case study. Through these seminars, studies and field trips, students will be better prepared to venture abroad later on.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polytechnic students have been exposed to working environment overseas through the institutions' vacation training programmes and student exchange programmes. Under these programmes, the polytechnic students have been sent to countries around the region, such as Japan, China, Taiwan and Brunei as well as the United States and some European countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities have introduced a 6-month industrial attachment programme and are encouraging students to undertake part of this requirement overseas. Both NUS and NTU are making arrangements with local and foreign companies and foreign institutions to take in their students for overseas assignments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities are also planning to introduce a modular and semester system for some of their courses. This will enable their students to do part of their course in overseas universities and gain credits for these modules towards the fulfilment of their degree requirements in NUS and NTU. The exposure of our undergraduate students to living and studying in a foreign country will be useful to them when they work abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Sir, may I know how are the students selected for such overseas scheme and who are financing their stay overseas?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Sir, up to now, the numbers involved are very small. Quite often, it is a small group, together with the

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> lecturers, who work out the project. In other words, it is their initiative. Included in that is fund-raising, which they do. So in a way, it is a group of students who are interested enough to organise themselves and to raise funds who create these opportunities for themselves.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the number and nature of complaints received by the Monetary Authority of Singapore against financial institutions for the years 1990 to 1992.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The total number of complaints received by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was 186 in 1990, 301 in 1991 and 209 in 1992. The types of complaints include those on disputed interest, foreign exchange, penalty rates and service charges, dispute over claims and premium charges, quality of service and unprofessional conduct, unauthorised transactions, and complaints against the institution's management and its policies. The MAS has followed up on all these complaints with the financial institutions concerned and help seek redress where the complaints are genuine. It will continue to encourage the banking and financial community to improve its services to customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Sir, will the Minister explain if there were complaints against banks for not posting their effective interest rates and whether any action was taken by the MAS?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am not quite clear about the Member's question. His question is to enforce effective interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Yes, that is right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> What effective interest rates?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> There were cases of complaints that banks did not post their effective interest rates. Currently, all banks post the nominal rates, which vary from one bank to another, and there is no basis
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for consumers to compare. So why should not MAS impose upon banks to make sure that whatever loans they provide they should post the effective interest rate?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> By "effective interest rate", does the Member mean the average interest rate over the life of the loan? Is that the idea?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Actual interest rate, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I see. I will ask MAS to look into this. I am not aware that there is a major problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> I would like to point out the difference between "effective interest rates" and "nominal interest rates". There are some problems in this area. Many consumers are not fully aware that when they take up a loan at 5 3/4% interest rate on an annualized basis it is not the same as taking a loan on the same percentage interest rate but on a daily or monthly-rest basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I understand. For example, the effective interest rate for a car loan could be substantially higher than the nominal rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> That is right.
  <br>

   <b>(Sale to sitting tenants)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether he will consider selling the industrial properties of the Jurong Town Corporation to sitting tenants.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, JTC develops and manages four categories of industrial facilities, ie, standard factories, flatted factories, terrace workshops and prepared industrial land. The standard factories and terrace workshops are offered for sale on long-leases. At present, 84.8% of standard factory tenants and 36.7% of terrace workshop occupants own their facilities. In fact, they are not tenants,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> they are owners. The remaining who are sitting tenants and wish to purchase the facilities can apply to JTC to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC is prepared to sell complete blocks of flatted factories and has done so. JTC will not, however, sell individual units within a multi-tenanted block of flatted factories because of the difficulties of managing both sold and rented units in the same block. Moreover, tenants wishing to expand their operations will have less flexibility to do so as they may not be able to buy contiguous space from existing owners. JTC's share of the flatted factory market is 22% compared with 60% for the private sector. Therefore, the private sector can more than meet any demand for flatted factory space both for sale as well as for rental.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC leases out prepared industrial land on an annual rental basis for 30 years, extendable to 60 years. JTC does offer, in response to requests by companies, the option to buy 60-year leases by paying an upfront premium instead of annual rental payments. Since the payment of an upfront premium ties up large amounts of capital for long periods, only a few companies have chosen this option.

   <b>TENDERS FOR INDUSTRIAL LAND</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry if future tenders for industrial land can be in smaller plots and on a 99-year lease to enable smaller manufacturing companies to invest in their own premises.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent tenders of industrial land were intended to increase private sector participation in industrial land development. They were not intended to provide land for individual manufacturers for their own use.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, only 14% of industrial space in Singapore is held by the private sector. The Government's intention is to increase this proportion by tendering out up to one-third of the annual release of industrial land. Such tenders will also provide a more accurate indication of industrial land prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land parcels tendered out in the recent exercise were similar in size to those sold by Land Office to JTC. This was intended to provide a benchmark for the prices of land sold by the state to JTC.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent exercise, six hectares in Kaki Bukit and two adjacent lots of 10.2 hectares each in Tuas were tendered out. The results of the tender are being evaluated. As part of the evaluation, we will consider whether the land parcels offered for sale in the tender were too large. Smaller parcels may be popular with developers since the risk element in holding the land is smaller. However, parcels of land tendered out should be large enough to allow for optimal land use and permit developers to enjoy economies of scale in infrastructural provisions such as drainage and utilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If manufacturers want smaller industrial facilities for their own use, they can either buy or rent standard factories from JTC, as I mentioned in my previous answer. JTC provides a wide range of standard factories ranging from 910 square metres to 4,000 square metres for sale. Manufacturers can buy, in addition to these standard factories, land on 60-year leases from JTC to put up their own buildings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the length of lease is concerned, the Government does not intend to sell industrial land freehold or on leases beyond 60 years. Leases of 60 years are long and, in fact, long enough for developers and industrialists to make adequate returns from their investments. Unlike housing use, for example, the nature of industries changes very considerably over 60 years. We have found the need to upgrade and rejuvenate our older industrial estates which are not even 30 years yet. Thus, we expect that 60 years is a reasonably long cycle before the land lease should revert to the state for redevelopment to meet the needs of future industries.

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in terms of low interest rate financing, substantial political risk insurance and reinsurance facilities, the Government intends to provide to local manufacturers, companies and businesses venturing overseas and (b) whether the Government is considering the setting up of an export and import bank (EXIMBANK) to provide such financing and political risk insurance facilities.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> At present, there are already a number of measures in place to assist our local companies to venture overseas. For example, EDB administers the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (Overseas) which provides fixed interest rate loans to local companies for acquiring fixed assets for overseas projects. The loan repayment period could stretch up to 10 years with monthly effective interest rate ranging from 5.65% to 6.5%. The Trade Development Board also provides a Market and Investment Development Assistance Scheme which provides a grant to offset the expenses incurred in activities such as feasibility studies, overseas missions and marketing and development trips. There is also the Export Credit Insurance Corporation of Singapore which provides some form of insurance to companies exporting abroad.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also signed a number of investment Guarantee Agreements with various countries including the ASEAN countries, People's Republic of China, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. This has greatly reduced the political risk faced by local companies when venturing overseas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on Promoting Enterprises Overseas, chaired by the Minister of State (Finance), Cdre (Res) Teo Chee Hean, is currently looking into how we can assist local companies to venture overseas. The Committee will consider further financial measures needed to help our companies venture abroad.
  <br>
  <br>

  <b>Mr Robert Chua Teck Chew:</b> Sir, traders and investors are more concerned about
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> getting insurance against political risk. Has the Ministry considered these special needs? Because, currently, from what I understand, political risk insurance is very small. What is available here is very small and cannot meet the needs of bigger projects overseas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister consider looking at re-insurance or insurance for political risk of a larger quantum?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I take it that this would be in addition to the investment guarantee provisions. This is one area that we have not been actively looking at because we are not aware that it is in great demand. But we will certainly consider if there is sufficient interest.

  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the HDB has not served any Notices to Quit on People's Action Party Members of Parliament, to recover possession of their offices situated at the void decks of HDB estates. This is because, following my Ministry's decision in September 1991 that HDB would no longer provide MPs with offices at HDB void decks, all PAP MPs have returned their MPs' offices at HDB void decks to HDB.

  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> So he admits now that HDB void decks loaned to the PAP Community Foundation for educational purposes have been used in the last Marine Parade by-election.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, we went through this discussion several times before. The position is that the HDB lets out premises to the PAP Community Foundation. Under the tenancy agreement, the PAP Community Foundation is allowed to let out, up to 20% of its premises in terms of operational hours, to any approved sub-tenant.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, we are now pinpointing a specific political use, that is, for use in the Marine Parade GRC by-election. So what I want to hear from him is that it is an admission that the PAP has been using the premises rented out to a PAP Community Foundation for educational purposes and it has been specifically used for an electioneering purpose. That is what I want to hear - it was used for a very specific purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me repeat the answer. Under the existing policy, the tenant of an educational centre, which must be an approved foundation, like the PAP Community Foundation, can allow

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the premises to be used by other organisations up to a maximum of 20% of the total operational hours. The only condition is that they cannot charge rent exceeding the rent payable to HDB.

  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> That is precisely correct. Mr Speaker, the HDB will let out premises in its void decks to any approved foundation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would the Minister say, besides the PAP Community Foundation, whether there is any other foundation being approved to use the premises of HDB on such a scale and scope?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> There are many charitable organisations and foundations using HDB void decks for their purposes.

  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Are these charitable organisations, besides the PCF, being given also the same rate of rental?

  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Such organisations also enjoy the same rate of rental.
  <br>

  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Are they on the same scale in terms of the number of centres used?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> It entirely depends on their needs. If they need to expand and they want to apply for more, we will consider their application. But if they do not need so many centres, why should HDB foist all these centres on to them?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, would the Minister reveal the number of such centres run by private charitable organisations which enjoy the same status and are given the same rate as the PCF enjoys?

   <b>LITTERING PROBLEM AT BLOCK 103, DEPOT ROAD</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for the Environment how many residents at Block 103, Depot Road were prosecuted for littering in the latter part of 1992 and whether the littering problem at that block has been brought under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no littering offender was apprehended in the vicinity of Block 103, Depot Road during the latter part of 1992. Enforcement was stepped up in January this year when the area became more littered. Of the 10 litterbugs caught, five lived in Block 103 itself. All the 10 culprits were at the ground floor when they committed the offence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from enforcement action, the Town Council and my Ministry did a house-to-house visit to advise residents not to litter. There is now less litter in the vicinity of Block 103 and the littering problem has been brought under control.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of littering in housing estates is not peculiar only to Block 103, Depot Road. It exists in other blocks and in other Town Councils as well. Potong Pasir is also not spared.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has actively campaigned against littering and attempted to educate members of the public not to litter. At the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> same time, tougher laws are enacted to deal with the hard-core litterbugs. We hope that the recently enacted Corrective Work Order (CWO) will deter them from littering.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, as far as I am aware, there is no littering problem at Potong Pasir Town Council. Can the Minister please name the block or any particular area which has been badly littered?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> What I am saying is that littering happens everywhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> I will ask my Public Health Officers to do an enforcement blitz on Potong Pasir, and I will report to you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am just asking a justified question, and the reply is a threat to blitz Potong Pasir. Is this in order, Sir?
  <br>
  <br>

  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> But what is your supplementary question?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I would like to ask that this House note that a statement has been made by an honourable Member - a definite factual statement - that there is no littering problem in Potong Pasir. May I ask the Minister to confirm the veracity of this statement at the next parliamentary sitting, Sir?
  <br>

   <b>CIVIL LAW (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Civil Law Act, Chapter 43, to clarify the common law position that banks can take charges over cash deposits received from their customers. Why is this amendment necessary? It is because some confusion has arisen in this area of the law due to an English case known as Re Charge Card Services Ltd [1986] which ruled that it was conceptually not possible for a bank to take a charge over its own debt, that is, a deposit received from its own customer which is regarded in law as a debt owing from the bank to a depositor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That decision was widely criticised in the United Kingdom, not least by bankers who were aggrieved that such an essential and well-established form of security had now been denied to them. Hong Kong, in June 1991, amended its law to clarify the Charge Card Services Ltd case. Our Bill is modelled on the Hong Kong Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation)(Amendment) Ordinance 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment makes it clear that a person, say, A, can effectively create, in favour of another person, say, B, a legal or equitable charge or mortgage over a debt owed by B to A in order to secure a loan. For example, a customer of a bank can create a charge over his cash deposits, in favour of the bank for a loan transaction or an overdraft. In fact, this form of security is a routine transaction which is of immense importance in daily banking and business practice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling in Re Charge Card Services Ltd case is an unnecessary impediment to the financial and business communities to arrange secured financing for business and development projects. This amendment was requested by the Monetary Authority of Singapore on the advice of the Attorney-General and it is supported by the Association of Banks in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the next Bill, the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill, may I thank the Minister for the clarification on the source of the legislation. May I say that it is a very useful thing if we are going to allow reference to Parliamentary debates that the Ministerial statement that precedes the Bill should give the source of the legislation as well as the rationale for the legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make just one other brief point? If it is desired to amend the Civil Law Act, may I suggest to the Minister that priority should be given to the amendment of section 5. For the information of hon. Members of this House, section 5 effects an importation of English law and it may come as a surprise to hon. Members that, although we claim to be a financial centre, much of our financial and commercial law is, in fact, English, so that if the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Westminster
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> changes the law, let us say, on agency, on sale of goods, by that same token, the law in Singapore is changed. This situation is clearly anomalous given our independent status. I understand that steps are being taken to effect an amendment of section 5 and I can only hope the Minister can enlighten the House on what these steps are and when they will be taken.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I also rise to support this Bill. But I would like to caution that we go a bit slow on this question of adding new laws on our own because of our financial centre status. We are an international financial centre and it is not just acceptance of the law in Singapore. The key point is the acceptance of the law which is used to govern financial transactions by all parties involved, usually foreign parties. In this respect, the concept of English law in financial transactions or contracts is quite widely accepted by most people who are party to such transactions. It is, therefore, important that, for the sake of credibility, and the fact that the people feel they can have recourse to law, such law should continue to be used as long as the international financial community accepts it. In fact, if I am not mistaken, there are a lot of contracts signed in Singapore where they specifically state that the enactment of those contracts is within the English law, or the law of the State of New York or any other place. It is stated clearly as part of the documentation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang GRC):</b> Sir, I welcome the Bill. However, I have one concern about the precise wording of the proposed amendment and its possible consequences.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am worried about the retrospective operation of the amendment in that it seeks to declare that it has always been possible to create a charge over a cash deposit. In order to understand why this may create a problem, I think it is necessary to know the previous state of the law and the banking practice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1986, prior to the Charge Card case, the commercial community proceeded on the basis that it was legally possible to create a charge over a cash
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> deposit in favour of the bank holding that deposit. Charges over cash deposits were a very useful and extremely common form of security. There was some academic argument as to whether such charges were conceptually possible but for all practical purposes, the commercial community proceeded on the basis that such charges were, in fact, possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there was some question as to whether this sort of charges were registrable with the Registry of Companies under section 131(3)(f) of the Companies Act. Essentially, pursuant to that section of the Companies Act, all charges over a company's book debts had to be registered. The question was whether a company would treat a bank deposit as a 'book debt' owing by the bank to the company. If it was a 'book debt' then it had to be registered. If it was not a 'book debt' then the charge need not be registered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of registration was not simply one of academic interest. It had serious practical consequences. If the charge had to be registered and it was not, and the company went into liquidation, then the charge would be void as against the company's liquidator. The bank would then lose its security. The bank may have other rights, like a right to set-off, but it would not have been prudent to rely on those rights alone.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, if not most banks, took the prudent course and registered these charges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986, the High Court of England's decision in the Charge Card case was delivered. That decision suggested that it was not possible for a bank to take a charge over a cash deposit placed with it. It caused, as the Minister has pointed out, much consternation among the banking community in the United Kingdom and here. And it affected a most important and valuable form of security.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986, also, the English High Court ruled in the case of Bright Life Ltd that a cash deposit in a bank, on the facts of that case, was not a book debt of the company placing the deposit.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined result of those two cases was that since about 1987, the legal position was believed to be that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) it was not possible to create a charge over a bank deposit in favour of the bank holding that deposit;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) in any event such a "charge" was not registrable under section 131(3)(f) of the Companies Act because it was probably not a book debt.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this prevailing legal view, lawyers, being what they are, advised their clients to register the so-called charge with the Registry of Companies. However, my understanding is that the ROC has taken the view that these so-called "charges" were not registrable. Probably, therefore, we have a lot of these which are not registered covering millions of dollars.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this prevailing climate, we now have this amendment. It is to be welcomed because it gives back to the banks the clear right to take security over cash deposits. That can only help and we are following Hong Kong in this respect. I fully support that. The problem, however, is with the declaration that it has always been possible to create such charges. From about 1987 onwards, the better view was that it was not possible to create such charges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that the amendment follows word for word the amendment in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, I would suggest that we reconsider this position for the following reasons. Take a case of a company going into liquidation after this Bill becomes law. Assume that the company had placed a bank deposit with a bank prior to this Bill. The documentation would have been drafted to give the bank various rights, but it may not purport to give the bank a "charge". It is also entirely probable that the bank's rights would not have been registered with the ROC. In such a situation, the company's liquidator could argue:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that the bank deposit, despite whatever terminology, was in fact a "charge";
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) by reason of the amendments, it has always (during the pre-amendment period) been possible to create such a charge; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) therefore, the charge is void as against the liquidator for non-registration under section 131(3)(f). For that last proposition, the liquidator will have to argue that the decision in Bright Life is not applicable in Singapore. The legal position there is not as clear as one would like.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the liquidator succeeds in that argument, then that places at risk probably millions of dollars worth of security that might have been taken by banks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid all this, I would suggest that there be no retrospectivity. If, however, the Minister feels that there is a compelling need for retrospectivity, then I would suggest that the Bill be delayed until the Minister for Finance has had an option to consider section 131 of the Companies Act. The Minister probably has other things on his mind today, but he may wish to amend that section to make it clear that it does not apply to cash deposits with banks. One way or the other, I think there must be some certainty because we are dealing with a very important commercial question. I understand from what the Minister has said that the banking community might have supported the Bill, but I wonder if the concerns raised by me have been considered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also point out the following differences between Hong Kong and ourselves:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Hong Kong legislation was passed in 1991. There was a shorter hiatus between the Charge Card case and the actual passing of legislation in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) I am not sure what position the Hong Kong Registry of Companies took vis-a-vis such proposed
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> charges. If they had allowed registration of such charges, then those banks would not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the least, I would suggest that before passing this amendment in its present form the Minister consider sending it to a Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Davinder Singh (Toa Payoh GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak on the Bill as well, but I take a different point of view from Mr Shanmugam. I think he makes two different points here. The first is that there will be a difficulty if the position in relation to the nature of the charge, ie, that it is one over possibly a book debt is not clarified. That, in my view, is a different problem altogether. It is important that there must be retrospective effect because you do not want a situation, after this Bill is passed, where banks have to call upon their customers, ask them to redo the entire transaction so that they fall within the ambit of this particular provision, giving rise to a whole series of problems including what in law is called consideration for the original loan, etc, etc. What we want to do is to be practical in the climate that we have today. Charges have been taken or purportedly taken by banks over deposits. You do not want banks and financial institutions to have to recommence the transactions to retake the charges so as to fall within the ambit of this legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem my Hon. Friend, Mr Shanmugam, raises is an important one. But I do not think it is the difficulty that arises from this amendment. It is a difficulty which exists as a result of an English decision which says that a cash deposit is not a book debt and whether we want to follow that or take a different course is a totally different matter. I do not think that the mere fact of non-registration of an earlier charge on account of an advice or view taken that it is not a book debt would affect the operation of this section.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, it must be quite obvious to everyone that this is quite a technical area. I am not sure whether the non-lawyers know what is going on here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, first, on the points raised by Mr Walter Woon. He asked if we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> also have in mind amendments to section 5. I agree with him that it is time that we removed the uncertainty as to the extent of applicability of English law to Singapore, especially in regard to statute law. Indeed, this is high on the law reform agenda of the Ministry of Law and the Attorney-General's Chambers. But we will have to carefully consider the approach. There are many approaches. For example, should we declare what are the statutes in England which will apply or should we re-enact them as part of the corpus of Singapore law and so on? But this is an important area and I hope to be able to bring up legislation in the course of this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by Mr Shanmugam, I will have to carefully consider what he has said and I note that Mr Davinder Singh disagrees. Sir, a consequence of the English decision was that it was not necessary to register particulars of the charge with the Registrar of Companies. Many banks continue to take such charges after that English case on the basis that the decision might be over-ruled or changed. Those who did naturally would have registered the particulars of the charge with the Registrar of Companies. Those banks which accepted the decision as correct would naturally not have taken any charges on cash deposits. They would have taken some other kind of security. They would also have taken letters of set-off which would entitle the banks to set-off the customer's indebtedness against such cash deposits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reaction to Mr Shanmugam's point is that the amendment will not affect the rights of banks. Either they have continued to take such charges or they have not. If they have, they would or should have registered. If they have not, the amendment does not affect them. If they have, then the amendment declares that the charges are valid.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the banks have acted on the basis that that English case was the law, then they would not have accepted charges over cash deposit as security, in which case the amendment does not make their position worse. They can create such charges after the amendment. In any event, if any bank
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> or lender is affected by the amendment, I guess he can apply to court for extension of time to register the charges. But I do not think this is necessary for the reasons I have given. As I said, the amendment was requested by the Association of Banks in Singapore as well as the MAS. I assume that they have considered the point. But in any case, before the Act comes into operation, there is time and to relieve Mr Shanmugam of any anxiety, I will ask the Minister for Finance to take another look at it, but there is no reason to hold up the passage of this legislation or to send it to Select Committee.

   <b>INTERPRETATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>1.57 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Interpretation Act to enable the Courts to have recourse to the use of Ministerial statements made in Parliament when interpreting any statute in order to ascertain the intention of Parliament should the statute be ambiguous or obscure in its purpose or if a literal reading of the statute would lead to an absurdity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, the Courts have not relied on the use of Parliamentary materials in interpretation of statutes. This may come as a surprise to Members of the House. But this is because of a number of reasons based either on constitutional objections or practical difficulties. But these objections can no longer be applicable today when the Courts are faced with a flood of ever increasing legislation of a complexity and variety not encountered before. If the Courts are to make well reasoned decisions, access to such information may well be crucial to its deliberations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position with respect to our Singapore Courts appears to be unclear. There are conflicting local cases in relation to the use of explanatory statements attached to the Bills which is one type of Parliamentary material covered by the amendment. Unfortunately, no local cases have ruled directly on the issue of whether the Singapore Courts can resort to the use of Hansard as an aid to statutory interpretation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords there, in a very recent decision known as Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v Hart, made a significant departure from their traditional English practice of not referring to the use of Hansard, by allowing its use for the purpose of resolving an ambiguity or obscurity or avoiding an absurdity if such Parliamentary materials consist of clear statements by a Minister or promoter of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment before the House also seeks to highlight the importance of adopting what is known as a purposive approach in the course of the Courts' interpretation of statutes in order to promote the underlying purpose behind the legislation. That is the main amendment. Apart from that, there are other amendments which seek to clarify the ambit of certain existing provisions in the Act for the avoidance of any doubt.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Bill. This is not something new. Many progressive judges have already been adopting a purposive approach towards the interpretation of statutes. It is nevertheless welcome. May I make some suggestions? If we are going to allow judges to look at parliamentary material, there are certain things that might helpfully be done in order to ease their burden.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I would like to make is that when a judge looks for a purposive approach, he is looking theoretically for the intention of Parliament. But in reality the intention of Parliament is a chimera. It
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is a mythical beast. In reality, it is the officials who advise the Minister and the Parliamentary draftsmen who draft the words. Very often, the intention behind the Bill is not clear just from reading the explanatory statement or by perusing the Minister's speech in Parliament. Now that we are going to allow the courts officially to look at these things, may I suggest that perhaps the Minister might like to ask the Parliamentary draftsmen to expand on the explanatory notes in the Bills. Very often, we copy legislation from abroad, sometimes blindly, down to the mistakes. It would help to know the source of the legislation. It would also help to know where changes have been made and why these changes have been made. This kind of explanation in the Bill itself will not create that much extra work, but it would be of great assistance to the judge and to other people who have to interpret statutes to have the material on hand.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is that we rely a lot upon Select Committees for technical Bills, but Select Committees are not necessarily the best way of looking at a technical Bill because of the way that they are structured. Very often again, we copy legislation from abroad. Legislation from abroad may have been preceded by reports done by a committee. For example, just looking at company law, there is the Jenkins Committee, and in insolvency, there is the Cork Committee. It might be useful when we seek to reform the law for greater use to be made of committees of lawyers from the Bar and from the Faculty of Law to prepare reports on proposed legislation so that it is quite clear what we are doing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I end with one last suggestion. The problem of ambiguity will be greatly alleviated if Parliamentary draftsmen could be directed to write in simple English instead of legalese. Now that we are allowed to look at the purpose, there is no need to cram everything into one sentence without a full-stop. I know the English themselves have not been successful in persuading their Parliamentary draftsmen to simplify their drafting. But it is my fervent hope that we at least can make some contribution to the clarity of the law in this area.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will discuss with the Attorney-General's Chambers which of Mr Walter Woon's suggestions can be adopted. I welcome his offer for the Law Faculty's assistance wherever it can be of help. Indeed, I strongly favour a situation where the Law Faculty lecturers can get involved in collaboration with the Attorney-General's Chambers or the Ministry of Law. I think he knows that I always have encouraged the Law Faculty to collaborate with Attorney-General's Chambers or the Ministry of Law.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I disagree with him is when he says that the intention of the Bill is not decided by the Ministers or Cabinet but by the officials. I do not know from which country's experience he has got that idea. But I can tell him that in this Government, in this Cabinet, the decisions and the intentions are made by Cabinet and the Ministers which compose the Cabinet.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his other point about explanatory statements, this can be looked into.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for simplifying the language, draftsmanship is a skill that is not easily acquired and the number of people who have the skill in drafting is limited. We must, of course, look for a wider pool of draftsmen. Of course, the more the better.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take his point that with this approach to enable the courts to look at parliamentary materials, it becomes important to enunciate the intentions clearly. I think this is not to be done only in the form of explanatory statements, but it must be in the form of Second Reading and Third Reading speeches given in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have touched on all his points.
  <br>

   <b>SMOKING (CONTROL OF ADVERTISEMENTS AND SALE OF TOBACCO) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking harms the health of not only smokers, but also non-smokers who breathe in side-stream cigarette smoke. It causes diseases such as lung cancer, coronary heart diseases and chronic lung diseases. My Ministry estimates that cigarette smoking contributed to the deaths of more than 2,800 Singaporeans in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the dangers of smoking, the Government introduced measures in 1970 to inform the public of the harmful effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to give up this undesirable habit. These measures included public education on the dangers of smoking, legislation to prohibit smoking in certain places, and heavier taxes on tobacco products in order to discourage as well as reduce smoking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986, we strengthened our efforts by launching a multi-pronged National Smoking Control Programme. One of the key objectives in this programme is to reach out to younger Singaporeans and encourage them not to become smokers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these measures over the years have helped to create a social climate in Singapore that discourages smoking. They have resulted in Singapore having one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world. Our smoking rate declined from about 23% in 1977, to a low of 14% in 1987. However, it has been increasing since then, rising to 17% in 1991, and 18% in 1992. This overall figure, however, hides the fact that the rate for male smokers is 33%, compared to only 3% for females.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of the data also shows that the increase in smoking rate has not been uniform across the various age groups. In fact, there are fewer older Singaporeans who are now smoking. Today, only 17% of those between 40 and 64 years of age smoke, compared to 27% in 1984.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is alarming is that the decline in the number and rate of older smokers has been more than offset by the rise in the number and rate of younger smokers. Smoking rates among those aged 18-19 have tripled from 5% in 1987 to 15% in 1991, while that for those aged 20-29 also rose from 15% to 19% in the same period.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about half of all the present smokers took up the habit before the age of 18 years. We therefore clearly need further measures to prevent those below 18 from being enticed into the smoking habit. At this tender young age, they are easily impressionable and are less able to resist peer pressure encouraging them to smoke.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveys show that many smokers are aware of the harmful effects of smoking. However, some take up smoking as they think it makes them look more sophisticated. Also, as the adverse effects will only show up very much later, many feel that there is no need to worry about the ill effects of smoking today. Unfortunately, they do not appreciate that the damage to their health is irreversible. When the actual illness is manifested, it may be too late for them to do anything. They will then be a burden to not only themselves and their loved ones, but also to society as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question we need to ask ourselves is: "As a responsible society, should we continue to allow Singaporeans of a tender age to be enticed into smoking, to knowingly or unwittingly do themselves harm?".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question has been the topic of much public discussion in recent months. Many members of the public, parents, civic and grassroots organisations, the medical and related professional organisations have all come out in favour of a ban on smoking in public places by persons below 18, as well as a ban on the sale of tobacco products to them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stricter legislative measures we are considering today will reduce access to tobacco products by young persons below the age of 18. At the same time, my Ministry will strengthen the public health
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> education programme and other measures to persuade existing smokers to give up their habit, as well as to encourage non-smokers to remain so. With fewer smokers in the coming years, Singaporeans, the majority of whom are non-smokers, would be able to enjoy a cleaner and healthier environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now give Members some background information on the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry presently administers three pieces of legislation relating to smoking. These are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Smoking (Prohibition on Advertisements) Act which controls cigarette advertisements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Consumer Protection (Labelling of Tobacco Product Containers) Regulations which spell out the health warning requirements; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the Poisons (Amendment) (No. 2) Rules 1989, which control the tar and nicotine limits of cigarettes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing this Bill, we took the opportunity to merge these three pieces of legislation with the proposed new provisions to reduce access to tobacco products by the young. The result is a comprehensive piece of legislation governing the sale of tobacco products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the major new provisions in the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill prohibits the sale or giving of any tobacco product to persons below the age of 18. There are now 22 other countries, including the UK, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, which have similar legislations, with the age limit varying generally from 16 to 19 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 prohibits any person below the age of 18 years from smoking, chewing, buying or possessing any tobacco product in a public place. The penalty for this offence is a fine of not more than $50 for the first conviction and $100 in the case of subsequent convictions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the passing of this Bill, my Ministry will embark on an intensive publicity and public education programme to inform Singaporeans about its new
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> provisions. We plan to bring the Act into operation in late May, to coincide with this year's "Smoke Free Week".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will allow a grace period of three months for youth under 18 caught smoking in public places. After that, we will continue to counsel those caught infringing the provisions in clause 11, especially first-time offenders. We will also inform their schools and parents for further counselling to be carried out. I am indeed glad that the Ministry of Education has agreed that the schools will also participate in this counselling programme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 prohibits the sale of tobacco products through vending machines. This ensures that cigarettes will not be easily available to young Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 prohibits the sale of smokeless tobacco products. In recent years, the number of smokers in the USA and Europe has declined. To counter this trend, some cigarette manufacturers have introduced new forms of smokeless tobacco and tobacco substitutes targeted mainly at the young. These tobacco substitutes are items with a non-tobacco base but which contain nicotine which is highly addictive. In the USA and Sweden, such products are already being actively promoted to teenagers. We can expect this to also occur in Singapore in the future, unless we institute preventive measures now.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the World Health Organisation is also concerned with this new approach taken by tobacco companies. The WHO has therefore recommended banning the manufacture, import and sale of smokeless tobacco products. Several countries, for example, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Ireland and Israel have already banned the import and sale of smokeless tobacco products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 prohibits the sale of imitation tobacco products. These are now available in the form of toys or confectionery products. Such imitation tobacco items give the young the impression that smoking is fun and enjoyable, and encourages them to give smoking a try when they are older.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 empowers my Ministry to introduce regulations to license cigarette
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> retailers. Sir, we do not intend to introduce such regulations for the time being. My Ministry will closely monitor the compliance with the new provisions, and will only introduce such regulations if the need arises.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to arrest the recent upward trend in the rate of smoking. The main increase has been amongst younger Singaporeans, many of whom take up smoking even before the age of 18. The provisions in this Bill will allow us to make it more difficult for those below 18 to gain access to tobacco products, and deter them from taking up this very harmful habit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, despite the many years of rigorous effort in anti-smoking measures, we have heard from the Minister that more people are actually smoking. The increase is most alarming among the young smokers. The number of regular smokers aged between 15 and 19 had more than doubled from 2.9% in 1987 to 6.7% in 1991. There is also an increasing number of young women who have taken up this smoking habit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it meant to us is that if we ever have a winning chance in this battle against smoking, we have to concentrate on helping our young to resist ever starting this addictive habit. Notwithstanding that we have the legislation, Sir, parents and adults do have an active role to play in this drive against smoking. Personal counselling of the young individuals, reinforced by widespread publicity, can render our campaign more effective in convincing the young minds not to smoke. We have just now heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence telling us that many of the smokers actually start very young, some as young as from the age of 12 to 13 years old, and they start their first puff out of curiosity and peer pressure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately for many, once started on smoking, the nicotine addiction leads them to become regular smokers. In the long run, they will suffer higher health
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> risks associated with smoking-related diseases of lung cancer, heart disease and chronic bronchitis.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must admit that I had the earlier hesitation in determining whether it was right and prudent to ban smoking completely for those under 18 years old. There appears to be a contradiction. If smoking is that bad, it should be banned for all, irrespective of ages. Why still provide the choice to take the puff on reaching 18 years old? How do you explain to the young that they cannot do what the adults can?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, we should not emphasise on the ban but the ultimate objective and the spirit in which the stance is taken. We have the interests of the young at heart and for their long term good, we want to prevent them from taking up the smoking habit. As for the existing adult smokers, I am very sure that for many of them they have wished that they have never started smoking in the first place and kicking the habit now is so hard even when they have to do so out of necessity for their own health.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the proportion of smokers in our population, there are actually more non-smokers. There is growing evidence of the harmful effects of breathing in other people's smoke. Non-smokers who are continuously exposed to tobacco smoke suffer the same danger to their health as smokers. Therefore, non-smokers can cry foul against smokers who smoke in their presence. It is time for non-smokers who are the majority to assert their right against the smokers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private organisations have been slow in making their offices and workplaces smoke-free, and only about half of them have some form of smoking control measures. The Government offices have been declared smoke-free since 1986. I hope that both the employers and employees can act together to provide a smoke-free environment in their workplaces.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level, medical expenditure on tobacco-related illnesses places a heavy burden on the economy, not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> counting the unnecessary waste to human lives. It is better and more cost-effective for us to act early in our strive to be a nation of non-smokers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make some comments on some of the clauses of the Bill and to seek clarification from the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 6, there is mention about the possession of 10 copies of a publication. I would like the Minister to clarify whether a person would be committing an offence if he accumulates the monthly subscriptions of a journal up to a year, in other words, he is in possession of 12 issues of the journal for the year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appears to be some discrepancy in the standards that we apply for those publications inside and outside Singapore. Is there not anything that we can do to close this gap? In other words, try not to make it too hard on those publications within Singapore and whether some influence can be made against those external publications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in clause 10 (1)(c), it saddens me that there is this provision about people who give or furnish cigarettes or tobacco to the young. It is a sad reflection that some adults do such things in offering cigarettes to the young and that it has to be reflected in this Bill. But I suppose that is a fact and it is happening, and we want to ensure that the adults do not give tobacco freely to the young.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 11(3), I wish the Minister to clarify whether public parks and recreational areas are included in the definition of "public place", because buildings and premises are mentioned and public parks and recreational areas are where the young gather often.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, under clause 17, the existing vendors are quite concerned about this question of licensing, though the Minister has said that he may not wish to have these regulations. But there is a concern whether he will control the number of licences, and how the existing vendors will be affected by this clause.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the main objectives of this Bill is to discourage and control smoking in young
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> people below the age of 18 years. We have heard that this is a very laudable social objective as we all know the health hazards of smoking and the potential of addiction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if you look at clause 11(1), the penalties spelt out for possession of cigarettes or for smoking by young persons are woefully inappropriate and will prove to be ineffective. Many young people under 18 years of age are not in the labour force and are financially dependent on their parents. As a result of this, two scenarios may occur. If the young person comes from a wealthy family, and if he or she has access to a lot of money, then a fine of up to $50 or $100 is "no big deal", if I may express it in the jargon of the young. If the young person comes from a poor family and cannot pay the fine himself or herself, then the parents will have to pay even if they have financial difficulties, as they will not want their child to serve a sentence of imprisonment in default.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, therefore, who are we trying to punish? The young offenders or their parents? Hence, if we wish to stop the habit of smoking in our youth, then the penalty provided must be meaningfully directed at the offenders. And here I think we should think of instituting community orders. These could be prescribed in the form of an attendance centre order.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By an attendance centre, I mean a place at which the young offenders are required to attend and be given appropriate instruction. The offender has to go to the centre for between six and twelve two or three-hour sessions on Saturdays or at any other time that does not interfere with school or work. Some police officers are already running boys' clubs in HDB estates, and this mechanism could be expanded and modified to be used for attendance centre orders. The attendance centre order is both deterrent and reformative in aim. The deterrent aspect arises from being punished by having the offenders' normal Saturday leisure activities interfered with. Also, attendance at an attendance centre should benefit the offender by bringing him under the influence of representatives of the authority of the State and teaching him
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> something of the constructive use of leisure. Counselling, especially on health hazards of smoking, firm discipline, periods of strenuous physical training and constructive hobbies can be programmes at the attendance centre. This type of community order will be much more effective than a fine of $50 to $100 to teach our young to smoke.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, first I would like to thank my two Parliamentary colleagues for their support of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Loh Meng See has asked a few questions. His first question is on clause 6 and he wants to know if a person accumulates some magazine or journal for a period of a year and, therefore, he has more than ten copies, will he fall foul of the law and be deemed to have committed an offence. Sir, clause 6 should be read as having accumulated 10 or more copies of the same journal. So if he has accumulated 12 copies of different months' journals, he has not fallen foul of the clause.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the intention of this clause is to allow us to prevent persons from, firstly, producing cigarette posters and, secondly, putting them up in the quiet of the night. What happened was that whilst we had a ban on the advertisement of cigarettes in the past, Members would recall having seen many posters being put up on construction hoardings by the roadside. It was not possible for us to stop this because we had to catch the culprits in the act of putting up those posters, which is extremely difficult. With this provision, whereby we prevent people from not only just printing but also having possession of more than 10 copies of those posters or advertisements, we have effectively solved the problem. And that is why over the past few years, we have not had any posters being put up on hoardings at all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked, under clause 7, whether we would also impose similar restrictions on publications which are printed externally. Sir, we have already implemented that. Publications which have more than a circulation of 10,000 copies a month are now subject to a ban on cigarette advertisement. We are now looking into
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> reducing that threshold quantity to 5,000, and are now in the process of looking into the implications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh also asked, under clause 11(3), whether public parks and recreational places are included under "public place". Sir, the clause reads:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"public place' means the premises of a school within the meaning of the Education Act or any place, premises or building or part thereof ...".'. So under the definition of "public place", parks and recreational areas are also included.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about the licensing of tobacco retailers, ie, firstly, whether we will control the number of licences that will be issued and, secondly, how will the existing vendors be affected. Sir, as I explained in my Second Reading speech, we do not intend to implement this provision for the time being and we will only do it if required. The circumstances under which we will put this clause into operation will be if we find that the retailers are not observing the ban and they are blatantly flouting the ban because the chances of getting caught may actually be very slim. If that is the case, then we will resort to licensing of all the existing retailers. Any new retailer that opens up for business will be issued a licence quite freely. This will allow us to have a further deterrent for the retailers to ensure that they are actually complying with this new Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin has said that the $50 fine is not appropriate because the sum is either too small to be meaningful. Sir, the question here is how do we have a penalty which allows us to impress on the young offenders that smoking is actually a very serious and damaging habit and they should not smoke. The $50 is meant to be a deterrent. But the $50 fine is not the be-all and end-all of what we intend to do. As I mentioned just now, our main focus is on counselling. For first time offenders, we will bring them in for counselling and we will also require the schools to counsel them too. We intend to bring in the parents to ensure that the parents also give us their support because they will be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> acting in the best interest of their children. As part of the counselling process, the attendance centre order which she has mentioned is a good idea. That can be another avenue of counselling for the offenders who have been caught. So we will look into the feasibility of implementing that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have answered all the questions raised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.

   <b>LAND ACQUISITION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>2.37 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, compensation for land acquired before 30th November, 1987 was assessed at 30th November, 1973 value and land acquired on or after 30th November, 1987 was assessed at 1st January, 1986 values, or the market value at the date of Gazette Notification, whichever was the lower.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Act to further revise and update the compensation for land acquired under the Act, namely, to pay market value as at 1st January, 1992 or the market value as at the date of Gazette Notification of the acquisition, whichever is lower.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the current position where compensation is pegged to 1st January, 1986 values, this amendment will certainly improve the compensation award for lands which are acquired in the future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment, therefore, is a recognition of the fact that land values have appreciated over the last few years. With the compensation awards being pegged at no higher than 1992 prices, the proposed amendment will address
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> concerns that the Government should pay a fair compensation whenever lands are acquired compulsorily.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Government will continue to review periodically the compensation for land acquired for public purposes as it has done so in the past.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I wish to declare that I am a practising architect. In order to achieve the national objective of providing public housing for the majority of Singaporeans and put in place the effective infrastructure to enable us to achieve rapid economic growth, great extent of land has to be acquired for this purpose. Because of the rapid progress we make, the compensation paid to the land owners of those acquired lands may sometimes not be in congruence with the prevailing market rate. Now that the housing objective has been achieved and most of the infrastructure in place and, more importantly, land value fluctuates at a much faster rate, it is therefore timely for the introduction of this amendment to enable the Government to pay adequate and fair compensation to those affected by land acquisition. However, because of the rapid rate in the increase in land prices, I would like to request the Minister, barring any administrative difficulties, to consider revising the date in which the market value is based upon to a much closer interval. From 1986 to 1992, it is a very long period of time. Land costs must have increased manifold. Therefore, it will be fairer if this interval be cut short to, say, two to three years so that a fairer assessment of the market value can be reflected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill too, and may I fully support Mr Chen's statement that, in future, the period of time be reduced. May I also express the hope that the Minister will consider eventually going towards paying market value for the land. After all,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in the past, when we were first developing the necessity to redistribute land and to build infrastructure it was very great but that necessity has diminished quite a bit now. The price of public good was very often private injustice and it was a great hardship on people to have their land acquired.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to make, although strictly not concerned with this Bill, is that the Act is connected to the Local Government Integration Act. Under the Local Government Integration Act where land is acquired for road widening, the Government can acquire the land. The cost of widening the road can be charged, ironically, to the people whose land has been acquired. May I suggest that there is very little comfort to the people to raise the quantum of compensation on the one hand and, on the other hand, to charge them the cost of widening the road, which they did not ask for in the first place. So may I ask the Minister to look into the possibility of amending the Local Government Integration Act as well? Do we really need the money that badly? That is really the question. After all, not every person who has land is rich and the Government correctly recognises that ownership of property is one of the keys to building loyalty to Singapore. I think we should not lightly deprive people of their property which they have worked very hard to obtain.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the philosophy of the marketplace has been the motivating factor of most of our economic and other decisions. We should, therefore, not shirk to apply the same philosophy to land acquisition. Principles of equity and the free market demand that when land is acquired by the Government, the compensation must be at market rate and not at some value of the past which may be lower. If one's property is acquired by the Government at market rate, that in itself can be a traumatic experience if one does not wish to part with one's property for whatever reason, but imagine the added injury if the value paid is below the market rate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, due to the hard work of our people, and the honesty, prudence and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> foresight of our Government, we have a country with no budget deficit and, in fact, we have consistent budget surpluses. There is, therefore, no moral or economic justification for taking land away from our people and not paying them their rightful due at the market rate. I, therefore, urge the Minister to provide that the compensation payable for any property acquired shall be pegged at its market value as at the date of the notice of acquisition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter that I want to draw the Minister's attention to is section 5 in the Land Acquisition Act. Subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) are reasonable. The need for the acquisition is stated as public purpose, public benefit, public utility or in the public interest. However, subsection (1)(c) states that land can be acquired for any residential, commercial or industrial purposes. It does not indicate any public purpose. There have been instances of land being acquired and then sold to other private developers at commercial rates for commercial purposes. This seems very unfair and arbitrary to me and this practice should be stopped. If there is no immediate public purpose for acquiring a piece of land, then it must not be acquired at that time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I must declare my pecuniary interest. I am a practising lawyer acting for clients whose lands have been compulsorily acquired.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land acquisition is big business for the Government. The Government, under the Land Acquisition Act, is given massive powers to compulsorily acquire land. Compulsory acquisition of land is a very profitable activity of the Government. Last year, the Government reaped $4.1 billion from land sales, which lands are mostly compulsorily acquired under the Land Acquisition Act. This year, the Government is expected to make $3.8 billion from land sales. The receipt from land sales this year is about 7% less than last year, probably indicating that land
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that would be acquired is becoming less. But, nevertheless, the sum of $3.8 billion is still very substantial.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the receipt of land sales was about one-third of the amount collected from tax revenue. This year, it is about a quarter of the tax revenue. It is quite clear that Government capital receipts from land sales contribute substantially to Government income which, when unspent, goes into the reserves. Therefore, much of our reserves are revenue derived from the sale of lands which are compulsorily acquired by the Government. I cannot support the present amendment to the Land Acquisition Act. I say that it is unfair and inequitable. A new formula for compensation should be worked out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speakers have already brought up the idea of market value. It is quite common knowledge that the Government acquires land for all kinds of reasons, not necessarily bona fide for a public purpose or for public interest. When land is acquired for building public housing, a hospital or construction of roads, no one will quarrel that they are for a public purpose. What happens when land is acquired by the Government for resale at a hefty profit or when land is acquired just to plant a few trees there or land is acquired to be re-rented out by the Government for a profit? Can we say that those lands are acquired for a public purpose? I do not think so. I would say that a more equitable mode of compensation could be one in which it depends on whether the land is generally acquired for a public purpose or for a quasi-public purpose or just outright acquisition for resale by the Government for a profit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that there should be different rates of compensation depending on the purpose for which the land is acquired. If such a formula of compensation were to be adopted, then the land owner will not unduly suffer too much loss.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been pointed out that not all land owners are wealthy people. I must say that we must remember that all these land owners are not wealthy people. I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> know of one case where a man had put all his savings in a piece of land as an investment. He had hoped eventually to sell it for a profit and use the profits of sale to tide him over in his old age. Suddenly, the land was acquired by the Government. The compensation he received was so low compared to the prevailing open market value at that time that the shock just killed him. He is one of the many victims of the low rate of compensation paid out under the Land Acquisition Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other untold stories concern the way the Government takes possession of compulsorily acquired land. I have only just been informed last night at my Meet-the-People session of a case at Kheam Hock Road adjacent to Bukit Brown Chinese Cemetery. This case concerns a wood and zinc house. It is situate on land that has been compulsorily acquired by the Government. There were five people residing there at the material time including one old lady and a teenage girl. On Wednesday, 24th February, at about
  <br>11.30 am, a horde of HDB enforcement officers came to that house together with two Thai workers and an escort of two armed policemen. On instructions, the Thai workers broke the windows of the house and used crowbars to pry loose the main door. When the main door was detached, it was thrown on the nearby grass. The family was alarmed. The teenage girl cried and begged the HDB officers not to tear down her house. This is the sort of way the Government forcibly evicts tenants of houses on land that has been acquired.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, before I reply to the other points, with your permission, perhaps you might allow Mr Lim Hng Kiang to answer the point about the Local Government Integration Act (LGIA) because, I believe, it comes under the Ministry of National Development and he would be able to shed more light.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> That was what I was about to do.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I respond to Mr Walter Woon's point on the LGIA? He said that the Government
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> acquires land for construction of roads and besides acquiring it and not paying the full market rate, it forces the owner to pay for the cost of building the road. That I say is no longer true.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LGIA is intended for building local roads which benefit the owners of the land fronting the road. It was passed in the early days when many roads were made of sand and laterite and the LGIA was introduced when these owners wanted a proper road made. And the Government came in, built the road and charged the cost of building the road to the land owners according to the frontages, ie, according to the benefit that they gained from building the road.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, such a practice still happens for local roads where the Government builds a road that benefits the owners of the frontages there. The Government will acquire the land based on market rate, build the road and charge the owners who benefit from building the road according to their share of the benefit. And for the owner who has to give up his land, the cost of the land is then deducted from his cost of building the road. So, as far as the building of local roads to benefit such owners is concerned, it is done in a very equitable way.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Government acquires land to build roads that serve the national network, the Government pays market rate for the land according to the Land Acquisition Act and does not charge the land owners for the cost of building roads in the national road network.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank the Members who have spoken. First, for those Members who have asked for more regular intervals of updating, yes, this can be considered. I am sure they have noted that this latest updating is at a shorter interval than the previous updating, from 1973 to 1986. So, this is something that we can consider for the future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Members have talked about going market rate completely - Mr Walter Woon, Dr Soin, and to some extent, I guess, Mr Chiam. If I may make a general
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> point, Sir, especially for those who have said, "We have probably acquired all the land that we have wanted to acquire. Most of the public projects are completed." The impression is given that it is hardly ever likely that we will acquire or need to acquire any more land. Can we be so absolutely sure? I cannot be sure. If I ask the Chief Planner whether he can tell me that there will never be a need to acquire land ever again, I am sure he cannot give me that assurance. And how can we tie future governments down?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget, when we talk about going market rate, that we are not in the United States or Australia where they have vast open tracts of land. Land in Singapore has been a special case, a special situation. It is a special situation and will always be a special situation. And very few other countries faced with this scarcity of land, with such high density of population have had so much success in public housing or industrialisation, port facilities or social and recreational facilities. And one of the important legal and social instruments which has enabled this Government to do this has been the Land Acquisition Act. It has been a crucial instrument of policy in achieving what has been achieved thus far. It may be the ideal to pay full compensation. But bear in mind what that means. It means more costly public projects and public development. Therefore, land acquisition policies and procedures that we have must ensure that the overall public interest and the interest of the majority must be taken into account and must promote housing, industrial, economic and other purposes. It must serve these interests efficiently, effectively, and not at a cost which will impede national development and not at an exorbitant cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong has attacked the Land Acquisition Act and said that the Government has reaped huge profits and so on and so forth. And therefore it is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> something highly immoral, unfair, inequitable. If it was unfair and inequitable, would we have achieved a situation today where more than 90% of the people are housed in public housing? It would not have been possible if not for the Land Acquisition Act and the cost of those HDB flats would not be what they are if not for the mechanism and the criteria for compensation in the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has said that some of the acquired lands are not bona fide and not genuine. That is a serious charge. He or others should bring up and challenge it in the courts if that is not so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned a specific case of a family being unfairly evicted. He must give us more details about this case so that it can be investigated. He has given the impression that out of the blue, HDB officers came and descended on them. He should let us know. Were they or were they not served with notices in advance? And did they comply with the notices? If they refused to comply with the notices, how many reminders were they given and so on and so forth? Let us get both sides of the story before presenting a picture of a draconian action by the authorities. I am sure my colleague, the Minister for National Development, will look into it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin raised the third limb of section 5. I do not think she should interpret it as enabling acquisition for matters other than for public interest or public projects, because that too would be used mainly for comprehensive development, as far as I understand. In fact, I do not think we have used that provision for many years.

  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion* standing in my name under item No. 6 in the Order Paper.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The Motion reads as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil List and Pension Act (Chapter 44) resolves that the Schedule to that Act be varied by deleting the figures "$51,000", "$2,013,200", "$393,000" and "$55,700" in the second column and substituting the figures "$53,000", "$2,249,900", "$411,300" and "$146,600", respectively.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to increase the provisions for the entertainment allowance and salaries of personal staff to $53,000 and $2,249,900 respectively. These increases for FY 93 are necessary to provide for anticipated higher entertainment expenditure and increases in staff remuneration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A higher sum of $411,300 is required to meet Expenses of the Istana household in FY 93. The increase is to cater for higher expenditure on public utilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation for Special Services in FY 93 is increased from $55,700 to $146,600. The higher expenditure in FY 93 is for the replacement of a car and other machinery and equipment which are beyond economic repair.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, necessary to vary the provisions in the Schedule to the Civil List as indicated in the Motion before the House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
  <br>

   <h4>PART I - REVIEW OF THE ECONOMY</h4>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <h4>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN 1992</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the 1985 recession, the Singapore economy rebounded strongly in 1987 and 1988. Quarterly growth rates then started falling steadily, from 11% in the first quarter of 1988 to 4.9% in the second quarter of 1992. This decline and the continued weakness of the US economy raised fears of a recession in Singapore in 1991. In particular, manufacturing growth fell rapidly from 11% in the first quarter of 1991 to 1.4% in the fourth quarter. The pessimistic outlook gained further support when the US economy only managed a weak recovery and the manufacturing sector recorded negative growth in the first quarter of 1992, the first time since the recession of 1985. Meanwhile, the financial sector was adversely affected by the consolidation of international banking activities and offshore risk management business. Consumer spending was also depressed due to weak sentiments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the Singapore economy was diversified and regional growth was strong. Robust growth of the transport and communications, and construction sectors helped to keep overall growth in 1991 and the first half of 1992 at around 5%. With the gradual moderation in cost pressures and better external conditions, the economy bottomed out in the third quarter of 1992.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1992 as a whole, the economy grew by 5.8%. This is a creditable performance when compared with the other NIEs. Taiwan grew by 6.1%, Hong Kong by 5.0% and South Korea by 4.9%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sector recovered from negative growth in the first quarter to register growth of 2.3% for the whole of 1992, on the back of strong growth in the output of electronics products such as
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> personal computers, disk drives and telecommunications equipment. The financial and business services sector was also stronger in the second half. This was due to higher demand for financing of regional projects, sustained growth in domestic loans and advances, and a more active foreign exchange market. Growth for the sector was 5.4%. Transport and communications continued to do well, riding on the strong regional economies. This sector grew by 9.2%. The construction sector continued to register double-digit growth, at 18%. The commerce sector was, however, sluggish. Retail trade was adversely affected by the change in composition of tourist arrivals, weaker tourist spending and cautious domestic consumer sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slower growth moderated cost pressures. The labour market eased somewhat. The unemployment rate in June 1992 stood at 2.7% compared with 1.9% in 1991. This moderated wage cost increases. Nominal wages grew by 7.5% in 1992 compared with 9.2% in 1991. Productivity growth recovered in the second half, in line with the cyclical recovery in output. Productivity growth for 1992 averaged 3.1%, up from 1.5% in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the manufacturing sector, slower growth in unit labour cost together with reduced utilities and interest costs helped to moderate business cost increases considerably. The Unit Business Cost Index for the manufacturing sector rose by only 1.9% in 1992. I refer Members to Chart 1 (Cols. 581 - 582). This compares favourably with the average annual increase of 4.9% between 1987 and 1991. However, with our weaker productivity performance relative to our competitors and a robust exchange rate, our relative unit labour cost against the other NIEs deteriorated slightly in 1992. I refer Members to Chart 2 (Cols. 581 - 582). The profit share in nominal GDP also fell marginally from 47% in 1991 to 46.2% in 1992. This is shown in Chart 3 (Cols. 583 - 584).

   <h4>OUTLOOK FOR 1993</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global outlook for 1993 is cautiously optimistic. Although forecasts by the OECD and IMF in the last 2 years have been scaled down repeatedly, their most recent forecasts point to better prospects in the industrial countries. The OECD and IMF expect the US economy to grow by 2.4% to 3% in 1993. This bullish assessment is supported by data showing good quarterly growth rates and stronger consumer confidence. The UK and Canada are also expected to recover from recession. However, the other two large industrial economies, Germany and Japan, are slowing down. Overall, the industrial countries are likely to grow by 1.9% in 1993, up from the 1.5% in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth prospects in East Asia, which accounts for one-third of our non-oil domestic exports, remain good. Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong expect to grow by 7%, 6% to 7% and 5% respectively. Malaysia and Thailand are expected to grow by 8% and Indonesia by 6.5%. China is likely to register double-digit growth again in 1993.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business community expects business conditions to be stable in the first 6 months of 1993. In the latest survey of business expectations, a net balance of 9% of firms in the manufacturing sector expect business conditions in the first half of 1993 to be better than the preceding 6 months. Firms in the electronics industry are optimistic, with a net balance of 29% expecting better business. Business in the commerce sector is expected to be more moderate after the year-end high. The transport and business services sectors are optimistic about prospects. The leading indicators, which indicate economic activity about three quarters ahead, continue to show an upward trend.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our relative competitiveness position has declined slightly, investors are confident about Singapore's fundamentals. Investment commitments in the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> manufacturing sector amounted to $3.5 billion in 1992, a record high. These high-quality new projects, with projected incremental value added per worker of $240,000, or about 4 times the existing average, will boost the productivity of the manufacturing sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the generally favourable external and domestic conditions, the Ministry of Trade and Industry's assessment is that growth in 1993 will be between 6% and 7%. The Government will therefore adjust the CPF contribution rates by another half a percentage point with effect from 1st July 1993. The employers' contribution rate will be raised by 0.5 percentage point to 18.5% while the employees' contribution rate will be reduced by 0.5 percentage point to 21.5%. If the world economic environment remains favourable in 1994 and our economy continues to grow satisfactorily, Government will further adjust the CPF contribution rates in 1994 by an additional 1.5 percentage points, bringing the contribution rates for the employer and employee to 20% each on 1st July 1994.
  <div align="center">
   <b>STRENGTHENING THE EXTERNAL DIMENSION OF THE SINGAPORE ECONOMY</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next few years, we can achieve a growth rate of around 5% to 6% provided we keep our competitiveness on an even keel and the world economic situation remains stable. In the longer term, however, high growth rates require new policy orientations to overcome the supply-side constraints of labour, land and services within Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emerging NIEs in the region are better endowed with land, labour and natural resources. They are becoming more competitive. Singapore must find the right response, to avoid becoming a failed NIE, namely, one which did not fulfil its early promise and failed to make it to become a developed country. In the race of nations, it is impossible for us to stand still and try to preserve what we have.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts to improve productivity and restructure the domestic economy to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> squeeze more out of each unit of resource will face diminishing returns, as we are already starting from a relatively high base. This has happened in all developed economies. The way out is to build an external dimension to our economy, in order to help us to overcome the problems of a small mature domestic market and a limited resource base. This is what the other NIEs have done in the past 5 years and what some developed countries like Switzerland and Japan have done over a much longer period.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many new business opportunities are to be found in the high growth countries around us. Foreign MNCs which come to Singapore have not done so with the primary aim to sell to the domestic market. They have always depended on markets in the developed countries and, increasingly in recent years, the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region. Singapore entrepreneurs must do likewise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential of the Asian market is vast, but sometimes underestimated. China and India both have official per capita GNP of less than US$400, but they have pockets of an emerging middle class in urban areas. It is reckoned that at least 5 Chinese cities - Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin - have per capita incomes above US$1,000. This places them on par with countries like Thailand. In India, the middle class is estimated to number between 100 and 350 million. This is up to 100 times the size of the Singapore market. The emerging middle class is demanding consumer durables like TV sets, refrigerators, motor-cycles and eventually cars. Moreover, the Asian region is expected to grow faster than the more established markets in the OECD countries where growth will be no more than 2% to 3%. The size of the Asian market and its growth potential represent a source of business opportunities for Singapore entrepreneurs, which we cannot afford to neglect.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singapore entrepreneurs have already ventured abroad to do business in the region. As at end-1990, Singapore companies had invested a total of $27.8 billion overseas. Direct investments
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> amounted to $7.5 billion which is equivalent to 12% of GNP. This is lower than Switzerland's and the Netherlands'. They have the equivalent of one-third of their GNP in direct investments overseas. Over time, as Singapore entrepreneurs gain experience, our overseas assets will also grow.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent study, the Ministry of Trade and Industry found that two-thirds of our direct investments overseas were in Asia and Australasia. Malaysia was the largest single destination, with $1.7 billion invested. In the last few years, we have become the largest foreign investor in Johor in terms of the number of projects. We have also participated in large projects in Batam and Bintan. Since the economic reforms in China, Singapore companies have also established a presence there. Singapore companies are involved in a wide variety of businesses in China - property development, industrial estate development, leisure and resort development, manufacture of computer peripherals and parts, software development and confectionery. In Vietnam and Cambodia, Singapore companies have invested in the food and beverage, textile and furniture industries. Statutory boards and Government-linked companies are well-represented in infrastructure projects in the region - industrial estate development, airport planning and design, and telecommunications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be realistic, the external economy will not supplant the domestic economy as the main engine of growth. Even in Switzerland and the Netherlands, income earned from overseas assets accounts for only 8% to 9% of GNP. The external economy is however valuable because of its ability to improve the economic structure in two ways. First, it generates business and economies of scale for companies operating in Singapore, making the domestic economy more productive. Second, it strengthens our links with other rapidly growing countries in the region, so that we will not be so heavily dependent on the developed countries for growth and markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regionalisation is not just a matter of sheer numbers. It requires that we find the right projects and the right firms with the ability to turn a promising idea into a profitable business. Since the subject was highlighted, many Singaporean entrepreneurs have contributed their ideas on the subject. They have among them accumulated valuable experience in working and investing in the region. Such people are still far too few, however, compared to opportunities waiting to be seized. If we can overcome the hindrances that hold others back, more entrepreneurs will in time emerge.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulties of getting Singaporeans to work abroad have been discussed extensively elsewhere and I will not repeat them here. We must be realistic about our weaknesses and find ways to overcome them. We must also build on our strengths. Our main strength is in organisations with proven professionalism and collective competence, not an abundance of individual mavericks with the touch of gold. Companies like SIA, Keppel, Sembawang, and Singapore Telecom, and statutory boards like PSA and PUB, have created strong management teams, with a depth and breadth of expertise equal to their competitors in the region. Some of them are starting to make their presence as corporations felt outside Singapore. We must leverage on this strength to go offshore, not only as individuals, but systematically in corporate teams.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government-linked companies (GLCs) and statutory boards are among our strong companies. We should tap their expertise to spearhead the regionalisation drive. Some concerns have been expressed that statutory boards and GLCs are not ready for this role because their priority is their domestic mission, or worse, because they are not business-minded. I believe that once the broad direction is set and the proper incentives are put in place, they will give more emphasis to their overseas operations. For example, STI, the international arm of Singapore Telecom, has invested US$150 million in 11 countries. It is involved in mobile phone ventures in Vietnam, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Keppel,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Sembawang and the companies in the Singapore Technologies stable have also participated successfully in regional ventures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These examples give us confidence that these companies can do much more. The question is how can they link up with the private sector, which is also doing regional business on its own. The Government will find ways for statutory boards and GLCs to work with private companies in overseas ventures. This could take the form of consortiums or joint ventures where both parties take the risks and share the rewards. Commodore Teo Chee Hean's Committee to Promote Enterprise Overseas will be examining this and many other related issues over the next few months.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector has proposed changes in tax incentives and tax rules to facilitate the drive to go offshore. The Government will take up some of these proposals in this Budget. I shall elaborate on these later in my speech. Whilst there is merit in building into our tax regime incentives for specific offshore activities, the more comprehensive approach is to lower direct taxes, both corporate and personal income taxes, across the board. This will encourage enterprise, both within and outside Singapore, and in whatever activities that businessmen choose. Individuals will be encouraged to take part in risky but highly profitable ventures, knowing that if they dare and succeed, Government will not cream off a large share of their rewards. This is why the Government will reform the tax structure to reduce corporate and personal income taxes, and introduce a Goods and Services Tax (GST) next year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is sometimes accused of levying increasingly heavy taxes on Singaporeans. Figures, however, disprove this. Since 1988, Government operating revenue, which includes Government taxes, ARF, COEs and foreign worker levy, have formed about 20% of GDP. This
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> compares with about 22% of GDP before the 1985 recession. The figure for 1992 was slightly higher, at around 23% of GDP, but this still gives no reason for alarm that taxes and levies are consuming an unprecedented and unsustainable share of national income. (See Chart 4 (Cols. 583 - 584))
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1993/19930226/19930226-HA-0600583.gif">Chart 4 - Government Operating Revenue As A Proportion of GDP (Cols. 583 - 584)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our figure of taxes making up 23% of GDP is comparable to that in other Asean countries and NIEs, and significantly below the 40% to 60% in OECD countries. (See Table 1 (Cols. 585 - 586)) The gap between us and the developed countries gives us a competitive advantage and helps us to attract investments.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1993/19930226/19930226-HA-0600585.htm">Table 1 - Government Revenue As Proportion of GDP (Cols. 585 - 586)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only Government with a significantly lower operating revenue than Singapore is Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, operating revenue forms 15% of GDP, compared to Singapore's 20%. However, there are fundamental differences between Hong Kong's circumstances and ours. Hong Kong is not a nation. Singapore is. Hong Kong does not have to provide for defence, which alone consumes 5% of our GDP each year. Nor does it have a heavily subsidised public housing programme, which is a major component of the Singapore Government's social policy. This is why Hong Kong's corporate tax and top personal tax rates can be much lower than Singapore's. It is impossible for Singapore to emulate Hong Kong's example.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the overall tax burden on Singaporeans is not high, our revenue structure needs to be improved. Over half of our operating revenue is from direct taxes, while the bulk of indirect taxes fall on only a few items. We need to shift the burden of tax from direct taxes to indirect taxes with a broad base. Hence the introduction of the GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This major change in our tax system is in line with tax reforms in other parts of the world. In the 1960s and 1970s, countries like the UK and New Zealand relied heavily on direct taxes to fund Government expenditure, including generous welfare programmes. Top
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> marginal tax rates were as high as 75% in the UK, 70% in the US and 50% in New Zealand. This "soak the rich" approach did not work. In practice, high nominal tax rates were tempered with various loopholes that allowed the rich to avoid taxes. The result was that few really paid taxes at the very high rates, while unproductive work was expended on tax avoidance and lobbying to enhance or maintain special concessions. Talented people who could not dodge taxes voted with their feet by moving to lower tax countries. These countries have since reformed their tax systems and reduced income tax rates. Usually the result has been higher, rather than lower tax collections from the high income groups. We should never forget these costly experiences of other countries, and unwittingly diminish the incentive to work and to invest. It is far better to encourage the talented by taxing them lightly than to tax them punitively and force them to under perform, evade taxes or leave.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent international developments give greater urgency to tax reform. Our last major revision of direct tax rates was in 1986, during the recession, when both the corporate tax rate and the top personal tax rate were reduced from 40% to 33%. This, and other cost-cutting measures, gave a significant boost to our competitiveness and helped the economy to recover speedily. However, since then many other countries (including the developed countries) have reduced their tax rates significantly. (See Table 2 (Cols. 587 - 588)) This trend has eroded the margin we enjoy. Although we cannot match every country's tax rate reductions, we must take cognizance of such developments and make the necessary adjustments in good time. We must also note that Singapore has comparative disadvantages in higher land and labour costs compared with many emerging economies in the region. A lower corporate tax rate will help to offset this disadvantage.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1993/19930226/19930226-HA-0600587.htm">Table 2 - Top Personal Tax Rates (Cols. 587 - 588)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, Government aims for a 25% corporate tax rate and a slightly
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> higher top personal tax rate. Given sustained economic growth, we can achieve this with the 3% GST, without needing to raise the GST rate further. The GST rate will stay at 3% for at least 5 years and thereafter for as long as revenue needs are not pressing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-orientation of our economic development strategy and the change in the tax system will take time to work through. I am confident that the private sector will respond favourably to the steps outlined. Those who succeed will encourage others to emulate them. Momentum will build up. The results will no longer be constrained by Singapore's size but by the ingenuity of individual and corporate Singaporeans. In time a second pillar of the Singapore economy, comprising strong local companies and their foreign operations, will become a major contributor to our national wealth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we will continue with our efforts to be attractive to foreign MNCs, who will always remain important to us. We will continue to welcome foreign capital and encourage R&amp;D. There will be no let-up in the development of human resources and physical infrastructure. When we develop this external dimension, Singapore's economy will have the prospect of many more years of prosperous growth.

   <h4>PART II - THE FY93 BUDGET</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to move on to the Budget for the next financial year.
  <div align="center">
   <b>EXPENDITURE POLICY</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's expenditure policy will continue to be guided by the philosophy of investing in the future. Expenditure will focus on areas which promote and support future growth. These are education, economic infrastructure, health care, public housing and national security. Quality of life in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore will be sustained through greater funding for the arts, sports, cultural and recreational activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control of costs will remain the cornerstone of expenditure policy. As the flagship of Singapore's economy, the private sector must play the leading role. The public sector will therefore be kept lean and trim to make available to the private sector a bigger share of national financial and manpower resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All operating and development expenditures will be met from operating revenues. Moreover, a substantial part of the surplus expected in FY93 will be channelled towards building up the Edusave Endowment Fund established last year and the Medical Endowment Fund which will be set up in April this year. Together with Government subsidies and Medisave, the Medical Endowment Fund will ensure that no Singaporean is deprived of basic medical care.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The FY93 Expenditure Estimates</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's medium-term policy target is to keep total operating and development expenditure within 20% of GDP, with 12% for operating expenditure and 8% for development expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY93, operating expenditure is forecast to increase from 11.7% to 11.9% of GDP while development expenditure is projected at 7% of GDP, up from 5.5% in FY92. Together, operating and development expenditure will amount to nearly 19% of GDP.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dollar terms, total Government expenditure for FY93 is expected to reach $15.5 billion, an increase of 18% over FY92. Social and Community Services will continue to have by far the largest share, taking up nearly 40%. Expenditure in this area is mainly on education, health care services, environmental protection, community development and subsidies on public housing. National security, covering Defence and Home Affairs, will take up the second largest share of more than 33% of total expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed budget allocations reflect the priorities of Government. They are to provide infrastructure as a basis for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> economic growth, ensure national security, house our people in decent, affordable housing in a clean and green environment, invest in quality education as well as provide good basic health care and a wide range of social amenities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me at this juncture take a moment to re-emphasize Government's commitment to education. As members are aware, Government will build up the Edusave Endowment Fund to $5 billion, to put in place a strong permanent foundation for educational standards to be continually upgraded. This is crucial, for the experience of many countries has shown that the surest way to secure continued success in an uncertain world is by investing in the education of future generations. A well educated and highly skilled people will always remain the fundamental objective of Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with this philosophy, the Government will increase its FY92 capital contribution to the Edusave Endowment Fund from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The additional $500 million will come from the projected surplus for FY92. Supplementary Estimates to effect this will be tabled in Parliament next week. With this transfer, the total allocation for education in FY92 will amount to 5.5% of GDP, which exceeds the allocation for every other sector, including defence. A further sum of $500 million has been earmarked for transfer to Edusave in FY93. This will bring the total Edusave endowment to $2 billion, double the current amount.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will also make its first capital transfer of $200 million to the Medical Endowment Fund in FY93. This Fund will eventually be built up to $1 billion. A one-off allocation of $5 million has also been provided to enable disbursements to be made from the Fund in FY93 itself for the benefit of Singaporeans who cannot afford basic medical care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me now to elaborate on the FY93 expenditure proposals.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Operating Expenditure</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenditure comprises Expenditure on Manpower, Other Operating Expenditure, Grants-in-Aid and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Pensions. For FY93, operating expenditure is projected at $9.7 billion. This is about 9.4% more than the revised FY92 expenditure of $8.9 billion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 25% of Operating Expenditure will go towards Expenditure on Manpower, which is projected to rise by $358.6 million or 17.1% to $2.5 billion in FY93. This is 3% of GDP, compared to 2.8% in FY92. The increase is mainly to cater for salary increments, some salary adjustments and the filling of vacancies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorised staff complement for ministries, organs of state and Government-funded statutory boards will decline by 0.6% or about 600 posts to nearly 99,500 posts in FY93. The decrease is due to Nanyang Polytechnic taking over the training of nurses and radiographers from the Ministry of Health, as well as restructuring and privatisation activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 88,000 persons are currently employed in the Civil Service and Government-funded statutory boards. This is about 600 persons less than a year ago. It shows the success of the Zero-Growth in Manpower Policy. Whilst Government remains committed to this policy, we will nevertheless ensure that it does not lead to a decline in standards or quality of public services. Wherever possible, increases in workload or manpower needs for new areas will be met through retraining, redeployment and productivity improvements. Where this is not possible, increases will be granted. For example, 116 new posts will be created in FY93 for the Ministry of Community Development to cater for the expansion of sports facilities and new community centres. Another 292 posts will be provided to the Ministry of Education to keep pace with the increase in student enrolment in schools and other teaching institutions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Operating Expenditure or OOE is projected at $5.1 billion or 6.2% of GDP. The OOE provision is an increase of $325 million over FY92, due mainly to the provision of agency fees for the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, reimbursements to restructured hospitals, and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> bursaries for the training of nurses. Higher expenditures will also be needed for estate management and the maintenance of roads.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants-in-Aid will amount to $1.9 billion or 2.3% of GDP. It represents an increase of $141 million over FY92's provision, which is largely to meet the higher operating costs of schools and polytechnics, and the rising cost of subsidised medical care. Higher grants to the Economic Development Board, National Productivity Board, Singapore Broadcasting Corporation and the National Arts Council account for the rest of the increase.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensions expenditure is expected to remain under 0.5% of GDP. In dollar terms, it will increase by some $13 million or 4% over FY92. This is due to an increase in the number of pensioners and the rising cost of medical subsidy for pensioners.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Development Expenditure</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$5.8 billion or 7% of GDP is proposed for development expenditure in FY93. This is around 37% of total expenditure, up from 32% in FY92. It is also closer to the medium term target of keeping development expenditure at no less than 40% of total expenditure, in line with the objective of allocating an increasing share of the budget towards development expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct Government development expenditure will increase by nearly 50% to $3.1 billion, or 3.8% of GDP. Major projects include land reclamation at Changi East and several other sites, the schools building programmes, provision of computer facilities for secondary schools, construction of Revenue House, and the development of Eastern General Hospital and the new Kandang Kerbau Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital subsidy for public housing is projected to reach $900 million, an increase of nearly 50% over FY92. HDB will need substantial increases in subsidies to build more flats and implement its Flat Upgrading Programme. More funds will also be needed to provide higher capital grants to Town Councils and a grant to HDB for the discount given on the sale of tenanted HDB shophouses.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R&amp;D, or Research and Development, is increasingly recognized internationally as being of strategic importance in enhancing industrial competitiveness. To sustain the push towards greater industry-related R&amp;D, a sum of $350 million or 0.4% of GDP will be allocated to the R&amp;D Fund to be administered by the National Science and Technology Board. This represents an increase of 27% over FY92's allocation. It is in line with the policy to increase funding for industry-related R&amp;D.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another $1.4 billion or 1.7% of GDP in capital grants will be given to other statutory boards. Projects which require capital grants in FY93 include the Woodlands extension to the MRT system, a new campus for Temasek Polytechnic, and the expansion and upgrading of the 2 universities. Capital grants are also required for economic development schemes administered by the Economic Development Board, development of tourism infrastructure on Sentosa, and development and improvement works to community centres.

   <b>MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch briefly on progress made in implementing management accounting systems in Government ministries and zero-base reviews conducted by the Auditor-General's Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Management Accounting Systems</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase I of the programme to install centralized computer based management accounting systems in all Government ministries and departments has been completed on schedule. Management accounting systems, or SIGMA, have been operational in the Ministries of Finance, Education, Health, Environment and National Development since April last year. Management reports generated by SIGMA are being used in these ministries to allocate resources and generate an awareness of the true costs of delivering public services. This will allow managers in Government ministries and departments to identify and weed out inefficient and unproductive practices. SIGMA will now be fine-tuned to make it more user-friendly, and extended to all departments in these ministries.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to report that the extension of SIGMA to all other ministries is ahead of schedule. By April this year, working management accounting systems will be in place in all ministries. By April next year, they would have been extended to all departments. Statutory boards are also being encouraged to introduce similar systems. I am confident that over time public service managers will use these management accounting systems to become more productive and deliver a higher quality of public service at lower cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Zero-base Reviews</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor-General's Office is responsible for conducting periodic zero-base reviews of individual ministries. The principal objective of these reviews is to ensure that ministries consciously and constantly monitor their own performances to keep their practices, operating procedures and policies current and relevant in achieving Government's priorities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past year, the Auditor-General's Office has conducted zero-base reviews of the Ministries of Education, Trade and Industry, Foreign Affairs, the Prime Minister's Office and the Attorney-General's Chambers. Reviews of the Ministries of Labour and Law are in progress. Three other ministries are scheduled to be reviewed over the next one and a half years.

   <b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <h4>PART III - FISCAL POSITION, TAX CHANGES, AND OFFSETS FOR THE GST</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now move on to describe our fiscal position and the proposed tax changes
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for FY93. I will also be announcing the corporate, personal and other indirect tax changes which form part of the GST package.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a healthy budget balance. Government had a surplus in FY92, mainly because its operating revenue was buoyant. For FY93, operating revenue is estimated to be $17.2 billion, whilst the operating and development expenditure is budgeted at $15.5 billion, so that a modest operating surplus of $1.7 billion is expected. Given sustained economic growth, revenue should remain buoyant and if costs are kept under control, we should continue to have budget surpluses in the next few years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target date of April 1994 for the introduction of GST has already been announced. Our favourable fiscal outlook will allow the GST to be implemented in a revenue-negative way. The GST will be introduced with a generous package of offsets, comprising corporate and personal income tax reductions, rebates and subsidies which, taken together, will exceed the GST collected in the first few years of its implementation. We will ensure that as far as possible, no household will be worse-off when the GST is implemented.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, I will discuss proposed tax changes in two parts. Part I will be concerned with tax changes specific to FY93. It will also deal with initiatives we are introducing this year to develop an external economy and to attract new investments into Singapore. Part II will be concerned with GST-related changes. It will deal with corporate and personal tax cuts, property tax rebates, compensating adjustments to existing indirect taxes, as well as additional rebates and expenditures to help lower income groups cope with the GST.
  <div align="center">
   <h4>FY93 TAX CHANGES</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrust of this year's tax changes will be to promote our investments abroad. This is in line with our current economic strategy. There will also be tax incentives to promote offshore activities in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore. In addition, in view of the healthy revenue position, I will grant some one-off tax rebates for Year of Assessment 1993. These will benefit both companies and individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Tax Changes for Companies</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Property Tax Rebate</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For companies, I propose to give a rebate on property tax. It shall be a one-off 25% rebate for commercial and industrial properties for the year commencing July 1993. This will offset some of the business cost increases in the year and help maintain Singapore as an attractive location for doing business. The revenue loss to Government is estimated at $145 million per annum. The rebate is intended to be shared between landlords and their tenants. In order to demonstrate this, HDB, JTC and other Government agencies owning properties will pass on most of this rebate to their tenants. The Government strongly encourages other private landlords to do likewise, and pass on at least half the rebate to their tenants.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Tax Incentives to Promote an External Economy</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I recognise the importance of building an external economy, I must stress that tax-wise we must not make outward investments generally more attractive than domestic ones. Foreign incomes therefore cannot be exempt from tax across-the-board. This is to avoid a hollowing out of our domestic industries. An across-the-board exemption will also open up a tax loophole for local source income to make a round-trip and return disguised as foreign income to enjoy tax exemption. For these reasons, the exemption of foreign incomes from tax will be given only on a case-by-case basis.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of seven incentives to promote the development of an external economy are proposed. They are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Unilateral tax credit for dividend income remitted from countries with whom we do not as yet have tax treaties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Extension of the unilateral tax credit scheme for services income, to include income remitted from Fiji,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Kampuchea, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, and to include other types of services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Extension of the double tax deduction scheme for approved expenses incurred in the promotion of exports, to cover export of services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Double tax deduction for approved expenses incurred in exploring and developing overseas investment opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Removal of a requirement under the Overseas Investment Incentive to form separate companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Tax exemption scheme for venture capital and regional funds to promote investments in the Asia-Pacific region.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Overseas Enterprise Incentive. This incentive provides approved Overseas Enterprises with tax exemption for qualifying income from approved kinds of overseas investments for periods of up to 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute a paper entitled Paper 1 (Cols. 589 - 592) which gives details of the incentives I have described.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Tax Changes to Attract Offshore Activities to Singapore</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to tax changes to attract offshore activities to Singapore. A total of six incentives are proposed and they are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To promote Singapore as an international centre for the trading of arts and antiques, a 10% concessionary tax rate will be granted to approved art and antique dealers on income derived from transacting on behalf of non-residents with approved auction houses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Tax exemption for non-resident beneficiaries of trusts where the trustee is an Approved Trustee Company. This is an extension of an existing incentive to promote trustee services in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Extension of tax holiday for SIMEX by a further 5 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Provision for extending the Warehousing and Servicing Incentives for periods not exceeding 5 years at a time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Extension of the tax exemption scheme for syndicated offshore credit and underwriting facilities, by an additional 5 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Exemption from tax for interest paid by members of the RAS Commodity Exchange. This is an extension of an existing incentive to enhance the international competitiveness of the Exchange.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute copies of Paper 2 (Cols. 593 - 598) with details of these incentives. This paper also contains a proposal on the treatment of capital allowances and losses of companies enjoying tax incentives.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Cap on Deduction for Medical Expenses</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, employers have been allowed to deduct for tax purposes all expenses incurred in providing medical benefits to employees without limit. This was not a problem in the past, when medical benefits were a minor expense. But in the long term, this arrangement will inflate health care expenditures and encourage over-consumption of medical services. It makes it worthwhile for both employers and employees to provide more medical benefits in their compensation packages than they would otherwise, rather than cash salaries. This is because employees have to pay tax on cash salaries while they enjoy medical benefits free of tax, and yet both medical benefits and cash salaries are tax-deductible to the employer. This difference in tax treatment between medical benefits and cash salaries reduces the incentive for both employers and employees to be cost-conscious in consuming medical services, as part of the cost of these services is borne by the Government in the form of forgone taxes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, employer-provided medical benefits enjoy unlimited tax exemption.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> As a result, these benefits account for 10% of all health care spending. According to a recent report on the US automobile industry, the cost of steel per US-made car is less than the cost of medical benefits per car. Many experts who have studied the problem of high medical costs in the US have concluded that this tax exemption is a major cause of the high costs, and that any serious attempt to contain health costs must include setting a cap on tax-free medical benefits. However, it is extremely difficult for the US to do so now, after medical costs have risen and the high medical benefits have become the norm.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not as yet have a serious problem in Singapore. A recent survey of 325 companies by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore showed that in 59% (around 190) of them, health care expenditure formed less than 1% of the total remuneration for their employees. I refer Members to Table 3 (Cols. 587 - 588). In another 26% (or 85) of the companies, health spending was between 1% and 2% of total remuneration. However, a few astute employers paid medical benefits amounting to over 5% of total remuneration.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1993/19930226/19930226-HA-0600587.htm">Table 3 - Medical Benefits as Percentage of Total Remuneration in 325 Companies (Cols. 587 - 588)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent a problem from developing in future, Government will cap the tax deductibility of expenses on medical benefits by employers at 2% of total employees' remuneration with effect from Year of Assessment 1994. Companies are free to give medical benefits even beyond this 2% figure if they wish to do so, but such benefits will no longer be tax-deductible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's aim is to pre-empt a future problem and not to deprive any workers of existing medical benefits. Most companies (85%) will be unaffected by this 2% cap, as their medical benefits form less than 2% of payroll. Government will give companies which have already exceeded the 2% cap in Year of Assessment 1992 time to adjust to the new rules. These companies will not have to pay tax on the entire amount of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> excess above 2% immediately. In the first year, they will be allowed to deduct up to 4% of payroll or their percentage in Year of Assessment 1992, whichever is the lower. This transitional cap of 4% for such companies will be reduced gradually by 0.5 percentage point per year until it reaches 2% after 5 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cap for new companies will be 2%. For companies enjoying concessionary tax treatment, the resulting increase in income from disallowing expenses in excess of the cap will not be treated as concessionary income but will be taxed at the full corporate tax rate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is also reviewing the medical benefits of public sector employees. Details will be announced later in the year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to deal with personal income tax changes for FY93.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Personal Income Tax Changes</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Individual Income Tax Rebate</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy grew by a satisfactory 5.8% in 1992. Singaporeans have worked hard to achieve this despite the sluggish world economy. As encouragement for continued effort, I have decided to give an across-the-board one-off rebate of 5% on individual income tax in Year of Assessment 1993. The estimated revenue loss to Government is $91 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Rebate of Service and Conservancy Charges</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans staying in 1 to 3-room HDB flats who pay little or no income tax, Government has decided to pay on their behalf the Service and Conservancy charges payable in the month of December 1993. This will be a one-off payment for citizens only, the equivalent of the 5% income tax rebate. The estimated expenditure by the Government is $10 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>CPF Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the National Day Rally last August, the Prime Minister spoke of the Government's intention to increase the assets of Singaporeans under an Assets-enlargement Programme. In addition to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> HDB upgrading and the sale of HDB shops programmes, he said that the Government would sell shares of corporatised statutory boards at a discount to Singaporeans. His aim was to make Singapore a share-owning society as well as a home-owning society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications will be floating Singapore Telecom (ST) on the Stock Exchange later this year. Details will be announced nearer the date of flotation. As part of the flotation, Government will sell several hundred ST shares at a discount to each CPF member who is a Singapore citizen. This is part of a programme to build up the assets held by Singaporeans, and promote widespread long-term ownership of blue-chip stocks, so that Singaporeans will have a more direct stake in the growth and prosperity of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To launch this share-owning programme, in addition to the 5% rebate on personal income tax and the rebate for Service and Conservancy charges, the Government will implement a Share Ownership CPF Top-Up Scheme to help middle and working-class Singaporeans to own shares.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Top-Up Scheme will be confined to citizens aged 21 and above who are CPF members. In September, the Government will contribute a $200 grant into each such CPF account, provided the member or his employer has paid in at least $500 during the 6-month period from 1st March 1993 to 31st August 1993. Members who pay in less than $500 will receive a pro-rated contribution from the Government. Citizens without CPF accounts will be allowed to start one to benefit from the Scheme. Retirees, housewives and the self-employed can therefore also enjoy, first the CPF Top-Up, and later, the purchase of Singapore Telecom shares at a discount.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This $500 co-payment that we require corresponds to a CPF contribution of $83 per month, or a salary of about $250 per month. Thus almost all working Singaporeans will qualify for the full $200 CPF top-up. The Scheme is expected to cost the Government around $200 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will take some time for Singaporeans who have not owned shares to become familiar with shares, and to learn the value of investing part of their assets in the shares of blue-chip companies like Singapore Telecom. They will learn from experience how good shares can multiply many times in value over the next 5 to 10 years. In future, when we have strong budgetary surpluses, we will from time to time top-up their CPF accounts to help Singaporeans buy shares of other statutory boards which will be corporatised. This way, every Singaporean will own shares and properties, which will appreciate in value as Singapore continues to prosper because of sound economic and social policies plus their own hard work.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Other FY93 Tax Changes Affecting Individuals</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the foregoing, I am proposing six other tax changes affecting individuals. The proposals are set out in detail in Paper 3 (Cols. 597 - 600) which I will now ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute. Briefly, they deal with:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Unilateral tax credit for overseas employment income and director's fee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Taxation of retirement benefits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Waiver of the residence requirement for the aged parent and handicapped sibling reliefs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Separate assessment for married women on all incomes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Separate claims for normal and enhanced child reliefs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Tax deduction for CPF contributions by self-employed individuals.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Other Tax Changes</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Duties on Cigarettes and Tobacco</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties on cigarettes and tobacco were last revised in March 1991 to discourage smoking. In support of the national anti-smoking campaign and in particular to discourage smoking among our younger population, the import duty on cigarettes will be raised from $100 to $115 per
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> kilogram. The import duty on tobacco and excise duty on cigarettes will also be raised from $50 to $60 per kilogram. Details of the duty changes for the various types of igarettes and tobacco are in Appendix A (Cols. 601 - 604). The change in duties will take effect from today.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to tax changes which will take effect next year when the GST is introduced. These tax changes constitute a major reform of our tax system, and are a principal reason for the Government to introduce the GST now.
  <div align="center">
   <b>TAX CHANGES TO ACCOMPANY THE GST</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Corporate Tax Change</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporate tax rate of 30% will be reduced by 3 percentage points to 27%. This will take effect from Year of Assessment 1994. The reduction represents a major step towards the target of a 25% corporate tax rate. It will ensure that Singapore's corporate tax rate remains competitive internationally. The estimated revenue loss is $318 million per annum.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Personal Tax Changes</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top personal income tax rate of 33% will be reduced by 3 percentage points to 30%, with proportionate reductions in other tax brackets. The reduction in personal tax rates for each tax bracket is in Appendix B (Cols. 605 - 606).
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1993/19930226/19930226-HA-0600605.htm">Appendix B - REDUCTION IN PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATES WITH EFFECT FROM YA94 (Cols. 605 - 606)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal relief will be increased by $1,000, from $2,000 to $3,000
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rebate on individual income tax will be granted annually. The rebate will be $700 in the first year, declining by $50 per year until it reaches $500 in the fifth year, after which it will remain at $500. This means that resident individuals will have their income tax liability reduced by the amount of the rebate, that is to say, $700 in the first year. Individuals whose liability is already $700 or less will not have to pay income tax for that year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have chosen to give a combination of tax rebate and personal relief, rather than

  <br> to rely on higher personal relief alone, because a tax rebate benefits low income taxpayers more than higher personal relief, for the same amount of revenue forgone.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal income tax changes will take effect from Year of Assessment 1994. Revenue loss is estimated at $494 million per annum.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Property tax rebate</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will give owner-occupied residential properties with annual values of less than $10,000 a property tax rebate based on a sliding scale. For properties with annual values of $5,000 or less, the maximum rebate of $150 per annum will be given. For annual values between $5,000 and $10,000, the rebate will vary along a straight line from $150 at $5,000 to zero at $10,000. This will benefit most HDB owner-occupiers, and also households staying in lower-end private properties such as terrace houses, shophouses and private walk-up flats. The revenue loss is estimated at $69 million per annum.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Changes in Other Existing Indirect Taxes</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government currently levies a range of indirect taxes, for example tourism cess, utilities taxes on PUB and Telecom bills, excise duty on petrol and import duties on vehicles. The Government will suspend or reduce the following levies with effect from 1st April 1994, to offset the GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cess charge of 4% levied on tourist restaurants and hotels will be reduced to 1%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5% tax on the bills of domestic telephone subscribers will be suspended.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5% tax on PUB bills of households in excess of $40 will be reduced to 2%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5% entertainments duty on all forms of general entertainment will be suspended.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cinematograph film hire duty will be suspended. Royalty payments for film hire will be liable to income tax as at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing duties on petrol and diesel will be adjusted downwards to nullify the effect of the GST. These duties were introduced as a means to control the usage of cars. Government does not intend the introduction of the GST to cause an increase in total taxes payable on these fuels.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The import duties on cars, taxis, motorcycles, and buses will be reduced to nullify the effect of the GST. Like duties on petrol, these were introduced as part of a package of measures to control car ownership and road congestion. Government does not intend the introduction of the GST to result in cars paying higher total taxes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties on tobacco, alcohol and gambling will, however, not be reduced when the GST is introduced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue loss from the changes in existing indirect taxes is estimated to be $162 million per annum.
  <div align="center">
   <b>ADDITIONAL REBATES AND OFFSETS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper stated that most households, including most lower income households, will be better off after the GST is introduced. For nearly all households earning at least $1,500 per month, the combination of personal income tax reductions and rebates, plus the property tax rebate, will be sufficient to offset the GST. However, households earning below $1,500 do not pay sufficient income tax for these tax reductions to offset in full the GST they will pay. To ensure that they too are not worse off, the Government will implement a package of additional rebates to offset the GST. The rebates will be largest at the beginning, when households are still adjusting to the new tax, and will taper off over time as incomes rise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the 1990 census, there are 195,000 households earning less than $1,500 per month in Singapore. (See Appendices (Cols. 607 - 610) C and D) 90% of them stay in HDB flats. 125,000 or 64% of them are in 1, 2, and 3-room HDB flats. Government will therefore use rebates on rentals for 1 and 2-room flats, and rebates on Service and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Conservancy (S&amp;C) charges for 1, 2, and 3-room flats, as the main mechanism to assist low income households. The Government will also increase S&amp;C subsidies to Town Councils to offset the GST payable on S&amp;C charges.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1993/19930226/19930226-HA-0600607.htm">Appendices - HOUSEHOLDS EARNING BELOW $1,500 PER MONTH BY RESIDENTIAL DWELLING (NUMBER), STATUS OF HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN $1,500 PER MONTH (Cols. 607 - 610)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 55,000 or 28% of the low income families are owner-occupiers of larger HDB flats, shophouses, terrace houses and semi-detached houses and small bungalows. They will benefit from the property tax rebate for owner-occupied properties outlined earlier.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 20,000 families earning below $1,500 per month are tenants in old shophouses, old walk-up private flats, or owner-occupiers in attap and zinc-roofed houses. They form only 3% of the total number of households in Singapore. However, they are too diverse a group to be reached by a single rebate or subsidy mechanism. Instead, the Government will work through the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) who are in close touch with the ground to administer a CCC assistance scheme for families needing help to cope with the GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Government will increase several grant schemes to meet the needs of specific groups. It will increase the Edusave grant from $50 per child to $100 per child, to help families with school-age children. It will raise Public Assistance rates to help destitute households. It will also raise the Singapore Allowance, to help Government retirees on low pensions cope with the GST.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Rental Rebates</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 61,000 HDB rental premises, of which over 83% are 1 and 2-room flats. We will grant rental rebates to tenants of 1 and 2-room rental HDB flats who are Singapore citizens, as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) For 1-room tenants: a rental rebate of $16 per month for the first year, declining by $1 a year to $12 per month in the fifth year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) For 2-room tenants: a rental rebate of $12 per month for the first year, declining by $1 a year to $8 per month in the fifth year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> The cost over the 5 years averages $7 million per annum.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Rebates for Service and Conservancy Charges</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore citizens staying in 1, 2 and 3- room HDB flats will enjoy rebates on their S&amp;C charges over a period of 5 years. Specifically:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) For 1-room flat dwellers: $12 per month for the first year, declining by $1 a year to $8 per month in the fifth year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) For 2-room flat dwellers: $11 per month for the first year, declining by $1 a year to $7 per month in the fifth year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) For 3-room flat dwellers: $8 per month for the first year, declining by $1 a year to $4 per month in the fifth year. The cost is estimated at $24 million per annum over the 5 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Offseting GST Payable on S&amp;C Charges</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households staying in HDB flats will have to pay GST on their S&amp;C charges, as S&amp;C charges are for a service like other goods and services which households consume. In order for the GST not to raise S&amp;C charges, Government will increase the subvention to Town Councils to offset the GST payable on the S&amp;C charges. The amount of subvention given will depend on the S&amp;C charges collections from each Town Council. This will benefit all HDB residential flat dwellers. The cost is estimated at $9 million per annum.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Edusave grant</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Edusave grant is currently $50 per annum per pupil. To help families with children defray any increases in educational costs due to GST, Government will increase the Edusave grant per pupil to $100 per annum from 1994. As mentioned earlier, to do this the Government will double the Edusave Endowment Fund to $2 billion. The increased grant will more than offset the GST payable on school books and other miscellaneous school items. It will also make the offsets fairer between big and small families, as families with more children who incur higher household expenses and pay more GST will also obtain more Edusave grants.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Increase in Public Assistance</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Assistance is currently given to aged destitutes and those certified medically unfit for work, widows or deserted wives with young dependent children, and orphans. The amount given ranges from $150 per month for a single-person household to $430 per month for a 1-adult and 3-children household. To help this group offset the GST on their monthly consumption items, we will increase the amount of Public Assistance by between $5 per month for a single-person household to $15 per month for a 4-person household. This translates into a 3 to 5% increase in the Public Assistance for the various household compositions. Details will be released by the Ministry of Community Development.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Increase in Singapore Allowance</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special allowance is given to pensioners whose pension is less than $850 per month. The Singapore Allowance is the difference between the $850 and the individual's pension, subject to a limit of $100 per month. As at 31st March 1992, there were 16,473 pensioners of whom 9,858 or 60% receive this allowance. From 1 April 1993, we will increase the maximum allowance by $30 per month to $130 per month, and the specified pension level by $50 from $850 to $900 per month. This will be more than the GST payable by these individuals when they spend their pensions. Cost is estimated at around $4 million per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Grants to CCCs</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebates on HDB rentals and S&amp;C charges, the property tax rebate, the increases in Edusave grants, Public Assistance and the Singapore Allowance will cover 90% of the households with income below $1,500. Most pensioners and retirees will also be covered by one or other of these schemes. The remaining 10% or 20,000 households are a small but diverse group. Not all of them are necessarily poor. Some own significant amount of property, or have accumulated more than enough savings for their needs. Some old folks are supported by their children, who will benefit from the tax cuts and other rebates. It is difficult to design a single scheme of Government
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> assistance to target precisely those who need help. We need a more sensitive mechanism to distinguish those who genuinely need help to cope with the GST from those who can manage on their own.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) provide such a mechanism. Being grassroots organisations, the CCCs are in constant touch with the ground. They are well-placed to identify which households in their constituencies need help, and what type of help will be most useful. The CCCs can work with other grassroots organisations like Residents' Committees in this task. They can then channel help to whomever needs it, including pensioners and retirees not living in HDB flats and not owning private property, or households which for some reason do not benefit from the offsets that I have listed above.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Community Development will budget $3 million per year for CCCs to operate this assistance scheme. This should be sufficient to cover all the estimated 20,000 low-income households not covered by the HDB and other schemes, even though probably not all of them will need help. The $3-million budget can be increased if necessary. The CCCs will evaluate needy cases who approach them for help. They will have the discretion to decide whom to help, and how much help to give. The amount per household will usually not need to exceed $200 per annum. This will resolve the specific problems of retirees and non-HDB residents arising from the GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to be clear that the CCC scheme is not meant to solve all the financial problems of poor families, or to give general assistance to households in distress. Other welfare schemes already exist to help poor families. The CCC scheme is designed specifically to offset the GST that poor families will incur, to the extent that the package of other rebates does not make up for the GST they have to pay. The CCCs will have to administer it with this objective in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Timing</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax rebate, the increases in Public Assistance and the Singapore
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Allowance, and the additional subsidies for Town Council S&amp;C charges will continue indefinitely. However the S&amp;C charges rebates, rental rebates and CCC grant scheme will operate in the first instance for 5 years. They are meant to be transitional measures to help households tide over the introduction of the GST. Therefore the amounts of the S&amp;C charges and rental rebates will diminish over time, although even in the fifth year the total package of assistance provided will be more than sufficient to offset the GST payable by most low-income households. During these 5 years, incomes should grow in real terms by 5 to 7% per year. This will be more than sufficient to offset the 3% GST, which should lead only to a one-off increase of prices of around 3% in the year of introduction. Higher incomes will reduce the need for these special schemes. After 5 years we will re-assess the situation to decide whether to continue the package in a modified form.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has undertaken that nearly all households will be better off after the GST is introduced than before. This offset package fulfils this promise. However, the Government cannot promise that households whose incomes are presently low, and who therefore pay little or no tax, will never pay more tax than they now do, even after their incomes rise as a result of economic growth. The tax burden has to be spread as broadly and fairly as possible, so that it will weigh lightly both on individuals and on the economy as a whole. This is indeed one of the purposes of introducing the GST.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Gains and Losses</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix E (Cols. 611 - 612) summarises the benefits to specific households by dwelling and income groups per year in the first and fifth year. Appendix F (Cols. 613 - 618) gives the net change of expenditures for lower-income typical households before and after the GST is introduced. It confirms that most households will be better off after the GST is introduced than before.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix G (Cols. 619 - 620) summarises Government's revenue position as a result of all the tax changes and offsets against the revenue collected from the GST. It shows that the revenue loss from the whole package amounts to $1,104 million. If we exclude the transient items, the total loss is still $1,070 million. As the GST collection is estimated at $921 million, the Government will have a reduced revenue of $183 million revenue per year during the initial 5 years. However, in the long run, I expect the package to be revenue neutral, because with economic growth consumption will increase and so will tax collections.

   <b>CONCLUSION</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have seen our economic growth rate levelling down over the last three years. Although the outlook for 1993 is somewhat better, for the longer term we need to change the orientation of our people towards venturing abroad if we are to continue enjoying high economic growth. Government will on its part do whatever is possible to encourage, facilitate and be a partner of an outward economic expansion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of public expenditures will continue to be on investments which will enhance our economic performance. Our tax changes are designed to promote overseas investments as well as clear the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> way for the foreign earnings to be repatriated. When the GST is implemented and the tax reform is in place, we will become more competitive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our challenge is to claim a bigger piece of that fast-growing economic pie in the region. I am confident that we have what is needed to meet that challenge.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. [Applause].

   <b>POLYCLINIC IN YISHUN CENTRAL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b> asked the Minister for Health (a) when will the construction of the polyclinic in Yishun Central, opposite Blk 647 be completed; (b) whether and why there is a delay in the construction; and (c) when will the polyclinic be opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> The Ministry had originally planned to build a polyclinic in Yishun Central. However, this plan has been changed arising from one of the recommendations of the Review Committee on National Health Policies. The Review Committee recommended that the Government should consider some alternative approaches to primary care provision, such as building multi-purpose clinics for leasing out to GPs. Such multi-purpose clinics or "medical centres", besides providing clinic suites for doctors, would also provide support services like laboratory, X-ray, pharmacy and health related retail shops, thus serving as a "one-stop" medical centre for the convenience of patients. In addition, GPs working in the medical centre could pool their resources and offer a wider range of services, for example, opening not only evening clinics, but perhaps, even 24-hour clinics, and providing house-call services, etc. By pooling resources, individual GPs would also have more time to upgrade themselves through attending continuing medical education programmes. Another aspect of this purpose-built medical centre is that, by leasing it out only to doctors and related services, they need not compete for the tender with suppliers of non-medical services. Since the building in Yishun Central was already under construction, it offered the earliest opportunity for a pilot project to be carried out. We expect the Yishun Central medical centre to be operational in January 1994. My Ministry will continue to provide primary health services for Yishun residents in the existing Sembawang Outpatient Dispensary and Sembawang and Mandai Maternal and Child Health Clinics.

The development of branch libraries is under the purview of the Ministry of Information and the Arts. MITA has informed me that the building of new branch libraries is being reviewed by the Library 2000 Review Committee formed in June 1992. The Committee is reviewing the role of the National Library and will recommend guidelines and models for the development of future branch libraries in due course. MITA will finalise the types of libraries to be built and their locations after studying the recommendations of the Library 2000 Review Committee.
