<div align="center"><b>(Secret ballot on union representation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for

Finance   (a)   whether   he   has   received    any

representations  from  the Singapore  Federation  of

Unions  of Government Employees requesting a  secret

ballot  among  all Government employees  other  than

teachers, senior



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



officers and daily-rated personnel, with a  view  to

ascertaining  whether  the  majority  wish   to   be

represented  by unions affiliated to the  Federation or to the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees; and

(b) what action he proposes to take in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a secret

ballot  of  employees  is  usually  taken  where  an

employer   refuses  to  accept  an   invitation   to

negotiate on grounds that he does not recognise  the

union.  Where there are two or more unions  claiming

representation for the same group of  employees  and

the  matter cannot be resolved in any other  way,  a

secret ballot can then be taken with the consent  of

the  unions concerned. The Singapore Government  has

carried on and is carrying on negotiations with  the

unions  affiliated  to the Singapore  Federation  of

Unions  of  Government  Employees.  No  question  of

recognition  therefore arises. A  secret  ballot  on

which union is to represent which grade of employees

does not, therefore, arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, would the Minister agree that

rivalry  between these two unions for membership  of

Government   employees   is   unhealthy?   For   the

unification of the trade union movement in the civil

service,  does  he  not consider it  appropriate  to

accede to the request of the Federation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is

rivalry  not only between unions affiliated  to  the

Federation,  hut also between member unions  of  the

Federation  themselves. For instance, a stenographer

employed  in  the  Broadcasting  Division   of   the

Ministry  of Culture is eligible for membership  and

can  be  represented  by one of  three  unions -   the Singapore  Government  Administrative  and  Clerical Services  Union,  the  Singapore  Secretarial  Staff Union, and the Department of Broadcasting Employees' Union. I think in these matters, Sir, it is best  to leave  questions of representation and  negotiations

to the employees and their unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, could

I  have a reply to my question? It is this: Does the

Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



not  consider  that  it  would  be  helpful  to  the

unification of the trade union movement in the civil

service if he were to accede to the request  of  the

Federation  for  a  secret  ballot  to  see  whether

A.U.P.E. or   the  Federation  should   have   the

membership?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not think a secret ballot

will  solve  anything. One of the  requests  of  the

Federation  is  that if they should win  the  secret

ballot, then they ask the Government to require  the

A.U.P.E. to amend its rules so that they would  not

be  able to recruit Government employees. This  same

request  was made by the Federation of City  Council

Labour Unions during the last strike, and we pointed

out  quite clearly to them that it is not within the

power  of  the  Government to require any  union  to

amend its laws in the way that the Government thinks

fit.  Therefore, whether or not a secret  ballot  is

carried   out,   whether  or  not   the   Government

recognises  one  union  or  the  other,  the  unions

concerned  will continue to exist, will continue  to

recruit  members, and will continue to compete  with

each other.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The problem only rises when we

refuse recognition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The problem arises only, when as

I  have mentioned before, we refuse recognition to a

particular union.

<div align="center"><b>WATER SITUATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I want

to report to the House on the water situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy rainfall over the whole Island in the past 10

days, including 4.32 inches for Tuesday, the 16th of

January,  alone,  has brought  water  stock  in  our

Singapore Reservoirs to full capacity, Rainfall  for

the  month of January up to yesterday, 24th January,

has been 14.95 inches as against the January average

of 9  inches for the last 86 years. This has  enabled

the  Water  Department temporarily to lift rationing

and  to supply our total consumer needs solely  from

our   Singapore  Reservoirs.  This  will  also  take

advantage  of  the Singapore rains while  conserving

stocks in our Johore Reservoirs which are still  low

because  there were no correspondingly  heavy  rains

there in the last fortnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the general situation of our total stocks

is  not altogether satisfactory. About two-thirds of

our  water  stocks are in our Johore  Reservoirs  of

Pontian and Gunong Pulai and these are only  53  per

cent  of  the  full capacity, making a 47  per  cent

shortage.   However,  in  expectation   of   further

rainfall for the rest of January and normal rainfall

for February rationing is being lifted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Water Department does not expect water

rationing to become necessary again unless a drought

were  to recur later in the year. Everyone can  help

by  checking  waste  either in homes  or  at  public

standpipes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the summary of the figures for the Johore

reservoirs,  which  I propose  to  table,  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gunong Pulai, total capacity, 1,220 million

gallons: shortage, 550 million gallons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pontian, maximum capacity, 2,525 million gallons:

shortage, 1,218 million gallons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I understood the

Prime  Minister to say that he is now  drawing  from

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



stocks, for the total supply for Singapore would  be

assure  the House that the stocks that go  into  the

consumer taps are properly and adequately treated?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I think it is the duty of

both  the  Water Department and the City Analyst  to

ensure  that Members of this Assembly and the public

generally  can  continue to enjoy the  privilege  of

living  in Singapore which is one of the few  cities

in  South-East Asia where you can consume water  off

the tap.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Original Question, as amended,

was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, in pursuance of the national objective of a

united Malayan nation, enlarged and strengthened  by

the   addition  of  our  brothers  in   the   Borneo

principle  for  the  plan  proposed  by  the   Prime

Minister  of  the Federation of Malaya, Tunku  Abdul

Rahman  Putra Al-Haj, and agreed to in principle  in

the Federation Parliament on 18th October, 1961, for

the  establishment  of the Federation  of  Malaysia,

comprising   the  eleven  States  of   the   present

<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I spoke on this motion in this  House

yesterday. Before concluding, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



said  that  the  Barisan Sosialis had  one  failing,

i.e., they are unable to distinguish clearly who are

the  colonialists and who are the nationalists.  The

Barisan  Sosialis  think that the  nationalists  are

also  colonialists.  They are confused  between  the

two. That is why their position is isolated today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have another

failing, i.e., they are shortsighted. They  try  all

ways  and  means  to  attack the nationalists   - even

harder   than   the  attack  they   level   at   the

colonialists.  This is a very great  shortcoming  of

theirs. They hope that the nationalists will come to

a   united  front  with  them.  But  they  stab  the

nationalists  behind their backs. For  example,  the

Member  for  Queenstown  said  yesterday  that   the

Federation  of Malaya is attracted to  the  Malaysia

plan because perhaps of the oil resources in Brunei,

where  the  revenue  is high. In fact,  the  revenue

there  exceeds expenditure so much that there  is  a

great surplus of money which will be helpful to the

Federation  of  Malaya. According to  him,  this  is

perhaps  the  only  true appeal  that  the  Malaysia

concept has for the Federation of Malaya. This  talk

is  very bad because he is trying to treat the Tunku

as  an  exploiter.  He tried to say  that  when  two

countries   wish  to  merge,  it  is   a   case   of

exploitation of one by the other. This kind of  talk

will  only  further separate the people of  the  two

territories. It will not bring peace to the  people:

instead  it  will bring disaster. We in  the  P.A.P.

have  a  different concept of Malaysia than that  of

the Barisan Sosialis. We take into consideration the

interest of the broad masses of the people. But  the

attitude'  of the Barisan Sosialis towards  Malaysia

is in the interest of the colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the Barisan Sosialis are in

such a position that they are surrounded by enemies.

They  hope to be able to defeat the P.A.P. in  order

to  gain power so that they can collaborate with the

British colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown raised three points

yesterday  in his speech with regard to the  British

colonialists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



This  was reported in the Sin Chew Jit Poh. He  said

the question confronting us is not merely to get rid

of  the  British. I think the people will understand

their  hidden  intention behind this  statement.  He

continued to say - as is reported in the Sin Chew  Jit

Poh - that  the British hoped that the people  of  the

Borneo territories would be divided and fight  among

themselves,  with  the  result  that  the   colonial

influence would be forgotten for the time  being  by

them.  At  the  beginning the Barisan Sosialis  said

that  the  question of the British  colonialists  no

longer exists. The second point they raised was that

it  is  the hope of the British to divide the people

of the Borneo territories. This kind of talk is very

inconsistent.  The P.A.P. want to  merge  all  these

territories into a very strong Malaysian nation, but

the Barisan Sosialis say that it is the intention of

the   British   to  divide  the  people   in   these

territories.  If this is so, how can they  say  that

the  P.A.P. are trying to sell out the interest  of

the people in this region? As far as we can see, the

leaders  of the Barisan Sosialis are suffering  from

shortsightedness.  They  seem  to  be  standing   on

Clifford Pier from where they can see monkeys coming

across the sea from Indonesia. They then run quickly

to Geylang Serai to say that the enemies are landing

and  that the Dutch military forces are slaughtering

the  Indonesian people. They are trying to  describe

the present situation in Indonesia as a very serious

situation in order to agitate innocent womenfolk  to

go  to the battlefield in Indonesia. The leaders  of

the Barisan Sosialis are just keeping quiet. Instead

of doing something, they are shouting slogans on the

stage.  Such  an attitude is incompatible  with  the

interest of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I can see today that the Barisan

Sosialis  are  suffering from a very great  mistake.

They  have many theories and many slogans, but these

are at variance with the dialectical materialism  of

Karl  Marx. We know that in the view of Marx, resort

must  be  made to practical moves. The understanding

of   the   human   being  is  very  important.   The

experiences of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



human  being  must  depend  on  his  production   in

material wealth in order that he can understand  the

natural   resources.  The  leaders  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  only  know  how to shout  slogans  on  the

stage. They know how to talk about theories.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> On a point of order.

Mr  Speaker,  I understood that we were  discussing

Malaysia  and  not  the  failings  of  the   Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Parliamentary Secretary is

replying  to  certain arguments put forward  by  the

Member  for Queenstown, which in themselves  went  a

bit  far  away from the motion, then I think  he  is

entitled  to  answer those points, but  not  in  too

great detail, of course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am now concentrating on the points raised by  the

Member   for   Queenstown   which   I   think    are

unreasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I was saying that the Members of the

Barisan  Sosialis  have a lot  of  theories  without

being able to understand the actual requirements  of

the  people. They went to Geylang Serai in order  to

get the support of the Malays there. They appear  to

be friends of the Malays. They wish to appear to the

Malays  that  they  are  very  courageous  in  their

struggle  against colonialism. They try to create  a

false impression in the minds of the Malays. On  the

one  hand, they try to get the support of the  Prime

Minister of the Federation, but, on the other  hand,

they  attack him in many ways. They treat the Malays

in   the  Federation  in  the  same  way  that   the

Manchurians tried to conquer China. This will  widen

the  gulf  between the people of Singapore  and  the

Federation with no benefit to them. For example,  in

the speeches of the Member for Queenstown, stress is

often  laid on the fact that Singapore and the other

territories should merge with Indonesia.  But  their

real  intention  is  not  a reunification  of  these

territories  with Indonesia because they  understand

that the present ruler of Indonesia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



is   President  Soekarno.  They  think   that   when

Indonesia falls into the hands of the Reds with  the

fall  of  President Soekarno, it would then  be  the

proper  time  to  include these territories  in  the

Indonesian Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to quote what the

Member  for  Queenstown said. This  appears  on  the

fifth page of the Sin Chew Jit Poh: of yesterday:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As socialists, we are in support of more and more

people  in  various countries uniting  together.  We

want  to have more countries united together in  the

interest of the people building a socialist  country

with a socialist economic development.'



<br><br>We  in  the  P.A.P. are trying  to  bring  about  a

reunification of these territories in  the  form  of

Malaysia in order to create a greater nation with  a

stronger economic unit.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, what is before us today is not the

problem  of whether this or that Party is  going  to

survive and run the government of Singapore but  the

future  of  10  million people whose destiny  is  at

stake and whose fate is in the balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya

first  mooted  the idea, there were  rumblings  from

various  quarters  particularly from  the  Communist

front organisations, that the conception of Malaysia

was   the  brainchild  of  British  colonialism  and

British  vested  interests.  These  Communist  front

organisations went even so far as to  say  that  the

Tunku  had  connived with the British in  presenting

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, Sir, events have proved to the

contrary.   The  Malaysia  Solidarity   Consultative

Committee   in  their  deliberations  in  Jesselton,

Kuching and Kuala Lumpur, have in no uncertain terms

bared the falsehoods and lies of the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British colonialism is on its last legs in this

part of the world. It is on the way out. The British

know it, the Communists know it, and we know it.  At

the  same  time, we all know that with the departure

of the British colonial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



power,  there will be left a vacuum in this  region.

The  Communists and their allies, with their  tongue

in  their  cheek,  say that it  will  be  filled  by

another form of colonialism - the colonialism  of  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is hardly necessary for me to say that

neither the Tunku nor his erstwhile colleagues  have

any territorial ambitions. However, we who belong to

the  democratic forces have no doubts in  our  minds

that  unless  something is done - and done  quickly - to

fill  this  vacuum, the Communists  will  get  there

first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight for Malaysia is a fight against time. It

is a fight for the survival of democracy against the

evil   forces   of   Communist   dictatorship.   The

Communists are no fools. They are aware of it.  That

is why they are using every means in their power, by

infiltration, intimidation and persuasion, to  wreck

the  Malaysia Plan. They are fighting for time  too.

They are not ready to take over now but they hope to

do   so  as  soon  as  they  have  marshalled  their

Communist  front organisations and  dupes  in  these

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not say that the Communists are the only

forces  which  are against Malaysia, but  I  dc  say

this, that they are the biggest force with which the

people of Malaysia will have to contend. Even in the

Borneo  territories, the leaders there have  a  fair

idea  of  what  will  happen  to  them  should   the

Communists  succeed.  In  fact,  the  few  who   are

apprehensive about Malaysia are those who fear  that

with  the coming of Malaysia the Communist front  in

Singapore will infiltrate into their territories and

make life a misery for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the fears expressed and it is a very

genuine   one.  For  this  very  reason,  Sir,   the

Temanggong Juga of Iban and other leaders from Sabah

and  Sarawak insisted that they would very much like

to  control  migration in the respective territories

after  Malaysia,  The people of  Sabah,  Brunei  and

Sarawak  are fully aware of the dangers of Communism

and Communist infiltration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



They know that for them to survive there is no

other alternative but to join hands with their  kith

and  kin  in  Malaya  and  Singapore  in  a  greater

federation  and  together  unfold  a  new   era   of

prosperity and happiness for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like now to touch on some

of  the  points raised by the leader of the  Barisan

Sosialis   in  his  speech  yesterday.  Merger   and

Malaysia mean an enslavement of the people  and  the

spread  of  injustice and inequality,  so  said  the

leader  of the Barisan Sosialis. Sir, [do  not  know

how  the Member has arrived, at this conclusion.  If

he  had  taken the Federation of Malaya today  as  a

guide for the things to come in the future Malaysia,

then he is completely wrong. And it is a mischievous

and  a misleading statement to make. Malaya has been

independent  for nearly 4½ years. It has  proved  to

the world that amongst the new nations in post World

War  II it .is a shining example of a country  where

justice,  equality, and freedom  of  the  individual

prevail.  Malaya has not reached the stage and  will

not   reach  the  stage  of  some  countries   where

political  opponents are just lugged into prison  to

satisfy the whims of the ruling Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about enslavement, injustice and

inequality,  the  Member for  Thomson,  who  was  my

fellow  traveller  to the Kuching  conference,  will

certainly bear me out when I say that in the  Borneo

States  the  ra'ayat,  particularly  the  indigenous

people, have not had a square deal from the colonial

regime.  Injustice, inequality, and enslavement  are

phases  which  could  be applied  to  the  state  of

affairs  in some of the Borneo territories. Colonial

power  which came to Sarawak in 1941, in  Brunei  in

1888, and in Sabah in 1878, had done very little  to

uplift  the  standard of living  of  the  indigenous

people.  When  the  British first  went  there,  the

Dayaks,  the  Ibans,  the Malays,  the  Muruts,  the

Bajaus, the Melanaus, the Dusuns, were all living in

attap  huts.  Today, Sir, after decades of  colonial

administration applied to the people,  they  are  no

better.  So, when the leader of the Barisan Sosialis

talks of injustice,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



inequality, and enslavement in the future  Malaysia,

he  should,  first  of all, take  a  peep  into  the

conditions that prevail in the Borneo States. I know

he  has been there, Sir, but perhaps he has not used

his eyes wisely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Malaysia, says the Barisan leader, would

mean  the transfer of power from the British to  the

Federation  with the British the back-seat  drivers.

Sir,  I  do  not see the logic of this argument.  We

have  repeatedly said in this House  - and so has  the

Tunku  elsewhere - that  Malaysia,  like  the  present

Federation  of  Malaya,  will  be  a  free  and   an

independent  country.  There will  be  no  back-seat

drivers. All the drivers in the future Malaysia will

come  from  the  people of Malaysia, and  they  will

occupy  front  seats, except perhaps the  Communists

who  in an open conflict with the nationalist forces

would prefer to remain back-seat drivers and let the

stooges do the fighting for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point has also been raised, within the

context  of  this argument, of the story of  nuclear

weapons  in  Singapore and the defence  treaty  with

Britain,   and   how   these   arrangements    would

automatically place the population in the front line

in  any  nuclear war. I myself do not  know  whether

there  are nuclear weapons stored in Singapore.  But

let  me tell the Barisan leader and his friends that

in  the  event  of  a nuclear war erupting  in  this

region, the front line would not be confined to  the

population  of Singapore alone, but the whole  world

would be involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, mud-slinging and smearing are all effective

weapons for those who have no argument left. And  so

the Barisan Sosialis leaders, having come to the end

of  their  resources,  now  indulge  in  this  dirty

pastime. The Tunku says that their leader, that  is,

the  Member for Queenstown, has a pathological  fear

of  the  Chinese  in Singapore,  and  hence  he  has

categorically   stated  that  he  would   not   have

Singapore  without  the Borneo States.  The  reason,

according to the Barisan, is the desire of the Tunku

to  have  a  preponderance of the indigenous  people

over the Chinese. In fact, Sir, this statement is an

accusation that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



Tunku  is anti-Chinese. Now, nothing can be  further

from  the truth. My friend and colleague, the Member

for Cairnhill, has already dealt with this point and

I will not elaborate on it. But let me say this, and

let me explain, if an explanation is needed, why the

Tunku  made  that statement. It is  not  because  he

fears  the  preponderance of the Chinese. Even  with

the Borneo territories thrown in, the proportion  of

racial  representation in Malaysia would be  42  per

cent indigenous, which would include the Malays,  38

per   cent   Chinese,  10  per  cent   Indians   and

Pakistanis, and 10 per cent others. Sir, knowing the

speed  of  propagation of our Chinese  brothers  and

sisters,  I  think it would not be long before  they

catch  up with the Malays and even beat them. If  we

are  to fight Communism in Malaysia, we cannot fight

them  in pockets. The problem must be tackled  as  a

whole.   Just   as  Malaysia  without   the   Borneo

territories  cannot work; so also  Malaysia  without

Singapore cannot be effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, let me once again say to the Barisan boys:

our Tunku is not anti-Chinese, nor is he communal in

his  attitude  towards  the  basic  problems  facing

Malaysia.  But  it is obvious to all that  the  very

fact  that  the Barisan has chosen to propound  this

line of argument only goes to prove the strength  of

Chinese  chauvinism that permeates  and  guides  the

thoughts and minds of the Barisan leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown, Sir, has also laboured

at  great length on the apprehensions of the  people

of  Borneo  towards Malaysia. He  said  the  Sarawak

United  People's  Party and  the  Party  Ra'ayat  of

Brunei wanted self-determination first before having

anything  to  do with Malaysia. Perhaps the  Barisan

boys  can tell me who are the guiding lights of  the

S.U.P.P. and who are their supporters, and from what

group  do they come. Are the Party Ra'ayat  and  the

S.U.P.P. the only political Parties in  the  Borneo

States? Does the Member for Queenstown know  or  has

he  heard  of  the Brunei United Party,  the  Brunei

National Organisation -

repeat again. There is the Brunei United Party,  the

Organisation, the Pemuda of Sarawak, the Malay Union

Sir, the Barisan boys can only -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the expression "Barisan

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have attended many of the meetings of these

organisations. I have met some of their leaders  who

are not only respectable citizens in their own right

but also patriots who love freedom and independence.

But   I   can   say  this  explicitly  and   without

contradiction, that they have not only  as  a  group

but  in  some cases individually a bigger  following

than  the Sarawak United People's Party. So  let  me

advise  the  Barisan  Members,  when  they  talk  of

Malaysia  in  the context of the Borneo  territories - let   them  not  forget  that  the  Sarawak  United

People's  Party is not the only political  Party  in

Sarawak.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on West Irian, the Member

for  Thomson had occasion to mention the  conception

of  Greater  Malaysia which would include Indonesia,

the  Philippines, the Borneo States,  Singapore  and

Malaya.  Yesterday the Member for  Queenstown  again

extolled  the same conception. Sir, I  do  not  know

what  game the Barisan are playing. Are they  really

serious  about this? Are they trying to  delude  the

people  into believing that they support this  idea?

Perhaps. Sir, I should mention here that the Greater

Malaysia  plan was first mooted in the early  1930s.

The  idea caught on until it came out in one of  the

platforms  of  the Malay National Party,  or  M.N.P.

after World War II.

interested in that statement, Sir. Could the  Member

indicate who first initiated that concept? And where

can I find documentation for it?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> I am coming to that, Sir, but I

do not think I would like to mention the name of the

gentleman  who first mooted the idea. It  came  from

the    Philippines.    Anyway,    politically    and

economically it was an idea acceptable to the  Malay

masses.  But do the Barisan really know the  primary

objective   of  the  conception  of  this  so-called

Greater  Malaysia? I will tell you, Sir,It  was  an

anti-Chinese move. It was a move which emanated from

certain  national  leaders in  South-East  Asia  who

feared  the  insurgence of Chinese in the  Malaysian

world.  Sir,  had  they known about  this  so-called

Greater Malaysia, I am sure the idea would not be as

attractive  to them now as it was before.  And  yet.

Mr  Speaker,  they have the cheek to say  that  the

Tunku  is  anti-Chinese when he refused to  consider

the concept of this Greater Malaysia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when winding up his speech, the Barisan leader

said that Malaysia is a British-sponsored project. I

will not attempt to deny this allegation. But to end

up my speech, I will say this to the Barisan Members

and to all those who are anti-Malaysia. The question

I would like to put to them is this. "Do you want to

run  your country yourselves or do you want  to  let

the Communists run it for you? If you want to run it

yourselves, then the only answer is Malaysia."



<br><br>3.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  come  to  deal  with  the

gnashing  of  teeth  and  breast-beating  that   the

Barisan  Sosialis have indulged in on the  question

of  Malaysia,  I  think it is necessary  for  me  to

outline the case for Malaysia insofar as it concerns

the  ordinary  people.  The  Barisan  Sosialis  have

talked a great deal about Malaysia, either from  the

point  of  view of this or that political  Party  or

leader.  We  have  talked of Malaysia  in  terms  of

ideologies - freedom    versus    despotism,     anti-colonialism  versus  imperialism,  democracy  versus

autocracy,  socialism versus communism, and  so  on.

Sir, I am not saying that these different ideologies

are not relevant to the issue of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in our preoccupation with the

ideological  and political aspects of  Malaysia,  in

our  preoccupation  with party  interests,  we  have

perhaps not laid enough stress on why the problem of

Malaysia  is  important to the 10  million  ordinary

people who will comprise it. They are not interested

in  these  problems. They want to know.  "What  does

Malaysia mean to me?" Therefore, to the ordinary man

in  Borneo,  Brunei, Sarawak, Singapore and  Malaya,

the  first question that will come to his  mind  and

the  first  question that he will ask is, "Why  have

Malaysia'? Why cannot we go on as we have  done  for

many  decades?" He will ask, "What do I get  out  of

Malaysia?" Then the next question he will ask - he  is

the  man who has to decide whether Malaysia is  good

or  bad  for  him - is:  "In what  way  will  Malaysia

benefit me?" The ordinary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



man  who  has  to look for a job and  care  for  his

family, will ask, "In what way will Malaysia benefit

me,  my  wife and my children?" He will ask,  "Would

life be better off or worse off for me and my family

if  there  were no Malaysia?" It is important,  Sir,

that  throughout the discussion  - we  will  later  on

come  to  the ideological aspect - not to forget  this

aspect  of  the matter  - what Malaysia means  to  the

ordinary man. In what way is it going to affect  his

life,  for  better or for worse?  If  we  keep  that

viewpoint  in mind all the time, then much  of  this

ideological  and other discourses  will  be  put  in

their proper perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can show that Malaysia is inevitable because

it is desirable, and that the ordinary people - the 10

million in the live territories - have much to gain in

the way of economic livelihood, political stability,

security  and  social progress under Malaysia,  then

the   opposition  to  Malaysia  voiced  on  whatever

grounds is really being done at the expense  of  the

livelihood of 10 million people; that is to say, not

political  Parties, not ideologies. The  stakes  are

the livelihood of 10 million people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, therefore, begin by attempting to answer

the  first question: "Why have Malaysia'? Why cannot

we  go  on as we are?" Sir, the first point to  note

about Malaysia is that it is not something which  we

are  going to create out of thin air. Lots of us are

talking  about Malaysia as if it does not exist:  as

if  we  are going to start from scratch. But I  say,

Sir, the basis for Malaysia already exists. Malaysia

is not something which was built out of thin air. It

exists.  It  has  already been  created  for  us  by

British colonialism. The five States of Malaysia - the

Federation,  Singapore.  Brunei,  Sabah  (or   North

Borneo)  and  Sarawak  - have been run by the  British

more or less as an integrated trading, financial and

administrative  unit.  The  trade  of   these   five

territories is interdependent. That is important  to

remember.  The prosperity of these five  territories

today  is interdependent. For example, Sir, in 1960,

some 32 per cent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



of  the total exports of these five territories were

with  one  another. That is, more than one-third  of

the  trade  of  these  five  territories  was  among

themselves. Similarly, Sir, some 32 per cent of  the

total  imports were again from among members of  the

Malaysia  group.  So in so far as one-third  of  the

total  imports  and exports are concerned,  they  do

export  to  and  import from one  another.  To  that

extent,  it is an interdependent economic  unit.  To

that  extent, Malaysia exists. In fact, Sir,  inter-trading is not only on a substantial scale but it is

also  an essential feature of their trading pattern.

These  close  trading links were maintained  by  the

unifying administration of British colonialism. Even

after  the  grant of independence to the  Federation

and  partial internal self-government to  Singapore,

these trade links have not been appreciably loosened

because    the   Borneo   territories   are    still

administered  by the British. For example,  Sir,  in

1960,  Singapore exported over $10 million worth  of

goods to North Borneo alone. So to that extent, Sir,

Malaysia is not something we are going to create out

of  thin  air. It exists. The problem is not whether

we  want  to create Malaysia but whether we wish  to

retain  the interdependence which has been of mutual

benefit to all of these territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more important than trade is the unifying

influence  of a common currency. Thanks to  a  sound

financial  structure and monetary stability  in  the

five territories, the Straits dollar today enjoys  a

prestige,   confidence  and  value  as   few   other

currencies do in the whole of South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the iniquities of British colonialism, it

has  created  a unified trade and monetary  pattern.

Intelligent nationalists, who are really  interested

in  the fate of 10 million people  - 10 million people

whose   jobs   and   livelihood  depend   upon   the

continuance of the interdependence both of trade and

a  unified currency  - and not interested in their own

political  future and whether or not they are  going

to  be the government, such intelligent nationalists

and socialists should use this interdependence as  a

basis for building a more just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



and  equal society in Malaysia. If any one of us are

really  interested in the welfare and livelihood  of

these  10  million people, then we  should  maintain

this interdependence and use it to build and shape a

more just and equitable society that we all want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the liquidation of colonialism does not mean

the  liquidation  of  all the creations  of  Western

imperialism  - all the things that Western imperialism

brought  in  its train, whether they  be  scientific

techniques,  health  and  social  welfare  measures,

modern   methods   of  economic   organisation   and

development,   and   the   unification   of   pocket

principalities  into  an  integrated   trading   and

monetary  pattern. When we talk of the inevitability

of  Malaysia,  we  work on the assumption  that  the

ordinary man will not lose something to destroy  his

own livelihood. That is the basis when we say it  is

inevitable, because we believe that the  people  are

not  so stupid as to destroy something on which they

depend  for their livelihood and for their survival.

Therefore,  Sir,  the urge towards  Malaysia  arises

from  the  realisation that in the  context  of  the

Asian  revolution the British must pull out  of  the

Borneo  territories as well as Singapore as colonial

overlords.  That again is an inevitable  process  of

history. Sooner or later, the British must pull out.

It  is  also inevitable that when the choice  comes,

the  10  million people, who are not  interested  in

standing for election either in Singapore or in  the

Federation,  will say, "How is this unified  trading

and  monetary  structure to be  preserved  once  the

British pull out the other unifying force? Who is to

replace that force?" Therefore, Sib, the rising tide

of anti-colonialism in this region makes the retreat

of  British  colonialism inevitable and the  British

know it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, only a few weeks ago the British

Prime  Minister reminded his people that his country

was  no longer a first-class power and that it could

no  longer  play the dominant role it  once  did  in

world  affairs.  Therefore, the indications  plainly

are that whether she likes it or not Britain will be

forced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



to   give  in  to  anti-colonial  pressure  in   the

Malaysian region, including Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the problem for the 10 million ordinary

people  who are not interested in ideologies,  party

conflicts, colonialism versus democracy, imperialism

versus autocracy, is this. All they want to know  is

how  to  retain  the  unifying  influence  that  the

British exerted in this region'? Who is to fill  the

unifying  role  that  Britain once  played  in  the

Malaysia  region? Or are we, as the Barisan Sosialis

hope  and  fight for, to break Malaysia into  small,

isolated and contending units'? The consequences  of

Balkanisation of Malaysia should be obvious to  even

the   meanest  of  intelligence,  the   meanest   of

Marxists, whether they are Groucho Marxists or Harpo

Marxists.  It  should ha obvious to  them  that  the

Balkanisation   of   Malaysia  into   self-governing

independent units must inevitably mean the  break-up

of  the  existing financial and trading  pattern  in

Malaysia.   That  is  so  obvious  that  we   cannot

therefore  understand how the Barisan Sosialis  (not

so long ago they were for Malaysia in principle, but

yesterday it was quite clear they were out to  break

up  Malaysia) propose to ensure to 10 million people

that   the  unifying  influence  which  the  British

exerted  here  to  a common trading  policy,  and  a

common economic pattern, is to be retained to ensure

their economic survival. Balkanisation must mean the

dislocation of trade between these territories  from

whose disastrous consequences none of the 10 million

people  can  escape. Once you break up  the  trading

pattern,   the  consequences  will  be   felt   from

Jesselton  to Kuala Lumpur. As independent  economic

units, each of these territories will enter a period

of bitter economic and trade rivalry to ensure their

survival.  Only  there can be no  survival  but  the

gradual impoverishment and exhaustion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as I shall show later, Sir, we submit

that  the Barisan Sosialis want such a situation  in

the  whole of the Borneo territories. Their exaction

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- impoverishment. Because that is the soil on which

Communism can flourish.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



I  charge that the Barisan Sosialis are deliberately

bringing about this situation knowing full well that

the  consequences  of  it would  mean  the  economic

impoverishment  and disruption of  thits  territory.

That  is  exactly what they want. I shall  show  the

reason  why  they  want to break  up  and  balkanise

Malaysia  to create a vast slum extending  from  the

Federation  to  the  North Borneo  territories.  For

example,  Sir,  if we accept the contention  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis that Malaysia should be  thwarted,

that   instead  of  Malaysia  we  should  have  five

independent   territories,  self-determination   for

these  territories, what answer  have  they  to  the

simple day-to-day problems which will arise the  day

the five territories break up? What, for example, is

to  happen  to the single currency system  that  now

obtains  when independence comes to these countries?

If there are going to be independent territories, is

it suggested that each of these States - North Borneo,

Brunei, Sarawak, Singapore and the Federation - should

each  issue their own currency and follow their  own

monetary policies? If that is the case, what then is

to  happen  to  the Straits dollar which  is  highly

valued  throughout South-East Asia? It  is  more  or

less  the common currency throughout South-East Asia

and   as  highly  valued  as  the  American  dollar,

primarily  because  it  happens  to  be  the  common

currency   of  five  of  the  most  prosperous   and

politically stable countries in South-East Asia. Any

merchant  will  tell you that a  Straits  dollar  is

valuable  for  legitimate as  well  as  illegitimate

trading  in the whole of South-East Asia. The  break

up  of  the  Straits  dollar into  five  independent

currencies, which is inevitable if you do  not  have

Malaysia,  is more likely to hit Singapore  hardest,

because   it  is  the  heart  of  Malaysian   trade.

Ambitious     political    leaders     and     great

revolutionaries might find comfort  in  the  thought

that in a balkanised and impoverished Malaysia, they

can  still  boast  that there  will  be  five  Prime

Ministers,  five  Foreign  Ministers,  five  Finance

Ministers and five of every kind of Ministers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Five Navy, Army and Air Forces.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, five Navy, Army and Air

Forces,    and    even   five   internal    security

arrangements,  but only at the cost of  turning  out

five  different currencies of doubtful value. I need

not  point to the consequences of that. The  logical

conclusion  that  must follow from the  break-up  of

Malaysia is that if the Straits dollar is broken up,

the  consequences  for the trader,  the  worker  and

other wage-earners are too obvious to mention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the States of Malaysia are balkanised in any

case, their independence would be both temporary and

precarious. They must sooner or later come under the

influence   of   new  and  stronger   overlords.   A

balkanised Malaysia will be a derelict empire  ready

for   occupation   by  any  freebooting   power   or

adventurer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia, therefore, is obvious and inevitable.

That  is  what  we  mean  when  we  keep  on  saying

inevitable, a word which exasperated the Member  for

Queenstown   - because you refuse to believe  that  10

million  people  would commit economic  suicide  and

ensure  their impoverishment by destroying something

which   already  exists  and  which  ensures   their

prosperity,  such as it is. Malaysia is the  obvious

and  inevitable answer to the question: "Who  is  to

fill the vacuum created by the evacuation of British

colonialism?"  The answer is: "The five  territories

collectively."  That is the essence of  Malaysia.  A

vacuum must be created sooner or later and therefore

that  vacuum must be filled collectively by the five

territories.  Malaysia  will  provide  the  unifying

influence  once  exerted by the British;  only  this

time it will be a unification in the interests of an

independent Malaysia instead of British colonialism.

Malaysia,  by preventing the balkanisation  of  this

area,  will  ensure  the  political  integrity   and

independence of these States as well as  maintaining

their economic prosperity and financial stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall not, at this point, deal with the real

reasons why the Barisan Sosialis have become fervent

advocates



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



of  balkanisation. All I want to point out  is  that

they  are not the socialists that they claim to  be,

that  they are really anti-nationalists in resisting

Malaysia.  As nationalists the obvious  and  logical

thing   for  them  to  do  is  to  strive  for   the

preservation of the territorial unity of States that

once formed part of an empire, simply because in the

contemporary  world of super States  and  contending

great  powers,  larger political and economic  units

have  a  greater survival value. It is obviously  in

the interest of the 10 million people of Malaysia to

preserve the territorial integrity and unity of  the

five States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only a few days ago the Barisan Sosialis were

pleading  for the territorial integrity of Indonesia

by  demanding the return of West Irian to Indonesia.

We  think it is a very laudable thing. We, like  the

Barisan  Sosialis, regard West Irian as an  integral

part  of Indonesia primarily because it was part  of

the  Dutch  Empire. We no more wish to see Indonesia

balkanised by the Dutch colonialists than we wish to

see Malaysia balkanised by the Barisan Sosialis -  the

Dutchmen of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, if the British colonialists have been

able  to  govern Malaysia for decades as  a  unified

administration,  we, the nationalists  of  Malaysia,

should  be  as capable and as eager to provide  this

area  with  a  unified administration ourselves.  In

other words, Sir, what we are saying is: you do  not

have  to  create Malaysia. All we ask  is  that  the

nationalists  in  the interest  of  the  10  million

people  should  preserve  an  administration   which

already exists. Let us work that administration.  It

is  a  measure of the kind of Stone Age thinking  of

the Barisan Sosialis that they should brand attempts

to  prevent  the balkanisation of Malaysia  as  neo-colonialism and reactionary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, as socialists, we should not only

welcome, but also work hard to preserve the economic

unity  of  Malaysia  in order to  ensure  the  rapid

economic  advance of its peoples and to develop  the

potentialities  of  the 10 million  people.  As  you

know, modern economic planning and development is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



likely to be more rapid and more effective in  large

and  populous geographical areas. That is the  basis

today  of  modem economic development.  We  have  to

think  in  terms  of larger economic  and  political

units.  Malaysia embraces an area of 130,000  square

miles. This is nearly two and a half times as  large

as any individual territory in Malaysia. In terms of

population,  we would have the markets,  the  skills

and the labour power of some 10 million people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an integrated political and economic unit, the

economic  potentialities of Malaysia  are  increased

manifold.   It   can   undertake   development   and

enterprises which the States cannot do individually.

For  example,  it would not be feasible  to  set  up

large   industrial  plants  in  any   one   of   the

territories  because  these  individual  territories

have  no worthwhile markets to offer. But where  the

potential  market for any industry is in the  region

of 10 million people, industrialisation becomes both

worthwhile and rapid. For example, where the  output

of  a steel plant is about 50,000 tons a year, I  am

told that the cost per ton is estimated at $630. But

where the output is 250,000 tons a year, the cost is

reduced to $475 per ton. This is an indication  that

economic  planning  and  industrial  development  in

larger units is economic, more efficient and rapid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic planning and industrial development on a

Malaysian  scale brings other advantages  which  are

denied  where planning and enterprise is on a  State

scale.  As  far  as  capital is concerned,  Malaysia

would  have  the accumulated savings of  10  million

people  and,  because  of the  area  and  population

involved, would also attract foreign capital.  Where

planning is on a Malaysian scale, scarce technicians

and other professional skill can be more efficiently

and fairly distributed. Conversely, the training  of

scarce  technicians, administrators and professional

men can be undertaken cheaply and efficiently. It is

obviously   uneconomic  for   each   of   the   five

territories  to  duplicate  universities,   training

institutes, technical and agricultural schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this by no means exhausts the list of

substantial advantages that the ordinary people will

derive from economic development and planning  on  a

pan-Malaysian scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic, political and financial case for

the  preservation  of Malaysia under  conditions  of

independence is so strong -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt, but

there seems to be an earphone which is being used as

a loudspeaker somewhere. I do not know whether it is

on  the  Opposition  Benches or  in  the  Strangers'

Gallery. Could Members have a look and turn off  the

switches?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the economic, political and

financial  case for the preservation of Malaysia  is

so strong that many of us are wondering why the Marx

Brothers  in  the  Barisan Sosialis  are  trying  to

sabotage  it.  It  is significant that  the  Barisan

Sosialis have never at any time attempted to  refute

the  economic and financial arguments in  favour  of

Malaysia - that  is,  in  matters  that  concern   the

livelihood,  the material and social advancement  of

the  ordinary people. Sir, the Barisan Sosialis  are

the   people  who  talk  every  now  and  then  with

reference to the people and the masses wanting  this

and  that,  the  people are for us, the  people  are

behind us, and so on. They are always talking  about

the  people. Therefore, one would have thought that,

whatever  policies they might pursue, at least  they

would  have  borne in mind the interest  of  the  10

million  masses. How are they going  to  ensure  the

economic livelihood and future of 10 million  people

who  exist today and whose prosperity is due to  the

fact that this is an integrated trading and economic

unit? In fact, Sir, it is necessary not only for the

purpose  of these logical arguments but for  further

arguments  to define here what the Barisan  Sosialis

mean when they talk of the people and the masses. It

is   most  important - as  I  propose  to  define - what

exactly they mean by masses and people. Once we know

exactly what they mean, many of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



double-talk, somersaults and confusion  will  become

clear.  It is my submission that when they  talk  of

"the  masses"  and "the people", they  are  defining

them not in the ordinary meaning of the words but in

the  Communist  or Leninist sense of the  words.  In

fact,  Sir, a great deal of the jargon used  by  the

Barisan Sosialis would be less confusing if we  were

to  accept  the Barisan Sosialis for what it  really

is - a   Communist  front  organisation  working   for

Communist aims and objectives. It is necessary, Sir,

for  us to bear that in mind. The pretence that  the

Barisan  Sosialis  are  a  conglomeration  of   non-Communist,  socialist agrarian reformers  cannot  be

maintained any longer. If we simply call the Barisan

Sosialis  "the  Front"  and give  their  jargon  the

interpretation that trained Communists put on it, we

shall  get  a clearer understanding of the Barisan's

strange  posturings  on many issues,  including  the

issue  of Malaysia. Since the Barisan Sosialis  talk

so often about the masses, the people, the people of

Malaysia, the people of Singapore, the people of the

Federation,  the people of Sarawak,  the  masses  of

Borneo,  it  will help us to understand the  Barisan

Sosialis  dialectical thinking if we ascertain  what

they  mean  when they talk of masses and  people - and

most  important when they talk of masses and  people

in the sense that Lenin has told Communist cadres to

think of the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quote from the great master himself - Selected Works, Vol. 10, pages 286 -287. It is most

important  to  understand this quotation  when  they

talk  of the masses and the people, because it  will

make clear what exactly they mean when they talk  of

the people. This is what Lenin said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to say just a few words about the

meaning  of  the term "masses". The meaning  of  the

term "masses" changes in accordance with the changes

in the character of the struggle [the struggle, Sir,

is the Communist struggle] ... During our revolution

[he  was  then  talking of the  Russian  Revolution]

there  were occasions when several thousand  workers

represented the masses... When the revolution has been

sufficiently prepared [that is, when you  are  ready

to   take  over],  the  term  "masses"  acquires   a

different meaning. Then several thousand workers can

no longer be called masses [that means the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



people  whom  you  called  the  masses  before   the

revolution  cease to be masses when  conditions  are

ripe for the revolution]. The word begins to acquire

a  different meaning. The term "masses"  then  means

the majority: [that means before that it was not the

majority  but when you are ready to take  over  then

the word "masses" means the majority; before that it

might  have been a minority] not merely the majority

of  workers, hut the majority of all the  exploited.

No other meaning can be accepted by a revolutionary;

[that  is  important - no other meaning  of  the  term

"masses" can be accepted by a revolutionary] if  any

other meaning were attached to this word it would be

unintelligible. A very small party is sufficient  to

lead  the masses ... But in order to achieve victory

you must have the sympathy of the masses.'.



<br><br>Therefore,  Sir, when the Barisan Sosialis  talk  of

the  masses  and the people, it might mean  anything

from  13  Barisan  Sosialis Members  to  25  Barisan

Sosialis Party members. They do not mean the  people

as  a whole or even, to quote Lenin, "a majority  of

the people". That is not what they mean by people or

masses. It does not mean the majority. It might even

mean  two  Barisan Sosialis Members can  become  the

masses   at  certain  times.  So  when  the  Barisan

Sosialis talk of the masses, it is quite clear, Sir,

that  they  mean all those who support  the  Barisan

Sosialis or the Communists: those are the masses. In

fact,  Sir, in another of his works, Vol.  6,  pages

70 - 71,  Lenin has dismissed the will of the majority

as  irrelevant  when one talks of the  masses.  That

again  is important. So the masses may not mean  the

majority. It can also mean ignoring the will of  the

majority. I will quote the relevant bit:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This is the International of those

"internationalists  in  deed"  whom  I  specifically

enumerated     above.    They    alone     represent

revolutionary, international masses  ...  Let  every

Russian worker ask himself how many really conscious

revolutionaries there were in Russia on the  eve  of

the  February-March Revolution of  1917.  [In  fact,

Sir,  it goes on to say that there were very few  of

them:]  The question is not one of numbers [that  is

important:  the question is not one of  numbers - when

you  are talking of masses, it means something else:

when  you  talk  of  the  majority  of  the  people,

according  to  Lenin and everybody who  accepts  the

precepts  of Lenin, it is not a question of numbers]

but  of  giving correct expression to the ideas  and

policy of the truly revolutionary proletariat.'.



<br><br>Therefore, "masses" means again only the people  who

support the Communists:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



"majority"  also  means only those who  support  the

Communists.  There might be only six  but  it  still

constitutes the majority of the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister is quoting from

certain  books.  I wonder whether  those  books  are

readily available in the National Library.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, these works are not only

available  but they disprove the contention  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis from time to time that the  wicked

P.A.P.   Government  prohibit  and  ban  progressive

books. These are Lenin's works printed in Moscow and

circulated  here.  But the difference  is  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis do not read the relevant passages.

When  their  masters tell them the majority  of  the

workers are behind them, many of them really do  not

know  that their true mentors are referring  to  the

majority  in the sense that the Leninists mean.  The

little  gentlemen here really think that  they  have

the masses behind them when, in fact, there might be

only  six  or  seven. As you know, Sir,  during  the

school riots -

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I do not think the Minister for Culture

need  go  to  the  extent of quoting  passages  from

textbooks  on Leninism and Marxism. If he  wants  to

know  the definition of "people", as defined by  the

Barisan Sosialis, then I say hold elections.  It  is

as simple as that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I am coming to that. I have a

great  deal  to say about elections.  He  says  that

as  the  Communists  can use  elections  to  capture

power.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Point of order, Is it relevant to the

motion before the House?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think possibly the Minister is now

inviting a debate on Leninism, Marxism, and so on. I

do  not  think  he should go into too  many  details

because  once he starts that, it opens out a  debate

on the subject. Perhaps he could just indicate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



what is in his mind, and then leave it at that,  and

stop  quoting from books. Apparently the  books  are

known to the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> May I submit, Sir, that this is

essential  because many of their own  followers  get

confused  when the Barisan Sosialis talk  about  the

people  in Sarawak not wanting Malaysia, the  people

in Singapore not wanting this and that, the majority

of   the  people  are  behind  this  and  that.   My

contention, Sir, as I shall show later, is that  the

Barisan  Sosialis are a Communist front organisation

and  they  use Communist jargon to delude and  cheat

the people of this country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister can make

his  point in quite a brief manner instead of  going

into  details and quoting from books. I do not think

that is proper in a debate of this nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> May I therefore reply simply to the

exchange  of fraternal greetings across  the  Floor?

May  I  just  therefore quote one last relevant  bit

from  the great master himself to show that, by  and

large,  the  Barisan technique is, if necessary,  to

stop  Malaysia by indulging in tactics which do  not

exactly give credence to their claim that they are a

non-Communist,   socialist,   democratic,   and    a

parliamentary  democratic Party? Lenin  says  it  is

necessary   that  a  majority  of  the   people   be

established  after the Communist  Party  has  seized

power  - you seize power and then you declare who  are

the majority of the people. He says here, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The traitors, blockheads and pedants of the Second

International [i.e. people like us, the weak  social

democrats]     could    never    understand     this

dialectics - that  the  proletariat   cannot   triumph

unless it wins a majority of the population over  to

its  side,  but  that to confine the  winning  of  a

majority  to, or make it conditional upon, obtaining

a  majority of votes at the polls under the rule  of

the bourgeoisie is either the densest stupidity,  or

a sheer attempt to foil the workers. In order to win

the  majority  of  the population,  the  proletariat

[i.e. the Communists]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



must,  in the first place, overthrow the bourgeoisie

and seize the power of the state.'



<br><br>This  ties  up, Sir, with a statement  made  by  the

Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis at a rally

to  support  West  Irian. He  said,  "Constitutional

methods  of  struggle  are useless."  So,  Sir,  you

establish  a  majority, not in terms  of  winning  a

majority of votes - all that is nonsense - but you seize

power and declare that, "We are the majority."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is important because if our thesis is that the

Barisan  Sosialis  has not only become  a  Communist

front  but  has also become a tool of a  Party  more

powerful  than  the  Barisan  Sosialis  to  sabotage

Malaysia,  then it is necessary for us to understand

the workings and thinking and strategy not of the 13

Barisan Sosialis Members - who are just frontmen,  and

as  I said the Barisan, meaning the Front - but of the

people  who  really direct the Barisan Sosialis  and

who  are  interested in higher stakes than  standing

for election to this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have elaborated at length on the definitions of

"masses",  "people", and "majority",  to  show  that

when  the Barisan talks of the masses being  opposed

to  Malaysia, they do not mean that the masses would

lose  out  on merger, that the people are  going  to

suffer under merger, that the people are opposed  to

the  abolition of the Internal Security Council,  or

that the Government is not heeding the voice of  the

masses.   What  they  mean  is  that  the  Communist

overlords  are  unhappy and angry that  we  are  not

listening  to  the  voice of the  masses,  i.e. the

Communists.  And when they say that the  masses  are

demanding  this or that, or that we are not  heeding

the  wishes of the masses, what they really mean  is

that  we  are  not conceding to the  wishes  pf  the

communists.  When  they  talk  of  the  welfare  and

interest  of the masses of Malaysia., what they  are

concerned about is not the welfare of the 10 million

people   but   of  the  Communist  conspirators   in

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, it is important for us to get that

point  across.  When they talk of  the  masses,  the

masses fight it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



out  with the Communists; and the whole argument and

the whole stand become clear and logical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia, Sir, as I have shown, is necessary for

the  economic  advancement and  welfare  of  the  10

million   people  scattered  throughout   the   five

territories. Though it is good for the  people,  the

economic  and political arguments show  that  it  is

good.  Even  the  Barisan  Sosialis  say  that,   in

principle, it is a good thing, but in practice it is

bad  for  the Communists and therefore  it  must  be

resisted.  The  Balkanisation of Malaysia  may  mean

economic  dislocation  and suffering  for  the  vast

majority  of the 10 million people. But the  Barisan

Sosialis  are  not  thinking of the  people  or  the

masses  in  the sense that you and I mean.  That  is

small  consideration - the sacrifice of the masses  in

the  ordinary  sense of the word - compared  with  the

possible  sacrifice  of  the masses  that  Leninists

have, i.e. the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question may be asked: why is it in the

interests  of  the Communists to balkanise  Malaysia

and  shatter the economy on which the prosperity  of

Malaysia  is  founded? The Barisan  Sosialis  oppose

merger  for the same reason that led them to  oppose

Malaysia. In both cases what the non-Communists  are

seeking  is  the creation of a strong and prosperous

national  state through integration of  the  economy

and administration of this area. The Communists know

that  this strong, unified and relatively prosperous

state  cannot, in the immediate future,  come  under

their  control.  They know that  if  an  independent

Malaysia  comes about today, it would pass into  the

hands of a non-Communist regime, the nationalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever theories the Communists might have

about  the anti-colonial struggle, arid so on - before

the  war  the  anti-colonial struggle was  still  in

theory,  hut  after  the war the  people  have  been

successful    in   their   anti-colonial    struggle

throughout  Asia and Africa and the Communists  have

not  failed to note the exasperating fact  that  the

collapse of imperialism in colonial Asia and Africa



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



has   almost  invariably  been  succeeded   not   by

Communist  regimes but by non-Communist  nationalist

regimes:  India,  Ceylon,  Burma,  Pakistan,  Egypt,

Syria,  Ghana, and so on. In every case, Sir, though

the  Communists are at the forefront  of  the  anti-colonial  struggle  (and we are not  denying  that),

after  its  success  in the anti-colonial  struggle,

what  was established was not a Communist government

but a nationalist government. That is relevant, Sir,

to  Mr Aidit's piece on Malaysia. Some of the anti-colonialists, as I said, play a foremost part in the

anti-colonial  struggle.  Yet  in  every  case  when

colonialism is smashed, it is not the Communists but

the nationalists who succeed in taking over power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of the countries that have gained

independence, the Communists attempted revolutionary

seizure   of  power.  Not  only  did  they   provoke

nationalism  into  open  enmity  with  them  but  it

resulted in the crushing of the Communists. In India

and  in  Burma,  Communist attempts to  seize  power

ended  in  disaster  for them. In  Egypt,  President

Nasser,  though he is on the best of terms with  the

Russians  and  the Communists, deals pretty  roughly

with  his  own Communists. Again, Sir, in 1948  when

the  Indonesian  Communists staged  a  revolutionary

uprising  in  Madium,  they  took  more  than   they

bargained for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the allegations made by the Barisan

Sosialis that supporters of merger and Malaysia  are

pro-colonial stooges, it may be well to remind  them

what the P.K.I. leaders called President Soekarno in

1948 when the Communists decided to seize power, and

in  fact attempted to seize power in Madium. This is

how Musso -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister for

Finance seems to be very preoccupied. Earlier on the

Minister for Culture walked through the Bar  without

paying respects to the Chair. I did not pull him  up

because  I  thought  the Minister  for  Culture  was

preoccupied  with his speech. And  now  we  get  the

Minister   for   Finance  walking   right   through,

completely preoccupied.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Oh. I

am sorry.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I just remarked on it because it

seemed   to   me   that  the  Ministers   are   very

preoccupied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I was not as preoccupied as some of

the Members opposite, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now the fashion of the Barisan Sosialis to

call  those who support Malaysia and merger as  pro-colonial stooges, agents of imperialism, and so  on.

It is perhaps important to remind them that whenever

the  Communists decide to use the word "masses",  or

"majority",   the   meaning  changes   under   party

political context. For example, in Madium  when  the

Communists staged an uprising, Musso, one of the top

Communist leaders, described President Soekarno  as:

"Soekarno-Hatta,  the slaves of Japan  and  America!

Traitors   must  die!"  And  a  Communist  broadcast

described the Madium uprising as a popular  uprising

against  the  Government  of  the  Fascist  Japanese

Quisling,  Soekarno and Hatta. These  are  the  same

people,  Sir, who put up posters today for Soekarno.

Their  own  leaders, when it suited their  interest,

called  Soekarno  and  Hatta  slaves  of  Japan  and

America   - Fascist Japanese Quislings,  Soekarno  and

Hatta.  So  whether  a  nationalist  leader   is   a

"progressive"  or  a  "colonial stooge"  depends  on

whether  the leader happens to be pursuing a  policy

which   is   favourable  or  unfavourable   to   the

Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to round off the story. May I say, Sir, that

the Madium uprising failed and Musso and a few other

gentlemen  were  executed by the  nationalists.  But

that is in passing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every time the Communists try their strength

with  the nationalists they meet with disaster. That

is  a  historical law. To use another  phrase  which

they  can  understand - the law of social development.

Even in Syria, Sir, some of those in the United Arab

Republic  who tried to break up the two  territories

ended  by having in Syria a government which is  far

more Right-wing than they expected. Similarly, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



in  Hitler's Germany, the Communists again tried  to

double-cross the socialists and they ended  up  with

Hitler.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder how the Minister can

relate all those remarks to the motion. Shall we try

and come to the motion as quickly as possible?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is quite pertinent, Sir. My

thesis  is  that they are anti-nationalists  and  if

they are fighting the nationalists they are going to

conic  a cropper, as many Communists did in Germany,

Italy, Spain and even the United Arab Republic. That

is  just  an indication that whoever play  with  the

forces  of  history, and if the  forces  of  history

happen  to  be going one way and they happen  to  be

going  the  other way, then they are going  to  face

disaster.  And  this fact - that is, every  time  they

take  on  the  nationalists, they lose  out  to  the

nationalists - the Communists find extremely baffling.

So  rather than admit that the people, the masses of

these  territories,  after  independence,  are   not

enamoured of what is called the dictatorship of  the

proletariat,  therefore,  the  Communists   try   to

explain  the  whole thing away by  saying  that  any

nationalist regime that does not play the  Communist

game  cannot be really independent. That is  another

talk,  Sir.  When  the Barisan Sosialis  talk  about

phoney  independence  or  that  the  Tunku  is   not

independent,  what they mean is this.  Their  theory

says that once the anti-colonial revolution is over,

the masses, the people, should automatically support

Communism.  But  in fact just the opposite  happens.

The  nationalists will take over and the  Communists

are pushed around. So they have to explain how is it

that  during elections it is not the Communists  who

win,  but it is the nationalists who win. Therefore,

they  say, well, if that happens, that must  be  not

because  of  anything else but that the  country  is

really not independent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, yesterday's Straits Times

published an interview Mr Alex Josey -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Your adviser.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - had with Mr Aidit, who is your

adviser. I am sorry, Sir, the adviser of the Barisan

Sosialis,  and  it is better advice  that  Mr  Alex

Josey  gives  me than Mr Aidit is giving  them,  as

they  will soon discover, Sir, we in Singapore  have

never  commented on the activities  of  the  P.K.I.,

that  is,  the  Indonesian Communist Party,  because

what  the P.K.I. says or does is solely the business

of  the Indonesian people. But when the P.K.I. takes

it  upon  itself to join in the campaign to sabotage

merger  and  Malaysia, then the people  of  Malaysia

have  the  right  to  counter  P.K.I. mischief   in

Malaysia.  I  shall  deal later  with  the  P.K.I.'s

attempts  to incite their local stooges to break  up

Malaysia.  Just  now I would like to  show  why  Mr

Aidit  in his article and other Communists  keep  on

describing as not fully independent countries  which

everyone else accepts as independent, including  the

Federation. We put forward a merger. They say it  is

a  phoney  merger  because it  does  not  give  full

independence.  Malaysia - well,  that  is   a   phoney

Malaysia because it does not give full independence.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for us, therefore, again to

understand  exactly what they mean by  independence.

As  I  said,  Mr  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  they  give

meanings  to  words like "majority",  "people",  and

"masses" which are quite different from the ordinary

dictionary  meanings,  that  is  the  meanings  that

ordinary  people  give  to these  words.  Therefore,

again, we must understand what exactly they mean  by

independence.  The  countries which  everybody  else

accepts  as  independent  they  say  are  not  fully

independent. It is their way of getting out  of  the

theoretical  dilemma why the anti-colonial  struggle

invariably  ends  in a victory for the  nationalists

rather than for the Communists. This fact, Sir,  has

puzzled many Communist camp followers who think that

the colonial masses should take to Communism like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



ducks  take  to water. So Mr Aidit offers  for  the

consolation   of  dispirited  Communists   and   the

dispirited Barisan Sosialis the theory of what  they

call   "neo-colonialism" - the  new  colonialism.   He

says - and  I  quote  from  the  interview.  This   is

essential  because on this definition he builds  his

case against Malaysia:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Neo-colonialism is a new form of colonialism...'.



<br><br>That,  Sir,  as logic is not profound.  It  is  like

saying, `Dog is equal to dog.' `Neo-colonialism is a

new  form  of colonialism.' But that certainly  must

have  impressed  and puzzled the  Members  of  the

Barisan Sosialis because it comes from Aidit -

because  of  the  pressure of the colonial  peoples.

Imperialists  realise that they must be  given  some

sort of independence, but what they arc given is not

full  independence  because  economic  and  cultural

colonialisation remains.'



<br><br>That is Mr Aidit's statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, which are these so-called neo-colonial

countries,  because so far we have had reference  to

independent countries, colonial countries. In  fact,

Sir,  as  far  as  I can remember,  the  word  "neo-colonialism" had never yet been used by the  Barisan

Sosialis until after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



Aidit  came.  I am quite sure we will hear  a  great

deal about neo-colonialism from now on. So what  are

the  so-called neo-colonial countries? According  to

Afro-Asian countries in the United Nations, for  Mr

Aidit goes on to complain, and I quote, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`More and more coloured peoples are joining the -'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I would suggest to the Minister for

Culture -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are asking for elucidation

or are you going to give elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - to explain whether it is only people

like   Aidit,  or  Communists  who  talk   of   neo-colonialism,  or  whether  there  are  people   like

Nkruma,  Nasser and others, whom the PAP, leadership

themselves term nationalists, who also say there  is

definitely neo-colonialism in the world.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> When Nkruma and other nationalists

talk  of neo-colonialism they mean anti-colonialism.

But  when  Aidit talks of neo-colonialism  he  means

Communism,  as  I  am  going to indicate,  Sir.  For

example, he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`More and more coloured peoples are joining the

United  Nations, for example, but many of them  have

accepted less than full and complete independence.'



<br><br>So   obviously,  Sir,  there  are  many   Afro-Asian

countries in the United Nations, not just a few  but

many,   all  of  whom,  according  to  Mr   Aidit's

definition   of  neo-colonialism,  are  not   really

independent. They have accepted less than  full  and

complete independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we all know that no country can be

admitted  to the United Nations unless its  members,

including  the  Communist  countries  as  well,  are

satisfied that it is a fully independent country. No

country  which  is  not fully independent  can  gain

admission to the United Nations. There is a vigorous

test, and among the testers are the Russians and the

Communist  countries.  So  the  Communist  test   of

independence obviously is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



not  the kind of test that is applied in the  United

Nations. That is the point I am trying to arrive at.

That  when  Nkruma  talks  of  neo-colonialism   and

colonialism  he  means  that certain  countries  are

directly subject to colonial rule. But when Aidit or

the Communist talk of neo-colonialism, they mean  it

in  a  completely different sense.  They  define  it

differently from the way it is defined in the United

Nations  by  the  non-Communist  countries  and  the

Communist  countries.  Therefore,  I  am  trying  to

suggest  that  the Communists have again  their  own

definition of independence; just as they have  their

peculiar  definition of what is  "people",  what  is

"the majority" and what are "the masses" -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And what is merger?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I notice that the Barisan

Sosialis  constantly  need  the  assistance  of  the

Member for Anson. I do not know whether he is a back-seat driver, but he is the remotest from all the  13

Assemblymen  from across this side of  the  Chamber.

Sir, if we define neo-colonialism as the refusal  of

independent countries to accept the Communist regime

in  preference  to a nationalist regime,  then,  Mr

Aidit's  meaning as well as analysis becomes  clear.

When   he   says  that  a  country  has  not   "full

independence",  what he means is  that  it  has  not

become Communist. The implication is that the masses

really   want  Communism.  That  is,  the   colonial

countries which have become independent  - the  masses

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- really want Communism but cannot realise their

hopes  because of the mysterious power  called  neo-colonialism  which frustrates their  desire.  So  in

that   way  he  pleases  the  Communists.  He   says

historically if there is real independence, then the

whole  world would go Communist. But at the  moment,

even   an   independent  country  is   really   neo-colonialist, and therefore the masses are still with

the Communists.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Indonesia is not Communist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is what Mr Aidit said.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am just coming to that point. The

neo-colonialists  are  therefore  people   who   are

nationalists  but not Communists.  Mr  Aidit  makes

this  clear when he says that Indonesia is not fully

independent  either.  It  is  quite  clear  in  this

article.  This can only mean that President Soekarno

is  himself - according to Aidit's definition - the head

of  a  neo-colonial country, a country which is  not

fully independent. Sir, I will quote Aidit, who is a

better  authority.  This is  what  he  says  in  the

interview:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Basically the economy is not in the hands of the

native  people  but foreigners. We  still  have  the

problem of neo-colonialism in Indonesia.'



<br><br>All  this talk, Sir, of independent countries.  Here

he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We still have the problem of neo-colonialism in

Indonesia.'



<br><br>As  I have pointed out earlier, Sir, the P.K.I. once

called Soekarno a Quisling and a traitor. Now to get

across  their point, they even imply that  President

Soekarno   is   the  President  of  a   neo-colonial

territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Much of our industry, for example, belongs to the

foreigners. Culturally our determination to  develop

along  our  own  lines  is  very  strong,  but   the

imperialists  still penetrate with  worthless  films

and words and so forth.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, intelligent people will find it hard to

swallow  that Indonesia is not fully independent  or

that  it is, after all, a neo-colonial country.  But

if we bear in mind that when a Communist says that a

country is not independent, what he means is that it

is  not  Communist, or that it frustrates  Communist

designs   to  turn  the  country  into  a  Communist

outpost, then we are not likely to be confused. Sir,

when  they  say  there is no political independence,

this is not independence, or that we are not working

towards  independence, what they really mean  is  to

cross  out the word "independence" and put the  word

"Communist"; the whole thing becomes clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly. Sir, when the pocket Aidits of the

Barisan  Sosialis claim that the Federation  is  not

independent  and imply that the Tunku is  a  Western

colonial stooge, what their double-talk really means

is that the Federation is not independent because it

is not giving Communists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



and pro-Communists a free hand to pave  the

way for a Communist takeover.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the test of the United Nations, the Federation

is independent. I believe there are 92 nations. They

have decided that the Federation is independent  and

allow it a seat there; otherwise, it would not  have

been  admitted  as  a member. It  may  be  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis will contend that even the  United

Nations  is an imperialist stooge organisation  and,

therefore, its judgment about whether the Federation

is or is not independent is invalid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me therefore quote from impeccable authority:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Right up to the end of 1955 it seemed impossible

that   the   British  would  make  any   imaginative

political  move which would turn the  flanks  as  it

were of the armed revolt -'.

nation. So far it is completely relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, what I say may not be

relevant,  but  the  authority  I  quote   is   very

relevant.  I  think  the Member  for  Thomson  would

accept it as such.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Right up to the end of 1955 it seemed impossible

that   the   British  would  make  any   imaginative

political  move which would turn the  flanks  as  it

were  of the armed revolt But the British today have

opted  out of the struggle. [They have opted out  of

the  Federation] It is no more their fight  - at least

not  officially.  It has become a  fight  between  a

popular   government  (unquestionably  popular)   [I

repeat,  Sir,  a  popular government (unquestionably

popular)] and a section of the population which  has

not been fully accepted as part of Malayan society  - "aliens in fact".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the relevant authority is Mr James

Puthucheary,   adviser  to  the   Barisan   Sosialis

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- incidentally also the man who advised Mr Lim Ching

Siong and his comrades that they could make a secret

deal  with  the U.K. Commission to oust the  P.A.P.

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quoting from a bock called The Battle for

Merger.  I  hope many Members have read it.  As  you

know, Sir, it contains, besides the Prime Minister's

radio  talks,  some  interesting  contributions   by

leading personalities in the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be, Sir, that even Mr Puthucheary may now

be   suspect  and  his  claim  that  the  Federation

Government  is  "unquestionably popular"  even  more

suspect.  So  I  must quote still higher  authority.

This   comprises  the  following  Barisan   Sosialis

apostles -   Mr Fong Swee Suan, Mr Puthucheary,  Mr

Chan Chiaw Thor and Mr Woodhull. I again quote from

documents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



from  The  Battle for Merger. This is what  is  said

there  by  the  four gentlemen who are  now  in  the

Barisan Sosialis:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"No sane person can claim today that the M.C.P.

revolt   is  directed  against  British  imperialist

domination  of Malaya. Malaya today is  ruled  by  a

popularly  elected  government  which  is  in   full

political and administrative control of the country,

a  government  which  has  been  freely  and  openly

recognised  by  the governments of all  nations  ...

including  the governments of the Soviet  Union  and

the People's Republic of China."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how then, Sir, are we to describe the state of

mind  of  the  Member  for Queenstown  who  contends

otherwise,  when  his  own advisers,  the  important

members of the Party, analysed the situation in  the

calm  quiet  of  a  detention  camp,  came  to   the

conclusion  that  the Federation  was  not  only  an

independent government, but undoubtedly popular? And

now  we  are told, Sir, that the Tunku is a  stooge,

and  the  Federation is not independent. It may  be,

Sir,  that even the Dutchmen of these people,  these

four that I mentioned, on whether the Tunku is or is

not   a  stooge  of  the  British  may  be  suspect.

Therefore,   Sir,  I  must  go  for   still   higher

authority,  an  authority which  no  Member  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis can dare refute, and I  quote  the

highest  of all authorities - Chin Peng. This is  what

Chin  Peng  said at the Baling talks  at  which  the

Member  for Anson was present in 1955. I quote  from

the White Paper on the talks:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Chin Peng then spoke for the first time: "First

and  foremost,  I wish to say that it  is  precisely

because  we  realise [This, he was  talking  to  the

Tunku] that you are not the spokesman of the British

Government  and  are  not the  running  dog  of  the

British   Government,  the  stooge  of  the  British

Government, that we have come out to meet you at the

risk of our lives."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chin Peng said, Sir, that the Tunku was not a

stooge  of the British Government: that he  was  not

the  spokesman  of the British Government.  But  the

little  men  who aspire to be small Chin  Pengs  say

otherwise -



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Neo-Chin Peng!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, therefore, today you find

after  all  these  authorities,  starting  from  the

adviser to the Barisan Sosialis (I presume, Sir,  he

is still the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



adviser  to the Barisan Sosialis) to Mr  Fong  Swee

Suan  and  so  on, and culminating  in  Chin  Peng's

statement -  his judgment on whether the Tunku  was  a

stooge  and  whether the Federation was independent.

Therefore, it is difficult to find that the  Barisan

Sosialis  and the Communist godfathers in  Indonesia

contend that the Tunku is a cat's-paw of the British

and  that,  to  quote  Mr Aidit,  the  Federation's

independence is an illusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the Barisan Sosialis imply that the Tunku

is  a British stooge and that the Federation is  not

fully  independent, they are defining "independence"

in  the  way  a Communist defines it  -  a  colonial

country  is  not independent if it is not Communist.

If you bear that definition in mind, every lime they

talk of "independent" or "not fully independent", we

know  what  they  really mean.  When  they  talk  of

independence  they mean a colonial  country  is  not

independent  if  it is not Communist.  So  when  the

Barisan  Sosialis  talk  about  fighting  for   full

independence and carrying on the colonial  struggle,

what  they  really mean is that the  fight  must  be

carried  on until a Communist Singapore, a Communist

Malaya and a Communist Malaysia is achieved. That is

what  they  mean by an anti-colonial struggle.  They

keep on talking about the anti-colonial struggle  is

not  finished  in  the Federation. To  the  ordinary

people, it does not make sense. But if you cross out

"anti-colonial"  and put "Communist  struggle",  the

fight  for  independence  means  to  strive  for   a

Communist  Federation, then the whole thing  becomes

quite clear. So if you constantly bear in mind  that

if the Barisan Sosialis talk of carrying on the anti-colonial struggle, what they really mean is carrying

on  the  struggle for Communism; and that when  they

talk of an independent Malaya or Malaysia, what they

really mean is a Communist Malaya or Malaysia,  then

all  their confusing antics, somersaults and double-talk become clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there is their inexplicable attitude

towards  merger. The nationalists say that the  best

way to liquidate British colonialism and gain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



independence  for Singapore is by merging  with  the

Federation.  But  the  Barisan  say  it  is  a  pro-colonialist and reactionary merger. The  true  anti-colonialist solution, the Barisan Sosialis claim, is

to  fight  for  full internal self-government  while

leaving  defence  and  foreign  affairs  in  British

hands. Now, that is extremely puzzling. Here on  one

side  we say, "Merge to get independence." They say,

"No,    that   is   pro-colonial.   That   is    not

independence."  But  fight for full  internal  self-government, hand over foreign affairs and defence to

the  British,  and that becomes a real anti-colonial

struggle. That would not make any sense unless, as J

have  said earlier, we define the word "independent"

in  the  sense that the Communists mean. To struggle

for  independence means to struggle for a  Communist

Malaya.   So,  therefore,  internal  self-government

without  the  Internal Security Council  becomes  an

anti-colonial struggle because it advances the cause

of  Communism. In other words, Sir, to fight  for  a

semi-colonial  Singapore  is  more  progressive  and

testifies to a more fervent anti-colonialism than to

fight  for  a merger where foreign affairs,  defence

and  internal  security would be  in  the  hands  of

Malayans, and not the British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how are we to reconcile this absurd

contradiction?  By  simply  asking  ourselves  which

course  would be more advantageous to the  Communist

cause  - independence through merger or internal self-government; a Malaya or Malaysia controlled  by  the

nationalists  or a Malaya or Malaysia controlled  by

the British?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is that after their bitter experience

with  colonial nationalisms in Asia and Africa,  the

Communists  have  today come to the conclusion  that

their chances of survival and victory are better  in

a  colonial  or semi-colonial territory than  in  an

independent territory. That is the real  truth  when

they  have analysed the position. They have decided,

in  view  of  their experiences with nationalism  in

Asia  and  Africa, where they always come a cropper,

that in the present context the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



anti-colonial struggle - in the Communist sense,  that

is, to further the cause of Communism  - is better  in

a  colonial or semi-colonial Malaya or Malaysia than

in  an independent Malaya or Malaysia, because  they

know  that colonialism is a weak force as  it  is  a

dying  force. Nationalism, on the other hand,  is  a

virile,  dynamic and irresistible force  which  time

after   time  has  given  Communism  a  had  mauling

wherever  it  tries  to  tame  nationalism  to   its

purpose.  So  while  shouting fierce  anti-colonial

slogans,  the  Communists of Malaysia manoeuvre  and

conspire  even with the British to halt  the  growth

and  unity  of nationalism. Therefore,  the  Barisan

Sosialis, on behalf of their Communist mentors,  are

resisting  merger, not because it  is  bad  for  the

people but because it means a consolidation of  non-Communist  nationalist forces in Singapore  and  the

Federation.  They  must break up merger  because  it

means  the  unification of non-Communist nationalist

forces.  That is why the Barisan Sosialis  in  their

desperation even went to the extent of going to  the

U.K.  Commissioner  with secret  proposals  that  in

return   for   full  internal  self-government   and

abolition of the Internal Security Council they were

ready  to let the British have their bases  and  run

the   foreign  policy  of  Singapore.  That  is   an

admission that today the Communists in Singapore and

Malaya have analysed themselves to a position  where

they  say, "Boy, we have better chances of  survival

under the British than under the nationalists."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is simple. Under the proposed

arrangement  with the British, the I.S.C. would  be

abolished and so the Communists hope they could have

a  free run in a semi-colonial Singapore. The forces

of   Malayan   nationalism  could  be  isolated   by

perpetuating  the  division of the two  territories.

When the Communists have consolidated their position

in  Singapore and strengthened their position in the

Federation and the Borneo territories at the expense

of  non-Communist nationalist forces, only then  can

they launch an anti-colonial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



movement against the British. Under such conditions,

a victory against colonialism could result in a take-over  by the Communists and not by the nationalists.

That  is  what they want. Today they are  not  ready

organisationally or psychologically to take over  if

independence  should  be granted  to  this  country.

Therefore, just like the reactionaries of old,  they

want  to  postpone independence because  they  would

rather  the British continue and give them  time  to

build up their forces sp that in a competition  with

the  nationalists they hope that they can take  over

the  country.  But at the moment they know  that  if

there  is  independence in any of these territories,

they  must  in  the  competition  lose  out  to  the

nationalists  as they have done in  every  place  in

Asia and Africa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists know that merger and Malaysia will

result  in  the  transfer of  sovereignty  from  the

British  to  the Malayan nationalists  and  not  the

Communists.  The Communists are not  in  a  position

today  to  take  over  control  of  the  nationalist

movement. Therefore, they cannot, for all their anti-colonial posturings, really afford to fight for  the

immediate  liquidation of British rule in  Singapore

and  the Borneo territories. They know that the real

and  most  effective barrier to Communism  today  in

Malaysia  is  not the British but the  non-Communist

nationalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if the Barisan Sosialis and their pro-Communist

friends  were to succeed in breaking up  merger  and

Malaysia, they know what the immediate consequences

are.  They know that Singapore will remain a  colony

under  the  British. If you stop  merger,  Singapore

will still remain a colony. If you bust up Malaysia,

the Borneo territories will remain British colonies.

It  is  my  thesis.  Sir,  that  today  the  Barisan

Sosialis and the Communists have put themselves in a

humiliating position  - as I said during the debate on

merger   - of  having to prop up the British  colonial

regime  to ensure their survival. They cannot,  dare

not  and will not fight the local nationalists. That

is  precisely  what the Barisan Sosialis  and  their

Communist puppet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



masters really want - the maintenance of British  rule

in  these territories until the Communists are ready

to take over and not the nationalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I indicated at the beginning of my speech,

the  ordinary people in all the territories  have  a

great  deal  to  gain economically, politically  and

culturally   under   Malaysia.  The   economic   and

political  arguments for Malaysia  are  irrefutable.

But however good Malaysia may be for the people - that

is,  the  ordinary men in the sense  that  the  non-Communist use it - it is bad for the Barisan  Sosialis

and their Communist mentors and therefore it must be

resisted  at  all  costs. When the Barisan  Sosialis

talk  of  Malaysia being bad for the  "people" - as  I

said,  they  define it in the Leninist  sense -   they

mean  Communists and Communist stooges.  As  I  said

earlier, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The question is not one of numbers but of giving

correct  expression to the ideas and policy  of  the

true revolutionary proletariat.'.



<br><br>Sir,  how  do the Barisan Sosialis today propose  to

halt merger and Malaysia?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, they, the great anti-colonialists,

tried   to  stop  merger  by  trying  to  sell   the

independence of Singapore to the British  in  return

for  internal  self-government  minus  the  Internal

Security  Council.  They tried  to  convince  the

British that they were non-Communist socialists  who

could  be  trusted to ensure the safety of  British

bases  in  Singapore. That is  the  line  they  were

trying to put over to the British. Sir, what we must

understand  is  that this duplicity is  an  integral

part of Communist strategy. Here again is an example

of Lenin's advice to Communist cadres. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is necessary [for a good Communist] to agree to

any  and  every sacrifice and even, if need  be,  to

resort  to all sorts of strategems, manoeuvres,  and

illegal  methods,  to evasions  and  subterfuges  in

order  to  penetrate the trade unions, to remain  in

them, and to carry on Communist work in them at  all

costs.'.



<br><br>This  relates to trade unions. But to penetrate  any

organisation,  the  Communist must  have  no  qualms

about resorting to evasions, subterfuges and deceit.

That  is  part of the Communist training.  To  those

Communists who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



might  have  qualms  about  resorting  to  evasions,

subterfuges, and illegal methods. Lenin himself  had

this advice to offer:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We say that our morality is entirely subordinated

to  the  interests  of the c1ass  struggle  ...  Our

morality is deduced from the class struggle.'



<br><br>So,  Sir,  the  term  "class  struggle"  is  another

misleading   Communist  term   for   the   Communist

struggle.  So  what  Lenin's advice  means  is  that

subterfuges,  evasions, betrayals,  plots  with  the

British  are  justifiable so long  as  they  promote

Communism.   For  a  Communist  the  definition   of

morality  is  anything which promotes the  Communist

struggle    Subterfuges,    evasions,    manoeuvres,

everything is justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this secret plotting to sell out the

independence of Singapore to the British,  from  the

Communist  point of view, from the Barisan  Sosialis

point of view, is justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That little secret deal with the British not only

failed  but  the exposure of this deal revealed  the

anti-nationalist intrigues of the Barisan  Sosialis.

So having been exposed there, they then attempted to

confuse the people and sabotage merger by asking for

-full  merger. This subterfuge, too,  has  now  been

exposed. They have lost the battle for merger.  They

are losing the battle for Malaysia, and Malaysia  is

an even greater threat to Communism than merger. The

Malayan Communists are not in a position to halt  it

and   so  the  Barisan  Sosialis  have  turned   for

assistance  to a new ally - the P.K.I. (the Indonesian

Communist Party).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first public indication of a sell-out of

Malaysia by local Communists to the P.K.I. came in a

report of an interview that Mr Lim Ching Siong, the

Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis,   was

supposed   to   have  given  to  the   pro-Communist

Indonesian paper. Bintang Timur, in November. May  I

quote a translation of this report, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lim Ching Siong, the foremost labour leader in

Singapore, who is also the chief opponent  of  Prime

Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew -'.

published  in the local Chinese newspapers.  So  you

can have either one  - either the transcript or a copy

of the local Chinese newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... the chief opponent of Prime Minister Mr Lee

Kuan Yew, stated to the correspondent of the Bintang

Timur  recently  that  he  preferred  a  merger   of

Singapore   with  Indonesia  to  merger   with   the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We in Singapore depend very much on trade with

Indonesia," said Mr Lim Ching Siong. "If  Indonesia

adopts a difficult attitude towards Singapore,  then

Singapore will be  sunk. Also ii Indonesia pursues  a

free  trade policy at any of the Rhiau Islands, then

Singapore will be  killed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frankly, we are more in favour of a merger with

Indonesia than with Malaya." said Mr Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Ching Siong further stated that from mans years of experience Singapore has acquired as a trading centre, it has been proved to the people of Singapore that Malaya has not been able to contribute anything towards the survival of the economy and the people of Singapore. The truth is that we are very much indebted to Indonesia.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now. Sir, it may strike many people as odd that

such an important change of policy, by a Party which

calls  itself "non-Communist, democratic socialist",

affecting the future fate of the people of Singapore

should have been made in an Indonesian pro-Communist

newspaper and not in Singapore. Nobody heard of  it.

In fact, the thing came to us by accident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate may range over both amendments and the

Original Question, as amended.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was referring

to  a report in the "Bintang Timur", a pro-Communist

Indonesian newspaper, which first reported that  Mr

Lim  Ching  Siong  was in favour of  merger  between

Singapore  and  Indonesia  rather  than   with   the

Federation  of Malaya. It seemed odd. Sir,  that  an

important  change  of policy -  such  as  advocating

merger  of Singapore with Indonesia when,  in  fact,

every  socialist and the Barisan Sosialis  in  their

manifesto have declared that they believe in  merger

of  Singapore with the Federation - should  have  been

announced  in  an  interview  with  a  pro-Communist

paper, not in Singapore but in Indonesia. To be fair

to  Mr  Lim,  Sir, may I say that  he  subsequently

denied having given such an interview. I am prepared

to  take  his  denial in good faith;  that  what  he

denied  was  that he had not given an  interview  to

this  particular paper. However, he has  not  denied

the  thesis  that  was attributed  to  him  in  this

newspaper.  So it is still a Secret. No announcement

had been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



made   that   the  Barisan  Sosialis  now   favoured

Singapore  merging with Indonesia which, if  it  was

really true, certainly accounts for their resistance

to merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, I think it was last Monday or Tuesday, the

Member  for  Thomson  went  even  further  when   he

described  the Malaysia plan as anti-Indonesian.  In

his  view,  to  quote the Member's  own  words,  Sir

-"Malaysia should have Indonesia as its heart-land."

Sir,  not  even  as  a member, and  not  even  as  a

partner, but as the heart-land of Malaysia. The term

"heart-land"  has a specific geo-political  meaning.

In  fact,  I think it was the prophecy of  Mackinder

who  proposed  the idea of heart-land of  Euro-Asia,

which was Russia. So "heart-land" has a specific geo-political meaning. In the geo-political sense of the

term,   it  is  the  strategic  centre  from   which

political, economic and social power radiates to the

periphery  of the heart-land. That in itself  is  an

interesting theory, Sir. That means that what we are

now   told  is  not  Malaysia,  but  Malaysia   with

Indonesia as the heart-land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of us may have thought that the Member

for Thomson was merely expressing a foolish personal

view  or even a madder view of the Barisan Sosialis.

However, Sir, the report of the interview by  Aidit,

the  P.K.I. leader, which appeared in  the  Straits

Times of yesterday, now makes it all too clear  that

Mr  Tim Ching Siong and the Member for Thomson  are

not  echoing personal views or accidental views, but

they  are  echoing decisions that had  already  been

arrived at by top Indonesian Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the battle for Malaysia takes on a different

meaning  with  each passing week. When Malaysia  was

first  proposed,  Sir, if you  will  recollect,  the

reaction  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  was   neutral

support  and no agitation, i.e. no public  agitation

from  one  section of the Barisan Sosialis.  By  and

large,  the  tendency  was  to  accept  Malaysia  in

principle,  presumably  because  at  that  time  the

Barisan  Sosialis were engaged in a  more  immediate

battle against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



merger.  And  they believed that the  Malaysia  plan

which  had  been  propounded by the Tunku  was  just

something  airy-fairy and would die out.  Therefore,

they paid no great attention to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is clear now that the Barisan Sosialis are

no longer a non-Communist, socialist, Malayan Party.

They  are  but  helpless  creatures,  the  miserable

stooges  of the P.K.I. What is happening, Sir,  with

the  political strip-tease that the Barisan Sosialis

are  indulging in, is that under pressure of  events

they  are  being forced to shed their veils  one  by

one -   the  democratic veil, the non-Communist  veil,

the socialist veil, and now the Malayan veil. And we

see  before us, Sir, not the Barisan Sosialis  which

say   that  they  believe  in  a  democratic,   non-Communist, socialist Malaya, but a Barisan  Sosialis

which have become the branch or the messenger boy of

the  P.K.I.  Therefore,  in fighting  Malaysia,  the

Barisan  Sosialis  leaders,  whether  Communists  or

adventurists, have been driven willy-nilly to embark

upon  the greatest betrayal of all  - the sell-out  of

Singapore,  the Federation of Malaya, and  Malaysia,

to the P.K.I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Sir, they are merely following instructions

from  the  Leninist text -  a good Communist  must  be

ready  to betray his own, country. That again,  Sir,

is  an essential part of the Leninist teaching.  For

example, Lenin says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Class struggle is impossible without dealing blows

to  one's own bourgeoisie, one's own government, and

dealing  a  blow to one's own government in  wartime

means ... [and this is important] ... high treason.'



<br><br>A  Communist  must  be  prepared  to  practise  high

treason. I am quoting from Lenin:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.... it means facilitating the defeat of one's own

country.'



<br><br>That   again  is  a  good  Leninist  text.  A   good

disciplined  Communist must accept that proposition,

i.e. a good Communist must be prepared to betray his

own  country. That is what he called "high treason",

which  means "facilitating the defeat of  one's  own

country".  Is  it  any wonder, Sir, that  everywhere

Communists should come into conflict



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



with  nationalists, because once a  Communist  front

organisation    comes    under    the    disciplined

instructions of a Communist Party, then  to  further

Communism  they  must be prepared to  practise  high

treason  and  facilitate the  defeat  of  their  own

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, in working as stool pigeons of the

P.K.I.,  the Barisan Sosialis are out to  facilitate

the eventual domination of Malaysian territories  by

the  P.K.I.  That is why the P.K.I. has  now  openly

come  to  the aid of the Barisan Sosialis and  their

unhappy  adventurers who must now  embark  upon  the

most   humiliating   and  most  dangerous   of   all

adventures    - the   sell-out   of   Singapore,   the

Federation,   and   Malaysia   to   the   Indonesian

Communists   - the betrayal of their  own  country,  a

practice of high treason. Let us, therefore, not  be

deluded  any  longer by the facade that the  Barisan

Sosialis  is  a  non-Communist,  socialist,  Malayan

Party. It is a Communist front ready to sell out the

people  of  Singapore to the Indonesian  Communists,

i.e. if  the  Indonesian Communists  ever  come  to

power.  Therefore, Sir, let us no  longer  carry  on

this  pretence  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis  is   a

socialist Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest I be accused of being unfair when I say that

the  Barisan  Sosialis is not a  socialist,  Malayan

Party,  let me quote a document from Tue Battle  for

Merger. This is a document written by Mr Lim  Ching

Siong,   the   Secretary-General  of   the   Barisan

Sosialis,  a Party which says that it stands  for  a

non-Communist,  socialist, democratic  Malaya.  This

document  was  written to commemorate the  death  of

Stalin  who,  as  we  know,  had  been  removed   by

Khruschev.  I  am  not quite sure whether  Khruschev

conies under the definition of a social democrat  or

a  running dog of the Imperialists. But this is what Mr Lim Ching Siong said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We must forever remember: We have already sworn

before  the  Red  flag  and  old  Stalin.  We   must

resolutely  uphold the interests of the Organisation

at all times and under all circumstances.'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



The  organisation, Sir, refers to  the  Anti-British

League,   which  is  another  Communist   controlled

organisation.  So  here is the Secretary-General  of

the  Barisan Sosialis who says, "We are sworn before

the  Red  flag and old Stalin." Later on he  enjoins

upon  his followers to read some interesting  books,

again  from two non-socialist democratic members  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis. The books he recommends  are

very  interesting:  "Malenkov's  Political  Report",

"Stalin's   Talks",  "Liu  Shao-Chi's  Training   in

Discipline  of the Organisation", and editorials  of

the  "Freedom  News". To acquire basic knowledge  of

Marxism and Leninism, he recommends "The History  of

the   Russian  Communist  Party",  "The   Basis   of

Leninism" and so on. In fact, I would enjoin members

of  other  political Parties to read some  of  these

books  except "Freedom News", because I think it  is

proscribed,  unless you happen to be  a  subscriber.

But  I would suggest that those who cannot get these

books  could probably approach the Barisan Sosialis.

But it is not so much that as there are no other non-Communist socialist books recommended in the list of

mass reading for members of the organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So first we have the Barisan Sosialis which start

off  by  trying  to betray their  own  Party  in  an

election.  Now  in  six months'  time,  the  Barisan

Sosialis have graduated to even higher things.  They

are  prepared to trade Singapore in the interest  of

the  P.KJ. They are getting better and better,  Sir,

in  accepting the Leninist precept:-  that  is,  high

treason and betrayal of one's own country is a  good

test  of  a good Communist. So yesterday,  Sir,  the

Member  for Queenstown kept on saying, "What is  all

this talk about Communism - the Communist bogey?  The

Government always brings this in" and so on. Sir,I

have  quoted  what  the  Secretary-General  of   the

Barisan Sosialis had sworn, before the Red flag  and

old  Stalin. Then let me quote another document.  It

is  a  very interesting book. I have a feeling  that

this book is going to be a very oft-quoted book.  We

have  kept  a few copies in the Library. Here  again

let me quote another document by the adviser to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



Barisan, Mr James Puthucheary. This was a statement

of  political beliefs which was written again in the

solitude of a prison. He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When I broke with my political friends in 1951,

the  full implications were not clear to me, and  so

to a large extent hung in mid-air as it were. Though

I  had  rejected some of what were considered  basic

tenets  and was critical of Communist regimentation,

I was unable to reject Weltenschauung.'



<br><br>Then he says:



<br><br>`My  return  from Communism was not  in  a  straight

line.'



<br><br>I  suggest, Sir, that the return to Communism is not

as  straight either. But it does show that when  the

Barisan Sosialis says, "What is all this talk  about

Communism?  All this smear is an attempt to  confuse

the  people." Mr James Puthucheary is  not  one  of

those people who wrote letters to say that all  this

talk  about Communist machinations is nonsense.  But

here in this document he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`My return from Communism was not in a straight

line.'



<br><br>Let me state here, Sir, that we are not fighting the

Communists  because  they  are  Communists.  We  are

fighting   them  because  they  are   actively   and

conspiratorally  resisting what  Malayan  socialists

have  always  believed in - merger between  Singapore

and  Federation. The day the Communists, the Barisan

Sosialis,  decided to sabotage merger we  took  them

on. The day they betrayed our candidate in Anson  we

took  them  on.  Now that the Barisan Sosialis  have

decided  to betray Singapore to the P.K.I., we  will

take  them on definitely, because we have no  doubts

now  that the Barisan Sosialis and their friends are

seeking no less than the betrayal of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let there be no doubt about our non-Communist

stand.  So long as the Communists fought for  things

which  we all publicly believe in, so long  as  they

fought  the colonialists, we were with them. We  had

no quarrel with them. So long as they fought even as

trade  unions for the betterment of the workers,  we

had no grudge with them. But the day they decided to

betray  their  country, to betray the  ideals  which

they said they believe in, that is, Socialism,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



then  we  took  them on. So we are not fighting  the

Communists because they are Communists, but  because

they  are  actively fighting us and our  efforts  to

create   a   democratic,  non-Communist,   socialist

Malaya. The reason why we are fighting them Js  that

they  are  fighting us. They tried  to  stop  things

which  they  had believed in, and to realise  things

which  we have fought for. Once they stand  in  our

way, then we must fight them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the story, Sir, of the conflict that has

always  occurred  between  the  Communists  and  the

nationalists in every country in Asia which had been

colonial and later became independent. There comes a

time  when  they will do this - though the  Communists

might have joined in the struggle as excellent anti-colonial  fighters, under cover that  they  are  not

Communists.  But  once  they  try  to  pervert   the

nationalist  aims and bend the nationalists  to  the

Communist aims, then they come a cropper. Therefore,

Sir,  even in the few short months that the  Barisan

Sosialis  started off - they started  with  what  they

called  the Barisan Sosialis - they started  with  the

wrong  name,  a  deceptive name. They  are  not  the

Barisan  Sosialis. It is quite clear not  only  from

what  is  said  in the past, but what  is  happening

today - the  worst  thing of all - that  they  have  now

become stool-pigeons of the P.K.I. It is inevitable,

Sir,  when  once you start a political  Party  under

conditions of betrayal, that is, you betray your own

comrades.  That is the genesis of the  Barisan.  And

then  they  try to deceive the people by saying  "We

are  socialists, non-Communists", when in fact  they

are   not.  They  have  proved  it  today  by  tying

themselves up, getting instructions, and subject  to

discipline from the P.K.I. As I have said,  we  have

no  quarrel as to what the P.K.I. does in Indonesia.

That  is its business. But when the P.K.I. tries  to

interfere and intervene in our affairs, then we must

hit  out  at it, and most of all against  those  who

lend  themselves  to  be used  as  stool-pigeons  by

foreign Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, may I say again that we

are fighting not the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



Indonesian  people. We are not concerned  with  them

because so far as we know, the Indonesian people  as

such  have  made  it  quite clear  that  as  far  as

Malaysia  is concerned, they have no objection.  The

moment  Malaysia was announced, Dr  Subandrio,  the

Foreign Minister, said, "Yes, as far as Indonesia is

concerned, we have no objection to Malaysia. It is a

matter  for the peoples of the Malaysian territories

to decide." So far their stand has been intractable.

To  save the Barisan Sosialis or merely because  the

Barisan Sosialis are in great difficulty  - they  have

looked  to  the P.K.I., whatever their reasons  are.

Once they embark upon what is, to quote Lenin again,

high  treason,  then  the people  of  Malaysia,  the

people  of  Singapore, the people of the Federation,

will  have  no doubt of their attitude  towards  the

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, therefore, Sir, make one final quotation

before I end my speech, I will quote again from  the

adviser   of   the  Barisan  Sosialis,   Mr   James

Puthucheary. He had this to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists by infiltrating into open

organisations have helped in weakening  them.  Their

activities  justified the creation of these  powers,

[that  is,  the  Emergency powers] their  policy  of

infiltration  justified  the  use  of  these  powers

against open organisations.



<div align="center"><h4>* * *</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I think is the greatest damage the Communists

arc  doing  to  the  country. They  have  failed  to

provide answers [This is most important. This  is  a

man  who  has returned from Communism. He is  giving

his  views.]  They  [that is, the  Communists]  have

failed  to provide answers to the country's problems

and  they  continue to prevent others from providing

alternative answers.'



<br><br>That  is an indictment against the Communists.  They

cannot  provide the answers. But that is all  right.

But   when   they  prevent  others  from   providing

alternative  answers, "They have unwittingly"   - this

is  very important; this was written in 1957 and  it

is  true  today of the Barisan Sosialis  - "They  have

unwittingly become allies of the long-term  aims  of

the Colonial government and Right-wing politicians."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



We  notice,  Sir,  that since  its  early  days  the

Barisan  Sosialis had to run to Eden Hall  to  do  a

deal. Though they talk about anti-colonialism and so

on, they are prepared, in such a situation, to do  a

deed  with  anybody else. First, the  colonialist - to

stamp out nationalism. Now the foreign Communists - to

stamp   out  nationalism.  On  the  basis  of   that

analysis,  Sir, Mr James Puthucheary, presently  an

adviser  to  the Barisan Sosialis, gave this  advice - and very good advice too:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The task of the social democrat seems insuperable.

But for any solution it is necessary that Communists

inside and outside the open organisations have to be

fought  and  at the same time an even greater  fight

has   to  be  waged  against  colonialism  and   its

supporters.'



<br><br>Today,  Sir,  the Barisan Sosialis, the  Communists,

are  the  biggest  supporters of  the  retention  of

British  rule in the Borneo territories, because  by

breaking up Malaysia, you leave no alternative  for

the  people but to carry on under British rule, both

in  Singapore  and  in  the Borneo  territories.  So

therefore he says, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Not to fight the Communists would be to abdicate

the   right  to  help  the  country  to,  solve  her

political and economic problems, to watch helplessly

as the country moves to a civil war.'



<br><br>That   is   the   considered  view  of   Mr   James

Puthucheary, a man who has returned from  Communism.

And  writing  about  the  Communists  he  knew,  his

injunction  was, "Not to fight the Communists  would

be  to  abdicate  the right to help the  country  to

solve  her political and economic problems, to watch

helplessly as the country moves to a civil war."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thesis is that we are fighting for a Malaysia

to  help  solve  the problems of 10 million  people,

because  we  see no way out to ensure  that  the  10

million   people   become  free,  because   Malaysia

automatically ensures the departure of British  rule

from    this    territory,   because   automatically

sovereignty is transferred to the Malaysian  States;

the  British pull out, the new Malaysia States  come

in. That is the only practical solution that we know

of  to  ensure the livelihood of 10 million ordinary

people. As Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



James  Puthucheary says, the Communists, even though

they  cannot  provide  the  solution,  will  prevent

others  from providing the solution and he  says  in

that  condition a good social democrat  and  a  good

nationalist  must fight the Communists.  I  say  the

time  has  come  when the Barisan Sosialis  must  be

prepared, as other Communists in Africa and Asia are

prepared, to fight the nationalists, and in the long

run the nationalists must win.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, after hearing the  Minister  for

Culture  speak  for  2½ hours, I  feel  that  I  was

hearing the Voice of America for 2½ hours.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Aidit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But I must

congratulate the Minister for Culture on being  able

to  make  such  a  lengthy speech of  such  a  frank

nature.  The  lengthy  speech of  the  Minister  for

Culture, compared with the Four-Year Souvenir of the

P.A.P.,  all the more reflects the P.A.P. political

philosophy  and  policy thoroughly.  It  shows  more

clearly  here than the Four-Year Souvenir  issue  of

the  P.A.P. His speech enables everyone to see  more

clearly  the true nature and colour of the so-called

true  spirit  of  the  so-called  nationalists   and

socialists.  It  will enable us to know  their  true

intention.  The  whole speech of  the  Minister  for

Culture can be said to be a nonsensical piece  which

is  devoid  of any meaning. Afterwards, I will  deal

with  the  arguments  he advanced.  They  were  very

nonsensical indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now reply to the two most important

allegations  made  against  us  by  the  P.A.P.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, for the past two days, when  debating

the  question  of Malaysia, we have  seen  that  the

Ministers of the P.A.P. and the Assemblymen  of  the

P.A.P. seem to be very elated. They think that  they

have  found two strong points to be used as  weapons

to deal with us. They think they can crash the heads

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis. The two arguments  which

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



cherish as very strong weapons against us are simply

this:  First, they say the Barisan Sosialis  support

Indonesia's  move to liberate West  Irian  from  the

Dutch  colonialists. Therefore, they argue that  the

Barisan Sosialis have no reason to oppose the  Tunku

in  liberating  the  three Bornean  territories  and

Singapore from British rule. Secondly, they say that

the  Central  Executive Committee of the  Indonesian

Communist  Party  last year approved  a  resolution

condemning  and opposing the Greater Malaysia  Plan.

The  Barisan Sosialis today are also opposed to  the

Greater  Malaysia Plan. Therefore,  the  P.A.P. say

that the Barisan Sosialis' opposition to the Greater

Malaysia  Plan  is complying with the directives  of

the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us examine the first

allegation  levelled at us by the P.A.P. The  P.A.P.

say that the Barisan Sosialis are -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Dutchmen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): - Dutchmen. The

P.A.P. say that the Dutch propose to let the Papuans

in  West Irian have self-determination and,  at  the

same time, they say the Barisan Sosialis also stress

the  point that the three Bornean territories should

be given the right of self-determination. Therefore,

they  argue  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis'  attitude

towards  the three Bornean territories is just  like

the  attitude  of the Dutch towards West  Irian.  In

fact, the kind of self-determination right which  is

being discussed now is actually very different  from

that. There is some fundamental difference. Here are

two  aspects  of  the  difference.  Firstly,  it  is

imposed  from  the top, as though it is  a  kind  of

charity executed from top to bottom. Another type is

from  the bottom to the top. It is a kind of request

expressed  from  below to the  top.  It  has  to  be

attained through some kind of struggle. It has to be

fought  for. The Dutch want to give the Papuans  the

so-called right of self-determination. The intention

is really to give the right of self-determination to

the   puppets  of  the  Dutch,  namely,   the   pro-colonialists.  But the peoples of the three  Bornean

territories



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



demand  constitutional  advance.  They  are  against

British colonial rule. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  right

of  self-determination is just  like  a  knife.  The

Dutch  want  to hand over this knife to the  Papuans

who  are  their  puppets in order to cut  off  their

relationship with Indonesia. They intend to give  it

to  their  puppets  in West Irian.  But  we  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis demand that the  knife  should  be

handed  over  to  the people of  the  three  Bornean

territories in order to cut off any control that  is

imposed   on   them  by  the  British  colonialists.

Therefore,  on  the  question of self-determination,

the  stand  of the Barisan Sosialis has  never  been

contradictory. It has always been consistent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand by the Indonesians to liberate West

Irian and the question of Malaysia are different  in

nature  too. Indonesia wants to liberate West  Irian

from  the  Dutch  colonialists. The  purpose  is  to

ensure  that West Irian will not become  a  military

base of the Western colonialists in Asia. It is also

to ensure that the Papuans and the indigenous people

there  will  become equal citizens of the Indonesian

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about the Malaysia Plan? According to the

present Malaysia Plan, the result of it will be that

it  will  not  at  all affect the British  interests

militarily and economically. According to  what  has

been disclosed by the Tunku, the realisation of this

Malaysia Plan will mean the extension of the present

defence  agreement  between Malaya  and  the  United

Kingdom.  Therefore, under these circumstances,  the

United Kingdom, as a member of S.E.A.T.O., will have

the  right  to use the base here. At the same  time,

another  result of this Malaysia Plan will  be  that

that  the  people in this area will be  affected  in

that  they will not become members of an independent

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these are the two fundamental differences

between  Indonesia's liberation of  West  Irian  and

Malaysia.  We have all seen how, on the question  of

Indonesia's claim for West Irian, Western  countries

like the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



Kingdom, Australia, and America have taken the  same

unfriendly attitude towards Indonesia. These Western

powers  unanimously support the Malaysia Plan.  From

this  we  can see that this so-called Malaysia  Plan

must  be  a new kind of camouflage to cover  up  the

real  intention of the colonialists,  which  is  the

continuance  of their colonial rule.  These  Western

colonial  powers will have to adopt some new  facade

because,  at  the  present time,  the  anti-colonial

voices  have been so very loud and strong  and  they

have  no other alternative. The General Assembly  of

the  United  Nations has also approved a  resolution

appealing for the discontinuation of colonial  rule.

As  a  result of such a resolution, the position  of

the  Western  powers will become untenable  if  they

continue with their old rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another weapon used by the P.A.P. They say

that our stand is the same as that of the Indonesian

Communists. Mr Speaker, the question is not one  as

to  what opinion the Communists have. Everyone  has

eyes  to  see for himself. The Communists have  also

eyes to see for themselves. What the Communists  can

see,  can  the others not see too? Must we deny  the

fact  if  the Communists tell people what they  have

seen? Does it mean that by doing so it is democracy?

Are  the P.A.P. advancing such an argument? Everyone

needs to know the truth. We must not reject as false

what the Communists say of certain things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said in this House that what is in the interest of the people may also be advantageous to the Communists. Therefore, the approach to the question of Malaysia cannot be based on the argument that if the Communists oppose this Plan, others must not oppose it too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the factors which have helped us

come  to  a decision oil Malaysia are not Communist-inspired.  But  the  interests of  the  millions  of

people  in  this  area have led us  to  the  present

position  on  this Malaysia Plan. We of the  Barisan

Sosialis have spent a lot of time pointing  out  to

this House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



that   we  cannot  accept  the  White  Paper  merger

proposals.  We have said that they are  not  in  the

interest of the people of Singapore. In the view  of

the people of Singapore, the arrangement of this so-called Malaysia is just the same kind of arrangement

as  set out in the White Paper merger proposals. The

Malaysia Plan also does not provide for equal rights

to  the citizens of Singapore. It also restricts the

freedom of the people in travelling. Furthermore, it

is  detrimental to the development of the  socialist

forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I firmly believe that the people

of  Singapore and the three Bornean territories fear

the  Malaysia Plan not because they have  heard  the

arguments of the Communists. There are many  reasons

which  have led them to harbour fears and suspicions

in  respect  of  this Malaysia Plan.  One  of  their

worries  is  this:  that after the establishment  of

Malaysia,  there is the fear that a large number  of

the  people of Singapore will migrate to  the  other

territories. They fear that after the realisation of

Malaysia  their present economic interest will  meet

with    more   intense   competition   from    other

territories. They are also worried that the  freedom

of  religious beliefs will be restricted.  There  is

the  further fear that they may be at a disadvantage

on  the question of employment in the civil service.

There  is  also  the  fear that they  may  not  have

adequate  representation in the Central  Parliament.

These  fears  exist  because of the  present  living

conditions  of  the  people  of  Singapore  and  the

Federation of Malaya and the prevailing unemployment

situation in these two territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are further reasons why they are worried

about  this  Malaysia Plan. For instance,  When  the

Tunku  went to London to discuss this Plan with  Mr

Macmillan,  he disclosed to the reporters  that  the

first  purpose  of this Plan was to  deal  with  the

Communists.  So  it is not in the  interest  of  the

people  in  this area to shake off the rule  of  the

colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tunku also said in London that if in future the

British  wanted Labuan, in North Borneo, they  could

use it as a military base. From this you can see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



that  even before the Tunku had the right to control

the   three  Borneo  territories,  he  had   already

promised  that Labuan would be handed  over  to  the

British for use as a military base. When the  people

heard this, they could not help but have suspicions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that today no one is

opposed to the concept of Malaysia. The question is:

what are the contents of the Malaysia plan? What  is

its  form?  What steps should be taken  to  approach

this  plan  and what kind of arrangement  should  be

taken  in  respect  of  time? According  to  present

indications,  the Governments of Singapore  and  the

Federation of Malaya want to rush through this plan,

and this will give cause for the people to have some

doubts as to the interests of this plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that the strongest

Party  in  Sarawak  is the Sarawak  United  People's

Party.  On  8th  July,  1961, they  issued  a  brief

announcement saying that any question which proposes

unification with Malaya should be decided upon  only

after  Sarawak  has decided on its  own  future  and

after it has attained independence. We have heard of

a   political  Party  called  the  White  Kalimantan

People's  Party. On 30th November, 1961, this  Party

cabled  to  London  to protest against  the  Tunku's

discussion  with  Mr Macmillan on the  question  of

Malaysia.  I have to stress here that the leader  of

this Party which issued this protest is one who  has

been  described  by  our Prime Minister  as  a  non-Communist nationalist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, during these two days of debate we have heard many things about the duties of a socialist. We have also heard the arguments propounded on the keen desire of the socialists and certain other kind-hearted people to rescue the peoples of these territories from British colonial

rule. Let me ask these so-called socialists: why  do

they not want to let the three Borneo territories be

united  together,  and  be an independent  political

unit? Why do they not accept such a concept? Why  do

they not agree to the request to let the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



three Borneo territories first get independence? Why

cannot  they  let  the three territories  be  united

together as one independent unit and so come out  of

colonial  rule  before talking about  Malaysia  with

them? I am surprised, and I feel strange, that these

so-called   socialists  should  behave  like   elder

brothers  rushing forward to protect the peoples  of

the three Borneo territories, scrambling to liberate

them and force them to adopt the same way of life as

we have now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To talk blindly about the safeguards of the rights

of  the  people  of the three Borneo territories  is

useless.  Socialists  must use  concrete  facts  and

examples  to  attract  people  to  their  side.   If

socialists in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya

can  raise the standard of living of the peoples  of

these  two  territories to  such  a  level  as  that

existing  in Elysium, then I believe the peoples  in

the  three Borneo territories would be very glad  to

join in the Malaysia plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the present important task

of  a  true nationalist and a true socialist is  not

just to see the expansion of his own territory,  but

to  concentrate his strength to ensure that  in  his

own country the workers and farmers can be liberated

from  exploitation  by foreign  capitalists  and  to

enable  his  own  country  to  stand  firm   as   an

independent self-governing country, in the spirit of

the Afro-Asian countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has said that

many  Assemblymen  of the Barisan  Sosialis  do  not

quite understand what is Communism. But on the topic

of  socialism,  we  have  never  heard  of  such   a

socialist  argument as that small nations can  never

exist by themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I reply to certain

arguments put forward by the Minister for Culture, I

will  say something about the amendment proposed  by

the  Member  for  Anson. We in the Barisan  Sosialis

cannot support this amendment to the motion. We  are

not  opposed  to  the concept of  Greater  Malaysia;

neither are we opposed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



such  a  plan. But we oppose because the  Tunku,  in

moving  his  motion in the Federal Parliament,  said

clearly that he could not accept Singapore into  the

Federation  of  Malaya - if it  meant  giving  Federal

citizenship  rights to the people of  Singapore.  He

said  clearly  that he could only  accept  Singapore

into  the Federation as a partner. If the Tunku,  in

moving   his   motion,  did  not  make  such   clear

statement,  then we would be very much  prepared  to

support  what he said, a Malaysian concept.  I  said

just now that we are of the opinion that the Greater

Malaysia  Plan is after all the same as  the  merger

proposals contained in the White Paper. So  we  feel

that  if,  on  the one hand, we refused  this  White

Paper  and, on the other hand, accepted the  Greater

Malaysia  Plan, it would create a lot of  confusion.

Otherwise  it would mean that we are not sincere  in

safeguarding   the  interest  of   the   people   of

Singapore. The P.A.P. like to talk very much about a

mandate.  But  they  have  forgotten  that  on   the

question of Greater Malaysia, we have no such  thing

as  a  mandate from the people of Singapore. If they

are so very much concerned and pay so much attention

to  the question of a mandate from the people,  then

they  should not act in an arbitrary manner and make

decisions for the people of Singapore on their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for Culture

mentioned two good points in his speech. First,  he

asked the people of Singapore why there should be  a

Malaysia  plan; and if there were no Malaysia,  what

would  happen to them? Well, we appeal to the people

of  Singapore  to  think very carefully  about  this

question.  They  must not forget that  it  has  been

posed  by  the  P.A.P. itself.  If  the  people  can

visualise the position in which the P.A.P. will  be

placed  in  the absence of Malaysia, then they  will

understand  why the P.A.P. is today very interested,

enthusiastic  but  worried about  Malaysia.  If  the

people can think about this question, then they will

be able to find a correct answer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture in his speech just now and the Minister for Home Affairs in his speech yesterday stressed the recent talk given by the Prime Minister of England, Mr Macmillan, to the people of England. The U.K. Prime Minister said to his own people that Britain had become a third-class power. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a fact. Mr

Macmillan  himself admitted it.  But  when  he  said

this,  it did not mean that Britain was prepared  to

give up its interest in colonial countries. He said

such things in order to encourage and to arouse  the

vigilance of the British people and instil  in  them

greater  efforts  and that they  should  adopt  more

cunning  means  to  deal with  the  world  situation

today. Mr Macmillan said this not only with a  view

to encouraging his own people to accept and face the

challenge  of  Communism, but also with  a  view  to

reminding  his  own people of the  economic  rivalry

coming  from America, Japan and other North European

countries.  And  so  to explain  the  words  of  Mr

Macmillan  as an automatic and voluntary  withdrawal

of the colonial influence is tantamount to deceiving

the  people  and the world on behalf of the  British

colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture just now also touched upon certain strange theories. According to his theory, small countries will not be able to survive. They will not be able to have a stable currency. If his theory is accepted, then I think countries such as Switzerland and Belgium, should not have existed at all. They should better have been merged with

Germany  or America. This kind of argument does  not

hold water. I think this kind of argument is similar

to  the  argument used by Hitler and the Fascist.  I

hope very sincerely that I will be able to hear from

the  Minister for Finance later on. I hope  he  will

reply  from  the  economic  point  of  view  in  the

political  analysis as to how and why a big  country

with  large  tracts  of land  should  not  have  any

economic  problems. His colleague, the Minister  for

Culture,  seems to be telling us that if  the  three

Borneo  territories can be merged  and  united  with

Singapore and Malaya, then there will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



every  chance of prosperity and everything  will  be

all  right.  But the fact remains that even  if  the

Malaysia   plan   materialises,   what   about   the

resources,  the  area  of land and  the  population?

Well,  all  this taken together will not  be  bigger

than  America,  India or Australia. So  I  hope  the

Minister for Finance will be able to enlighten us as

to  why  in  these big countries which are  full  of

natural  resources, there is still  in  existence  a

very great unemployment problem. There are still  in

existence economic problems. Why? Why is that people

in these countries are not able to live in paradise?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to

the  historian Gibbon, history is a chronicle of the

crimes, follies and misfortunes of men. Not everyone

will  accept this dictum of Gibbon as true  of  all

history of all mankind. But in certain countries and

at certain times, the conduct of certain men is such

as   to  lend  support  to  Gibbon's  definition  of

history. I believe it applies to our own country  at

the  present  time and in regard to the  conduct  of

certain  people. The people I have in mind are  none

other  than the Communists and their stooges in  the

Barisan  Sosialis;  and the episodes  which  I  will

relate  concern their sayings and actions in  regard

to the Greater Malaysia Plan. I propose to show what

crimes  the  Communists and  their  stooges  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis were prepared to commit  to  fight

Malaysia,   their  folly  in  so   doing   and   the

misfortunes that await them now that they  had  done

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This house has been treated, in this debate on

Malaysia,  to  the  usual Barisan Sosialis  fare  of

wilful  misrepresentation of truths, large  servings

of  half-truths  generously  spiced  with  downright

untruths.  But I am not concerned with the  tracking

down    of    each    and    everyone    of    these

misrepresentations. To do so would be  a  monumental

task. Nor shall I dwell at length on the general  or

specific  arguments Which they have put forward.  My

colleagues will deal with them in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to go behind the facade of the arguments

which  they have put forward, hut which they do  not

really   believe  in, and  probe  into   the   real

motivations  which  have led  them  to  oppose  both

merger and Malaysia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My narrative begins on Saturday, 27th of May, when

the  Prime  Minister  of the  Federation  of  Malaya

addressed the Foreign Correspondents Association  in

Singapore. He delivered a lengthy speech in which he

described  some of the problems and achievements  of

the  Federation Government since Merdeka. But  there

were  two significant passages in his speech.  These

passages  were both brief. The first was a  friendly

reference to Singapore made in such a way as to give

hopes   for  the  first  time  that  the  Federation

Government  was prepared to take in Singapore  in  a

merger.  Prophetically, the  Tunku  seemed  to  have

foreseen  trouble  with the Communists  over  merger

because it demanded a loyalty to the Malayan way  of

life.  May I quote the first significant passage  of

the Tunku's statement (Sunday Times, 28th May):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For us in Malaya, and I include Singapore in my

remarks, loyalty to the Malayan ideal of the way  of

life  is fundamental. There can be no half-way house

in  loyalty. No one ever becomes happy by trying  to

make  the best of two worlds. People who think  they

are  trying  to ensure the future by  trying  to  be

friendly  with the communists on the  one  hand  and

with the Governments of Federation and Singapore  on

the  other, are sure to end up losing one way or the

other.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second passage consists of two sentences. But

it  is  these  two  sentences which  gave  birth  to

Malaysia not merely as a theoretical concept but  as

a  practical  proposition. May  I  read  the  second

passage. The Tunku said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sooner or later she (the Federation of Malaya)

should  have an understanding with Britain  and  the

peoples  of  the  territories of Singapore,  Borneo,

Brunei  and Sarawak. It is premature for me  to  say

now  how  this closer understanding can  be  brought

about,  but  it is inevitable that they should  look

ahead  to this objective and think of a plan whereby

these territories can be brought closer together  in

political and economic cooperation.'



<br><br>That was all the Tunku said on Malaysia, but it  set

in  train  a  series of events which  were  to  have

profound and far-reaching consequences. The  Tunku's

proposal  on Malaysia, tentative though  it  was  at

that time, was one of the principal factors that led

to the open break between the Communists and the non-Communists in the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tunku spoke on the 27th May, some 2½ weeks

before nomination day for the Anson by-election. The

next development was a statement signed by six trade

union   leaders   in  the  Communist   open   front

organisation  headed  by Mr Lim  Ching  Siong.  The

statement  was  published on the 3rd June.  By  that

time,  general interest in Malaysia had been aroused

not only in Singapore but in all five territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement of these six trade union leaders, if

taken  at  its  face value, was unexceptionable.  It

pledged the support of the unions in the by-election

for  the  P.A.P. on the grounds of its anti-colonial

record.  It then went on to say that the six leaders

were  convinced that the most practical solution  to

the  present  political setbacks  lies  in  the  new

constitution.  They  further  said  and  here  I  am

quoting  the actual words as recorded in the Straits

Times, 3rd of June: "What we are clamouring for this

time  is  a  genuinely full internal self-government

not  only  in  name  but also in fact.  A  popularly

elected  Government must exercise  all  rights  over

matters  of internal security. The Internal Security

Council must be abolished." There was absolutely  no

reference  to Malaysia, although Malaysia  was  then

the burning political topic of the day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming as it did on the eve of a critical by-election, the statement was of grave importance. We

can  discount its face value but we must probe  into

its  inner meaning. When Malaysia was the main issue

of   the  day  the  silence  on  this  subject   was

significant.  It  was obvious that the  message  was

intended  to be conveyed to the P.A.P. non-Communist

group  that the condition of the support  which  Mr

Lim  Ching Siong and his trade unions were  prepared

to  give  to  the  P.A.P. was that  we  must  ignore

Malaysia as an issue in the by-election, instead  we

should aim for internal self-government as the  next

stage  of  our constitutional development  with  the

local   Government  having  powers   over   internal

security.  In  plain words, what the Communists  had

told us was simply this: "Do not support Malaysia or

else we shall kick your teeth down your throat."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. took some time to ponder over the real

meaning of the statement. It became clear to us that

on   this  issue,  if  both  sides  maintain   their

respective  stands,  there  must  eventually  be   a

parting  of  ways. The Communists were  clearly  not

interested in merger or Malaysia because they feared

that  a  strong central government would take action

to  curb  them. They wanted Singapore to be isolated

under  conditions which would permit them to develop

it into a Communist stronghold in South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 9th June the Deputy Prime Minister declared

the  stand of the P.A.P. on this issue. He said that

in  the  1963  constitutional talks, we intended  to

seek  independence through merger  under  conditions

which would give Singapore autonomy in education and

labour.  He further indicated that if Malaysia  were

to speed up merger, then the P.A.P. would support it

in  principle. In plain language, the reply we  gave

to  the  Communists was, in effect, "you  chaps  can

take a running jump off Clifford Pier."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So nomination day, the 10th June, came around with

the two sides having taken positions - the P.A.P. for

independence through merger within Malaysia if need

be; the Communists for the continuation of

colonialism in Singapore provided the British were

prepared to relinquish control over internal

security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 24th June, Mr Lim Ching Siong wrote a

letter to the Straits Times and underlined his

original point. He said and I quote from the Straits

Times, 24th June, page 10;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Colonialism makes itself felt in Singapore via

the Internal Security Council. We have found it

necessary to point the way ahead more concretely by

our claim for the abolition of the Internal Security

Council and the achievement of full Internal self-government.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are no two ways about it, Mr Speaker,

Sir, The P.A.P. won the elections in 1959, and the

main political platform was that we shall attempt to

achieve independence through merger as the next

constitutional step for Singapore. In the by-election the Communists tried to pressure us into

going back on the word that we had given, to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



electorate and instead have a more limited target as

the next constitutional step.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the by-election progressed (the two sides having

taken  their  respective  positions)  a  series   of

strange  events occurred in Singapore. On  the  26th

June three British Governors flew in from the Borneo

territories. The ostensible purpose of  their  visit

was  stated  to  be a discussion over  the  Malaysia

proposals.  After three or four days, the  Governors

departed as ostentatiously as they had arrived. By a

coincidence, Tunku Abdul Rahman paid a visit to  the

Borneo  territories at about this time. A  few  days

later the Earl of Selkirk left Singapore, ostensibly

for  London  to discuss the Malaysia proposals  with

Cabinet Ministers in London. But I have heard since,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, that the Earl of  Selkirk  never

went  much further than Rangoon. Be that as it  may,

these  ostentatious movements of  the  British  pro-consuls  had  the effect that the British  intended.

The  Communists became convinced that agreement  had

been  reached between the Governments of  Singapore,

the Federation and Great Britain over Malaysia. They

became  visibly more and more agitated as  the  days

passed   by.   This  agitation  spread   to   former

Parliamentary Secretaries of the Government who have

now  defected to the Barisan Sosialis and  who  were

then   under  very  heavy  pressure  from  Communist

groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Parliamentary Secretaries implored their

Ministers  to  let them into the secret.  They  were

convinced that the Malaysia Plan had been worked out

in  detail  and that the agreement had been  signed,

sealed  and  delivered. Each time they  entered  the

office  of  a  Minister, they  would  look  somewhat

suspiciously at his safe obviously wondering whether

the secret document was locked up there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, events hotted up outside. On the

8th of July, the General Employees Union - the largest

of  the Communist open front trade unions -  announced

its  full agreement and support for the stand of the

six trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



unionists led by Mr Lim Ching Siong in their demand

for  a  genuinely  complete internal self-government

and  the abolition of the Internal Security Council.

There  was  to  be  no  nonsense  about  merger   or

Malaysia. The statement also said that this  minimum

demand should be obtained at the 1963 constitutional

talks in London between Great Britain and Singapore,

and  when  the  time  is  ripe  and  the  conditions

conducive,  then we should advance another  step  to

achieve  merger. No definition of what is  meant  by

"when the time is ripe and the conditions conducive"

was attempted in the statement, but having heard the

exposition   of  my  colleague,  the  Minister   for

Culture,  on Communist double-talk, I think  we  can

attempt a shrewd guess as to exactly what they  mean

by these words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, until then, the Communists and the non-Communists in the P.A.P. had avoided a frontal

clash.  The  Communist had hitherto  only  withdrawn

support  from  the P.A.P. in the Anson  by-election.

But  on  the 11th of July, the long-delayed  head-on

collision  took  place  and this  occurred,  of  all

places,  at  the University of Malaya.  The  Student

Socialist  Club  held a forum on  merger  which  was

distinguished  by  bitter recrimination  between  S.

Woodhull on the side of the Communists and Mr Devan

Nair speaking for the non-Communists of the P.A.P. I

do  not wish to go into the details of that forum as

the  subject  of  the  debate  was  merger  and  not

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this open clash, the Communists decided to

intervene in a big way to fight the P.A.P. at Anson.

They  had  been  alarmed that  their  withdrawal  of

support from the P.A.P. and their indirect attack on

the  policies  of the Government did  not  have  the

effect  that  they  wanted. They decided  then  that

whatever the cost they must ensure the defeat of the

P.A.P. candidate who was one of their colleagues  in

the  trade  union movement and a former Chairman  of

the  T.U.C. Central Council of which the six leaders

were  members.  So on the 14th of  July,  six  trade

unionists enlarged the issue and laid great emphasis

on four points which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



they  had  earlier mentioned in the  course  of  the

Anson  by-election.  These  four  points  were:  (1)

release  all  political detainees  immediately;  (2)

scrap  the  Internal Security Council and  institute

full  internal  self-government;  (3)  assist  in  a

speedy reunification of the trade union movement and

grant  citizenship and franchise to those  loyal  to

the anti-colonial struggle; and (4) allow freedom of

Press,  speech,  assembly, etc. At  the  same  time,

eight  P.A.P. Assemblymen were induced to commit  an

act  of  gross treachery and betrayal. They  sent  a

letter   to  the  Party  Chairman  asking   that   a

conference  of  Party branches be  held  to  discuss

certain matters. There was nothing wrong in this  if

they  really  believed what they  stated,  that  is,

there   was  inadequate  consultation  between   the

leadership  and the rank and file in the Party.  But

these  eight Assemblymen, beaded by the  Member  for

Queenstown, arranged to get the widest publicity for

this  letter  two  days  before  polling  day.  They

released it to the Press. Their intention was clear.

Just  two days before polling day, they deliberately

launched  this  treacherous  assault  on  the  Party

clearly  in the hope and expectation that  it  would

have  an adverse effect on our chances in the  Anson

by-election. There is a significant passage in  this

letter which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We agree with the six trade union members in

their  advocacy  of  the four minimum  anti-colonial

measures  and the minimum constitutional demand  for

genuinely full internal self-government by 1963.'



<br><br>This  final act of betrayal had the effect that  was

intended. The candidate met with defeat though by  a

poor  margin. The number of voters who were confused

by  this  treachery and abstained  from  voting  was

three times the margin of defeat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists had in the meantime launched an all-out assault on the organisation of the P.A.P.

Assemblymen  were  approached  and  pressured   into

denouncing  the  Party and in particular  the  Party

leadership.  Organising Secretaries  became  special

targets   of   pressure  and  intimidation.   Branch

Committee  members were similarly worked  on.  Large

numbers of them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



succumbed  to  pressure, persuation or intimidation.

The  fortunes of the Party were then at  the  lowest

ebb  in its history. It had suffered in two critical

by-elections. The Party organisation was in a  state

of  shambles  due to the defection of  most  of  its

Organising  Secretaries and substantial  numbers  of

its   Branch   Committees.  The  loyalty   of   many

Assemblymen and Parliamentary Secretaries could  not

be  counted upon. The Communists had made good their

threat to deliver a kick in the teeth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, by all accounts, the Government should

have fallen and general elections taken place, which

was   the  object  of  this  whole  operation.   And

accordingly, three days after polling day,  we  find

the  great  anti-colonial heroes -  Messrs. Lim  Ching

Siong,  S.  Woodhull,  Fong  Swee  Suan  and  J.  J.

Puthucheary  - going to Eden Hall to seek an interview

with  the  Earl of Selkirk. Doubtless they were  now

fully convinced that the P.A.P. Government had  been

dealt a mortal blow and they were ready to take over

the  reins of Government. The famous Eden Hall  tea-party  was  not  the first occasion on  which  these

great  anti-colonialists exchanged views  and  drank

tea  with  representatives of the British  Raj.  The

Prime  Minister has already given an account of  how

over  a  period of time the officials  of  the  U.K.

Commission  had  been cultivating these  people.  He

also explained that the British on their part wanted

the  Communists to believe that they can  take  over

power  in  Singapore  provided they  play  the  game

constitutionally  and  provided   they   leave   the

military  bases  alone. In the British  calculation,

once the Communists believed it, they would then  be

bold  enough  to leave the protecting  wing  of  the

P.A.P. and launch out on their own, if necessary, in

conflict  with the P.A.P., which they were confident

of  scrubbing  out. Now the British had  sensed  the

conflict of policy and views of these two groups - the

non-Communists and the Communists in the P.A.P. over

Malaysia.  They decided to exploit this conflict  to

the  maximum  and in so doing they depended  on  the

suspicious  nature of the Communists and their  fear

of  Greater Malaysia. Viewing matters in retrospect,

I am led to the conclusion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



that  the  ostentatious arrivals and  departures  of

Governors  and High Commissioners staged during  the

Anson by-election was merely a British ruse to  draw

out the Communists. Certainly in my discussions with

Ministers  of  the Government of the  Federation  of

Malaya,  I  am unable to see any reference  to  what

these  Governors had discussed, the policy they  had

defined,  or even any clarification of what happened

during that period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Communists had foolishly allowed themselves

to  be  deceived  into believing that  Malaysia  was

already  at hand and that all arrangements had  been

fixed.  And they were going to be fixed. As a result

of  this  belief, they went berserk. And so on  18th

July  they  saw  the British Supremo at  Eden  Hall,

doubtless to find out what the next step should  be,

now  that  they  thought that the  P.A.P. had  been

delivered  a knockout punch. Sir, unfortunately  for

them the non-Communist P.A.P., whom they had derided

as  soft  and  petty  bourgeois,  possessed  greater

staying  powers  than they had suspected.  Far  from

collapsing, we decided to stand up and slug  it  out

with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we pondered over the statements of the Trade

Union  Six  of 3rd June, we had decided that  should

there  be  a  parting of ways between the Communists

and  the non-Communists in the Party, then the issue

of  Malaysia and merger was from our point  of  view

the  best possible one on which to part company. All

genuine  nationalists want to see the  growth  of  a

great   united  prosperous  nation  with   a   large

population   and   extensive   national   resources.

Malaysia  lends  itself naturally as an  independent

sucessor State to the former British Empire in  this

part  of the world. For the Communists to break with

us on this issue was to force them eventually into a

position  of  isolation from the Malayan nationalist

movement.   Their   pretensions   to   be   national

revolutionary leaders would then be exposed. I shall

discuss  later the absurd and contradictory position

to which the Communists and their stooges in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



Barisan  Sosialis  have  been  reduced  in  opposing

Malaysia.  Now, when the Communists found that  they

had  failed  to capture and destroy the  Party,  and

failed  to  topple  the  Government,  they  had   no

alternative  but  to  group  themselves  and   their

sympathisers together in a separate Party named  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  or  Socialist  Front.   A   more

appropriate name, of course, is Barisan Komunis,  or

Communist Front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists then realised that in opposing

merger   and  Malaysia,  they  had  made  a  serious

political blunder. So they tried to wriggle  out  of

the  position by pretending that they wanted merger.

But  the conditions which they laid down for  merger

were  carefully calculated to be such that they were

unacceptable to the Federation Government, and known

to  be unacceptable to the Federation Government  by

the Communists who proposed them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Malaysia, it was during Anson that they

stated  that  Malaysia was not part  of  the  P.A.P.

election programme, and we therefore had no business

to  give  it support. Subsequently even on  Malaysia

they changed their stand. On 30th August the Barisan

Sosialis issued a statement clarifying the position.

The  statement was signed by the Chairman. It  is  a

document  of  considerable importance. I  intend  to

read  a  fairly lengthy quotation from the statement

as published in the Straits Times of 30th August. On

page 18, the Barisan Sosialis stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The way ahead for real reunification was in one

of two directions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. An immediate full and complete merger with

Singapore  joining the Federation as  a  constituent

State, like Penang or Malacca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. As an autonomous unit within a confederation

with Borneo territories coming in when possible.



<div align="center"><h4>* * *</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with Malaysia, the statement said that as

a  stage to eventual merger, Barisan Sosialis  would

accept   a   constitutional   arrangement   for    a

confederation  within which Singapore  would  be  an

autonomous  unit,  with full  autonomy  in  internal

matters,  including internal security, and conceding

by treaty the fields of external affairs and defence

to the Federation Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrative and constitutional difficulties

in  the way of achieving merger or confederation may

cause  some  delay, but while this was  going  on  a

great  anti-colonial struggle must  be  launched  to

abolish the Internal Security Council and wrest  the

right  of self-determination from the colonial power

by 1963.'



<br><br>In  other words, a great anti-colonial struggle must

be  launched  in  order  to  ensure  that  Singapore

remains a colony by 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us ponder on the implications

of  this statement. I will not deal with the section

on  merger with the Federation, as this has  already

been  debated at length in this Chamber. On Malaysia

the  Barisan Sosialis accepted the idea of  Malaysia

provided: the Constitution of Malaysia was  a  loose

one,  namely, a confederation. As an aside,  I  must

say and I must confess with some surprise, that none

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  speakers  seem  to  have

remembered  this  important policy  statement  which

they  issued  last August. Within this confederation

Singapore  would be an autonomous unit.  Here  again

the familiar refrain occurs  - an autonomous unit with

full autonomy in internal matters including internal

security.  But more important, the Barisan  did  not

regard    this   confederation   with   the   Borneo

territories as a matter of any urgency. There was no

need  to hurry. "What we must do," according to this

statement,  "was  to have internal  self-government

with   the   abolition  of  the  Internal   Security

Council."  So once again they turned to their  first

love.  In fact, the only love, when we come to that,

is a semi-colonial Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal security has clearly become an obsession

with the Communists and their stooges in the Barisan

Sosialis.  They seem to be entranced and  hypnotized

by this subject. Of course, everybody knows that for

them this is the real heart of the matter. They  are

not   worried   about  citizenship  or   labour   or

education,  though they pretend to be so.  They  are

prepared  to  drop labour and education,  ditch  the

workers and the Chinese schools any time in exchange

for  internal  security in the hope that  this  will

save their own skin.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



Non-Communist  socialists  who  do  not  depend   on

support  of  the  Communists and  their  open  front

organisations  for  political  power  have  a  clear

conscience  in these matters. They are not  troubled

by  special powers which the Government must have in

security  matters,  for they  know  that  these  are

intended to deal with Communist subversion, not with

democratic socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is the net result that the Communists

have  achieved as a result of their policy and stand

on  Malaysia? As I have demostrated conclusively, it

was  motivated purely by fear over internal security

matters. The first result is their breakway from the

P.A.P.  When they thought that Malaysia was  already

in  the  bag, they came to the conclusion  that  the

only  way  to  stop it was to break the  Government.

Then  they  would take over the reins of  Government

and undo the whole arrangement on Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first result of this policy was the open break

with the non-Communist Left. We of the non-Communist

Left felt, even in our moments of dire anxiety after

Anson,  profoundly relieved at their departure  from

our  ranks  over a dispute on a plainly  nationalist

issue.  While  they are attempting  to  portray  the

P.A.P. Government as reactionary, pro-colonial,  and

singularly  hostile  towards them,  they  must  have

realised  that during the period that they  were  in

partnership  with us, they were able to  consolidate

their position in the trade union field and in rural

and  cultural  organisations. We as a  non-Communist

government  naturally had to take certain safeguards

to ensure that their consolidation was not too solid

and  their expansion not too rapid. But I would  say

that under the P.A.P. they had it so good. They  had

no  fear of being repressed. Now that they have left

us,  they  must  fend for themselves  and  face  the

future themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second result is their political isolation in

all  national issues, of which the issue of Malaysia

is  an outstanding example. In their desperation  to

seek  cover,  the Communists have even attempted  to

make use of non-political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



Right-wing   organisations,  such  as  the   Chinese

Chamber  of Commerce, the Chinese guilds and  clans'

associations.  En  this  effort  they  have   failed

dismally.  I  think  I have briefly  dwelt  on  this

subject in this House on a previous occasion when  I

described Round 5 between the Communists and the non-Communists in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third result is that the Communists are placed

in  a  completely  false position on  the  important

political  issues  of the day.  Sir,  I  referred  a

moment  ago to the absurd and contradictory position

to  which  they  have  been reduced  on  nationalist

issues, such as Malaysia. My colleague, the Minister

for Culture, has rightly called them the Dutchmen of

Singapore. The Dutch wanted the principle  of  self-determination  to be observed in  West  Irian  as  a

means of delaying independence for West Irian by the

transfer to an independent Indonesian government. In

exactly  the  same way, the Barisan Sosialis  wanted

the principle of self-determination to be applied in

Malaysia  in  respect of the Borneo territories.  We

have  had that said in so many plain words by  their

Chairman,  the  Member for Queenstown.  Whereas  the

people of Singapore and the P.A.P. want independence

and  merger, the Communists and their stooges in the

Barisan  Sosialis  have  consistently  pressed   for

internal self-government provided that they can save

their own skins under a semi-colonial Singapore, and

they want to frustrate Malaysia by appealing to  the

principle  of self-determination which they  roundly

denounced when proposed by the Dutch for West Irian.

Do  they  not  understand  the  absurdity  of  their

position?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that the Communists have allowed

themselves  to be reduced to such a pathetic  state?

Students  of  the  history of the  Asian  revolution

would not be surprised at this. This is nothing  new

and  there are parallels in other countries in Asia.

May  I  refer  to  just one of them?  This  occurred

during World War II in India. When the war broke out

in October 1939, the Indian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



Nationalist  leaders headed by  Mahatma  Gandhi  and

Pandit  Nehru  opposed India's entry into  the  war.

They stated that this war did not concern them.  The

Communist  Party of India too at that time  declared

that the war was an imperialist war, that is to say,

a war between capitalist countries in a dispute over

imperial possessions. Both the nationalists and  the

Communists  in India were locked up as a  result  of

their opposition to the British war effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the Soviet Union entered the war in 1941,

the  Indian  Communist Party performed an  immediate

political somersault. The imperialist war became  an

anti-Fascist  war  because the Soviet  Union,  their

ideological   fatherland,  was  attacked   by   Nazi

Germany.  The  Indian Communists were then  released

from  gaol to collaborate with the British  Imperial

Government in India to support the war effort, while

the  nationalist leaders remained in gaol. And I  am

told,  Mr Speaker, Sir, by Indian students  whom  I

met  in  England, that at that time the  nationalist

leaders in Congress were trying to mount strikes  to

stop  production and injure the British War  effort.

But the Communist organised strike breakers in a big

way  to  help  the Imperial masters and  defeat  the

workers   led   by  the  nationalist  leaders.   The

subservience  of the National Communist  Parties  to

foreign  causes  and  foreign  governments  is  well

known. On Malaysia, it is becoming more apparent now

that  the stand of the Communist and the stooges  in

the  Barisan  Sosialis is dictated not only  by  the

desire  for  self-preservation,  but  also  by   the

strategy of Communist Parties abroad. The opposition

to  Malaysia by our local Communists runs so closely

to the policy of the Indonesian Communist Party. The

declaration  of  the  P.K.I.  (Indonesian   Communist

Party)   on  the  subject  has  only  been  recently

published and it deserves the closest study.  It  is

now becoming clear to everyone how close the Barisan

Sosialis   position   on   Malaysia   follows    the

declaration  of the P.K.I. Is this a coincidence  or

is  it  the  result  of contacts and  organisational

arrangements between the Communists in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



Singapore and the Communists in Indonesia? This is a

subject that deserves the closest attention. We know

for a fact that last month, important members of the

Communist    front   organisations   in   Singapore,

including   the  Vice  Chairman  of  Party   Rakyat,

attended   an  important  political  conference   in

Djakarta,  at  which leading members of  the  P.K.I.

were present. Doubtless the Singapore Communists had

taken  advantage  of  this visit  to  effect  secret

connections  with the P.K.I. We cannot,  of  course,

expect  them to admit this and disclose the details.

Nevertheless,  we  should be  on  the  look-out  for

influences from abroad on the political line of  the

Communists   and  their  stooges  in   the   Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me sum up my arguments. What I am saying

amounts to this. The Communists and their stooges in

the Barisan Sosialis and other Communists open front

organisations have only one political  objective  in

the  recent past and at the present moment, and that

is  to  avoid  security action which they  fear  and

expect  would be taken against them after merger  of

Malaysia.  To  secure  this  objective,   they   are

prepared to see the continuation of colonial rule in

Singapore, provided the Internal Security Council is

abolished.  To this end they sought the  counsel  of

the  U.K. Commission, who egged them on in their mad

adventure. During the Anson by-election,  they  were

panicked into the belief that Malaysia had all  been

buttoned up. This belief, which in the event  turned

out to be a false alarm, caused them to run amok and

break  away  from  the P.A.P. This has  resulted  in

their fully exposed and isolated position today  and

the  very  dangers which they sought to escape  from

now  looms  larger and more immediate  than  before.

Truly we can agree with Gibbon that in this instance

the  crimes  which  they have perpetuated - crimes  of

treachery and betrayal of their comrades as a result

of    their   folly - will   bring   upon   themselves

misfortunes of their own making.



<br><br>7.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today

we  see  that the P.A.P. Government is adopting  the

same tactics and same propaganda tactics of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



the  S.P.A.  In 1959, before the general  elections,

the  Lim Yew Hock Government tried to boost  up  its

prestige  by holding a grand exposition  at  Kallang

Park.  It  was  quite obvious that the former  Chief

Minister  then  hoped that with all the  lights  and

splendour  of  the exposition the  people  would  be

misled into believing that everything was fine under

the  S.P.A.  Government. Today  we  see  the  P.A.P.

putting up grand concerts on Chinese New Year Eve in

order  to  celebrate the P.A.P.'s  Malaysia  scheme.

Sir,  we  see the same amount of light and splendour

now  as during the S.P.A. exposition. Evidently  the

P.A.P. hopes that by having this exposition, the so-called  Malaysia scheme, the people will be  misled.

The  P.A.P.  Government think that they can  mislead

the people into believing that their future will  be

as bright as the decorations being put up for the so-called  Malaysia concert. It will enable the  P.A.P.

propaganda  to misrepresent anyone who goes  to  see

the  lights  as  showing support for their  Malaysia

scheme.  Sir, the P.A.P. Government think that  they

can  mislead  the people into believing  that  their

future  will be as bright as the decorations put  up

for  the so-called Malaysia concert. But just as the

artificial lights did not save the S.P.A. Government

from  their doom, the latest P.A.P. propaganda  will

not  save  the P.A.P. Government from being drowned.

Our  people know well what the sell-out plan  means.

This sell-out plan is merger or Malaysia. The people

of  Singapore  know  that  their  future  under  the

P.A.P.'s  so-called merger or Malaysia  will  be  as

dark  as  the padang itself when the concert  lights

are  switched  off.  The people see  in  the  P.A.P.

Malaysia plan as something good to look at  but  not

good to eat. Sir, this Malaysia plan turns out to be

nothing  but  a piece of white paper  on  which  the

desperate P.A.P. politicians wish to sign  away  the

interest  of the people in order to save  their  own

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as my Party Chairman, the Member for

Queenstown,  said yesterday, we must not  fall  into

the  P.A.P. propaganda trap of crying high  and  low

about   the   principle  of  Malaysia.  The   P.A.P.

Government wants everybody to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



trapped into the so-called principle of Malaysia  in

order  to  deceive the people that they believe  the

P.A.P.  Malaysia scheme. It is regrettable that  the

Workers'  Party and the U.P.P. have fallen into  the

propaganda trap of the P.A.P.
