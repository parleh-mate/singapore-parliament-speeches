and  pray that I may prove myself worthy  of  that

honour.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, may I, on behalf

of   this   House,  congratulate   you   on   your

appointment   as   Speaker  to   the   Legislative

Assembly? Mr Speaker, you are well known  to  the

people  of  Singapore, having served in  different

capacities in the public service of the community.

You  were  Municipal Commissioner  and  Councillor

from  1947  to 1957 for a period of ten years.  So

also  you  were  on the Board of Trustees  of  the

S.I.T. for eight years. You were a member of  the

Raffles   College  Council  and  member   of   the

University of Malaya Council from 1955 to 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, Mr Speaker, have come to this House not as

a stranger. We ourselves on this side of the House

are familiar with you, for you sat on the opposite

side  of  the  House, Probably you  were  the  one

Member on the Opposition Benches in those days who

assiduously   studied  his  Bills  and   did   his

homework.  For  that,  Sir, you  have  earned  our

respect.  I am sure, Mr Speaker, your familiarity

with  the Standing Orders and the workings of  the

Assembly  will no doubt qualify you most admirably

to  discharge  the  functions of  Speaker  of  the

Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I say, Mr Speaker, I notice that

in  your biography, besides playing football,  you

are  also a great cricket and hockey player.  Your

predecessor was also an expert in the English game

of  cricket.  He  did his part well  when  he  was

Speaker  in  this House, and I have no doubt  that

you too will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



play   cricket  so  long  as  you  discharge   the

functions of Speaker. But may I add, Mr  Speaker,

that  being versed in cricket and hockey will also

qualify  you to be a great golf player, and  I  am

quite sure that some Members in this House do hope

that  one of these days they will be able to  meet

you on the links.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon (Bukit Merah):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, on behalf of my colleagues,  I

wish  to express our heartiest congratulations  to

you  on being elected as Speaker to this Assembly.

We have confidence that you will no doubt maintain

and  carry  on  the traditions laid down  in  this

Chamber  by  the previous Speakers  who  had  been

praised  for  their  fairness,  impartiality   and

sincerity towards this side of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the practice of parliamentary democracy, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  it is the Speaker's esteemed  duty

and  responsibility to see that  any  constructive

opinion  from  the  Opposition  will  not  be  sup

pressed, to see that parliamentary democracy  will

not be monopolised by those who are in power, and,

above  all,  to see that no Member of  this  House

with  different  political  ideologies  should  be

arbitrarily  arrested  as long  as  his  political

activities  do  not exceed the  framework  of  the

Constitution. Only by so doing, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

can  the dignity of this Chamber be preserved  and

can  it then be said that there is a real practice

of  democracy in the country. Otherwise,  Sir,  it

will  simply  make  a mockery  of  the  democratic

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with your ability, your

experience,  and your justness, I can  assure  you

that the Members in our Party will render our

co-operation to you and will naturally abide by your

rulings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, in a parliamentary system the office

of  Speaker is fundamental. His tasks  are  by  no

means  easy,  particularly in budding  democracies

where the drift is towards autocracy, which  is  a

system of government by an absolute ruler.  It  is

unfortunate that many countries in the  Afro-Asian

world have rejected democracy for autocracy. A few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



examples are Pakistan, Indonesia, Ghana,  and  one

of   the  latest  to  submit  an  application  for

membership in this exclusive club is Melawi, There

is   no   possibility,  however,  of  an  absolute

autocracy in Singapore, because the crucial powers

especially  of defence and security  rest  on  the

Central  Government which has  no  reason  yet  to

abandon the parliamentary creed. But it is obvious

that  the  trend in Singapore is towards autocracy

as far as its limited power permits it. So for the

moment  we  are  at  least in theory  following  a

democratic parliamentary system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a system the Judiciary and the

Legislature are expected to provide some  measures

of check against the tendency to absolutism by the

Government.  What will happen to the  citizens  of

the land if they cannot challenge the excesses  of

Government in an independent Judiciary? What  will

happen to our democracy if the representatives  of

the people cannot voice their opinions against the

repressive  laws  passed in  the  Legislature?  In

order,  Sir,  for the Judiciary to  discharge  its

role  as a pillar in the democratic framework,  it

must be filled by fearless men, by people who  are

prepared  to throw in their resignation papers  so

that  justice and the rule of law may  be  upheld.

Politicians come and go, but the Judiciary,  being

a  permanent  institution, should be like  Raffles

Lighthouse, no matter what the tide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for the Legislature to be able to voice

public  opinion  -  and public  opinion  is  the

cornerstone  of democracy - it should hold  meetings

regularly  with fixed dates and not  convene  only

when the Government is required to do so under the

Constitution  because  certain  acts  require  the

assent of the Legislature. The Speaker, who is the

guardian  of  the  Legislature, has  therefore  an

important function to play, more so as ours is not

a  normal  Legislature. The Speaker has no  voting

rights.  He  possesses no right to participate  in

the  debates  but he acts as the guardian  of  the

Legislature. On vital issues his decisions can  be

of great consequence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



Imagine  what  will happen if the Speaker  decides

that he should not grant further leave to the  two

who  disappeared  and have not been  sworn  in  as

Legislative  Assemblymen! There will  be  two

by-elections  and  the results of these  by-elections

might  affect  the  Government.  Because  of   his

importance, the election of Speaker should,  as  a

flatter of courtesy, be discussed with the  Opposi

tion.  In  the selection of Mr A. P.  Rajah,  the

Opposition  was not consulted. One  should  either

come  out  openly for the parliamentary democratic

system or one should denigrate the defects of  the

system   and  alternatively  canvass  for   guided

democracy. We here are neither fish nor  fowl.  In

theory,   we   are  supposed  to  be   working   a

parliamentary system; in practice we are not. When

the situation is thus so delicate and the lines of

division  between democracy and autocracy  are  so

blurred,  the  task  of  the  Speaker,   Sir,   is

uneviable. The Speaker's responsibilities are,  to

my knowledge, twofold. The public sees him only in

his  manifest  duties when he chairs the  Assembly

debates  in  open Chamber. Here, Sir,  the  public

gallery  is  the final judge of the Speaker's  ade

quacies and his fair-mindedness. But it is in  the

other and more difficult task which the public  is

little  aware of where the call upon the Speaker's

calibre   and  strength  of  character   is   more

demanding  but  which  only  parliamentarians  and

historians can appreciate. What deliberations  are

made  behind those velvet curtains could sometimes

have  more  consequence on  the  survival  of  the

democratic  system  than  what  happens  in   open

Chamber.  For  the  system to  survive,  not  only

should  we  have an independent Judiciary  but  we

should   also   have   an  effective   Legislature

including a Speaker who is prepared to uphold  the

parliamentary   system  and  allow   parliamentary

practice  to  guide  his  decisions,  rather  than

political  expediency of the majority Party  which

selects him for the post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rajah has often been regarded by friend and foe alike as the best parliamentarian in the last Assembly. He was never seen to lose his temper; he

never got involved in unnecessary interjections,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



His  speeches were never personal; he always spoke

relevantly. These are his good qualities. What  we

in  the  Opposition expect of him, as Speaker,  is

not that he will chair the debates impartially

on that score I have no doubts. What I wish  to

expect from him is that he will carry on the  fine

traditions of Sir George Oehlers in attempting  to

preserve  the  independence of the Legislature  so

that  the  principles  underlying  the  democratic

system  will not collapse. I have high hopes  that

Mr   Rajah   will  not  fail  us.   I   therefore

congratulate him on his appointment.

received a petition from the villagers of  Kampong

Chai  Chee requesting the Government to provide  a

pedestrian  crossing  at 6¾  m.s.  Upper  Changi

Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This request was investigated, and a reply was

sent  to  the  petitioners on 29th  August,  1963,

informing  them that their request  could  not  be

granted for the following reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Traffic Police authorities are

satisfied    that,   along   this    portion    of

Changi  Road,  there  are  suflicient  breaks   in

the  flow  of  traffic  to  allow  pedestrians  to

cross       the       road       safely;       and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the site is unsuitable for a pedestrian

crossing, as there is a very sharp bend,

and two bus-stops close to the bend, at 6¾ m.s. Upper Changi Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petitioners have since written to express

their   appreciation  of  the  reasons  for   this

decision.

the  University  of  Singapore and  the  Singapore

Polytechnic  respectively, who graduated  in  1963

and   1964  respectively,  are  employed  in   the

Singapore Government Service.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In a fair comparison of

employment  opportunities  open  to  graduates  of

these  three  institutions, we must  exclude  from

consideration employment of medical,  dental,  law

and pharmacy graduates as these courses are taught

at one institution only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures are as follows:

<pre>

 1963 graduates employed in the Government

service:

 Nanyang University    			70

<br><br>I  want  to  make it clear that these figures  are

classified  by the year of graduation  of  persons

employed in Government service. It does not  refer

to  the number of graduates employed in any  given

year, either 1963 or 1964. Therefore, as you  will

note  the  figures for 1964, the Nanyang graduates

are rather less compared with 1963 graduates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



That is because for any given year  there

is  a  back-log  of graduates to be absorbed.  For

instance,  in  1964  the total number  of  Nanyang

graduates of all graduation years employed by  the

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason

Ulu  Pandan  that  there are  no  plans,  for  the

foreseeable  future,  to build  a  new  Government

Outpatient  Dispensary in Ulu Pandan Constituency.

This  is  because  of the fact  that  the  present

network  of  26 Government Outpatient Dispensaries

serving  Singapore island have a staff of only  44

doctors  whereas proper stalling would require  no

less than 70 doctors. It is therefore necessary to

consolidate   present   services   with   whatever

available  staff  is in service,  and  it  is  not

possible   to  contemplate  expansion  until   the

shortage of medical staff is solved first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to add, however, that Ulu Pandan

Constituency is not without Outpatient Services at

present. Every Wednesday morning, the Holland Road

Outpatient Dispensary operates at the Maternal and

Programme are offered alternative accommodation in

Housing  Board  Estates  where  shops  which   are

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5 of the Local Government Integration

Ordinance,   1963,  provides   that   all   lands,

buildings   and  other  property,   moveable   and

immoveable, of the City Council and of  the  Rural

Board  at  the  end of the year  1960  other  than

lands,  buildings  and other property  which  were

vested  in  the  Public Utilities Board  shall  be

deemed  to have been transferred to and vested  in

the  Government without further assurance  on  the

1st day of January, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent suit before the High Court of

Singapore, the question of the transfer to and the

vesting of property acquired after the 1st day  of

January, 1961 has been raised. Although the  Local

Government Financial Integration Ordinance,

1960 - which is now repealed - provided   for   this

eventuality,  the Government's legal advisers  are

of  the view that the position of such property is

not   clearly  beyond  doubt.  The  amendment   of

subsection  (1)  of  section 5  of  the  principal

Ordinance seeks to settle this question beyond all

doubt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (4) of section 5 of the principal

Ordinance  which  sets out  the  procedure  to  be

followed  in  the case of proceedings  pending  or

matters  or  causes of action existing immediately

before  the  coming into force  of  the  principal

Ordinance is repealed and re-enacted with  greater

clarity particularly as regards whether or not the

provisions of the Crown Suits Ordinance apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I only wish to seek  clarification

from  the  Minister as to whether this  Bill  will

cover those actions which are not pending but  new

actions  which  can  be  contemplated  by  parties

against  the  former City Council  or  the  former

Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to seek this clarification because when I

was  the  Mayor  of the City Council,  action  was

taken  against me by Mr L. A. Marcus and we  have

settled  this action, each side paying  their  own

costs.   When  my  lawyers  wrote  to  the  Public

Utilities Board, they tried to pass the  buck  and

my  lawyers  apparently  do  not  know  the  right

department  to  take action because  obviously  we

might not have action to take.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek clarification from the

Minister  as  to whether the Bill does  provide  a

clause  whereby  a  person  can  take  new  action

against  the Government because it has taken  over

all   the  rights  and  liabilities  of  the  City

Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the

hon.  Member that this amendment Bill was  enacted

to  cover  exactly the type of case which  he  has

raised.  If I can draw the hon. Member's attention

to  the  proposed amendment to subsection  (4)  of

section 5 of the principal Ordinance, it sets  out

previously  the  procedure to be followed  in  the

cases  of proceedings pending or matters or causes

of  action existing immediately before the  coming

into   force  of  the  principal  Ordinance.   The

position  now is that if one desires  to  sue  the

City Council, one can do so. It is brought in  the

name  of the City Council but it is the Government

which bears the responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot advise the hon. Member on his own

personal  legal matters. He has his  own  lawyers,

but  I  can  assure him that this  Bill  has  been

brought in to provide for the eventuality which he

is afraid of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the funds for the National

Theatre  were  campaigned for  in  1959.  After  a

period of two years, according to a speech made on

31st October, 1961, about $700,000 were raised for

this National Theatre. But up to the present date,

i.e. after  a period of 2½ years, the sum  raised

was   only  about  S200,000.  There  is  a   great

difference between the first figure and the second

figure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore have lost confidence in

the  cultural policies of the Government,  as  the

figures  show. Mr Speaker, Sir, the  construction

of  the  National Theatre was for the  purpose  of

promoting  the cultural activities of the  people.

It  was meant to bring out the characteristics  of

the  cultures  of  the  various  races  living  in

Singapore,  thereby intermingling  these  cultures

and creating a new culture. But the Government has

abandoned this policy. In fact, it is now adopting

the   colonial  policy  in  respect  of   culture.

Furthermore,  the suppression of healthy  cultural

activities has been carried out. As a result,  all

cultural  activities  are now  carried  out  on  a

political basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The encouragement of yellow culture is also

under way, either directly or indirectly. In fact,

yellow culture is now quite popular among the

people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  In  street corners and  everywhere  in

Singapore  you can see obscene publications.  Even

the  programmes  that  appear  on  television  are

tainted with yellow culture. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me

touch   a   little  on  the  programmes   for

television, because this is closely connected with

healthy   cultural  growth.  May   I   have   your

permission   to   speak  on  the  programmes   for

television?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, briefly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, as the State Government has the

power  to deal with the administration and routine

work of broadcasting, I hope it will take steps to

stop  showing  more "yellow" programnies  on  T.V.

There  should be no fantastic stories  of  murder,

rape  and arson shown to viewers because  this  is

going  to do harm to our next generation. I appeal

to  the  Government  to review  its  present  T.V.

programmes so that good programmes can  be  viewed

by  the people and the bad programmes discarded in

good time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present programmes put on

T.V. are very poor in content. This is a fact. But

the  question is whether the Government  wants  to

monopolise cultural activities or not.  It  should

not  monopolise all cultural activities. In  fact,

it  should give the people and the local  artistes

an opportunity to express themselves and give them

adequate facilities to do so. If the Government is

prepared   to  get  in  touch  with  the  cultural

organisations in Singapore, then better programmes

of  a  higher artistic value can be shown, in this

way,  at  least some of the defects in the present

T.V. programmes can be remedied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the construction of the National

Theatre.  The cost of construction of the National

Theatre,  including the laying of the  foundation,

is $2.2 million. The structure itself costs

$1.63 million. It is not worth to spend such a big

sum  of  money  for  a building  of  this  nature.

Although  the design of the National  Theatre  was

obtained  by  way of competition, I doubt  if  the

architect concerned obtained the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



views   of   the   local  artistes  and   cultural

organisations of Singapore before putting  up  his

plan. I do not deny that the architect has special

qualifications  and experience. But  if  he  could

have  got the views of local artistes and cultural

organisations, he could have done better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there are special conditions

attached  to  the  cultural  activities   of   any

country,   and  these  should  have   been   given

consideration when designing the National Theatre.

People  who  have  experience in stage  work  have

raised  this question. I wonder whether  this

so-called  largest theatre in South East Asia  is  big

enough  for a large-scale opera. I wonder  whether

the stage is big enough for the purpose. The music

pool  seems small. The backstage is rather shallow

and  if you want to put up local operas the  stage

is too big. The rent is very high. If the National

Theatre  has  all  these  defects,  then   it   is

regrettable that the Government has not been  careful  with  public funds. As a result of this, the

National  Theatre has been put up in  a  slip-shod

manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now want to deal with the seats in the

National  Theatre.  I  have  a  plan  showing  the

seating  accommodation  of the  National  Theatre.

According  to  an  on-the-spot investigation,  the

seats  in the UU row up to the PP row at the  back

are now damaged. And from the OO row to the AA row

the outer seats have changed their shapes. But the

seats   for  the  VIP  have  been  given   special

consideration,  and  so  they  have  remained  all

right.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, ever since the completion of

the  National Theatre, most of the seats have been

damaged in a matter of a year. From this point  of

view  alone,  one can see how the  Government  has

squandered public funds. Even if the architect  of

this   National   Theatre  has   made   some   mis

calculations  about the climate of Singapore,  and

even  if  first-class programmes are  put  on  the

stage,  you  cannot expect the audience  to  enjoy

these                                   programmes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



by  subjecting them to climatic conditions such as

rain.  In short, I would say that the construction

of   the   National  Theatre  has  been   rather

haphazard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the exits of the National

Theatre.  There  are 3,421 seats in  the  National

Theatre.  According  to the Government  estimates,

this  National Theatre can accommodate 13,000  people  or  more. With such a great number, I  wonder

whether  the  four exits are enough.  Furthermore,

the  two  smaller exits on a higher level are  not

conveniently placed. The public do not  make  full

use of them. As a result, there are only two exits

to this National Theatre. The other two are not in

popular  use. So according to estimates,  normally

if  the  seats are fully occupied, one can  expect

about 3,500 spectators. It will take them some  20

to  25  minutes  to  clear  out  of  the  National

Theatre.  If the number of spectators should  rise

to  10,000, then the time required for them to  go

out will be doubled, to say the least. Under these

circumstances,  should there be  any  accident,  I

just  cannot  imagine  what  will  happen  to  the

audience in the theatre. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is

a  matter that concerns public safety. I hope  the

Government  will  pay special  attention  to  this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, summing up all that I have

said,  it  is  clear that the people can  see  for

themselves that their hard-earned money  has  been

squandered  by the Government. That  is  why  they

refused  to  contribute further for the completion

of  the National Theatre Fund. We fully understand

their sentiments. But, on the contrary, the Govern

ment  finding itself in a position that it  cannot

get  further help, has tried to extort some  money

to   solve   its   financial  problem.   This   is

inexcusable.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member has just beaten the

clock!



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): MrSpeaker, in the

past two or three years, the National Theatre  was

used  as a show-case for the P.A.P. Last year  the

National Theatre was opened rather haphazardly for

the  so-called  South-East Asia Cultural  Festival.

One year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



has  since passed. Before the National Theatre was

built, the P.A.P. said that this was going  to  be

the  cultural centre of Singapore. That  was  said

before  the  plans were made. But now we  can  see

that  in the last one and a half years or  so  the

performances  put up at the National Theatre  have

been  rather  few.  In fact, we can  easily  count

them.  Why should there be so few performances  at

the  National Theatre? Why should the performances

be  so  few  in  the past one year?  I  think  the

reasons are as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important one is that the P.A.P. has

already  given up its policy to encourage  healthy

cultural activities. The Government has not  given

any  assistance  to  the  development  of  healthy

cultural   activities.  It  has   given   no   aid

whatsoever  to  the  amateur  artistes  among  the

people. On the contrary, suppressive actions  have

been  taken  against them. Artistic  and  cultural

activities  are  more or less monopolised  by  the

Party in power. Under these circumstances, can one

expect   cultural  activities   to   flourish   in

Singapore?  If cultural activities are not  widely

popularised and encouraged among the people, where

is the value then in the National Theatre? What is

it  built for? Do you want the professional

sing-song girls and the songstresses to perform at  the

National Theatre? No. They have already got  their

own stages in the amusement parks. Or do you think

you  can make full use of the National Theatre  by

putting  up  performances  staged  by  the  P.A.P.

artistes? No. There are not enough people to do so

many   performances.  The  cultural   workers   in

Singapore  have a feeling of sadness  that  yellow

performances are rather rampant in Singapore. They

are  very discouraged because of this. That is why

I  dare say that the National Theatre has not been

fully  made  use  of  in the past  one  year.  The

National Theatre has only got a facade. It is good

looking outside. The P.A.P. Government is boasting

of  it,  saying  that  it is one  of  the  biggest

theatres in South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third factor is that the rental of the

National  Theatre is too high. As far as  I  know,

professionals         who         want          to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



rent  the  National Theatre have to pay  at  least

$450  per  night.  The  highest  rent  is  $1,000.

Amateurs  who  desire to use the National  Theatre

are  required to pay at least $350 per night.  The

maximum  rent required of them is $550 per  night.

Artistes and cultural organisations who desire  to

use  the  National  Theatre are  discouraged  from

using  it because of the exorbitant rent. This  is

because  their proceeds may not be enough  to  pay

for  the rent. Then with regard to the use of  the

National  Theatre  for rehearsal  at  day-time,  I

understand that the rent for such use is  $50.  We

have  seen that the Government has squandered some

$2  million  on the National Theatre. The  rentals

are  high.  So  to  cover up all  these  losses  I

understand that some advertisers make use  of  the

National  Theatre for the making  of  photographic

advertisements for commercial firms, for  example,

the  Milo  firm  and  others.  Can  you  say  that

"commercial"  is art? I do not know  what  is  art

then if "commercial" can become an art. It is very

disheartening that this should happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is one other important matter

to  which  I wish to draw your attention.  As  the

people have no confidence in the P.A.P., so it  is

no  longer possible for the P.A.P. to get any more

money  from the people. So the only way out is  to

pay out of public funds or to resort to compulsory

contributions. I remember some time  last

year - the  Minister for Education is not here; otherwise

he   can  listen  carefully  -  the  Ministry  of

Education sent out forms to the Principals  asking

the  teachers  to  donate $10  each  as  voluntary

contributions. The word "voluntary" means it is up

to  you entirely whether to donate or not. But, on

the  other  hand, the instruction also  came  down

that   those  who  did  not  make  any   voluntary

contributions should be listed and they should  be

asked   to  give  reasons  for  not  making   such

voluntary contributions. How can you say that such

contributions  were voluntary? All  these  actions

were  very repressive. At the beginning,  I  asked

the Minister for figures of teachers who have been

dismissed. Up till now I have not been able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to know the figures because he has not given them

orally.  But  in  any case,  there  is  a  lot  of

suppression going on in education circles.  A  lot

of  teachers have been dismissed and teachers  are

now  unhappy. They are rather afraid of the P.A.P.

men, whether they are small fry or big shots.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are not on the Ministry

of  Education. I do not mind the Member  referring

to that Ministry in passing, but if he is going to

speak on it at some length, he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am sorry about it. But I have brought up all these

matters  just to show that contributions were  not

voluntary.  It was the Minister for Education  who

was responsible for all such compulsory donations.

If  you  do not make your voluntary contributions,

then your name will be listed and you have to give

your reason why you do not want to ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could the Member come to his next

point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I go on to satisfy

the  Member of the Opposition in regard  to  these

Supplementary  Estimates,  I  wish  to  draw   the

attention  of the House to the fact  that  in  the

last  Assembly sitting, it was made clear to  this

House that a further payment would have to be made

in  accordance  with what has been  agreed  to  in

respect  of the Government's contribution  to  the

Trust.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the cost of the National

Theatre,  which was estimated at $2.2 million  and

in  respect  of  which  the  estimated  figure  of

Government's assistance is based, has increased to

approximately   $2.4  million.  The   Trust   will

therefore have to raise the funds to pay  for  the

additional  cost. This is to be the responsibility

of  the Trust. Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government  agreed on 20th of July, 1962,  to  pay

the  difference between the total  costs  of  $2.2

million and the total donations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



received by the National Theatre Trust. The amount

to   be   paid  by  the  Government  amounted   to

$1,343,720.96, after deducting donations totalling

$856,279.04.  You will recall, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

that  the  House already approved the  payment  of

$500,000  on  24th  of July  and  another  sum  of

$450,000  on  the 17th of December, 1963,  to  the

National Theatre Trust. Members will remember that

at  the last sitting, as I quoted earlier on  from

Hansard, I said that a further payment would  have

to be made in accordance with what has been agreed

to in respect of Government's contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the questions raised by the Member

for  Bukit  Merah on the scale of rent charges,  I

can  assure him that the charges are imposed after

careful  consideration. I will make a  comparison,

Mr Speaker, Sir. The rent for each performance at

the  Singapore  Badminton Hall is $250.  You  will

note  that  essential services such  as  a  proper

stage,  loudspeaker,  and public  address  system,

stage  lighting  system,  chairs,  etc.,  are  not

provided  for in the rental. The charges  for  the

use   of   the  National  Theatre  arc   therefore

considered  to be very reasonable. If  the  Member

for Bukit Merah - I am sure he has a copy already

-  has not been given a copy of the charges, then

I  shall undertake to forward him a copy if he  so

requires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to go into

details of the various rates of charges as it will

take  up  a  considerable length of  time  in  the

House,  but if Members of the Opposition  are  not

clear  on  certain points and are  not  satisfied,

then  I shall be pleased to receive any suggestion

from them as to the revision of rental charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of design and

planning of the National Theatre, as noted by  the

Member for Bukit Merah, the plan was adopted after

a  public competition. The plan was considered  by

the   National  Theatre  Trust  appointed  by  the

Government  and in whose responsibility  we  place

our trust. As stated in the last Assembly sitting,

the National Theatre was originally meant to be an

open-air one, but in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



view of the enthusiastic response from the public,

the  National Theatre Trust has decided to  revise

its  original plan into a covered theatre.  I  can

assure the Member for Bukit Merah that the various

conditions and requirements he has raised  earlier

on  the  suitability  and  practicability  of  the

National  Theatre being used for  the  purpose  of

performance,  etc.,  were  all  included  in   the

conditions  and  requirements  supplied   to   the

competitors  in this contest for the plan  of  the

National  Theatre. To date, members of  the  Trust

have no adverse observations to make on the design

and   other  matters  relating  to  the   National

Theatre. But I have to congratulate the Member for

Bukit  Merah  on bringing in the question  of  the

number   of   exits,  which  he   has   considered

inadequate. So far as I have noticed this  is  the

only  constructive criticism from Members  of  the

Opposition, and I shall look into this  matter  at

my earliest opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson as well as

the Member for Bukit Merah went into some detail

regarding the practicability of the National Theatre

and whether or not it is really put to its intended

use. From the statements made by both Members of the

Opposition, I feel that this is a classic display of

ignorance. If Members, of the Opposition require any

information of the bookings of the National Theatre, I

have just counted the number of bookings. Mr Speaker,

Sir, bookings received up to the 20th of October,

<div align="center"><b>1964, totalled 99, including rehearsals, etc. The</b></div>

Member for Thomson has raised the question that we

should even charge at all for the purpose of

rehearsals. Members of the Opposition may be

interested to know that these bookings included, among

many others, a variety concert by the Yin Sin Old

Boys' Association and another variety concert by the

Chung San Huay Kuan, a comical play by the Singapore

Film and Drama Institution. All these bookings, Mr

Speaker, Sir, will show that the National Theatre

provides an excellent place with excellent facilities

for the promotion of culture at grass root level.

Statements by the Opposition Members that the National

Theatre has been misused are totally incorrect. The

House may be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



interested to note the following breakdown  of  the

bookings  of  the National Theatre in  two  periods

from 1st of June to 31st of October, 1964, and  1st

of  November to 31st of December, 1964, in  respect

of   Malay,  Chinese,  English  and  other  variety

performances,    meetings,    congregations     and

exhibitions, etc. From the 1st of June to  31st  of

October,  1964:  Malay 3, Teochew  2,  Mandarin  5,

Cantonese  2, English 9, Variety 12, Meetings  and

Congregations  13,  Exhibitions  5.  From  1st   of

November to 31st of December, 1964: Malay 2,  Cantonese   1,  English  4,  Variety  2,  Meetings   and

Congregations 2, and Exhibitions 2. From  this  you

will  note,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that  the  National

Theatre  caters  for activities of  all  the  major

language  streams in the State. I believe that  Mem

bers  of the Opposition should be satisfied by  now

that the National Theatre is not what they consider

to  be  a  project of wasting Government money  and

throwing  public funds into the sea, as  stated  by

the Member for Thomson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the stage being too big for

Chinese  operatic performances and  too  small  for

Western performances, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

that  this  is a condition with which  it  is  very

difficult  for all of us to comply. I think  it  is

equally  difficult for engineers and architects  of

the advanced West to provide a compromise solution.

No  doubt the pool for the musicians is considered

to  be slightly small - but it is not uncomfortable

-  and  we shall look into the question whether  it

needs to be

-extended or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Members of the House

are  also  aware of the nature of the performances,

particularly  Chinese operatic performances,  where

the stage requirements are comparatively very small

as compared to Western performances like ballet and

spectacular variety shows, etc. We can remedy  this

by  some  arrangement  of  the  stage.  It  is  not

possible  for us to have two different stages,  one

for  typical  Chinese  operatic  performances,  and

another  for Western performances. This is a  minor

point.  The Member for Thomson, who is  very  much

interested in cultural activities, will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



agree  with me that such a position can be  altered

merely by an arrangement of the stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I come back again, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the

question  of  charges? As I have said earlier  -  I

have  referred to the example of the charges levied

for  the  Singapore Badminton Hall - it  should  be

noted   that  the  National  Theatre  has  a  total

accommodation of 3,420 ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon:</b> 3,421.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> 3,421 - thank you. This very

good proposition is in a smaller hall. Charges  for

admission  will inevitably have to be increased  to

an amount which will not be voluntarily accepted by

people intending to attend the show. In the case of

the National Theatre, the number of seats is 3,420.

The  Member for Bukit Merah says that the admission

charges  can  be reduced to a figure acceptable  to

the  public  without  causing any  extra  financial

burden  to  them.  I  can  assure  Members  of  the

Opposition   that  most  of  the   organisers   and

associations  that  stage  shows  in  the  National

Theatre  do make some profit if they levy admission

charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the discussion is on

Contributions   and   Charitable   Allowances    to

charitable organisations, but the Member for  Bukit

Merah  has  earlier  touched  on  the  question  of

television.  With your permission, Sir,  may  I  en

lighten  him a little on this subject? As we  know,

television   is   still  in   its   infancy   here.

Nowithstanding  this, the standard  of  performance

and  telecasting,  as we see in our  homes  and  in

public  places,  I think, should  not  receive  any

adverse criticism. It is not that we do not receive

any  constructive criticism but we  have  done  our

best  to  satisfy the audience, and  television  is

still ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I regret to say that the

Member has had his 15 minutes.

of  the  National Theatre more than a year ago,  there

were  only 99 bookings out of more than 400  days  and

that includes bookings for rehearsals. In other words,

out  of every one-day booking there are three or  four

days ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> On a point of clarification, with

your permission, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the bookings

received  were for the period from 2nd June, 1964,  to

20th  October,  1964.  If  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim

requires  statistical periods prior to that,  I  shall

undertake to forward them to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The point I am trying to raise is

this.  We have all these big buildings in town  -  the

National  Theatre which is the first open amphitheatre

meant  for  the masses where no charges for  admission

would  be  made. It was first proposed to be built  on

the  Kallang  Park site, but later it was  shifted  to

King  George  V  Park where the background  was  quite

suitable for an open amphitheatre, something like  the

Hollywood  Bowl.  Then  later,  as  the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture has explained to

us, there was such an enthusiastic response - which is

quite  contrary  to what the Member  for  Thomson  has

said;  he  says  that  teachers  were  asked  to  make

compulsory  "voluntary" contributions -  that  we  are

still short of $400,000. Perhaps in the first wave  of

response the Government introduced a dollar-for-dollar

brick  donation.  It  was  so  good  and  there   were

promises,  but they were not kept. That  was  why  the

Government  had  to  come back to  this  House  for  a

further $400,000 which had earlier been taken from the

Contingency Fund to complete the National Theatre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, do you remember the story of the

Victoria  Theatre? It was completed in the  same  way.

The  Government  every  time came  back  to  the  City

Council  for additional funds -  $¼ million, $100.000

more  in  order to complete this particular phase  and

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



particular  phase.  Mr  Speaker,  we  have  too  many

buildings in the City. The Victoria Memorial  Hall  is

always  empty. Then we have the Victoria  Theatre  and

now  we  have the National Theatre. Very soon  we  are

going  to  have  another big theatre - the  Trade  Union

House - and  we will have all these white elephants.  Do

you  remember, Sir, that about two years ago when  the

Government  was  quite shaky, each  of  the  Ministers

tried  to  build something? The Deputy Prime  Minister

wanted to build a car park which, I hear, is now  more

than  half  vacant.  The former  Minister  for  Labour

wanted  to  build a Trade Union House costing  $4½

million  so that he could commemorate the day when  he

would  no  more be a Minister but sharing the  Tourist

Promotion  Board  in  introducing  fair  dames.   Each

Minister  vied  with the other to  build  the  biggest

building  in the city. I do not know eventually  which

one  will build the biggest - the National Theatre  to

commemorate  the work of the Minister for Culture,  or

the  Trade Union House to commemorate the work of  the

former Minister for Labour. What we want, Sir, is  not

more of these buildings. What we want is more personal

assistance  for  the  poor, more unemployment  relief,

more  hospitals, and more care for the underprivileged

people.  The money expended on these buildings,  which

is  about  $10 million, is wasted. It is not only  the

capital cost which the public are being asked to  pay,

but  also  the regular maintenance cost to keep  these

high  buildings in good condition, to keep the  staff.

The National Theatre has over 3,000 seats but there is

hardly  an occasion when it is filled up unless  there

is  a free show and free tickets are given just before

the  elections to commemorate the so-called South-East

Asia  Cultural Festival in order to make a big  impact

on  the population. Otherwise, Sir, if the public  are

expected to pay, there is hardly any occasion when the

seats  are filled. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a waste  of

money.  This  is another white elephant  that  we  are

asked to pay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in any country in the world  Government

have built edifices not with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



the  object of making money. Otherwise it  becomes

commercialised.  Therefore,  the  Government  have

built  the Trade Union House to assist the workers

and  not with the object of making money. Likewise

the  National Theatre. I think the Government have

done  the right thing and we know that we  are  in

the right and we will proceed with it irrespective

of irrelevant criticism.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, originally I had no

intention  to speak, but I was surprised  to  hear

the  Member  for Hong Lim saying that he  has  his

doubts   about  the  existence  of  the   National

Theatre. The Member for Hong Lim should know  that

the National Theatre project commenced when he was

the  Minister for National Development. And he now

raises  this question. I do not know how he  stood

at  that  time  and how and where he  stands  now.

Similarly with the Member for Bukit Merah, when he

spoke  just now. The plan of the National  Theatre

can  be  truly said to have been agreed to by  all

the  13 Members of the Government who defected  to

the  Barisan Sosialis. They now come back and  say

that they are dissatisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the misgivings of the Member for Hong Lim,

I am quite sure that in his heart he is satisfied.

At  that time he opened up many parks like Kallang

Park  and  Hong Lim Park. In only one constituency

was  a park established, i.e. Hong Lim Park. There

is  no such park in the Southern Islands known  as

the   Southern  Island  Park.  Therefore,  he   is

satisfied that there should be no National Theatre

because of the existence already of Hong Lim Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of the growth and development of

yellow culture, the definition of "yellow culture"

is  wide  and it is incorrect to link it with  the

National  Theatre project. Can the story depicting

the  life  of  a  youth  be  described  as  yellow

culture? To the Member for Bukit Merah, let me say

that if all the characters in the story are males,

I  am  quite  sure there will be  not  one  single

person  to see the story on T.V. Likewise  if  all

the characters are females, then there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



will   be   no   audience.  So   there   must   be

representation  from both sexes in  any  play.  If

there  is  any story about love, it is  common  to

have  such  representation.  Human  beings  cannot

divorce  themselves from love. So this  definition

of "yellow culture" is very wide indeed. I feel it

is better to be a little yellowish than reddish.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, allow

me  to touch on the question of yellow culture. It

has  been  given so much importance by the  Member

for Bukit Merah and the Member for Thomson. In the

last  Assembly  you will remember  the  charitable

nature of the Government. We said to them, "Please

supply  us  with  what  you  think  ought  to   be

televised, what kind of books you think  ought  to

be  published, or to be banned by the Government."

We offered this to the Opposition in the hope that

we   would   later  receive  some   concrete   and

constructive    suggestions   from    them.    But

unfortunately   we   did  not  receive   anything,

particularly from the Member for Thomson. Today he

has again talked about yellow culture, undesirable

films, undesirable publications, and so on. So  we

do  make the Opposition an offer once again

now -"Please  give us a complete list of the films  and

publications or anything that you consider  to  be

yellow culture, so that we can look into them, and

will probably ban them."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim has

referred  to  the  National  Theatre  as  a  white

elephant.  I have made it clear earlier  that  the

number of bookings received and the manner the  Na

tional  Theatre  has been used is proof  that  the

Theatre is practical and beneficial to members  of

the public.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Hong Lim that the

National Theatre must be meant for the masses. As

it is now, open-air theatres can also bear part of

this responsibility, such as the Crawford Park

open-air theatre and the Hong Lim open-air

theatre. Mr Speaker, Sir, the National Theatre

has been referred to as a white elephant. I would

refer to Hong Lim Green as a retarded elephant. I

remember, Mr Speaker, Sir, when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



Hong  Lim was being built, the Member for Hong Lim

put  so  much enthusiasm into it. If he so desires,

then  I  will  relate to this House the particulars

in  detail how Hong Lim Green was built. Sir, if  I

were  to  go into this question, it would  take  up

the  valuable time of the House, because the Member

for Hong Lim ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are not on Hong Lim Green

now. We are on the National Theatre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member for

Hong  Lim has said that the National Theatre is  no

doubt  spectacular but it has not been put to  good

use.  We  do know, Mr Speaker, that there  is  one

red  elephant in Singapore. The red elephant  I  am

referring  to  is the entrance to Kallang  Park.  I

say  "red" because it is an eye-sore. The  entrance

to  Kallang  Park  was erected without  any  proper

planning  and  consideration.  As  a  result,   the

traffic  in that part of Mountbatten Road  has  not

been  as  smooth  and as free a  flow  as  we  have

planned. So the entrance to Kallang Park is  a  red

elephant.  If  he  thinks that there  is  any  more

white  elephant in the State, I think  I  can  make

further references to sonic other elephants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker will also know that the Member for Hong Lim tries to recapture the nostalgic good old days of the City Council. But the Government's

responsibility  is  not merely kicking  up  rows  in

Assembly  sittings or at City Council meetings.  Our

responsibility is to do solid work, so that we  will

raise the living standard of the people not only  in

respect   of  clothing,  schools,  houses,  clinics,

medical  attention, but also to inculcate  into  the

people  the  value of democracy,  the  sense  of  to

getherness,  and  to  uphold the  integrity  of  the

country.  I believe we can bring about these  things

through cultural activities. No doubt it will take a

long time. But we are positive that the unity of the

people can be brought about through such exchanges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the National Theatre, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am sure we are aware that prior to its

erection, there was not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



a single place in the State that was suitable for

operatic performances. As a result, cultural troupes

from other countries visiting Singapore frequently

found difficulty in getting a proper place and a

proper sound system. The Victoria Theatre, which the

Member for Hong Urn has referred to earlier, has

only 904 seats. But the National Theatre with 3,400

seats, proper public address system, is an ideal

place for variety shows, or performances by local

associations, civic organisations, etc. The Bad

minton Hall hitherto was supposed to be the only

ideal place. But it was not erected for that purpose

and, with this in view, we erected the National

Theatre to provide artistes, both local and foreign,

with a proper place which is comfortable for them to

perform.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to touch on a few points raised

by  the  Party  in power just now. The Deputy  Prime

Minister  has  mentioned that some  of  the  Barisan

Members   supported  the  project  of  the  National

Theatre  but  now we have turned round to  criticise

the  National Theatre. We do not object to the build

ing  of the National Theatre to promote our cultural

activities as such. We supported the project of  the

National Theatre. But after the building of  the  Na

tional  Theatre, the question arises whether such  a

purpose  can  be achieved by this National  Theatre,

and  whether  there have not been  difficulties  and

defects  in its construction. That was the point  my

colleagues,  the  Member for  Bukit  Merah  and  the

Member  for Thomson, have raised just now.  But  the

Members  opposite  were not able to  give  a  proper

reply  to  our  criticism. In the past,  before  the

Members  of  the Barisan Sosialis left  the  P.A.P.,

donations  from  the  public  were  very  good.  The

response  was  very  good. Ever since  we  left  the

P.A.P., the donations have become unsatisfactory. My

colleague  has  pointed this out just  now.  If  the

response is not good, the blame can only be  put  on

the  Government, because it has now monopolised  all

cultural  activities. It has not  managed  well  the

donations    to    the   National   Theatre    Fund.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of yellow culture, they say that

we must not presume that when there are members of

the  two  sexes  in the picture,  that  is  yellow

culture.  Such a definition of yellow  culture  is

too simple. What we mean by yellow culture is that

some  of  the items are of low taste. It does  not

mean that we must not have pictures of both sexes.

They  have  not  a  clear  definition  of  yellow

culture.   Therefore,  their  rebuttal  has   been

childish. Another Government Member has  asked  us

to   give   a   list  of  "yellow"  pictures   and

publications.  If  the Government  is  serious  in

wanting  to  accept the opinion of the people  and

wanting to ban yellow culture, of course,  it  can

be  done. But ever since the P.A.P. came to power,

they  have  been pursuing a policy of  suppressing

healthy cultural activities. If the Government  is

sincere  in  wanting  to hear  the  views  of  the

people, it can very well set up a committee  where

the various cultural organisations can put forward

their  views.  We will give our views  at  such  a

committee. This is my reply to the speech made  by

the Government Member just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, a little while ago, the Member for Thomson raised a question. He

said   that  during  the  year  the  Ministry   of

Education  has  asked  for  donations   from   the

teachers.  He said that there were two forms,  one

was  for voluntary donations and the other was  to

give the reason for not wanting to donate $10.  He

blamed this on the Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to give a very simple explanation with

regard  to this matter. Those who did not want  to

donate  would  not be dismissed because  of  their

unwillingness to contribute. This has  nothing  to

do  with  those  teachers who  were  dismissed  in

December. The Minister himself has given them  the

reason  why they were dismissed. There is a  Trust

for  the funds of the National Theatre. This Trust

comprises  all the civic leaders. Therefore,  this

National  Theatre Trust Fund can ask for donations

from people from all walks of life. Therefore, the

National Theatre Trust Fund can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



very  well ask for donations from the people.  The

forms  given  to  the schools for filling  in  the

names of the donors and the amount of the donation

were not chopped with the chop of the Ministry  of

Education. This was within the jurisdiction of the

National  Theatre Trust Fund. Donations  from  the

teachers  was one of the ways to raise  funds  for

the National Theatre. It was not proper to ask for

donations  in  this way and the  Minister  himself

also  warned the National Trust. This  shows  that

the Minister himself was fair in dealing with this

matter.

<br><br>5.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I was touching upon the

fact  that this year 21 .00() pupils ought  to  be

eligible  for  admission into  secondary  academic

schools. But because the Government has not enough

schools, 6,000 odd pupils are not able to have any

accommodation  in any secondary academic  schools.

We find that of the 21,000 pupils, about 6,000 odd

pupils are not able to get admission into schools.

This  represents a great number and the percentage

is  one-third  of the 21,000 odd. If the  Minister

for  Education wants to use any excuse or pretext,

then  he  may say that it is because of  financial

resources or shortage of schools. But if for  such

a  great  number  of pupils the original  estimate

could not be properly foreseen in advance, then it

represents a faulty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



calculation. This is negligence of duty on the

part of the Ministry of Education, because it goes

to show that it was not able to plan and calculate

in advance its actual needs. In the past, the

P.A.P. Government used to boast of its good

education policy and how it was able to provide

places for all school-going pupils. But from this

supplementary vote asked by the Government, we can

see that it has not been faultless in the

administration of its education policy. For these

6,000 odd pupils, the Government is seeking

temporary places in other schools. The Ministry of

Education does not clarify as to what type of

schools these pupils will be put in - technical,

vocational or academic. But whatever the type of

schools, these pupils, who originally should have

been able to join secondary academic schools, are

now to be put into other schools instead. This

will create adverse effects psychologically on the

children concerned. The Ministry of Education has

to bear the responsibility and the consequences

for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, I would like to mention

another matter. The Ministry of Education, on the

one hand, is unable to provide a sufficient number

of secondary schools for the pupils. On the other

hand, it is resorting to unreasonable measures to

expel middle school pupils. Not very long ago,

many Chinese middle school pupils were ordered to

leave school. The Ministry of Education did not

give sufficient reasons to the parents or

guardians of the pupils expelled. On being

questioned by the parents concerned, the Ministry

was not able to give any reason why their children

were not able to be accommodated in the schools.

We know that if the Government wants to give any

excuse or pretext, it can argue that the pupils

have been engaged in illegal activities. But this

kind of pretext was adopted by past colonial

regimes and is not a good pretext to be used nowadays.

If this pretext can be advanced as a reason,

then it only goes to show that the Ministry has

not been correct or proper in dealing with them.

When the parents of the pupils concerned queried

the Ministry, the Ministry was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



not able to give them a satisfactory explanation.

This fact shows that the Government administration

in regard to secondary schools has been a faulty

one, by bringing party politics into the schools

and divesting the pupils of their right to study.

In order to expel a pupil, the Education Ministry

should, I think, advance sufficient reasons,

otherwise they should not try to expel a pupil

from school.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, a little while ago, the Member for Jurong talked about 6,000

pupils who have not been able to find any places

in schools and the Government has not been able to

provide schools for them in which to study. Mr

Speaker, Sir, I find that the Member for Jurong is

not capable of understanding these problems.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what has caused him to make the speech

just now. The Government's promise is this. If a

child of school-going age wants a place in a

school, the Government will see to it that he or

she gets it. If primary pupils can pass their

Primary School Leaving Examination, then the

Government is able to allocate places for them. As

to what type of schools they want to

enter - whether academic, technical, vocational or com

mercial secondary schools - that depends on the

choice of their parents. On this point, I have

already given my answer. The number of pupils who

want to join secondary academic schools has

increased, thus causing an insufficient number of

academic schools to accommodate them. Although the

6,000 odd pupils affected are housed in other

school buildings, they are still continuing with

their secondary academic education. The three

additional secondary academic schools to be built

are meant to take these pupils back. Let me stress

that although they are at present being

temporarily accommodated in other types of

schools, the curricula and the subjects they study

are still the same as those in secondary academic

schools. There has been no change in this respect.

As to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



the cause of this phenomenon, it can be attributed

to the following.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, last year, the percentage of primary

pupils taking the school leaving examination had

increased, and the percentage of passes had

improved, thus causing an increase in the number

of pupils seeking entrance into secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as regards vocational schools, the

number of such schools has exceeded the number we

originally planned. Actually we planned for six

such schools. We estimated originally that many

primary school-leavers would join vocational

schools, but because of parental preference for

secondary academic schools, this has resulted in a

shortage of places in such schools, whereas' there

are many vacancies in secondary vocational

schools. We hope that from now on, parents will

discard the past idea of preference for

white-collar jobs and will try to put their children

into vocational or technical schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Jurong also mentioned

that the Ministry of Education had sacked certain

secondary school pupils without giving the parents

of these pupils a satisfactory explanation. Mr

Speaker, Sir, in the past few months, a number of

middle school pupils were expelled. Some were

expelled by the Ministry of Education; some were

expelled at the request of the principals

concerned. The reasons were very simple. While at

school, these pupils were not actually engaged in

their studies. On the contrary, they took part in

demonstrations and activities organised by certain

pro-Communist Nanyang University students. Even

recently, on 12th September this year, the Barisan

Sosialis organised a demonstration against

national service and these pupils joined in this

demonstration, and as a result, they were sacked.

Some of them also distributed illegal pamphlets in

their schools. These pamphlets were produced by

certain Nantah pro-Communist students. Some took

part in demonstrations outside the Chinese Chamber

of Commerce, and others took part in anti-National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



Service  movements.  For these  reasons,  the  pupils

concerned  were  expelled. We can  only  respect  the

right  of  the pupils to be educated if  they  really

want  to study in schools, but if these middle school

pupils  want  to  take  part  in  anti-national   and

subversive   activities,   then   the   Ministry   of

Education cannot support or condone such activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Minister  for  Education has  explained  why  certain

pupils  were  expelled. I am not satisfied  with  his

explanation.  His explanation as to why 6,000  pupils

are  being accommodated in other types of schools  is

not  satisfactory.  He says that  the  percentage  of

passes  of  primary school pupils had  increased  and

that  there  was an insufficient number of  secondary

vocational schools. I have some doubt about  this.  I

would  like  to  ask him whether he  considered  such

primary   school-leavers  to   be   half-witted   and

therefore  expected a high percentage of failures  so

that  there  was no need to have a sufficient  number

of  secondary academic schools built for them.  Since

he  is in charge of education in the State, he should

try  to assess in advance the whole situation. If  he

continues  to  presume that every year  many  primary

school-leavers will fail

the   School  Leaving  Examination,  then  there  will

continue  to  be  a shortage of places  in  secondary

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the second reason given by him when he

says  that the number of secondary vocational schools

has  exceeded  the  number originally  planned,  this

shows  up the inadequacy of the Ministry in assessing

the  number  of  pupils  seeking  entrance  into  the

different   types  of  schools.  It  has   erred   in

anticipating  the  number  of  different   types   of

schools to be built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also spoke at length on many parents being reluctant to let their children join vocational or technical schools. He has thus put the

blame on the parents. He went further and criticised

them - for wanting their children to have an

academic education in order to take up white-collar

jobs. But the question is not whether these children

want to become white-collar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



workers  earning a salary of about $1,000 a month.  In

actual  fact, they find it very difficult to get  jobs

when  once  they  leave school. This  shows  that  the

educational  system in Singapore still smacks  of  the

past  and  smells of colonial education. The  Minister

should  not  try  to  blame the parents  for  the  con

sequences. It is a fact that many pupils after leaving

school have no chance at all of getting employment  or

choosing their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards certain pupils who have been expelled for

having taken part in Nantah student demonstrations  or

certain  activities, I would like to ask the  Minister

whether  he can advance any concrete evidence  why  he

has   expelled  them.  We  cannot  rely  on   personal

information given to the Minister himself.  He  should

also  investigate the circumstances under which  those

demonstrations  were held. They  were  caused  by  the

Government  trying to control Nantah. The causes  were

many, due to the fault of the P.A.P. itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  we never presupposed the percentage  of

failures and presumed that most of the primary

school-leavers  are  half-witted. As a  matter  of  fact,

vocational  schools are not meant for those  who  failed

their  P.S.L.  Examination only. Those  who  pass  the

primary school examination are entirely free to choose

to  go into vocational secondary schools and, if their

results   are  good,  they  can  go  into   vocational

institutes   for  further  education.  So,  vocational

secondary  schools  are not merely  intended  for  the

primary    school-leavers   who   failed   in    their

examinations.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the number of vocational schools built

exceeding our demand, perhaps it was because we were

overconfident in assessing or in foretelling the

choice the parents were going to make with regard to

what type of schools their children should go to. We

never imagined that there were a lot of parents who

preferred to send their children to secondary academic

schools. Our calculation then was that with

industrialisation on the way, more parents would

choose to send their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



children  to  vocational and  technical  secondary

schools.  Of  course, we admit that our  estimates

were  over-optimistic, but  we  hope  nevertheless

that  in  future more parents would  change  their

attitude towards education and send their children

to  vocational and technical schools to  meet  our

industrial needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary school students go to school in order

to  study. They should not go to school  with  the

idea  of  taking part in anti-national activities.

We,  of  course, have evidence to  show  this.  In

fact,  some  of  them have been convicted  in  the

courts.  And  who is to blame for their  dismissal

for    their    participation   in   anti-national

activities?  The blame should go  to  the  Barisan

Sosialis.   If  the  Barisan  Sosialis   had   not

instigated  them, then these students would  still

have been attending school. So we come to the very

root of the whole matter - that the Barisan Sosialis

should  be blamed for the students' dismissal  and

for their loss of education.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1965.



<br><br>The Estimates before the House and the review I am

proposing  to  make in presenting these  Estimates

may  be of some interest. We have completed a full

year  of  confrontation which  has  brought  about

strains and stresses in our economy. Last  year  I

presented   a   forecast  of   possible   economic

consequences of confrontation, and this  year,  it

is  possible  to  compare the  outcome  with  that

prediction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesian economic confrontation is intended to

deny Malaysia and in particular Singapore supplies

of raw



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



materials, such as rubber, copra, timber and other

tropical  produce which Indonesia used  to  market

through  our  Malaysian ports.  Singapore  handled

more  than 80 per cent of the Indonesian  entrepot

trade  marketed  through Malaysia. Indonesia  also

closed  her  markets to our exports and re-exports

of  food,  manufacturers and consumer  goods.  How

have we fared during this period?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first observation that I want to make is

that the trade embargo which Indonesia intended to

mount  against us had never been at any  time  100

per  cent effective. In the case of trade  carried

on  through  Letters  of  Credit,  the  Indonesian

authorities  were  compelled  to  acknowledge  the

realities  of her economic situation  as  tens  of

thousands of tons of low-grade rubber piled up  in

the  ports  along the coasts of Sumatra and  South

Kalimantan.  Eventually they had to authorise  the

exports  of these goods to certain ports  in  Asia

with  the full knowledge that these products  will

be transhipped to Singapore. I understand that the

export  licences  for these goods were  personally

authorised  by  no  less  than  President  Sukarno

himself.  So,  as a result of this leakage,  Singapore  was able to recover some proportion of trade

which  she  lost  after  last  September.  I  also

understand  that  the Indonesian authorities  have

again   clamped  down  on  exports  through  third

countries and we shall wait and see what they will

do   when  their  ports  get  cluttered  up   with

unsaleable rubber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the barter trade which was carried

on  in  small  craft manned mainly  by  Indonesian

traders and crews. After confrontation the  volume

of  barter trade increased substantially. The Indo

nesian  authorities, the Navy,  the  Customs,  the

Exchange  Control,  and other  departments  proved

either unwilling or unable to prevent the movement

of  tropical  produce from Rhio  and  the  Sumatra

ports  to  Singapore. The level of  efficiency  in

their  economic operations is no better  than  the

military efficiency which they have mounted

small-scale  invasions  on the Malayan coast.  With  the

sales of such produce the Indonesian traders  were

able to buy food, provisions, textiles and

house-hold



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



goods which  they  cannot  get  from  other

sources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the fact that the economic blockade mounted

by Indonesia was incomplete, diminished the impact

of confrontation on Singapore's economy, but from

the 14th August it was necessary for the

Government to impose a total ban on the barter

trade. This trade had been used for the purposes

of smuggling explosives and arms as well as for

the infiltration of agents. The ban carried out by

our own navy, police and customs was completely

effective, unlike the futility of controls mounted

by the Indonesian authorities. So today no barter

trade is going on in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published figures of our external trade and

shipping do not include either third country

imports or transactions in the barter trade. It is

obvious that in a state of economic warfare which

Indonesia is waging against us, there is no

special reason why we should oblige our enemy with

such valuable economic information. The recorded

trade showed a considerable decline. Total imports

for the first half of this year amounted to $1,362

million as compared with $1,789 million for the

corresponding period of 1963, a decline of 23 per

cent. Exports for the first half of this year

amounted to $881 million, recording a fall of 31

per cent compared to the same period last year. In

actual fact, of course, the decline is rather less

than this for reasons which I have explained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my forecast last year of the possible effects

of confrontation, I said that if the embargo on

trade was completely effective it would lead to a

decline of something like 8.7 per cent of our

national income and unemployment in our processing

industries and shipping lines up to 8,200 persons.

In the event, this forecast proved over

pessimistic. The number of workers unemployed as a

direct result of confrontation never exceeded

4,000 at any one moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the decline in trade, even allowing

for leakages, made quite a serious impact on our

trading economy, particularly after the ban on the

barter trade. Its impact on other sectors of the

economy was partially



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



cushioned off by a number of factors. The chief

one was the high level of activity in our

construction industry and the second reason was

the growth of our manufacturing industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commerical bank lending can be taken as a good

indicator of economic activity. Outstanding

commercial bank loans stood at $808 million at the

end of January and rose to $861 million at the end

of August this year. Bank lending to the trade

sector has maintained its level, probably because

of the increases in local purchases of raw

materials from Sabah and Sarawak and other states

of Malaysia to make good the reduction in

Indonesian sources. Advances to the manufacturing

industry rose from $86.5 million in June last year

to $117.0 million this year. Similarly advances to

construction industry increased from $32.2 million

to $55.8 million during the corresponding period.

The total number of buildings under construction,

both by private enterprise and Government,

totalled 23,616 units in June this year as

compared with 16,393 units in June last year. The

expansion of the manufacturing industries I will

deal with later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of increased activity in

construction and industry that we were able to

offset to some extent the full economic effects of

Indonesian confrontation. While there has been a

decline in business activities which were linked

to Indonesian trade, and while this has extended

also to some service and entertainment industries,

I think it is a fair assessment to make that the

economy of Singapore has stood firm. We have not

cracked up under confrontation. Indeed it is the

Indonesians themselves who had to admit defeat and

who had to release exports of raw materials which

they knew would find their way to Singapore.

Naturally, from the economic point of view, a

return to normal trade with Indonesia would

provide a substantial increase in business and

general prosperity. But however much we may desire

this, we must not forget that the national

interest of Malaysia is of overriding importance.

In any event, the setback to our trading sector is

insignificant compared to the loss of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



income and the shortage of goods which Indonesia

has brought upon herself by her policy of

confrontation. Indeed, the disintegration of the

Indonesian economy - ramshackle at the best of

times - has reached the stage where the eating of

rats and corn has been commended as a patriotic

virtue.



<br><br><i>General Review of 1964 Revenue and Expenditure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to a general review of revenue and

expenditure in 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget for 1964 is the first one for the

State as an integral part of Malaysia. Expenditure

including a capital transfer of $16 million was

estimated at $326.4 million. This was almost equal

to the estimated revenue of $326.7 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to 30th September this year, actual payments

in respect of expenditure came to $219.8 million.

This practically balanced the revenue of $219.3

million received during this period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It always happens that expenditure in the last

quarter is higher than in previous quarters. This

is because bills for articles ordered earlier in

the year arrive for payment and vacancies in posts

are more fully filled up. On the other hand,

certain items of revenue fall off. The large

revenue earners, such as income and property

taxes, would have yielded most of their proceeds

during the first nine months of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure for the last quarter of the year is

estimated at about $100 million. Total expenditure

for the year is, therefore, expected to come up to

approximately $319.8 million, which is about $7

million below the amount estimated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the revenue side, a sum of $76.7 million is

expected to be collected during the last quarter.

The total for the year, therefore, will be around

$296 million, or $23 million less than expenditure. This year, the indications are that

Singapore will incur a deficit. This is the first

time that this has happened to, a  P.A.P.

Government, and I will go into the reasons later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, revenue is well maintaineci, with

only entertainment tax and

tobacco duty failing to come up to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>

expectations. The revenue from entertainment duty is

expected  to be about $7.5 million as  against  $8

million  estimated. The sum collected in 1963  was

$7.5  million. So compared to 1963 there has  been

no  fall. It is just a matter of not coming up  to

expectations.  This is due to  the  popularity  of

television, and the disturbances during  July  and

September which affected cinema attendances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobacco duty is expected to be $5.7 million

below  the  estimate of $48 million but  about  $1

million higher than 1963 revenue. This is  due  to

the  switch  from imported brands to locally  manu

factured cigarettes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two large items of revenue in the 1964

estimates for which no payments have so  far  been

received.  The  first is arrears  of  contribution

payable by the Central Government to the Singapore

Government  towards expenses of the University  of

Singapore.  The amount is $12 million. Another  is

an  amount  of  $11 million representing  currency

profits  earned in 1963 prior to Malaysia Day.  If

these two payments, totalling $23 million, were to

be made this year, we would just about balance the

budget. But it should be noted that these are

non-recurring  revenue  items  and  it  gives  me   no

pleasure to depend on them to achieve a balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other sources of revenue have not done

badly. Of the Federal taxes, i.e. taxes where  the

revenue  would be apportioned between the  Federal

Government and the State in the ratio of  40:  60,

income tax is expected to yield $92 million, which

is  $2  million  above the sum estimated,  and  $6

million  above  the 1963 figure  of  $86  million.

Customs  and Excise duties on liquor are  expected

to  be about $1.2 million higher than the estimate

of $30.5 million. Petrol duty is also up by

$3.3   million   as  compared  with   the   amount

estimated,  and is about $3½ million  higher  than

last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these figures, it would be seen that

confrontation  has made little effect  on  revenue

which  depends on the level of income. Income  tax

has slightly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



exceeded expectations. Liquor duties indicate that

people  are drinking as merrily as before. Revenue

from  petrol  duty shows that more  motorists  are

driving more cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I presented the 1964 Estimates last year, I

explained  that  the estimates on expenditure  had

been  trimmed  of all margins. This  was  done  by

assessing  actual  needs and providing  for  these

only. As a result, it was anticipated that no head

of expenditure would show substantial savings, and

indeed  certain  heads  may require  supplementary

provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure to-date confirmed my forecast. No

head of expenditure is expected to show savings of

any  substantial size. But with the  exception  of

six  heads  of expenditure, they are  expected  to

keep  within voted provisions. The heads that  are

short are seeking supplementary provisions. Taking

the  expenditure of all heads together,  shortages

as well as surpluses, expenditure for this year is

expected  to  be short of estimates  by  about  $7

million. This is insignificant out of a budget  of

$326   million  and  is  the  smallest  percentage

shortfall we have experienced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will require

additional  funds  of approximately  $10  million.

This  will raise expenditure on education for  the

year to around $105 million; slightly more than  a

third of total revenue for the year. I shall  deal

with Education expenditure in detail later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Welfare requires an additional $1.1

million   to  meet  public  assistance   payments.

Culture  is  seeking $900 thousand of  which  $390

thousand   is  in  respect  of  the   balance   of

Government's  contribution  towards  the  National

Theatre  and  the  balance is for television.  The

expenditure   for  television  had   been

under-estimated, because at the time when the  estimates

were prepared, television had been running only  a

few  months, and it was difficult to estimate with

any   accuracy  at  that  time.  But  the  rapidly

mounting cost of television is a source of concern

to my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs will require an additional $170 thousand

to increase its fleet of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



launches and speed-boats. These are required to be

able  to maintain increased sea-patrols on account

of confrontation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two heads, Planning and Marine

Surveys,  are  short  of  small  amounts  of   $47

thousand and $4 thousand respectively and are  due

to  underestimation of their requirements.  Taking

the  financial situation as a whole,  although  we

have   no   cause   for  immediate   concern,   I,

nevertheless,  want to sound a  word  of  caution.

Revenue and expenditure for the current year shows

that  the  days  are over when  we  can  take  for

granted that each financial year will end  with  a

surplus  of  $50 million or more. This  fact  will

have to be faced. We have entered a period when we

must  be careful over expenditure. This is  on  ac

count of two factors:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the rise in expenditure, particularly on

the  social services, has been too fast for

revenue to keep pace with;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the contribution which we have to make to

the  Federal Government towards defence and

Central Government services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the rise in expenditure on social services

has  been  particularly  fast.  The  increase   in

expenditure  on education in particular  has  been

spectacular. In my first Budget speech in 1959,  I

drew  attention  to  the effect  which  population

growth would have on education expenditure  and  I

predicted that by 1970 we may well have  to  spend

$180  million a year which was then more than half

the  revenue  we were earning in 1959. Expenditure

for  the past few years has confirmed my forecast.

Recurrent  annual  expenditure  on  education  has

risen from



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$57 million in 1960 to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$67 million in 1961,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$82 million in 1962,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$94 million in 1963, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$105 million expected to be for 1964.



<br><br>These figures represent only the running costs and

exclude  development expenditure such as  cost  of

building  new  schools. So in the  space  of  four

years,   expenditure  on  education   has   almost

doubled. This rate of increase is,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



however,  mercifully expected to fall off.  A  benign

providence  must have heard my cry of  despair  in

1959, for the birthrate since then began to show a

substantial  and  continuous  decline  each  year.

Members will recall that in 1946, the first

post-war  year,  the number of babies born was  38,665.

The  number increased at a frightening  rate  each

year,  and  by 1958 has reached 62,495. The  crude

birth  rate,  i.e, number  of  babies  born   per

thousand of population, was 41.3 per thousand  and

has gone down steadily to 33.5 last year. In terms

of  actual  number  of  babies  born,  the  annual

figures  from 1959 to 1963 read as follows 62,464,

61,775, 59,930, 58,977 and 59,530. As these births

relate to a population that is growing and increas

ing  each year, it means that the crude birth rate

is declining. Detailed demographic studies show  a

continuous  decline in the age-specific  fertility

rates in all age groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this dramatic change in demographic trends

in  the  state seems to have escaped the attention

of  the  public.  It is no longer  true  that  the

population of Singapore is increasing at the

world-record  rate  of  4 per cent or more.  The  latest

estimates for 1963 show an annual increase of some

2.2 per cent, still too high but not as bad as  it

was a decade ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, expenditure on secondary and higher

education  will continue to rise in the  next  few

years,  as  the  present crop of primary  students

move  up,  before such expenditure finally  levels

off.   I   have  mentioned  that  expenditure   on

education takes up slightly more than one-third of

total revenue, and this is a very high proportion.

So,  under  existing conditions, it will  be  very

rash  to introduce any change in education  policy

which  will raise expenditure beyond our financial

resources.



<br><br><i>The 1965 Estimates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the estimates for 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1965 revenue has been estimated at $339.6

million   and   expenditure  at  $359.8   million,

including a capital transfer of $20 million to the

Development                                  Fund.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total estimated revenue of $339.6

million,  the  State  share  of  Federal   Revenue

collected  in Singapore has been taken to  be  the

existing  one, namely 60 per cent.  Our  share  of

Federal  revenue  is estimated at $190.2  million,

which  is  about 56 per cent of the total  revenue

accruing to the State Government, the other 44 per

cent being local taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main revenue-yielding taxes, i.e. income

tax, customs duties, liquor, petroleum and tobacco

duties, road tax and estate duty, are all Federal.

A  change in the rates of taxation by the  Federal

Government   will,  therefore,  also  affect   our

revenue, as will any revision in the apportionment

ratio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not, of course, at this stage know what

tax  changes  the Federal Government may  want  to

introduce for the next financial year. Our revenue

estimates are being prepared on the basis of  what

we  anticipate  will happen in Kuala  Lumpur.  Our

assumptions  need not necessarily be correct,  and

what  the  Central Government decides to do  could

throw  our  estimates off the mark. Preparing  the

estimates  under such conditions  is,  of  course,

unsatisfactory.  There appears to  be  a  need  to

change our financial year to enable us to complete

our  estimates  after the taxation policy  of  the

Central  Government is known, and in due course  I

may come up to ask the Assembly to consider moving

the  financial year to begin later in the calendar

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1965, the State's share of Federal revenue

has  been  estimated at $190.2 million as  against

$175.6 million estimated for 1964. These estimates

are  made  on the basis that the rates of existing

taxes  will remain the same, and on the assumption

that  certain  protective duties will  be  imposed

under the Common Market arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On present performances, income tax is expected

to  increase by $1.9 million. Customs  and  excise

duties  on liquor are estimated to bring  in  $3.4

million more than the $30.5 million estimated  for

1964. Other major sources of Federal revenue  that

are expected to yield more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



money  are motor vehicles' registration  fees  and

the road tax, stamp duty and estate duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the assumption that certain new protective

duties will be introduced, this source of revenue,

which hitherto has been insignificant, is expected

to yield about $7 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from State sources is estimated at

$149.4  million, which is $1.7 million lower  than

the $151.1 million estimated for 1964. The drop in

revenue from State sources is mainly on account of

the State losing two major items of revenue:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) currency profits which were estimated to

bring in $11 million in 1964. This now goes

to the Central Bank;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) port dues estimated at $2.5 million for

1964. This will in future go to the Port of

Singapore Authority.



<br><br>Contributions  in  respect  of  the  Widows'   and

Orphans'  Scheme are estimated to fall by  half  a

million dollars. This is because the intention  is

to wind up the scheme. No new contributors will be

accepted  and  it  is expected that  a  number  of

existing  contributors will opt out. Entertainment

duty  is estimated to be around the actual  amount

to  be collected this year. This is half a million

dollars  lower than the amount shown in  the  1964

estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline of revenue from these four items

amounts  to $14.5 million. The total is only  $1.7

million  lower  than the total  for  1964  because

other  items of revenue are expected to  increase.

Since  they  relate  to a large  number  of  minor

items, I do not intend to touch on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to 1965 expenditure. Education again

takes first place with an estimated expenditure of

$107.9  million. This is $13 million  higher  than

the  1964  estimates, but only  about  $3  million

higher than what is expected to be spent in  1964.

Actual  expenditure in 1964 includes $2.5  million

in  respect  of payment of arrears  of  salary  to

women teachers on their conversion to men's salary

scales. So the estimate for 1965 represents a real

increase of $5.5 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next comes Hospitals Division which shows an

increase of $3.1 million arising from an expansion

of  hospital  facilities.  The  estimate  for  the

Ministry of Culture is increased by $2.2

million - mainly on account of expansion in television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of "charge on account of

public debt" which is a statutory expenditure, the

other   heads  of  expenditure  show  only  modest

increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to draw attention to the

addition  of  a  new  head  of  expenditure,   the

Ministry of Law, Head account code No. 1101.  This

head  only  shows  the Minister  for  Law  with  a

skeleton staff for his Ministry headquarters.  The

departments   discharging  functions   under   his

portfolio  are  still  shown  under  their  former

Ministries. This is because by the time the duties

of  the  Minister for Law were decided  upon,  the

draft  estimates had already been  in  an  advance

state  of  preparation, and there was insufficient

time  to  extract these departments out  and  show

them  where they rightly belong. The position will

be regularised in the 1966 estimates.



<br><br><i>Development Expenditure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964, development expenditure by Government

Ministries  and departments is expected  to  total

$166.4 million as compared with $134.3 million  in

1963. This shows an increase of 23.2 per cent.  If

we  include  development expenditure of  Statutory

Authorities,  such as the Public Utilities  Board,

the  Port  Authority, Economic Development  Board,

the  Telephone  Board, and others, development  in

the  public  sector in 1964 will  come  to  $254.4

million  as  against  $198.0  million  in  1963 - an

increase of 28.5 per cent over last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Statutory Authorities are important

agencies  of economic development in the State,  I

will  deal with the whole of the public sector  in

my  review and not confine it to Government departments and Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in previous years, I will deal with

development expenditure in the public sector under

three    convenient   heads,    namely  -  economic

development,   social   development   and   public

administration. The totals for each of these  main



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



sub-sectors  are  as  follows -  economic  development

$156.5  million, social development $96.3 million,

and  public administration $1.6 million, making  a

grand total of $254.4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic development consists in the purchase

and  development of land, provision of  power  and

other public utilities, construction of industrial

estates, laying of new roads, improvement  of  old

roads,    construction   of   wharves,    bridges,

telephones and others. In a word, to provide  what

the economists call "the infra-structure".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land and agricultural development amounted to

$11.3    million.   Rural   development    schemes

maintained  a  high  tempo  during  the  year.  60

schemes  for  the extension of power  supplies  to

villages  and  village roads have been  completed.

Farmers and fishermen both on the main island  and

the  Southern  Islands  continue  to  receive   an

increasing   scale  of  extension  services.   Six

existing veterinary extension services were  fully

occupied,  and  it is necessary  to  add  two  new

veterinary clinics to cope with increasing work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial development continues to receive the

urgent  attention  of the Government.  Expenditure

this year is expected to total $117.2

million - this  is  expenditure  of  government  and  public

authorities,   and   does  not   include   private

investment.   The  main  agency  of  the   State's

industrial  promotion effort is,  of  course,  the

Economic  Development Board, whose  exertions  are

now  beginning to show results. Of the  113  firms

awarded pioneer status, 43 are in production.  The

actual  capital  investment in  plant,  equipment,

building  and  land  carried out  by  these  firms

totalled $132.5 million as on 31-8-64. These firms

provided  an  initial employment of 2,233  persons

and  this  has increased to 4,195 by  the  end  of

August. When all the firms are in full production,

employment  is  expected  to  increase  to   6,687

persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the 47 pioneer industries already

in production, another 54 are at various stages of

implementation. $37.9 million has already been

spent by these firms on construction, design and

so on. Their final capital outlay would be in the

region of $234.1 million. These



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



54  industries  will provide employment  to  6,368

persons  at initial production and 9,331  when  in

full  production.  Of  the  remaining  12  pioneer

firms,  8  have shown very little progress  and  4

projects have been abandoned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to pioneer industries, there are, of

course,  others which do not qualify  for  pioneer

status.  A  count  made  at  the  last  census  of

production  showed that 120 new non-pioneer  firms

went  up  during  the reference year.  These  were

mostly  small  factories employing 10  persons  or

more. The small industries are not being neglected

or  overlooked by Government. The Light Industries

Services   has   been  set  up  by  the   Economic

Development  Board to provide loan,  training  and

technical  assistance  to small  manufacturers  in

need  of them. Among the larger non-pioneer indust

ries  either  in production or in the  process  of

implementation, there are 11 of substantial  size,

including  a number of motor car assembly  plants.

These  11 industries involve an investment of  $44

million  with  an employment potential  of  nearly

4,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Industrial Estate occupies a pivotal

position in our industrialisation programme. 1,400

acres  of  land have been levelled, reclaimed  and

prepared for occupation. Another 400 acres are  in

the course of preparation. To date, 74 enterprises

have been allotted sites. 19 are in production and

another 12 are expected to be in production by the

end of this year. Another 15 are at various stages

of  construction  and most of  them  would  be  in

production in 1965. I had recently made  a  review

of  progress  of works in Jurong,  the  new  Port,

roads,  railways,  electricity, industrial  water,

housing,  bridges and other matters. As honourable

Members  are  doubtless aware of the  contents  of

this review, I need not repeat myself on this occasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal instead with progress in the smaller

industrial estates. This too has been encouraging.

At  Tanglin  Halt, out of a total of  56  prepared

lots, 54 have been allocated to 34 companies.  All

the  sites  at Redhill have been taken  up  by  30

enterprises, of which 26 are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



in  production. At the end of September all  sites

in  the Kallang Industrial Estate have been  taken

up  and  ten firms were in operation. The prepared

plots at the Bendemeer Road and Kampong Ampat Road

industrial  estates  have all been  allocated  and

work  is progressing. Because of land shortage  in

the city area, it is necessary to resort to

multi-storied flatted factories. Piling for the first of

such factories has commenced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to public utilities, the extension of

electric  power  supplies is proceeding  ahead  of

schedule  with $58.7 million expected to be  spent

this  year. With the installation of a new 25 m.w.

steam  turbo-alternator set and  6x6.0  m.w. open

cycle  gas  turbines, the generating capacity  has

been increased from 152 m.w. in 1961 to 226 mw, in

1963  and to 284 m.w. by the end of this  year  as

against the target figure of 264 m.w. envisaged in

the   4-Year  Development  Plan.  The  demand  for

electricity  has  been  increasing  steadily.  The

first  new 60 m.w. alternator will be commissioned

in 1964, the second by May 1965, and the third and

fourth  by  June and September 1966.  Transmission

and distribution schemes for extending supplies of

electricity  to  many  parts  of  the  estate,  in

particular  to the Jurong Industrial Estate,  have

been   carried  out  successfully.  The  installed

capacity  for the manufacture of gas  has  doubled

from 538 million cubic feet in 1960 to about 1,160 million cubic feet in 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schemes for the increased supply of water to meet

the  growing  needs  of  the  population  are   in

progress.  Soil  investigation in connection  with

the  Johore River Project was completed  in  April

this   year.  Land  has  been  acquired  for   the

headworks in Kota Tinggi. The first phase  of  the

project is expected to be completed in 1967/68  at

an  estimated  cost of $40 million.  Progress  has

also been made on the Scudai River Project, and by

August  it was possible to pump 12 million gallons

of  treated  water per day. The whole  project  is

expected to be completed sometime next month  when

we would be able to add another 30 million gallons

per day to our water supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year under review transport and

communications  present  a  picture   of   greater

progress   than  in  previous  years.   With   the

completion  of the East Wharf Scheme,  expenditure

in  1964  was incurred on other development  items

such as portable diesel generators, extensions  to

Dockyard  head office and provision  of  quarters.

Further plans for the expansion and improvement of

facilities in the harbour are nearing completion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil aviation projects progressed ahead of

schedule.  In May, the new international Passenger

Terminal  Building was opened. Other  notable  com

pleted projects include the construction of a  new

extension  to  the Jet Parking Apron, installation

of  a Surveillance Radar Equipment, and High Power

VHF  Radio  Telephone equipment. Orders have  been

placed for Automatic Speech Recorders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of our telephone system is

progressing  at a faster rate than  was  expected,

$6.75 million being spent in 1964 as against $3.34

million planned. With four new telephone exchanges

at  Nee Soon, Changi, Bukit Timah and Jurong,  new

connections increased from 35,358 lines in 1960 to

52,130 lines by September 1964. A submarine  cable

has been laid between Singapore and Pulau Bukom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Multi-Storey Car Park, a new project in the

State Plan, was completed in June this year  at  a

cost of $2.45 million providing bays for 882 cars,

about  300 motor cycle and scooters. In July  this

year,   work   started  on   the   Raffles   Place

Underground Car Park, to provide parking bays  for

140 cars. This will be completed next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of roads, drains, and bridges has

also  shown  progress.  However,  the  removal  of

squatters  in  certain areas  is  a  factor  still

impeding the rate of construction. In all,  $11.80

million will be spent in 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of social development a total of

$93.6  million will be spent by the  end  of  this

year  on  capital  expenditure  as  against  $79.7

million last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's programme of public low-cost housing

proceeds  with  undiminished vigour.  The  Housing

Board  has completed 9,636 flats so far this year,

and  by the end of the year, another 12,000  flats

will  be  under construction, nearly one-third  of

which will be Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Television was introduced in February last year

and  by last month 51,515 television licences have

been   issued.   Work   has   commenced   on   the

construction of a permanent T.V. studio  which  is

expected to be ready by April 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health is concentrating on

consolidating their services rather than expanding

them.  Nevertheless,  development  has  not   been

neglected. Ten new school dental clinics  will  be

completed  by the end of the year. At the  General

Hospital,   a   third  medical   unit   is   under

construction.  At  the Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital  a

Thoracic Surgical Unit is being built. Both  these

works will be completed in 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education continues to build new

schools  as  well as extending the capacity  of  a

number  of existing schools. 21 schools are  under

construction and 8 will be completed this year. In

view  of the changed demographic trends I referred

to  earlier, it is necessary to make a  review  of

the    Ministry's    future   development    plan.

Construction  of an additional three-storey  block

at  the  Vocational  Institute  has  commenced  re

cently. This is to prepare the skilled workers and

artisans  which industry needs. The  International

Conference  Hall and Trade Union House at  Shenton

Way is nearing completion. The target date set for

the opening of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



substantial building, costing $4.5 million, is set

for  March 1965. The Social Welfare Department has

completed  a  home for the aged at Woodlands.  The

Youth  Leadership Training Centre of the  People's

Association was also completed this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a new chapter in Singapore's history begins

this  year with the rebuilding of the city itself.

The detailed plans for the development of Southern

Precinct  I bounded by New Bridge Road,  Havelock

Road,  Outram Road and Chin Swee Road and Northern

Precinct I bounded by Beach Road, Crawford Street,

Victoria   Street  and  Jalan  Sultan   has   been

completed.  1,173  families  have  been  moved  to

Housing  Board  flats and the vacant  houses  have

been  demolished. Construction of new houses  will

begin next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sector is a small one, namely, public

administration.  This relates to  improvement  and

construction of Government offices and  buildings.

The  amount  to be spent this year comes  to  $1.6

million.



<br><br><i>1965 Development Estimates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the 1965 Development Estimates.

1965  is  to  be an extended phase of the  State's

Four-Year  Development Plan and most  of  the  pro

visions  in  the  Development  Estimates  are  for

continuing  projects. Broadly,  the  emphasis  has

been on the completion of schemes already started,

leaving most of important new schemes to the  next

Plan.  The new plan period will be for five  years

commencing in 1966 and this will bring the State's

plan  period  into  line  with  other  states   of

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, a number of new projects in

the  Estimates.  It will be noticed  that  against

several  of these projects only a token  provision

of  $10 has been made, or the votes have been made

subject  to Treasury sanction. This is  to  enable

further examination of the projects as to the best

means of their implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Ministry of Finance, a provision of

$300,000 is made to take up the option offered  to

the  Singapore Government of purchasing shares  of

Malaysian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



Airways  Ltd, amounting to  5  per  cent  of  the

increased  capital  arising out  of  the  proposed

amalgamation of Malaysian Airways Ltd, with Borneo

Airways Ltd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Customs and Excise Department, there is

provision  for Customs Stations and Facilities,  a

Free  Trade Zone to ensure that there are adequate

Customs  facilities to implement  Customs  control

over goods leaving the Port of Singapore Authority

when  the Free Trade Zone is established. Further,

with  the  rapid progress made in  Jurong,  it  is

necessary to provide a Customs Station and Transit

Bond   outside  the  area  to  exercise  effective

control  over  movements  of  dutiable  goods  and

smuggling. An extension to Customs House  is  also

required in view of the expanding functions of the

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Printer will acquire equipment to

enable  a  more  speedy  output  of  work  in  the

Bookbinding   and  Composing  Sections   to   meet

increasing demands on the Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will bring existing

schools  up to standard size requirements  in  its

provision for major extensions to eleven  existing

schools  and  the reconstruction of  four  Primary

Schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health will extend facilities at

the Nurses Training School at the General Hospital

as  the  number  of  students at  the  School  has

increased from 400 to 800 students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Ministry of National Development, a sum of

$39.5  million for Phase II has been  allotted  to

the  Housing  and Development Board  to  meet  its

second  five-year  programme of low-cost  housing.

This  includes  a  provision of  $10  million  for

housing in the Jurong Industrial Area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completion of programmes started under Phase I

will  need  an  additional $35.5 million.  So  the

Housing  Board will receive a total of $75 million

for the building of low-cost flats in their princi

pal  housing  estates.  This,  of  course,  is  in

addition to the $20 million to be allotted for the

renewal   of   the  city  which  I  have   already

discussed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the major activities of the Ministry of

National  Development are worthy of  mention.  The

East Coast Reclamation Scheme will proceed with re

newed vigour. $1.8 million has hitherto been spent

in  reclaiming  land  off  Bedok.  Next  year  $12

million has been allotted for continuation of this

work.  When  completed in four years'  time,  this

vast  land  reclamation scheme will result  in  an

addition  of  1,200  acres or 2  square  miles  to

Singapore's   territorial  domain.   The   Kallang

reclamation  work will continue. $4.4 million  has

been spent so far and an additional $5 million has

been set aside next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Public Works Non-Recurrent, a number of

new  schemes  are  required. The Sungei  Pang  Sua

Drainage   Scheme  will  eliminate   flooding   at

Woodlands between the 11th and 14th milestones and

in Bukit Panjang. Another drainage scheme at Tiong

Bahru  will also alleviate flooding in that  area.

Under the Roads programme, the widening of Frankel

Avenue and Whitley Road is required in view of the

greater  volume  of  traffic  along  these  single

carriageway  roads. At Nicoll Highway,  two  extra

lanes  will  be  built to cope with the  increased

traffic load.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A valuable project of the Primary Production

Department of the Ministry of National Development

is  the  construction of the Abattoir  and  animal

quarantine  station  in  Jurong.  A  sum  of  $4.6

million has been voted for this project. Work  has

already  started. Now, contrary to the expectation

of  both laymen and experts, there is in Singapore

a thriving livestock industry based on the rearing

of  poultry  and  pigs.  Not  only  are  we

self-sufficient in these products, but we are  actually

exporting  large quantities of poultry, eggs,  and

pigs to other States of Malaysia. We must now look

to  overseas  markets which we can supply  by  the

canning of meat products. But before we can  build

an  export market in canned meat, we must  satisfy

international health requirements in the slaughter

of  animals. Our present abattoir is decrepit  and

out  of  date.  A new abattoir has been  carefully

planned and designed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



in  Jurong  with  the assistance of  experts  from

Denmark.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this modern abattoir becomes operational,

it  will  make a contribution not only by  way  of

export  of  canned meat but also  by  providing  a

supply  of  many by-products for local industries,

such  as  hides and skins for the leather  tannery

being  established in Jurong, the supply of animal

waste,  bones and offal for the organic fertilizer

factory that is also going up there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of new roads and bridges and

extension  to  existing roads and improvements  to

bridges  have  become a matter  of  great  urgency

because  of  the rapid increase in the  number  of

motor  vehicles.  No less than $15.5  million  has

been set aside for this purpose next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the interesting projects authorised for

next  year, is the construction of flyovers  along

Bukit  Timah and Dunearn Roads at the junction  of

Farrer Road and Adam Road. A sum of $1 million  is

to  be  voted for this project. This is the  first

time   that   we  are  constructing  flyovers   in

Singapore  but  the  motivation  of  this  is  not

prestige  but,  as motorists will  testify,  sheer

necessity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, the criteria on which any development

project  is  judged, had been  its  value  to  the

State. This means that in one way or the other the

project  must  add to the sinews of  our  economic

muscles, or increase the capability of present and

future generations of citizens. These criteria had

been  sternly  utilitarian as befits a  developing

nation.  It would be irrational for us to  go  for

the  frills  and frivolities on the  one  hand  or

prestigious  magnificence on the  other.  Affluent

societies can afford to do this. Bankrupt nations,

like Indonesia, also do this, although they cannot

afford it, in the quest of a momentary illusion of

grandeur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet it will be wrong for us completely to

overlook  the need for some grace and elegance  in

public amenities. Some new projects entered in the

next  year's  estimates show a relaxation  of  the

austere  standards which we have  applied  in  the

past. For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



instance, $150,000 will be spent on developing the

Mount  Faber Scenic Park. A garden is to be  built

over  the  underground car park at Raffles  Place,

for which purpose $120,000 has been set aside. The

Woodlands  tree  nurseries  will  be  extended  to

provide the trees which are needed in the campaign

to  grow  more trees in Singapore. Another $40,000

has been set aside for extension to the children's

play-ground. We also propose to build a number  of

fountains  in  some  roundabouts  and  in   public

places.  Next year, in all, half a million dollars

has   been  set  aside  for  these  fountains  and

$100,000  will be spent next year. The  Van  Kleef

Aquarium  has  been  allotted  some  $43,900   for

improvements  and  extension. All  these  projects

will  go some way to beautify our island and  make

it a more congenial place to live in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concludes my review of what we have done

this  year and what we intend to do next year.  On

the  economic front, nothing has happened that has

upset the forecast which I made last year that  we

can  successfully  ride Indonesian  confrontation.

The  collapse  which the Indonesians had  expected

and   which  their  anti-national  pro-Communistic

allies in Singapore were hoping for, did not  take

place.  On  the  contrary, with  the  enthusiastic

support   of  the  masses,  our  great   work   of

construction and industrial development took great

steps  forward.  And so it will go  on  until  the

Indonesians  and their local stooges  realise  the

futility of their fight against Malaysia.

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapidly increasing population in

Singapore which is estimated to reach 4 million in

1990,  the  Master Plan which was designed  for  a

population  of  2  million will  have  to  undergo

radical   changes   to  take  into   account   the

population  growth.  Part of the  lands  presently

allocated  for  rural uses, green belt,  and  even

agriculture will have to be re-zoned for  industry

and   other   urban  uses,  and  the  density   of

population  in residential zones will have  to  be

increased to enable a more intensive use of  land.

All  these will cause an increase in the price  of

land, since land is a scarce and limited factor in

the  resources of the State. In consequence,  many

landowners will stand to benefit from an  increase

of  land  values through no additional  effort  on

their  part, except that they are fortunate enough

to own land near to areas developed by the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a view to securing to the State the

increases  in  value  of  land  brought  about  by

community development and not through the  efforts

of  the  landowner, the Government has  considered

various  measures  including  the  acquisition  of

development rights in land, the acquisition of the

freehold in land, and the freezing of land prices,

but   after   very   careful  consideration,   the

Government  has decided that, as a  practical  and

immediate measure, a development charge should  be

made   on   all   written  permissions   for   the

development of land beyond the existing  permitted

use.  The  broad  principle is  that  any  written

permission  granted which allows development  over

what  is normally permitted in the present  Master

Plan  will attract a development charge. In  other

words, landowners or other interested persons  who

will benefit from the grant of permission must pay

to the State a part of this benefit in the form of

a development charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to add a new part, Part III A,

entitled   Development  Charge,  to  the  Planning

Ordinance. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



provides for the levy of a development charge on  the

grant   of   written  permission   which   permits

development  in excess of the average  residential

density  prescribed  in the  Master  Plan,  or  an

average residential density of 50 persons per acre

in  the  Island map of the Master Plan, or  on  an

alteration  to the Master Plan after 1st  January,

1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date 1st January, 1964, is intended to serve

as  a  datum to distinguish between the provisions

of   the   present  Master  Plan  and   subsequent

alterations. The charge may be levied on the  land

owner  or  the person making the application,  and

must be paid or secured to the satisfaction of the

Competent  Authority  before  the  grant  of   the

written  permission.  Statutory  Boards  will   be

exempted from the charge. The charge is determined

by  an  order of the Competent Authority, and  any

person  who is dissatisfied with the order  as  to

the   development  charge,  may  appeal   to   the

Minister.  The development charge, in  default  of

payment, can be recovered as a first charge on the

land of any person from whom the money is due. The

Bill  empowers  the  Minister to  make  rules  for

prescribing  the  different rates  of  development

charges;  the exemption of a particular, or  class

of development from such charge, and the procedure

for  an  application for the determination of  the

charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also become increasingly evident over the

past two years that a great majority of

applications for development are made not with the

intention of developing the site for which plann

ing permission has been granted, but for the

purpose of speculation. We get the absurd position

of the planning permission or the planning script

being hawked around the market, with no actual

development taking place on the site. The

Government views with concern the abuse of the

planning machinery which has produced a large

number of sites carrying planning approvals with

little prospect of their being developed. Such

approved sites can be obstacles to the future

planning of the locality, as any Government

schemes affecting them would render the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



Government liable to a larger compensation than if

the site had not received planning approval.

Clause 3 of the Bill accordingly provides that any

written permission for building and other opera

tions granted after, the appointed day, will lapse

if the development is not, completed within two

years of the grant of permission with the proviso

that such permission may be renewed for such

period as is considered necessary by the Competent

Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is further provided in clause 4 that any

written permission granted before the appointed

day for building or other operations may be

cancelled by the Competent Authority if the

development is not completed within three years

after the appointed day. This provision is similar

to section 10 of the Planning Ordinance which

provides for the cancellation of planning

permission granted under the Singapore Improvement

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken also to tighten

and strengthen the existing provisions on planning

enforcement. Clause 5 seeks to repeal and to

re-enact the enforcement provision in section 13 of

the Ordinance with amendments. Clause 5 now

provides for enforcement notices to be served not

only on the person who has carried out development

without planning permission, but also on the owner

or occupier of the land. A person who is convicted

for failing to comply with the directions in an en

forcement notice will now be liable to a

continuing fine of a maximum of $100 per day for

each day during which the offence is continued

after conviction. It is further provided that a

person who, after compliance with an enforcement

notice, uses the land or carries out any

re-instatement or restoration of the building, will

be guilty of an offence punishable by fine or

imprisonment, or both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 gives authority to persons authorised

by the Minister or the Competent Authority to

enter upon any land for the purpose of carrying

out the provisions of the Ordinance, and makes it

an offence for any person who obstructs such

persons in the exercise of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



this  authority. This is to afford protection  to

officers  in  the exercise of their duties  under

the  Ordinance. This clause also provides for the

methods  of recovery of any money due  under  the

Ordinance. The proceedings are similar  to  those

provided  for the recovery of property tax  under

the Property Tax Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of clause 10 is to simplify the

administrative  process by  transferring  to  the

Minister  all  references to the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  wherever this expression appears  in  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining clauses 1, 2, 6, 8 and 11 provide

for minor and consequential amendments.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Widows' and Orphans' Pension Scheme

enshrined  in  the Widows' and Orphans'  Pensions

Ordinance is a compulsory contributory scheme for

all   Government   officers   who   are   holding

pensionable  offices, and who are  restricted  by

law  to  monogamous marriages. Formerly this,  in

practice,  meant Government officers of Christian

religion.  The scheme was designed, as  its  name

suggests,  to cater for the interests  of  widows

and  orphans  of public servants, and  indeed  it

served  a  useful purpose at the  time  when  the

scheme was brought into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



operation. However, in a democratic society such

as we are, anything that suggests of compulsion is

suspect and often strongly disliked, and over the

years the staff unions, including individual officers,

have voiced strong opposition to this scheme and have

pressed for its abolition or conversion to a voluntary

scheme. A further complication cropped up when the

Government introduced the Women's Charter in September

1961. This resulted in those Government officers who

are non-Christians and who are not restricted to

monogamous marriages before being now

obliged to contribute to the scheme. It was not the

intention then to bring such officers within the ambit

of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Ordinance. It is

now clear that the scheme has outdated its usefulness.

Bearing in mind, therefore, the feelings of the staff

unions, the

position of officers who through the Women's Charter

suddenly found themselves liable to contribute to the

scheme, the Government decided to make contributions

to the scheme voluntarily and to extend to existing

contributors the choice of opting out of the scheme if

they wish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be three options under the present

amendment, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Government officers can continue to contribute;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) they can cease to contribute and elect to be paid

an actuarially calculated sum; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) they can cease to contribute and preserve the

rights that have accrued to them under the Widows'

and Orphans' Pensions Ordinance.



<br><br>These various options are not new. Similar options

had already been written into the Ordinance in

1958 but confined to the benefit of expatriate

officers who went away on Malayanisation.

Therefore, in a sense, the present amendment Bill

now before the House merely extends the options to

local officers -- concessions which they have been

clamouring for unsuccessfully in the past.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



The proposed amendment will also preclude

membership of the scheme those officers who are

appointed to the Government service on or after

2nd March 1961, the date prescribed in the Women's

Charter for marriages thereafter to be monogamous.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His

Excellency's approval to proceed with this Bill,

and I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my Budget speech last year I said that

entertainment duty on pro-fessional boxing would

be reduced from 33 per cent to 15 per cent, the

cost of each ticket sold with effect from 1st

January this year. I explained at that time that

entertainment duty in most of the States of

Malaysia was half the Singapore rate and, as a

result, professional boxing had been in the dol

drums since 1960 and the amount of tax collected

had been negligible. This Bill seeks to remedy the

situation, and it is hoped that it will give a

fillip to the sport



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (a) of the Bill seeks to delete

"professional boxing" from the list of

entertainments which must be charged the full

rate. Clause 11 empowers the Minister, in addition

to exempting any entertainment or class of

entertainment from the payment of duty, to vary

the duty payable in respect of any entertainment

or class of entertainment subject to conditions.

It is proposed to validate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



the    reduction   in   entertainment   duty   for

professional boxing mentioned in my Budget  speech

last year under clause 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, time and experience show the weaknesses of

any  legislation,  and  the opportunity  has  been

taken to make certain amendments to the Bill shown

to  be  necessary in the light of past experience.

The  present  law  provides that open-air  cinemas

will pay entertainment duty at half the prescribed

rates.   Unfortunately  the  Ordinance  does   not

contain  any  definition of an "open-air  cinema".

This  has  given rise to difficulties in  applying

the  law and to a request from the proprietors  of

open-air cinemas for a proper definition. Clause 2

now provides an acceptable definition of "open-air

cinema".   Henceforth,  all  cinemas   which   are

entirely exposed to the sky will come within  this

definition. All other cinemas will be charged  the

full rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new subsection (4) to section 4 of the

Ordinance is introduced in clause 3 of the Bill to

enable the Comptroller to pay all moneys collected

under  the  Ordinance into the State  Consolidated

Fund  as  State revenue derived from entertainment

duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 adds to the powers of the Comptroller

the  power to require proprietors of entertainment

to  give appropriate security against payments  of

entertainment  duty. This will  safeguard  against

default  of  payments  of  revenue  due   to   the

Government  especially in  the  cases  of  ad  hoc

entertainment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in clause 8 will enable the

Comptroller  to order the refund of  entertainment

duty  overpaid provided a claim in respect thereof

is made within six months of such overpayment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9 (2) of the existing Ordinance provides

that if the Comptroller is of the opinion that the

payment of a lump sum or any payment for a  ticket

includes  other privileges, rights or purposes  be

sides  admission  to  an entertainment  or  covers

admission  to an entertainment during  any  period

for  which the duty has not been in operation, the

duty  shall be charged on such proportion as repre

sents the right of admission to a particular  type

of entertainment in respect of which entertainment

duty is payable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



The   expression  "or  covers  admission   to   an

entertainment during any period for which duty has

not  been  in  operation" was  required  when  the

Ordinance was brought into force in 1952 for cases

of    lump   sum   payments   for   admission   to

entertainments before and after the in, troduction

of  the Ordinance. After twelve years the need for

this particular provision no longer exists. So  it

is proposed to delete this expression from section

9 (2) of the Ordinance by clause 9.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other minor amendments are contained in clauses

4,  6, 7, 10 and 12. These include substitution of

the  word  "Colony"  wherever it  appears  in  the

Ordinance  with the word "State". The  removal  of

restrictions  on  the kind of  audience  at  which

entertainment is held for entertainment  purposes,

and where there has been a breach of any condition

attached  to  the  certificate granting  exemption

from  duty,  provision is made for  such  duty  to

become payable on demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Entertainments Duty (Amendment) Bill introduced by

the Government has two main purposes. Firstly, it

is designed to increase revenue. Secondly, it is

to provide the P.A.P. and their cliques with

certain facilities. According to clause 3 of this

Bill, although a certain reduction is provided,

the taxes on cinemas have been increased. In the

past, taxes on open-air cinemas were only half of

those for ordinary cinemas. The taxes then were 25

per cent for the ordinary cinemas. Whereas

formerly it was 12.5 per cent, it has now been

increased to 25 per cent. I think the reason may

be due to the reduction in the entertainment

revenue. The increase in revenue which this

provision will perhaps bring, will enable the

Government to use it for other purposes. But I am

afraid the Government may perhaps use the money

for its political activities or to buy guns or

ammunition. I am not sure of this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to section 12, the Minister has the

discretion  to  exempt  entertainment   duty   on

certain  cinemas  or to reduce their  levies.  In

other words, it gives the Minister the same power

for  his  own purposes. The Bill is full  of  the

Fascist  spirit. As I have said, the  purpose  of

this  Bill  is for the convenience of the  P.A.P.

and  their cliques. So that for those people  who

are  in the same clique as the P.A.P. the Minister

could  exercise  his discretion and  exempt  them

from  paying  taxes or reduce  their  taxes.  For

others  it  will  be strictly  according  to  the

regulations. Why should the Government not exempt

concerts or stage acts for charity from entertain

ment  duty?  I  doubt the true intention  of  the

P.A.P. I say that the Bill is full of the Fascist

spirit, it has a dictatorial flavour. If you want

to  develop local cultural activities and promote

local   artistic  performances,  then  you   must

encourage  healthy performances.  The  Government

should provide more facilities for them. When  we

were  debating the vote for the National Theatre,

the  sum involved was about $450,000. The  charge

was  so much. But the Government has not provided

the  same facilities to other civic organisations

who  put up cultural activities, it is, in  fact,

impeding  the healthy development of culture.  On

the  other hand, there are certain concerts  anti

cultural    activities   put   up   by    certain

organisations which should also be exempted. This

will  reduce  their  burden.  It  would  also  be

beneficial  to  all concerned. I  feel  that  the

Government  should not abuse this provision.  The

Minister  should  not have any bias  against  any

civic organisation in exercising this power.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it

is  a fair statement to make that if a person  is

elected   to   represent   the   people   in    a

representative  Assembly such as ours,  there  is

some  obligation  on  the part  of  the  people's

representative,   that   is,   the    Legislative

Assemblyman,  to understand what  he  is  talking

about in this Chamber. First, he must be able  to

understand what the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



Bill  means. I say that the hon. Member  has  not

shown the slightest trace of understanding. First

of   all,   before  you  can  pass  judgment   on

Government's  policy  or Government's  intention,

you  must  know what the facts are. He says  that

clause  3 is intended to double the entertainment

duty on open-air cinemas. It does nothing of  the

sort.  As I have mentioned in my speech -  and  I

have   made   it  clear  even  to   the   meanest

intelligence - this clause provides a  definition

of  an open-air cinema. It is the open-air cinema

operators themselves who have been asking  Govern

ment  for  a clear definition, because then  they

will  know  exactly how their cinemas  should  be

constructed anti how they qualify for the reduced

rates on open-air cinemas. So what the Member has

said  about Fascist legislation, Mr Speaker,  is

absolute nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the second point. He says that clause 11

gives  me new power to exempt certain classes  of

entertainment from duty. He says, of course, that

the purpose of this is to give P.A.P. branches or

the    P.A.P.   Central   Committee   duty   free

entertainment.  Mr  Speakers  Sir,  when  P.A.P.

branches  or  the P.A.P. Central  Committee  hold

concerts,  they  pay entertainment  duty  at  the

regular rate, in fact, I remember earlier in  the

year,  I had to haul up one of my colleagues  and

ask him to get his branch to pay the tax quickly,

otherwise  he would be prosecuted. What  sort  of

nonsense  is  this. The power to grant  exemption

already  exists  in the present  Ordinance.  This

provision confers no new power on me in regard to

exemption of taxes for certain classes  of  enter

tainment.  What is new in clause 11 is the  power

to vary the rate of entertainment duty. And as  I

have  said,  this is what is needed to regularise

the reduced rate for professional boxing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I plead

again  of the hon. Member, for heaven's sake  try

to  make an attempt to understand the Bill  under

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment Bill to the Sale of Food and Drugs

Ordinance  (Chapter  148 of the  Revised  Edition)

seeks  to make, two simple amendments, to  section

28 of the principal Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is provided in section 28, subsection (1)

para. (l) of the principal Ordinance that `the

Minister  may prescribe fines not exceeding  $500

for  a  breach  of  any  regulation.  It  is  now

proposed  under  clause 2  (a)  of  the  Bill  to

increase this maximum fine to $1,000 in order  to

bring  it in line with Regulation 60 of the  Food

and  Drugs Regulations, 1957, which states that:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every person who commits a breach of

any  of  these Regulations for which a penalty  is

not   expressly  provided  shall  be   liable   on

conviction  to a fine not exceeding  one  thousand

dollars."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offences against the Food and Drugs Control

Regulations  often  produce  substantial  profits.

Therefore,  the corresponding maximum fine  should

be  raised  so  as  to act as a deterrent  against

dishonest  traders and unscrupulous  manufacturers

who  intend  to mislead, cheat or do harm  to  the

public.  This  heavier penalty for offenders  will

also  help the officers of the Health Ministry  to

being maintained throughout the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second proposed amendment to section 28 is a

procedural  one  which seeks at, streamlining  the

manner  by  which  regulations may  be  made.  The

present   provision  in  the  principal  Ordinance

section 28 subsection (3) requires that all  such

regulations shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



be  laid before the Legislative. Assembly  and  no

such   regulation  shall  come  into  force  until

approved  by  a  resolution of the  Assembly.  The

proposed amendment under clause 2 (b) of the  Bill

seeks to simplify all this procedure `by requiring

only publication in the Government Gazette and its

presentation to the Assembly, as soon  as  may  be

possible, after publication. This follows  current

practice for subsidiary legislation.

<div align="center"><b>ADMINISTRATION OF ECOMOMIC DEFENCE LAWS</b></div>



<br><br>7.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, Iet me talk about the Administration of Economic Defence Laws. Malaysia

has  caused hardship to the people asa  result  of

confrontation.  Many people have suffered  because

of this and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



consequences  are  adverse  all  round.  There  is  a

general  atmosphere of uncertainty  and  distress.

That is why the Government formulated the Economic

Defence  Bill,  which was passed on  the  19th  of

December,  1963.  At  that  sitting  I  urged  the

Minister  for  Finance not to allow  employers  to

abuse  the loopholes of the law by exploiting  the

workers.  It should help all the workers affected,

such as the lighterage workers and stevedores. The

Minister  had assured the House that  there  would

not be such incidents as causing harm, or loss, or

damage to those workers. The Ordinance has been in

practice  for  about  one  year  now.  After   the

unemployed  workers  have  received  aid  for  six

months,  what  about their future  livelihood  and

their  families' existence? I would  now  like  to

comment on these Economic Defence laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the law, all those workers

unemployed  as a result of confrontation  can  get

one-third  of  their earnings from the  Government

and another one-third from the employer, based  on

their  actual salaries. It appears to be  quite  a

good   scheme,  but  actually  there  are   faults

underlying it. Firstly, in implementing this  law,

the  Economic  Defence Board  had  not  asked  the

employers to report on the number of working  days

in  a  year. Some employers might have made  false

reports.  Let me quote some examples. One employer

had  made  use of August 1963, when the  price  of

rubber was at its lowest. In other words, it was a

month during which the number of working days  for

employees was the least. He used it as a basis for

calculating one-third of the workers' wages. As  a

result,   the   workers  suffered  great   losses.

Moreover, certain employers reduced the number  of

working  days and reported that to the Government.

Thus,  the workers affected would get only $20  or

$30  each.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  some  people  were

receiving  only  90 cents to  $1  a  month.  In  a

situation  such  as this, how can the  workers  be

expected  to live and maintain a livelihood?  This

is one fault of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the law provides that all those

factories which are working



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



should   not  come  within  the  purview  of   the

Ordinance. Thus, certain employers thought  out  a

wonderful  plan. They reduced all their  available

stock according to the original calculation.  Work

that  could  be  completed in a  short  time  they

prolonged to cover the six months allowed  by  the

Ordinance.  Thus the employees could not  get  the

actual  one-third  of the wages which  they  would

have  been  entitled  to get. Thus  the  employees

suffered again. They could only work one day,  two

days  or  three days a week. The Economic  Defence

Board  has  not carried out an investigation  into

this   matter,  or  adjusted  or  rectified   such

unlawful  manipulations. The Board  has  also  not

given aid to make up for the workers' losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Ordinance provides that the

employer  should pay for six months  one-third  of

the  worker's wages. The Board has full discretion

in  exercising the powers given by  the  law.  The

employer  could  use this amount as  a  bonus  for

dismissing  the workers. Now this  does  not  take

into  consideration  the Government's  assistance.

Ordinarily,  whenever a shop or a  factory  closes

down,  the  workers should get a certain allowance

before they are dismissed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, not only this, they should also be

able   to  enjoy  the  provisions  of  the  Labour

Ordinance  and the benefits as provided under  it.

Thus,  the  workers, in fact, are not getting  the

care  of  the  Economic  Defence  Board,  and  the

benefits amount to zero. But those factories which

are  able  to resume normal production  have  been

able to follow this line or tactic. They give  the

workers  two months' dismissal notice. After  that

they  re-employ  them as new workers.  There  have

also been instances of reorganisation of firms and

factories  without  the workers  being  given  the

allowances  which they usually get.  This  usually

happens in the rubber mills. The employers adopt a

"take it or leave it" attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance is not only unable to help the

workers  to  solve their hardships,  but  it  also

causes the workers to be exploited all the more by

the employers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is that the

Economic Defence Board's main fault is that  those

workers who are unemployed are not entitled to the

one-third benefits provided by law. After Malaysia, the

workers  who  are hardest hit are  the  lighterage

workers, fishermen, and workers in the rubber  and

rattan mills. These workers are not able to get any

benefits. They are on the verge of despair and up to

date most of these workers are still unable to get

alternative jobs. I want to ask whether the Government

wishes to push them over the brink into the abyss.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the re-employment of workers, there

are  many irresponsible things done in the  Labour

Exchange. The Government put the workers in places

which  they do not like, where they do not receive

their  proper  wages. Their  wages  are  from  two

dollars  to three dollars a day. Some of them  are

not  even getting fifty cents or one dollar a day.

After  they  have received employment,  they  will

cease to get any benefit from the Economic Defence

Board and most of the workers have to go to Jurong

to  work.  They have to spend a lot  of  money  on

their transport expenses. How much have they  left

to  spend on food and other necessities?  Most  of

these  workers  are  getting fifty  cents  or  one

dollar  a  day. If they refuse to accept the  jobs

offered by the Board, then they will cease to  get

any benefits from the Board. They will be regarded

as  voluntarily giving up their benefits  and  all

their allowances will be terminated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has boasted about the pioneer

industries,  that  these  industries   will   give

priority in employing those workers affected,  but

this  will  only facilitate the foreign employers,

especially  the  British,  American  and  Japanese

employers, to exploit the workers, so as  to  earn

more  profit,  that is, to get cheap  labour  from

these workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Defence law is intended only as a

smoke-screen to cover up the mistakes made by  the

Government.  `The  workers in Singapore  have  con

tributed a lot to the prosperity of the State  and

the  Government is duty bound to look after  them.

Now I urge the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



Government to review the implementation of the

Economic Defence Ordinance. Let me put forward a

few suggestions, so that the Government can study

them seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, continue to carry out the Economic

Defence Scheme so as to give aid to those workers

who have not received aid. Secondly, to give

financial aid to solve the present difficulties of

all classes of workers who have been hit by the

Indonesian confrontation. Thirdly, these workers

should not be deprived of their privileges and

rights conferred by the Labour law. Fourthly,

whenever a factory resumes production, it must re

employ those workers who were laid off, and it

should not change the salaries of those workers.

Fifthly, the Government should provide them with

financial aid or reduce their house rents.

Sixthly, the Government should introduce a salary

scale so as to prevent foreign capitalists from

exploiting the workers affected.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a

clear contradiction in what the hon. Member has

said. On the one hand, he says that Economic

Defence is a great fraud - it is cheating the

worker and exploiting him. On the other hand, he

asks me in his list of six suggestions to continue

the scheme beyond six months and to include all

workers who are not at present eligible. If it is

a fraud, why does he want it to extend to all

other workers? Why does he want it to continue

beyond six months?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are so many

misrepresentations in what the hon. Member has

said that I find it difficult within the time at

my disposal to track each and every one of the

falsehoods. First, he alleges that the employer

makes a false report in order to pay less. If he

knows of such cases, it is his duty to report it

to the authorities concerned, and this employer

will be charged under the law and will be

penalised. In the absence of specific information,

I would regard it as completely baseless. He also

says that some employers fix August 1963 as the

period in which the normal wage should be

calculated. Why do they do so, Mr Speaker? Just

because the Rubber Workers' Union insists that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



they use that month for calculation purposes! When

they  found they got cheated, they lost out,  they

blamed  the Government. The Rubber Workers'  Union

is  a  Barisan Union which in several cases  asked

for  August  1963.  They made a mistake.  That  is

their own lookout, but do not blame me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he says that some workers are paid 90 cents

a  month by allowance, or $1 a month. True,  there

are seven of then1 getting from 90 cents to $9.66.

These  are  persons working in a  rubber  mill  in

Thomson  Road.  In  fact, these  persons  are  not

eligible for admission to the scheme because  they

are  casual irregular workers. Nevertheless,  they

wanted   to  come  in  and  the  Economic  Defence

Department  said, "All right." And  quite  rightly

employers  objected, but we said.  "Well,  if  you

want  to  come  in,  we  will  include  you."  Any

gratitude,  Mr Speaker? These are people  who  do

not do regular work. They hang around coffee shops

in  case  there are jobs to be done, and sometimes

they never turn up. I have got the details of  all

these seven workers. Mr Speaker, Sir, and if  the

Member is not satisfied I will read out the  names

and details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the other matter is about severance pay.

The  employer  pays one-third each month  for  six

months. At the end of six months the employer will

have  paid  off  two months' pay. If  the  factory

closes  down and cannot continue, then  these  two

months'   pay,  which  the  employer  has  already

extended  to the worker, goes into severance  pay.

This  is made quite clear in the law. There is  no

fiddling  about it. So how have the  workers  been

cheated?  The  Member has forgotten  to  calculate

that  the  Government also has given  the  workers

another  two months' pay for the period.  So  they

get   the  severance  pay  or  whatever  they  are

entitled to plus two months' pay contribution from

the Government. So how can he say that the workers

have  been cheated? I think I have made  my  point

quite  clear,  Mr Speaker, Sir, on  that.  Simple

arithmetic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he says that in the Direction of

Employment when we try to get unemployed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



workers on the Economic Defence Register,

we  compel them to take jobs at 50 cents a day, at

$1  a  day,  and in Jurong, mind you.  Where  `the

worker lives in Thomson Road it will cost him more

than  $1  a day to go to Jurong. And if he refuses

to take on the job, we strike him off the Economic

Defence  Scheme. I challenge the Member openly  to

give  me one instance where that has happened - one

instance, one name, where that has happened.  This

business of 50 cents, 10 cents - I can tell you  the

reason.  It is this: there are a number of  Govern

ment  factories not only in Jurong,  but  also  in

town,  which receive women workers and train them.

During  their  training period they are  paid  pin

money,  a nominal allowance, because they are  not

making  any  output. During that period  they  are

paid  50 cents or $1. But we told the workers that

if  they accepted this during the training period,

the  Economic Defence Department would  give  them

the  balance to bring them to a total pay  of  the

two-thirds  allowances  which  they  were  getting

before.  There  is no question of  compelling  the

workers  to work for 50 cents or $1, and  if  they

refuse,  we  strike them off. Even if we  imagined

for one moment that this were true - and I do not

believe  it is true - the workers have the right  of

appeal.  There  is  an Appeal  Board  against  any

decisions  of  the  Director of  Economic  Defence

which  take  away  benefits from workers  in  this

unjust manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to stress here

that  in  directing workers who are unemployed  to

new  jobs, we have been very fair and very lenient

both on the worker and the employer. So far as  is

possible, we want to get the matter of transfer of

a  worker  from his old job to a new one agreeable

to  both the employer and the worker, that is, the

worker likes his new job and is prepared to accept

the  pay, and the employer thinks the man  or  the

woman  can  do  the  work.  A  minimum  amount  of

compulsion  has  been used in this  instance.  For

instance,       up       to        the        17th



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



of October, no less than 6,000 vacancies have been

notified to the Economic Defence Department and

exemptions have been given to 4,545 because of the

greater skill required but is not available among

people who are in the list. And out of 1,531

vacancies, 990 unemployed persons have already got

new jobs, and another 430 are in the process of

being engaged. So if we were to take the attitude

that the worker must take on a new job whatever

the pay and wherever it is, then it would

obviously be very easy for us to solve the whole

matter because the number of vacancies notified to

the Department is much greater than the number of

unemployed on the Economic Defence Register.

Contrariwise, if we were to insist that a worker

should take whatever job he is offered, how would

you explain that in more than 3,000 instances we

had to make contact with the worker three times or

more to make him an offer of new employment? It is

not a case of the worker going to the Labour

Exchange each day asking whether there are any

vacancies. It is a question of the Economic

Defence Department making repeated attempts to

call on the workers to get them to be considered

for new appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I think the scheme has run fairly

successfully, considering the enormous

difficulties in administering such a complex and

substantial exercise. As I have said, if this

scheme is not to the benefit of the worker, Mr

Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member would not have asked

me to extend it for a longer period than six

months to get other categories of workers included

under it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, That this Assembly do now adjourn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Othman bin Wok, with reference to his

replies   to   the  following  two   supplementary

questions  on  10th  June, 1964 (Official  Report,

10th  June,  1964, Vol. 23, No. 1, Columns  9  and

10):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied): Is the Minister

aware that the six domes of the two temples which

were  completed  in  1962 were  pulled  down  and

rebuilt in

1963? And can the Minister confirm that there was

a  waste  of $40,000 of public funds due to  this

constructional bungling?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied): Can the

Minister make it clear whether the following four

amounts are included in the sum of $133,500:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) $50,000 contributed by the City Council;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) approximately $11,000 paid as voluntary

donations   by  certain  Muslim   and   Hindu

shopkeepers    of    Campbell    Lane     for

transferring   of   tenancy   of   properties

belonging to Hindu Temples;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) approximately $5,900 collected from the

public  for  purposes  of  Hindu  destitutes'

burial fund, which amount was handed over  by

the Hindu Advisory Board: and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) $30,000 promised by members o the public?



<br><br>supplied the following additional answers  on  2nd

October, 1964:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to question (a), I have been

informed  that in fact the additional expenditure

which was incurred on reconstruction of the domes

amounted  to a total of $27,500, and not $40,000,

as  stated in your question. I am also told  that

the  need  to reconstruct the domes  of  the  two

temples   arose   because  the  qualified   Hindu

architect, who was engaged from Madras to draw up

plans  and  specifications for  the  Perumal  and

Sivan   Temples  in  accordance  with  the  Hindu

Temples Building By-laws, did not in fact  adhere

fully  to  these  Bylaws, and the sthapathy,  who

successfully  tendered for the construction  work

on  the  basis  of  the plans  drawn  up  by  the

architect, did not detect the irregularity in the

design  until it was too late. Work  on  the  two

temples on the basis of the plans drawn up by  the

architect was started in April, 1961, and it  was

not until the temples were inspected in November,

1962, that the attention of members of the Hindu



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



Temples' Management Committee was drawn  to  the

fact  that the plans and specifications had  not

complied  with  the Hindu Temples  Building

By-laws.  Subsequently, after a discussion held  by

the Hindu Temples' Management Committee with the

sthapathy in charge of the construction, it  was

decided  to  carry  out  certain  additions  and

alterations as advised by the sthapathy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to question (b), I confirm that

the sum of $133,500 includes -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the $50,000 contributed by the City

Council;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) approximately $11,000 paid as voluntary

donations by certain Muslim and Hindu

shopkeepers of Campbell Lane;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) approximately $5,900 collected from

the public for the purposes of the Hindu

destitutes' burial fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum, however, does not include the $30,000,

which had been promised by members of the

public, of which so far only $15,000 has been
