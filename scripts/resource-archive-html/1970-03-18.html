<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me offer my heartiest

congratulations to the Minister for Finance on his

very illuminating Budget statement. He has set out

succinctly  the course of economic development  in

Singapore  during the last decade. What  impresses

me  most,  and perhaps every Singaporean,  in  his

presentation  of the 50-page Budget  statement  is

not just that it is a well-prepared statement with

a  great deal of scholarly thought behind it,  but

that it exudes a quiet note of confidence for  the

future   against  the  background  story  of   the

economic   development  and   success   story   of

Singapore  in  the  face of  great  adversity  and

against overwhelming odds. A great tribute must be

paid   to  the  Finance  Minister  who  has   been

personally  responsible for  Singapore's  economic

development  and planning during the greater  part

of the past decade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson that we are to draw from Singapore's

economic  progress  in the last  decade  is  that,

despite our lack of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



natural  resources  and the  presence  of  adverse

factors,  we  can not only survive but  also  make

significant  improvements in our economic,  social

and   political  fields  if  we  Singaporeans  are

prepared  to  sweat and toil for it.  This  lesson

should  undoubtedly give us added  confidence  and

determination to work harder if we are to win  for

ourselves greater prosperity and greater  progress

in the coming decade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing that we must bear in mind is

the  timely  warning  given by  the  Minister  for

Finance that we must not be complacent if  we  are

not  to fritter away all that we have achieved  in

the  last  decade, and if we are  successfully  to

meet the challenge that we have to face at the end

of 1971 when the British completely withdraw their

forces  from  Singapore, thereby aggravating  both

our security and economic problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the acceleration and expansion of

industrialisation  programmes   as   planned   and

carried  out by the Economic Development Board  up

to  date  have  helped to increase the  number  of

persons  employed in the manufacturing  industries

to  87,128,  and while we are confident  that  the

full economic impact of the complete British pull-out  at  the end of 1971 can be cushioned  through

further   expansion   of   the   industrialisation

programmes,  it is envisaged that this  will  give

rise to attendant problems, the chief of which  is

likely  to  be a shortage of engineers, management and

technical  personnel.  This  problem  is   further

aggravated by such personnel being required to  do

national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has proposed, as a way of

minimising  the  problem  of  shortage   of   such

personnel,  to  relax  our  immigration  and  work

permit   restrictions  on  the  in-flow  of   such

personnel. The Government, after weighing the pros

and  cons, considers it advantageous to liberalise

the conditions under which such people can qualify

for   permanent   residence   in   Singapore   and

eventually citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While such a proposal appears to be logically

necessary as a solution to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



problem  of  our  envisaged  shortage  of  trained

personnel  with  technical and management  skills,

and  while in principle it has my support, I must,

however,  ask  the  Government to  exercise  great

caution in its implementation as it may result  in

the  creation  of other and greater  problems.  My

fear  is that the persons who may avail themselves

of the relaxed conditions for entry into Singapore

and   swarm  into  our  factories  and  industrial

enterprises  may not necessarily be  of  the  best

calibre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortage of men with skills in management and

technical fields is a problem all over the  world,

particularly  with the developing countries.  With

such  demand for the services of trained technical

personnel,   Singapore's   offer   of    permanent

residence  and citizenship in addition to  a  wide

range of incentives in terms of money or otherwise

may  not  necessarily attract  the  best  type  of

workers  who  may  prefer  to  emigrate  to  other

countries,  more  developed  and  prosperous  than

Singapore.  The  point I wish  to  make  is  that,

supposing  we have managed to attract only  third-rate   personnel  with  management  and  technical

skills, we may be creating a situation which  will

have  an  adverse effect on, and ramifications  in

relation  to,  the  long-term  objectives  of  our

industrialisation programmes. The  end  result  is

that  our production cost and quality control  may

be  seriously  affected. It is a  matter  of  time

before   the  need  of  technical  and  management

personnel  can  be  met locally.  When  that  time

comes,  the  import  of management  and  technical

personnel  from  abroad may cause  a  demoralizing

effect on local management and technical personnel

who  will thereby be deprived of promotion avenues

to that extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the incentives given to expatriate

personnel besides permanent residence and eventual

citizenship will serve to increase their take-home

pay.  Situations  may  arise  where  citizen   and

expatriate personnel working side by side  on  the

same  job  and  possessing the same qualifications

enjoy two entirely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



different terms and conditions of service. It will

not  be  surprising  if a feeling  of  unhappiness

results  from such disparities in pay and  working

conditions.  It  is, therefore not  likely  to  be

conducive  to a congenial atmosphere in the  place

of  work, and to assist our efforts to educate and

train   our  own  local  personnel  to   man   our

industries and industrial enterprises. It may well

be,  to  quote the extreme case, that our citizens

with  managerial and technical skills may find  it

more  attractive and lucrative to migrate to other

lands  where  they are likely to find greater  job

satisfaction for the skills that they possess.  If

this happens, it would indeed be a paradox to  our

detriment. This feeling of unhappiness is all  the

more acute in cases where expatriate personnel are

placed  in  positions above our citizen  personnel

who  subsequently obtain equivalent, if not higher

qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the situation today in

Malaysia-Singapore   Airlines.   The    expatriate

management of M.S.A. gives the impression that  it

has   adopted   a   policy  of  recruiting   white

expatriates  irrespective of the  availability  of

local    personnel   with   similar   or    better

qualifications.   The  Singapore   Air   Transport

Workers'   Union  has  over  the   years   battled

strenuously    for    a    concrete    plan    for

nationalisation  and  a  training  programme   for

suitably qualified national staff to be groomed to

replace  expatriates. But with the recent  changes

in   the   structure   of  the  management,   more

expatriates  are being brought in. And  now  under

the so-called scientific expatriate management  of

M.S.A.,   all   kinds   of   dubiously   qualified

expatriates   have   been   recruited;    existing

expatriates who have been scheduled to  leave  are

promoted  over the more qualified national  staff.

Experienced national staff are switched around  to

their    disadvantage   under   the    guise    of

reorganisation  in  order  to  pave  the  way  for

establishing  expatriate  footholds.   All   these

nefarious  activities have lowered the  morale  of

the  M.S.A. staff  and have  created  deep-seated

frustration and disillusionment among the national

staff  who feel that qualifications and efficiency

are not the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



prerequisites  for promotion. This attitude  could

have far-reaching effects on the national staff if

steps are to remedy this situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister, in his speech, paid tribute

to  the  National Trades Union Congress by stating

that    its    success    in   promoting    labour

responsibility  was one of the  important  factors

creating  a favourable general investment climate.

It  is  gratifying for the N.T.U.C. leadership  to

note  that its realistic and responsible stand  in

promoting   labour   responsibility    has    been

appreciated  by the Government. The leadership  of

the N.T.U.C. has always maintained that the labour

movement can play a responsible role as a  coequal

sector  in  the tripartite partnership of  Labour,

Government  and  Management  in  the  social   and

economic development of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Employment Act on

15th  August, 1968, the N.T.U.C. has no reason  to

doubt  the  bona fide intentions of Government  in

giving  vent to the underlying objectives  of  the

Employment  Act. While the N.T.U.C. may  say  the

same of the many enlightened employers who have co-operated wholeheartedly and sincerely not only  in

refusing  to  take  advantage  of  some   of   the

provisions  of the Act, but also in observing  the

spirit  of  the  Act, the N.T.U.C., unfortunately,

cannot  say the same of a few employers  who  have

taken advantage of the anomalous provisions of the

Act to the serious detriment of their workers. The

N.T.U.C. will  soon be making representations  to

the Government to rectify the anomalous provisions

of  the  Employment Act so that the Act  will  not

lend   itself  to  abusive  practices  by  a   few

unreasonable employers who may be tempted to treat

the Employment Act as a licence to exploit labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon. Members will recall that, together with  the

passing   of  the  Employment  Act,  the   Central

Provident  Fund  Ordinance  was  also  amended  to

increase  C.P.F. contributions from five per  cent

to  ten per cent in gradual stages. This was to be

part and parcel of a package



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



deal,  so  to speak, with Labour - that  is,  higher

C.P.F. contributions for better  work  discipline

and  efficiency. Workers are to be  given  greater

C.P.F. savings which, in a very significant  way,

will go a long way towards giving them a sense  of

security  after their retirement from  employment.

While  the  vast majority of workers benefit  from

the  increase in C.P.F. contributions,  there  are

also, sad to say, some workers who happen to  work

under  less  reasonable employers and who  do  not

benefit from the increase of C.P.F. contributions.

These  are  the unionised workers in  the  private

sector who are enjoying not less than 10 per  cent

retirement    benefits   under   the    collective

agreements. One obtained the impression  that  the

primary  objective of the amendment to the  C.P.F.

Ordinance  was to increase the C.P.F. savings  of

individual workers so that when they retire,  they

will  be able to find a bigger amount of money  to

provide  for their old age after retirement.  But,

sad  to  say,  this may not be the  case  in  many

situations.  Many employees, with the  concurrence

of  the  Arbitration  Court,  have  the  increased

C.P.F. contributions offset against their  normal

gratuity  payments. In effect,  on  retirement,  a

worker  gets,  on  the one hand, increased  C.P.F.

savings,  but  on  the other hand,  he  loses  the

greater  portion if not the whole of his  gratuity

payments,  equivalent  to  his  increased   C.P.F.

contributions. The net result is that he does  not

benefit from the increase in C.P.F. contributions,

at least not to the extent that one thinks that he

should  get as the result of the amendment to  the

C.P.F.    Ordinance   to   increase   the   C.P.F.

contributions from five per cent to ten per  cent,

in   conjunction  with  the  amendments   to   the

Employment Act. Members will surely understand  if

there  is  some feeling of frustration  over  this

matter  among  some  workers.  I  hope  that   the

Government   and   the  N.T.U.C. together   with

Management, will be able to iron out the anomalies

arising  out  of  the operation of the  Employment

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of Labour to accept the underlying

principles and objectives of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



the   recent  Employment  Act  has  begun  to  pay

dividends.  What  we all must not  forget  is  the

sound advice of the Finance Minister in his Budget

statement that the more difficult period will come

at  the  end of 1971, with the completion  of  the

British  military withdrawal. We must,  therefore,

not  be  complacent  and over-confident.  We  have

overcome   the  difficult  1960s,  and  we   shall

overcome the challenge of the I 970s provided that

Labour, Government and Management can continue  to

work  as  co-equals  in  a tripartite  partnership

striving   for   national,  social  and   economic

progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for the reason that Labour must play a

responsible  role  as  a  co-equal  partner   with

Government and Management that the Singapore trade

union movement has made its momentous decision  to

modernize  itself  so as to be a co-equal  partner

with  the  Government and Management in  the  very

sense of the word.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, very few people in Singapore can

remain   unimpressed  by  the  narration  of   our

economic  success  in the last ten  years  by  the

Minister for Finance in his Budget statement. I am

no exception, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important factors contributing

towards our great leap forward can be found in the

quality  of our political leadership.  As  such  I

intend to dwell on this subject a little.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959 when the P.A.P. first took office, our

Prime Minister did have "grave reservations".  His

reservations  were not unfounded. The  politicians

that  held power prior to 1959 were inept, corrupt

and  made a sham of parliamentary democracy.  They

did  not  have the foresight to lead Singapore  to

independence.  The  P.A.P. itself   was   finding

difficulties with the adventurous opportunists and

treacherous   Communists   within    the    party.

Furthermore, the Government was confronted with a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



fierce  display of anger and disappointment  by  a

large  section of the people in the earlier regime

on   the   one   hand,  and  the   apathetic   and

disenchanted    orientation   of   many    average

Singaporeans  on  the  other.  Thus   the   P.A.P.

government  was  faced with the gigantic  task  of

reshaping a colonial society for independence, and

to  set  Singapore on the road to development  and

modernization by restoring the faith of the people

in the principles of parliamentary democracy. This

was  by no means an easy task. It calls for strong

character,  determination and unselfish dedication

on  the part of the political leadership, plus  an

unyielding  faith in the validity and  workability

of parliamentary democracy itself. It was the good

fortune  of the people of Singapore that  they  do

have  such a leadership. Patiently, the foundation

was laid, as reported by the Finance Minister,  in

spite of political pre-occupation, to prepare  the

way  for  economic  progress and  to  provide  the

average citizen with a happier life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite situations of tension and crises, the

democratic  socialists, through the  P.A.P.,  have

proved  that  through persuasion,  convincing  and

working  within  the  framework  of  parliamentary

democracy and not through terror and ruthlessness,

as  the  Communists would want it,  they  too  can

achieve progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there was one other factor that

contributed towards consolidation of the  people's

faith  in  the democratic socialists, and  thereby

helped  them to make progress in the country.  The

Communists front-men, through their own folly, had

convinced   the   people  that  they   were   more

interested  in  political gains for the  Communist

cause  than  in the general welfare of the  people

and the country as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have gone to great lengths on this subject

because  it  brings  home a crucial  point.  I  am

convinced that ultimately our economic well-being,

political  stability  and national  security  will

depend to a very large extent on whether or not we

have  developed  in  our  younger  generation   an

unyielding    faith   in   the    principles    of

parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



democracy.  And  this  is determined  to  a  large

extent  by the quality of the political leadership

we  provide and can continue to provide.  In  this

connection,  Sir,  I think we cannot,  and  should

not,  hope to ignore the possible doubts that  our

people might have in the question of succession to

the  highly  successful political leadership  that

they  have  been accustomed to for  the  last  ten

years. Those entering and those who wish to remain

in  the political arena must pledge to uphold this

tradition      of      dedication,      sincerity,

determination,   honesty   and   basically    the

principle of parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fear that our achievements can be

destroyed  by a political leadership  of  inferior

quality  is not unfounded and we must be  vigilant

at all times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another great transformation the Government has

brought about in the last decade has been  in  the

bureaucracy.  Members  will  recall   the   uneasy

relationship  the Government had  with  the  civil

servants when it first assumed office in 1959.  It

was evident in those days that the bureaucracy was

not  geared to the changes that were taking place.

The bureaucratic system had to be streamlined, and

new   talents  brought  into  prominence.  Patient

search  had  to be made to bring in  the  brighter

sector   of  the  population  to  assist  in   the

administration. The Government realised that  with

more  and  more institutions set up  for  economic

expansion and social services, greater exercise of

initiative had to be given to the civil servant. I

have   observed  also  that  the  Government   has

deliberately  exposed  its  bureaucrats   to   the

intricacies of the commercial world.  In  many  of

our  statutory boards and public owned  commercial

agencies, civil servants are made to work hand  in

hand with businessmen. The obvious advantage to be

gained  in  such a set-up is that the  bureaucracy

will  have  a better understanding of  our  highly

commercialised  society and they  will  invariably

learn  a  trick  or two from their  more  seasoned

commercial counterparts. But I must raise here the

fear  of possible erosion of the integrity  of  an

incorruptible bureaucracy which is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



essential  to  the  successful  operation   of   a

democratic system. It will be time for regrets  if

we  should find our public servants succumbing  to

the temptation of material gains when they are  so

exposed. It might be worth while to take note that

Singaporeans will find it really hard  to  forgive

such mistakes if they do occur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recruitment of new talents into its

fold,  the bureaucracy has invariably strengthened

itself. I do not wish to be a prophet of doom, but

I  do see signs of gradual erosion of the power of

the  politician by the bureaucrat. Having been  in

power  for  more  than a decade  and  seen  things

getting    more    and   more   institutionalised,

Government  leaders may tend to take such  erosion

with  extreme  kindness. But, Sir,  being  a  firm

believer  in democracy, it is hard of me to  allow

the  creation of a formidable or even near supreme

bureaucracy.  A closer check must be  made  before

any great damage is done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, please do not allow what I have just said to

carry  to  the House the impression  that  I  have

ruled  out the contribution of the public  service

to our progress in the last decade. Indeed, Sir, I

have made it the second point in my speech to  pay

tribute  to  these people and to express  my  deep

appreciation  of  the  grand  work  of  the  civil

servants  as  a  whole. It is to  the  credit  and

satisfaction of many that we should  have  such  a

generally honest, hard-working and efficient civil

service.  My  point is that the Government  should

not  in its preoccupation with problems create out

of  this  civil  service  a  Frankenstein  to  the

disappointment of many, like myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will turn to our relations with our

neighbouring countries. Sir, my mind is  disturbed

and  I  feel  sad that while we in  Singapore  are

happy  and proud of our achievements in  the  last

decade and grateful to the Government leaders  for

what they have done, there are many of our friends

outside  of  Singapore who would  have  wished  to

share our joy and pride as brothers and equals and

unable  to do so for reasons beyond their control.

I refer, Sir, to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



many,  known  and  unknown to us,  who  have  been

secretly wishing us well since the day we acquired

independence as a sovereign republic.  These  kind

people,  sharing  our  hopes and  aspirations  and

knowing our difficulties as an independent  state,

must  be searching deep within themselves for  the

evil curse that disallows them to rejoice with  us

over our achievements at this very moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our stay in Malaysia was short, but then we

did  make  many  friends. We  went  into  Malaysia

because - and I quote the Prime Minister from  his

book  The Battle for Merger, a book from  which  I

have  derived much political inspiration - he said

"if  merger does not come with the consent of  the

people of the two territories, then inevitably  it

will  come  by  the use of force by one  territory

over  the other, because each is so vital  to  the

survival of the other."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironical and inconceivable, in so far as I

am concerned, as fate would have it, that we after

4  1/2  years of independence should flourish  and

prosper, while our friends and relatives should  3

3/4  years  after  that fateful August  1965  have

suffered loss of lives and homes and may soon have

to  face  the dilemma of a deadly choice.  In  any

case, I do not consider it wise to dwell too  long

on  this  subject  except to  make  the  following

observations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, during and after Malaysia, one lesson we

did learn is that one sure and quick way to impede

progress is to have too many people living on  the

good-will   and  provisions  of  the   Government.

Secondly,  contrary to the expectations  of  many,

our  separation from Malaysia did  not  spell  our

death  warrant. We did manage to continue to  grow

and  prosper through sheer willpower  of  a  hard-working  people. Thirdly, we have to  explore  new

fields    of   co-operation   between   the    two

territories. New personalities will have  to  meet

more  frequently  to  work out  fields  of  common

interest.  It is vital to our survival  that  both

territories must map



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



out possible courses of action so as to face up to

the  realities of life after the shock of May last

year. On various occasions, our Government leaders

have  repeatedly pledged to support any move  that

would contribute to uplifting the economic life of

the  people in the region. It is on this framework

that we can co-operate with our neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, having made very rapid progress in

industrialisation, may in future find itself to be

relatively  more advanced technologically,  in  so

far  as  the region is concerned. There  would  be

others  who  would have still to make  headway  in

industrialisation. Would it not  be  a  good  idea

then  to look into the possibility of arriving  at

some kind of a "common market arrangement" for the

distribution of technological know-how?  The  time

will  come when countries that are relatively less

affluent   in   technological   know-how    should

concentrate   on  less  sophisticated  industries,

while  others relatively more advanced can involve

themselves  in  industries  that  require  greater

skill.  In  this way the relatively more  advanced

countries  in this region can help the  others  on

the road to industrialisation and progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Sir, I wish to join the Government

in  appealing  for  a better appreciation  of  the

problem  of attracting foreign investments.  Quite

apart  from  the  fact  that such  investments  as

reported  by  the Minister bring in ready  markets

and technological know-how, they too can bring  us

stronger backing for our security. If we keep  our

open  door  policy, we will be able  to  get  more

people  interested in our security to ensure  that

they  can  go about making money safely  and  that

their  investments  are not harassed!  I  have  no

doubt  that Singaporeans are pragmatic  enough  to

understand that, for all the advantages that  come

with  such  investments, a price will have  to  be

paid!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about paying a price for progress. I take

this opportunity to praise the worthy contribution

of  our  workers. They have worked very  hard  and

have  accepted the Employment Act. 1968,  in  good

spirit. This is a high price they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



have to pay for the progress of all Singaporeans,

including the prosperous businessmen,

industrialists and other commercial tycoons. The

labour movement has had its share of glory in our

struggle against the Communists. The workers have

always taken the brunt of any change for better or

for worse. They deserve our praise and admiration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strike a more materialistic tone, Sir, I have

to remind the Minister for Labour of his assurance

given on various occasions that if everything goes

well, our workers should have their take-home pay

revised upwards in two to three years' time. They

deserve it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has progressed not because of any

natural    resources   or   heaven-sent    riches.

Singapore's success is due to the iron will of the

people led by able political leadership. In  order

that our achievements in the last decade will  not

be  wasted, we must develop and accept new values,

new  ideas, be more achievement-oriented, tolerate

differences, have pride in group performance,  and

be  willing  to  expose ourselves to technological

innovations.  In short, we must develop  a  modern

outlook  in life. We must fit ourselves  into  the

new   and  challenging  world.  The  Minister  for

Science  and Technology, after being elected  pro-tem  chairman  of  the P.A.P. on  21st  November,

1954, said, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A country big or small can only be great if the

spirit of the people is great.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the spirit of our people as manifested in the

last  ten  years  has  been  great,  and  we  must

necessarily succeed as a great country.



<br><br>3.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in admiration of

the   way   in  which  the  Minister  for  Finance

masterfully  and coherently presented  the  Budget

statement. Clearly, Sir, there are many advantages

in  having  a distinguished economist as  Minister

for  Finance. But to many of us Backbenchers, this

poses a distinct disadvantage in having to try  to

com-prehend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



the  economic jargon, let  alone  try  to

tackle the Minister on his home ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a particularly difficult task today, Sir,

as   my  economist  friends  who  have  read   the

statement tell me that the Budget statement  is  a

masterly analysis of the exciting economic  events

of the last decade. Of course, one cannot deny the

fact  that  the Finance Minister has had  all  the

advantages   of   being  at  the  economic   helm.

Therefore, Sir, I shall have to be satisfied  with

just  a  few questions, which I hope the  Minister

will clarify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it concerns our open door policy. There

are  two  aspects of this policy on which I  would

like to focus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Foreign investment. In his speech the Finance

Minister  pointed out that we do not  really  need

the money that comes with foreign investments, but

rather we want and require foreign investments for

the   technology,  the  marketing  and  managerial

expertise that come with them. Therefore, first of

all,  if  we  have  capital of our  own  presently

invested  abroad,  should we  not  look  into  the

possibility  of hiring the managerial  skills  and

know-how  but  providing  the  capital  ourselves?

Alternatively,  should we not  actively  encourage

more  joint  ventures in a much  more  significant

manner,   whether  wholly-owned  or  partly-owned?

Secondly,  what  steps are being taken  to  ensure

that  the  marketing  and managerial  know-how  is

being  transmitted  to  local  personnel  so  that

eventually we will acquire such indigenous skills?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Immigration. The Finance Minister has called

for a review of the immigration policy relating to

the   inflow  of  skilled  labour  and  managerial

personnel. This is the second aspect of  our  open

door  policy on which I would like to focus. As  I

see it, the immediate objective of this policy  is

presumably  to  prevent run-away wage  and  salary

increases   so   that   the   momentum   of    our

industrialisation  plans  is  not   impeded.   The

policy, I must say, is well considered, given this

objective. However, two other questions need to be

put forward. First.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



consider   the   situation   where   the   foreign

enterprise is set up with pioneer benefits of  tax

exemption,    accelerated   depreciation,    lower

property  tax rates, subsidised factory sites  and

utilities,   and,   lastly,   utilising   imported

personnel.  One  may wonder what net  benefit  the

concern is to our Republic. Therefore, Sir, if  we

look  at the Gross Domestic Product, the sum total

of  employee  remuneration  and  profits  will  be

registered,  but  in terms of the  Gross  National

Product -a truer measure of national welfare  -the

addition   is   negligible,   if   not   negative.

Undoubtedly  one  can  argue for  some  multiplier

effects   arising  from  the  enterprise's   local

purchases  as  well  as for eventual  tax  revenue

gains.  Nevertheless, the point is surely  crucial

in  that  we need to be aware of net benefits  and

costs.  In  this regard, perhaps steps  should  be

taken  to  reduce the large item  of  "Errors  and

Omissions" in the balance of payments to enable us

to get a better picture of the G.N.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, another issue connected with the

immigration  policy  is that  we  should  exercise

extra caution and selectivity. It would not do for

us   to   erode   legitimate   gains   in   worker

productivity by allowing in sufficient numbers  so

as to keep wages and salaries down. Our dilemma is

that, on  the  one hand, wages and  salaries  are

contributions  to  the  G.N.P. and  hence,  other

things  being equal, maximising wages and salaries

would  maximise the G.N.P. And on the other  hand,

wage   and   salary   increases   unwarranted   by

productivity gains can surely hurt us by dampening

investment,  both  local and  foreign.  Therefore,

Sir,  I think some kind of balance in this respect

would have to be struck.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third point in regard to the immigration policy

is  the possible political repercussions. As  long

as  the  flow of such workers is inwards, no  such

problem  conceivably  arises,  apart  from   other

nations'  concern  about a  brain  drain.  In  the

eventuality   of  any  recession   in   Singapore.

however,  the  resulting retrenchment  of  foreign

workers  could  give  rise to  political  problems

particularly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



if  the numbers are significant. I must hasten

to  add,  Sir, that this has not happened as  yet,

but we should be prepared for such an eventuality.

Hence,  as I have said earlier, we should exercise

extra caution and selectivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point concerns the economic growth and

social  fabric.  Mr  Speaker.  Sir,  I  get   the

impression,  after  reading the Budget  statement,

that our Finance Minister seems rather envious  of

the  Japanese  growth and savings  rates.  I  have

already pointed out that, in our context,  a  high

G.D.P. rate   need   not  necessarily   mean   a

correspondingly high G.N.P. growth rate. But  even

with  a high G.N.P. growth rate, the danger arises

in  that  our social fabric might not be  able  to

cope  with the ensuing rapid changes in  style  of

living.  Furthermore,  we would  also  see  severe

strains    upon   the   economic   and    physical

infrastructure   together   with   the   attendant

problems of pollution of air, land and sea. Should

we  not then moderate our ambitions and settle for

a  realistic pace of economic change? We certainly

would  not  want,  I am sure, any political  shift

that   might  attend  rapid  social  and  economic

changes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the subject of the British military

pull-out.  Looking into the immediate future,  the

Minister  for  Finance has drawn our attention  to

the  expenditure effects of some $250 million  to

$300  million from the final phase of the British

withdrawal. In addition, we face the prospect of a

dampening  of  world trade. The question  I  would

like  to  ask is this: have we drawn up plans  for

mitigating    or    offsetting    the    otherwise

deflationary  impact  of  the  two  factors?   The

Finance Minister mentioned the running down of the

foreign  exchange reserves. There are,  therefore,

two points that many be worthy of notice. First of

all,  I  believe  we can reduce the anti-deflation

expenditure  somewhat if we  chose  projects  that

have  low  import  leakage.  Secondly,  we  should

resist the temptation to raise taxes. Depending on

the incidence of such taxation, the overall effect

would be deflationary. Instead, if capital markets

abroad



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



loosen  up, we should borrow from abroad.  But  in

any  case, our non-monetary reserves would be more

than adequate for the purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the question of the profitability

of  Government enterprises. We in this House  have

had   on   several   occasions  touched   on   the

Government's   participation  in   a   number   of

enterprises, both wholly - and partly-owned.  All

we  know  about  them is that  so  much  has  been

invested.  Perhaps the Minister  for  Finance  can

enlighten this House on the profitability of these

ventures,  that  is, the rates of return  we  have

earned  on  them.  I think in reply  to  questions

yesterday,  the  Minister threw  little  light  on

them. He gave only an example, but then what about

the rest?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point arising out of the Finance

Minister's observations concerns under-employment.

He  made an observation on the tight labour market

with  regard  to skilled and semi-skilled  labour.

However,  there would appear to be a  category  of

people  labelled under-employed. These are  either

white-collar aspirants or else Primary VI rejects,

and  they  are mostly young, and largely sheltered

by  familial structures. And yearly we add to  the

list,  if  only  via  Primary  VI  rejections.  My

question  is: what can we do about this  category?

We  take  care  of those who survive  the  Primary

School  Leaving Examination in either academic  or

technical education. I believe the Government  did

attempt  to  do  something by  opening  vocational

schools.  But such schools have now been  replaced

by Industrial Training Centres. Hence, the problem

of  this  lot  of under-employed  has  yet  to  be

solved. Therefore, something should be done  about

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the Finance Minister did not

touch  on  the Vietnam issue. With the accelerated

reduction of U.S. military expenditure in Vietnam,

our trade in that area will be affected. It may be

that  the  volume of trade is small, but certainly

one  cannot say that it is negligible. Perhaps the

Finance Minister would care to comment on  how  it

will affect our trade.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last point concerns the near standstill

expenditure on social services. My question is: is

this  justified in view of all the gains  we  have

made  in  the  G.N.P. growth? Sir, I  notice  that

there  are other Back-benchers who are also  eager

to  have their say on the Budget statement  and  I

would now like to close my remarks by saying  that

I fully support the motion so moved by the Finance

Minister. I also hope he will clarify what I  have

just  raised,  for  I  must admit  that  I  am  no

economist  but am just trying to fulfil my  duties

like others.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we are glad to hear the Finance

Minister  make  the  announcement  in  his  Budget

statement for the coming financial year that there

will  be no increase in the present taxes  or  the

creation  of  new  ones. This is  a  very  welcome

statement.  In spite of the fact that our  country

is  faced with the imminent withdrawal of  British

troops  with a consequent increase in our  defence

expenditure, our revenue has reached the figure of

$1,041,200,000. Comparing this figure with that of

1969,  the  revenue  estimate  has  increased   by

$106,800,000.  After transferring $40  million  to

the  Development Fund and meeting the  expenditure

of  $1,040,920,780, there is still  a  surplus  of

$348,220.  There is no deficit.  This  is  a  good

reflection  of  our  economic  achievements  since

independence. Our economic growth has  enabled  us

to  meet our increased expenditure. It also  shows

how,  with preparation, the Government is able  to

achieve  these results. It has also been  able  to

create  a  mild boom in its economic  development.

This  has  injected confidence into our people  in

the future of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in discussing this painless budget, allow

me  to  express  my feelings which come  from  the

bottom of my heart. First, the economic prosperity

we  have achieved seems to have the appearance  of

democratic   socialism.  But   fundamentally   the

Government has not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



realised  the  principle of democratic  socialism.

Secondly, as regards the livelihood of the people,

the  working class has made their contribution  to

our  economic  development.  Yet  what  they  have

received  in return has been less than  what  they

have  paid for in their efforts. To put it simply,

from  what we can see of the economic development

of our country, the Government has not made a fair

distribution   of  the  fruits  of  our   economic

development, because there is still a gulf between

the rich and the poor in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has pointed out that the

Employment  Act, 1968, has been supported  by  the

N.T.U.C. This shows that our people are determined

to overcome the present difficulties and that they

are  willing to make sacrifices in order to ensure

a  better future. He has also pointed out that  in

this  way  foreign  investors  will  be  able   to

recognise  in  our people a trustworthiness  which

can  ensure the success of their investments.  The

working class has contributed much to the progress

of  industrialisation, and has sacrificed a lot in

the   interest  of  the  country.  However,   some

capitalists use the Employment Act to exploit  the

fundamental interests of the workers in  order  to

enrich  themselves.  The Government  has  now  and

again said that it would take action to deal  with

those capitalists who exploit labour. But this  is

only  lip-service. From this, we can see that the

Government has not taken any strict measures  to

check  management in order that the  interests  of

the  working  class can be safeguarded.  Sir,  the

welfare   of  the  working  class  is   also   the

responsibility  of the Government.  It  should  be

safeguarded.  I  want to stress that  the  working

class  is  prepared to meet the challenge  of  the

age.  They are willing to sacrifice their personal

interests in order to help the Government  make  a

success   of   its  industrialisation   programme.

However,  locally-produced goods are  not  cheaper

than  imported  goods. We have strongly  supported

local  industries, and yet locally-produced  goods

are more expensive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



than  imported  goods. For instance, fire-crackers

are  locally  produced. We can also  get  imported

fire-crackers which are subject to tax.  But  both

imported  and  locally-produced fire-crackers  are

sold at 35 cents per packet. Therefore, we can see

that  the  local product is not cheaper  than  the

imported  crackers. We have made our contributions

and  sacrifices, and yet we have not  enjoyed  the

fruits of our sacrifices. When imported goods  can

be  sold  cheaper than our locally-produced  goods

even  after  they have been taxed, we can  see-how

expensive  our  local  products  are.   There   is

something wrong here. It seems that the Government

wants  only our people to make sacrifices. On  the

other hand, it has been more courteous towards the

capitalists.  Sir, I do not mean to frighten  away

the capitalists from investing in our country. But

what I want to point out is that the encouragement

of  foreign  investment in our country  should  be

based  on the principle of mutual benefit. If  the

Government were to take a placating and  cringing

attitude  towards  the capitalists  in  order  to

encourage  foreign investment here, it would  only

expose  the  inability  and  foolishness  of   the

Government.  It  would also show that  it  is  not

adhering to its principle of democratic socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the Budget statement, we can see that

the  efforts of our people produced $414.3 million

for the manufacturing sector in 1965. In 1966,  it

increased to $486.8 million - an increase  of  $72

million.  Private sector investment also increased

from $233 million in 1966 to $596 million in 1969,

showing  an increase of 156 per cent. I am quoting

these  figures in order to show that, as a result

of the sacrifices and hard work of our people, our

country has been able to overcome its difficulties

and  has  achieved the present mild  boom  in  our

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period, the Government has improved the living conditions of a few high-ranking

Government  officers  and  also  increased   their

allowances.  For  instance,  a  Mercedes  car   is

provided  free to every one of these  officers  in

order that they can better serve the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



Government. The total cost of seven Mercedes  cars

is  more  than $110,000. I do not deny that  these

high-ranking Government officers have  contributed

a  great  deal  to the country. In a  way,  it  is

proper  to give them incentives so that  they  can

better  serve the Government. But the crux of  the

question  is  that  we  should  not  neglect   the

contribution  made by the working class  who  have

taken part in the building of our country. Why  is

it  that the living standard of the working  class

has  not been raised? Furthermore, Government  has

not  introduced  measures to  improve  the  living

standard of the working class. Sir, I am sure  you

will  agree  with  me  that  if  we  are  to  give

incentives  to Government servants so  that  they

can  serve  the country better and make them  feel

secure  in  their posts, we should not forget  the

lot of the general masses. When these high-ranking

Government   officers  in  air-conditioned   rooms

formulate  schemes, they have to  depend  on  the

general masses to carry them out. When the general

masses cannot carry out these schemes they will be

made scapegoats. And we, as Members of Parliament,

will also become scapegoats of these officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about Members of Parliament, our duties

in the constituencies have increased considerably.

After  a  lapse of ten years and in spite  of  the

increase  in our work, our parliamentary allowance

of   $500   has  not  been  increased.  In   other

countries, the M.P.s have ways and means to enrich

themselves. But we are a different lot here and we

do not think of enriching ourselves. If we compare

ourselves with the M.P.s of other countries, we do

more work in the constituencies and we are serving

the  masses even though our allowance has not been

increased. This is an example for all to  see  and

emulate.  Sir,  I have given this example  but  it

does  not mean that I am making a request  for  an

increase  in  our  allowance.  I  have   no   such

intention. The main purpose in giving this example

is  to  compare the M.P.s here with the  M.P.s  of

other countries. And also to urge all our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



M.P.s   to  adhere  to  our  democratic  socialist

principles and march along this path in  order  to

build  a  better and fairer society. In  order  to

achieve  this ideal, we have to take the necessary

measures.   There   must  be  a  balance   between

production  and consumption. We must also  try  to

narrow  the  gap between the rich  and  the  poor.

There  should be better safeguards for the working

class,  and  production  must  be  increased.  The

workers' living standard should be raised so  that

there  will  be  a  fairer  distribution  of   the

economic  fruits. We should aim at these targets,

and not allow our society to be manipulated by the

rich.  Only  by  these means can we eliminate  the

exploitation of the working class and  bridge  the

gap between the rich and the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will agree with me that the main task of

the Government is to look after the welfare of the

people  and  to  increase  the  rewards  for  the

working  class  so  that they  can  improve  their

livelihood  and  also  to  provide  for  the  next

generation. The Government must also take steps to

increase  the  purchasing power  of  the  working

class. Of course, it will have to proceed with its

industrialisation programme. But I  feel  that  in

the  process, we should synchronize it  with  our

policy  of  democratic  socialism  in  order   to

increase  the benefits of production so that  they

can be shared equally by all the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I do not advocate that the

Government should do away with private enterprise.

All  private enterprises, in so far as they do not

act  against  the interest of the people  and  the

nation,   should  receive  assistance   from   the

Government  in order to increase production  and

efficiency.  The rich are still in an advantageous

position.  For instance, we have heard  from  many

hawkers   complaining  that  they  have   suffered

considerably  under the urban renewal  scheme.  I

fully  support  the  redevelopment  of  the  urban

areas, but we should also realise that some people

would be affected as a result of the urban renewal

scheme. Redevelopment affects different people  in

different  ways. On the one hand,  some  investors

would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



reap  huge profits, but, on the other hand,  small

merchants would sustain severe losses. Some  might

even  go bankrupt. This is because they are unable

to   adapt   to  their  new  situation   and   new

environment. I am sure the Government can get  all

these  facts from the Ministry of Law and National

Development.   Though   the   Government    awards

compensation to the people affected, it should be

stressed  that  the  amount of compensation  given

cannot  make  up  for their suffering.  The  high-ranking Government officers who stay in their air-conditioned rooms cannot appreciate the extent  of

their sufferings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the concessions given to those who are

forced  to  remove, the actual fact is  that  they

have no choice. Though they are given concessions,

the  type  of dwellings or shophouses,  the  cruel

fact is that everything boils down to money in the

final  analysis. What the Government cares for  is

also  money. Small merchants have not been successful  in  competing  with larger  capitalists  when

tendering for premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about small hawkers, this question again

makes  us  realise  that  the  Government  is  not

dealing  with  matters  based  on  the  spirit  of

democratic socialism. First of all, I should point

out  that  as  our Government is  elected  by  the

people,  we should act according to the manifesto

we  put up during the elections. We must have  the

agreement  of the people first before we implement

any  new policy. In this way we can be true to our

people.  They  will therefore support  us  because

they feel that we have fulfilled our promises. How

are  we  going to explain to the people in  great

detail  that we could not fulfil all our promises,

as  pledged,  because of the  changing  times?  We

should  make  ourselves clear to  the  people  and

explain  the present changes to them. We are  duty

bound to explain to the people who have elected us

to this House why certain measures are impractical

and cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



be  implemented. In my view the Government has not

acted according to the spirit and principle of its

manifesto, in dealing with the hawkers.  Sir,  the

question  of  hardship  of the  hawkers  has  been

resolved to some extent. However, they still  face

some  problems,  for  instance,  the  increase  in

hawkers' licence fees. The Government's policy  on

hawkers needs to be changed so that they  may  be

better  treated.  When we increase  their  licence

fees,  we  are imposing a greater burden on  them,

though  the additional sum extracted from them  is

to  be used for health and environmental services.

Why  do  the  Government not think of measures  to

prevent  the evasion of tax by the "big fish"?  It

is  an  open  secret that rich  people  have  been

evading   taxes.   Instead,  the   Government   is

increasing the tax on hawkers' licences. This kind

of  action  is  not  appropriate.  I  believe  the

Government,  by  paying attention to  this  point,

will  be able to get more revenue from people  who

have been evading taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Government to take note that to

tax  the hawkers would only increase their  burden

and   suffering.  They  are  already  finding   it

difficult  to  make ends meet. In  the  end,  they

would  form the habit of borrowing from  chit-fund

companies,  which  are now flourishing, to  solve

their   financial  difficulties.   The   chit-fund

companies thus become blood-sucking vampires.  For

instance, when  small merchants remove  to  other

accommodation because of the urban renewal scheme,

they  will have to pay a lot of money like initial

down-payment, rentals and other necessities. Since

they  have  no ready cash, they will have  to  get

some  sort of a loan from the chit-fund companies.

They will have to pay very high interest rates. In

this  way, the poor becomes poorer and  the  rich

becomes  richer. Thus the rich would  be  able  to

exploit  the poor. This has always been the  case.

The  legislation  of chit-fund  companies  by  the

Government  will lead to the result  I  have  just

mentioned. I would like to ask the Government  why

it  cannot provide the same kind of service as the

chit-fund



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



companies do for these citizens in order  to  help

them improve their livelihood. The Government  can

charge  a  low  rate  of interest  as  maintenance

charges. In this way, it can help the poor  people

when they need money urgently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Budget statement, we can see that our

Gross  Domestic Product has increased from  $1,968

million in 1959 to $4,833 million in 1969. The per

capita  income in 1959 was $1,262 whereas in  1969

it  was  $2,437.  This goes to show  the  economic

progress  of  our country in the past  ten  years.

However,  this rate of economic progress does  not

necessarily  mean that the standard of  living  of

everyone in Singapore has gone up, that we are now

very well off. Even though about ten years ago the

per  capita  income  was about  $1,200,  the  poor

people  could still put some savings in the  bank,

but  now  they do not have enough to live on  even

though the per capita income has risen to $2,400.

They have to borrow from the chit-fund companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to impose a more

progressive  tax on the rich people so  that  they

will  be taxed more. This is not improper. In this

way, we can close the gap between the rich and the

poor people of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to come down to the root of the matter. If

the  Government  wants  to realise  its  aims  and

objectives  of  democratic  socialism,  it  should

provide a fairer and more equal redistribution  of

wealth.  Though at the beginning this  might  call

for  a  small sacrifice from the people,  we  have

reason  to believe that in the long run they  will

resolve  to  march forward in order to  achieve  a

better  and a more prosperous future. In this  way

we  will be able to instil in our people hopes and

prospects  for  a  better  future.  Otherwise  the

political  ideas which we have spent much  thought

in formulating and which we have struggled hard to

realise will have no significance. If there is  no

political idealism in our work here in Parliament,

then, Sir, may I ask, how can the Government still

expect  to receive the support of the masses?  Now

is the time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



for   the   Government  to  implement   a   fairer

distribution of wealth for the whole society.



<br><br>4.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, last year when the Minister for

Finance  tabled his budget, many new tax proposals

were made. However, under his expert guidance,  he

presented on the 9th of this month a budget  which

does  not  contain  any new  tax  proposals.  This

brings  great delight and relief to the people.  I

fully  support this painless budget,  and  I  hope

that  the next few budgets will be as painless  as

this one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister, the reason for the

favourable balance between revenue and expenditure

is  due  to "fast economic expansion and  improved

tax  administration to provide increased revenue".

The  Government has put in much effort  to  expand

the  economy of our country so as to arrive  at  a

balanced budget. This is an ideal policy. However,

whether  our economic expansion will be  sustained

is  the  crux of the problem. Whether the  present

economic  boom will only be transient  or  whether

there   will   be   economic   crises   are    the

uncertainties of the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should not be complacent

about  what  we  have  achieved  in  our  economic

programmes.  The  complete withdrawal  of  British

forces  by  the  end  of 1971 and  the  world-wide

economic   recession  will  affect  the   economic

progress of our country. This was clearly  pointed

out  in the Minister's Budget statement. It  is  a

warning signal to our people - that if we  do  not

take   steps  now  to  prepare  for  such  adverse

eventualities, we shall be faced with all sorts of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no doubt we have experienced an economic

expansion  over the last decade. But whether  this

will  be sustained is a problem into which we must

look.  Investors have taken advantage of  all  the

incentives and concessions that the Government has

offered them. But they are only concerned with the

short-term returns and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



interest  on  their  investments.  This  can  only

result in the poor quality of their products. Such

ventures  and  enterprises will  not  be  able  to

survive  for long. They are a source of disruption

to   our   economy.   Sir,  such   investors   and

enterprises should be controlled by the Government

so  that  they will not misuse the incentives  and

concessions offered to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has

taken  about  two  hours  to  deliver  his  Budget

statement. It reveals in great detail the progress

of  our  economy  over  the  past  ten  years.  It

analyses   the  various  stages  of  our  economic

development over the last decade, and has  arrived

at   a  very  logical  conclusion.  Obviously  the

Minister has taken much time in its preparation in

order  to  draw up such a comprehensive statement.

The   spirit  shown  by  the  Minister  is  really

praiseworthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past ten years we have experienced

various  difficulties and drawbacks. For instance,

in  1961-63 there were political disturbances when

anti-national elements created trouble everywhere,

trying  to  destroy  our  national  existence.  In

1963-65  there  was  the Indonesian  confrontation

which  made the Indonesians stop trading with  us.

This period slowed down our economic progress. But

under  the  able  leadership  and  policy  of  our

Government, together with the joint efforts of our

people  of all races and classes, we were able  to

overcome  these  difficulties  and  we  now  march

steadily on to economic construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these grand economic and social achievements,

it  is necessary to mention the following: (1) the

achievements  in building construction.  Over  the

past ten years we have built 100,000 units of low-cost  housing.  This  has  solved  our  housing  shortage  problem. (2) The building of industries.

Over  the  past  eight years we have  successfully

laid a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



sound foundation to our industries, and industrial

produce  has increased. For instance, in 1959  the

industrial  sector's  contribution  to  our  Gross

Domestic  Product  was $256 million.  However,  by

1969 this increased to $1,154 million. There was a

great  increase  in the number of jobs  available.

According to statistics, by the end of 1969  about

87,000   jobs  were  created.  This   solved   our

unemployment problem to a great extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the high rate of our economic

development, we have also made achievements in the

fields  of  education  and  social  services.  For

instance, we have successfully maintained our free

universal primary education, and have done well in

our   eradication  of  illiteracy.  We  have  also

improved    our   technological   and   scientific

education.  This stream of education will  provide

high calibre personnel in large numbers needed for

our  nation building. Moreover, as a result of our

improved educational programmes, more and more  of

our  people  will be better educated and  equipped

with  modern  technological knowledge. Undoubtedly

they   will  become  the  future  elite   of   our

citizenry.  Further,  over  the  past  few  years,

because of a nation-wide family planning campaign,

our  population growth has decreased from  40  per

1,000 to the present 18 per 1,000. As a result  of

the  judicious planning of the Ministry of  Health

over  the  past two years, a nation-wide  cleaning

campaign  was launched, and with the joint  effort

of  the  people  we  have,  in  fact,  become  the

cleanest country in the whole of Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these good performances clearly show that, in

spite   of  the  various  political  and  economic

difficulties,  we have been able to overcome  them

and,  in  fact, have even achieved  much  in  the

l960s.  These achievements have been greater  than

anything  obtained in other countries in Southeast

Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the Minister for Finance that

in  our  society there is greater social  cohesion

and a higher degree of social discipline and self-reliance. There is also a sense of pride.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



among  our people, who are ready to surge  forward

in  spite  of unfavourable conditions.  All  these

good qualities are factors to stimulate our social

progress  and  the  dynamism  behind  our   nation

building. For instance, the members of the various

Citizens'  Consultative Committees, the  community

centre  managements,  and the  committees  of  the

various  city  organisations, give  very  concrete

examples of their dedicated service to our country

and  our  people. All this shows that  our  people

have  good qualities of character. Another example

is that during the confrontation period our people

quickly rallied round the Government when the call

for  national  defence was made. They  immediately

joined  the  Vigilante  Corps.  The  present  good

response  of  our  youths to national  service  is

another concrete example of the dedication of  our

people.  This  shows  that the  character  of  our

people  has  been  lifted to a higher  plane  -  a

necessary  quality  for nation  building  and  one

which will ensure success for our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an emigrant society. During the colonial

period we lacked a sense of group living. However,

since  our  independence, we  have  been  able  to

inculcate  this  good quality in our  people.  Our

success  so  far  has  been due  mainly  to  three

factors. First, the Government's intimate  contact

with the people. The national leaders are able  to

discuss   with   the   people   various   problems

confronting the country and thus inculcate in them

a  sense  of patriotism. Secondly, the educational

and  cultural  levels  of  the  people  have  been

generally raised. They have a deeper understanding

of  the problems confronting our country. Thirdly,

greater   use   has   been  made   of   the   mass

communication media, such as the newspapers,  T.V.

and  the  radio. This has increased the  sense  of

patriotism of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the Budget statement many times and I

am  sure the Finance Minister has made an accurate

analysis  of our economic situation and  that  our

future   is  bright.  Of  course,  we  have   been

stressing  the  fact that the  1970s  will  be  a

period of trial and challenge to us in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



view of the British withdrawal by the end of 1971.

We  have to bear the full brunt of maintaining our

own  defence and security and their effects on our

economic  development. We are confident of  facing

the  future, because it is an undeniable fact that

we have various factors in our favour. Our foreign

reserves  stand  at  $2,445 million,  a  four-fold

increase in four years. This will ensure that  our

currency  is stable and consequently international

investors  will  have greater  confidence  in  our

country. We have also done well in developing  our

internal economy; for instance, the development of

new      industries,     shipbuilding,     housing

construction,  tourism, an  increase  in  external

trade   and  the  undertaking  of  urban   renewal

projects. We have progressed in all these  fields.

If  present  conditions  continue  in  the  coming

years,  we  will be able to maintain our  economic

prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present budget, the estimate for defence is

$328,670,000.  Next comes social  services,  which

takes  up $319 million. Following these two  items

is  the estimated expenditure for statutory boards

and other economic services which cost a large sum

of  money.  Every year the Development  Fund  will

receive  about  $30 million to $40  million  which

will   ensure   the  success  of  our  development

programmes. Defence has taken the biggest  cut  in

our  budget.  This  is because the  Government  is

taking  immediate steps to strengthen our  defence

in  order  to  meet the situation created  by  the

withdrawal of British troops in 1971. This  is  to

ensure that we are able to exist as an independent

country. This is the correct action to take, and I

am   sure   all   our  people  will   give   their

wholehearted support to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in spite of the increased expenditure on

defence,  the  Government has  not  neglected  its

responsibilities on education. In the  budget  for

next  year,  $3.9  million  is  allocated  to  the

University  of Singapore, Nanyang University,  the

Singapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann College.  There

is  thus  a  nine per cent increase in expenditure

over  that  of  last  year in the  development  of

higher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



education.  This is to ensure that we can  produce

people  of  high  calibre to help  in  our  nation

building. This is a good measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of immigration and

the  granting  of  citizenship, the  Minister  for

Finance  has said that the Government  will  relax

the regulations for the granting of citizenship. I

agree  with this measure as it is in the  interest

of  the country. I hope those who have been living

in  Singapore for a long time and who possess blue

identity cards will be given some consideration in

their applications for Singapore citizenship. They

have families in our country who are willing to be

loyal  citizens. We should grant them  citizenship

so  that they can make a positive contribution  to

our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to mention that, although

there  is  no  increase in taxation,  there  is  a

credit  balance  of  about $300,000.  This  speaks

volumes  for our Minister for Finance  because  it

shows his ability and economic acumen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, this is a lively budget. I believe

that  with  the present stable political situation

and  with  continuing prosperity in  our  economic

development,  our  Republic will  enjoy  a  better

year.  With the joint effort of the people, a  new

and prosperous era will begin in the 1970s.



<br><br>4.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have something to say on the

budget  for  the  coming year. On the  subject  of

defence,  I  must  say that I am not  against  the

defence  of  the  country as such,  because  every

country has to defend itself. Every country  needs

its own armed forces to protect its people. In the

past,  education has always taken the largest  sum

of  money.  But  this year defence has  taken  the

largest cut, a sum of almost $300 million. This is

too big a burden for us.



I have said that I am not against defence as such.

But  the  way we are going about it is  wrong.  We

have called up our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



youths for training and the reason why we have  to

spend   so  much  is  that  national  service   is

compulsory.  We should start training  our  youths

when  they are in Secondary I or Secondary II.  All

Secondary school students should undergo  military

training.  In  this way we can carry out  military

training  free of charge. We do not have to  incur

such  large sums of money on defence. What I  mean

is that training for national defence should start

with  secondary  school  students.  We  must  also

induct female students into national service. This

is  only fair, otherwise we may one day find  that

all our male citizens are engaged in a war and all

of them might perhaps be killed. What will be left

will  be  only females. Can they produce  children

without  the men! This is wrong. We should  induct

both males and females into national service. This

is  my  opinion. Unfortunately, the  Minister  for

Defence  is  not  here. But I would  like  him  to

revise  his policy on national defence. Only  then

can we save a great deal of money. Other countries

are also doing this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I come to the question of foreign affairs.

In   the  past  we  have  followed  a  policy   of

neutrality and non-alignment. But now  we  are  no

longer neutral. This is wrong. Take, for instance,

the  tight rope in the circus. Can the rope  swing

to the left or to the right during the act? No, it

cannot.  It  must be firm and straight,  otherwise

the  tight-rope walker will fall down. So we  must

be  neutral  in order to be safe. We must  not  go

either to the left or to the right. Whoever  comes

to  attack  us, let us die together. What  are  we

afraid  of? If you are afraid, you should  resign.

No  one  should  influence our  stand.  We  should

maintain  our  neutral and independent  stand.  In

this  way,  our economy will prosper and  we  will

progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have changed our policy towards the Bank of

China.  This is a failure in our policy. What  are

we  afraid of? We are not going on the lines  that

China is going on. We should not follow the policy

of  going  either to the left or to the right  as

long as there is money. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



should  adopt  a  policy  of  perfect  neutrality,

otherwise  in  the end we are going to  suffer.  I

would  like  to  remind the Minister  for  Foreign

Affairs  that  we should be neutral, otherwise  we

would be like the man walking on the tight rope in

the  circus  who will fall down if the tight  rope

swings  to  the  left  or to  the  right.  What  a

disgrace it will then be. If we go to the left  or

to  the  right, we  will fall down.  We  must  be

neutral  and remain in the centre so that  in  the

end we will reach our objective.



I  was  in full support of the Government's policy

on the acquisition of land. But now the Government

seems  to  be  taking over land on the  cheap  and

selling  it at high prices. Let us have a  bit  of

fairness in this matter. Without fairness, all the

people  will  complain. Let  us  be  fair  to  the

people. We cannot suppress the people too much, or

they  will rise in rebellion against us. At  least

the  Ministers can take an aeroplane  and  fly  to

some  other country. But where can I go? For those

of  us  who  cannot afford to take  an  aeroplane,

where can we go? If we go back to China, what will

happen   to  us?  What  about  those  Members   of

Parliament  and the rest of the people who  cannot

take aeroplanes and fly to some other country?  So

we  must adopt a neutral policy. Only then can our

future be secure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the acquisition of land also,

people  are saying that the People's Action  Party

is  now operating a bean curd shop, and that it is

selling things. They have said that Singapore  has

sold  Christmas Island but they dare not say  that

the  P.A.P. has sold Singapore island!  They  are

saying  that the P.A.P. is operating a  bean  curd

shop.  Mr  Speaker. Sir, you may not  know  about

buying  bean curd. Previously bean curd  was  sold

piece  by piece. How about the P.A.P.? The  P.A.P.

is  also selling bean curd piece by piece. How can

this  go on? We cannot allow this state of affairs

to  go  on. We must be fair, otherwise the  people

will  not  be satisfied with our performance.  The

land that we acquire from our people should not be

sold to foreigners. Otherwise it would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



be  similar to the concessions in Shanghai,  where

plots   of   land  were  divided  up   among   the

foreigners. We should not do this. We should  sell

acquired land only to our citizens. If we sell  to

foreigners,  what are we to do if we are  attacked

by  foreign  troops? This shows that  we  are  not

patriotic  enough. I came from China  and  I  know

what imperialism is like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Delta spoke about

resettlement. She was wrong. How can  we  resettle

people?  We should have pity on them. We  must  be

fair  to them. We must not force them to move from

place  to place. As an M.P., I was scolded by people

who  were evicted from their houses. It is because

they  had a genuine grouse. Last December, as  the

people  were  getting ready to celebrate  the  New

Year, they  were  ordered to  move  out.  If  the

authorities wanted them to move out, a few months'

notice  should have been given to them. How  could

they  celebrate the New Year when they had to move

out? It was not a Happy New Year for them. Some of

the  officers are getting a few thousand  dollars,

which  is  more  than what our Prime  Minister  is

getting. This is not the way to do things.How  can

the  people tolerate this sort of treatment?  They

cannot take it any more. They are angry, and  when

the  demolition gangs are about to pull down their

houses, they arm themselves with weapons. How  can

we cope with the situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of arrears of rent, I must say

that  everyone owes rent. But we should not  force

them to move out just like that. Our Government is

a  democratic  government and  we  should  not  do

things  in  this  way.  The Minister  gets  a  few

thousand  dollars a month. How much does  he  save

from  this sum? How can people with a few  hundred

dollars  support  their  families  and  pay   rent

regularly?  They should be given time  to  pay  up

their  arrears of rent. They should not be  forced

to  move out. It they are forced to move out, then

democracy becomes suppression and tyranny.  People

would rise and rebel against our Government.  What

are we going to do then? I have seen many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



things.  Where  can we go? Are  we  going  to  the

hills? Therefore, we must consider the question of

payment  of arrears of rent. We should  have  pity

and  look  after  those people who  owe  rent.  We

should  not evict those who cannot afford  to  pay

up.  They just simply cannot afford to pay up. The

Minister should be more sympathetic. He should see

for  himself the circumstances of the  people  who

are in arrears of rent.



I  must  also  say that there is no corruption  in

Singapore,    but   there   is   an   unreasonable

bureaucracy.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, congratulations to the Minister

for  Finance  on  his  highly satisfactory  Budget

statement. During the last ten years, despite  the

many   unexpected  setbacks,  such  as  Indonesian

confrontation and the accelerated British military

withdrawal,    and    despite    the    apparently

insurmountable  problems such as the  unemployment

situation, our economic strength has continued  to

improve.  Credit must therefore be  given  to  the

Government  and, in particular, the  Minister  for

Finance   for  having  successfully  steered   our

country  through one of the most difficult periods

in our history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the Minister reported considerable

improvement in our standard of living and  in  our

economic position, I wish to draw his attention to

some important matters which affect the livelihood

of  our  farmers in particular, and  the  cost  of

living of the general public in general.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will disagree that our industrialisation

programme,  which  has been a great  success,  has

broken  the back of our unemployment problem,  but

while we concentrate on industrialisation, we must

not   forget  that  we  should  try  to  be  self-sufficient  as far as possible in food production.

Through  the  efforts  of the  Primary  Production

Department in the past few years, we are now  able

to  produce all the eggs and pork needed  for  our

home consumption. I understand that the prices  of

eggs  and pork sold by farmers to wholesalers  are

very   much   lower  than  the  prices   paid   by

householders  in  the  market.  Our  farmers   are

complaining  that, because of the  low  prices  of

eggs  and  pigs  sold  to the  wholesalers,  their

income  is hardly sufficient to pay for the  feed-stuff for their hens and pigs. Yet housewives have

to  pay  high  prices  for pork  bought  from  the

market.  This  situation  affects  not  only   the

farmers, but the general public as well, for  when

the   prices  of  eggs  and  pork  go  up,   other

foodstuffs also follow suit, resulting in an  all-round increase in our cost of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the solution lies in the formation of

farmers'  co-operatives. The  farmers  sell  their

produce  to the cooperatives which, in turn,  sell

it  to  the retailers in the market. If the prices

of  eggs  and  pork are to remain at  the  present

level, and if the public accepts these prices,  at

least   the   benefit   goes   to   the   farmers.

Alternatively, if the farmers' selling prices  are

to  remain, at least the general public benefit by

having  to  pay less for their eggs and pork,  and

there  would be a general lowering of our cost  of

living.  At present, neither the farmers  nor  the

general  public  benefit; only the middlemen,  the

wholesalers,  who  seem to  have  a  grip  on  the

market, benefit. I therefore urge the Minister for

Finance  or  the  Minister  responsible  for   co-operative societies to look into this problem  and

consider  the formation of farmers' co-operatives.

This  will not only be an incentive to the farmers

to improve their economic

conditions, but also enable the people with  lower

income to buy food at cheaper prices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): At the beginning of the l970s and in the midst of

the  withdrawal of the British Armed  Forces,  the

wise  and  resourceful Minister  for  Finance  has

presented  a  painless Budget, without introducing

any  new taxes or any increase in the rate of  old

taxes.  Needless  to  say,  this  budget  will  be

welcomed  with great joy by people from all  walks

of life. He has given us encouragement, as we step

into  the  l970s. He has also given us  a  greater

degree of confidence in the future of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are glad and proud of is that about four

years ago, after we were forced to leave Malaysia,

all the people managed to pull themselves together

and, in a concerted effort, put in a great deal of

hard  work,  thereby producing the fruits  of  the

labour   we  see  today.  We  have  laid  a   firm

foundation for our permanent survival. Our economy

has  progressed by leaps and bounds each year. Our

Gross  Domestic Product has increased every  year.

Our  industries have thrived. In fact, what we are

facing  now  is  not the problem of creating  more

employment opportunities, but the problem  of  the

shortage  of  labour. In short, the  task  of  our

nation   building   has  had  a  very   favourable

beginning.  As  long  as we  all  learn  from  the

experience of our predecessors and work hard,  the

prosperity  we  enjoy now will be  maintained  and

further  enhanced. However, we should  not  forget

that  there  are some people around us  who  would

like  to  see us fail. For this reason, we  cannot

afford  to  be  careless in the least.  We  cannot

afford  to  relax.  We  must  stand  firm  in  our

position and progress from strength to strength.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has told the House that

the financial policy of the Government is based on

the rapid economic growth and relies on the im



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



proved  administration to increase the revenue  of

the  country. It does not depend on new  taxes  or

higher taxes for its revenue. This is a very  wise

and praiseworthy move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that the Minister, in order to improve

the efficiency of tax collection, has set up a new

Anti-Evasion  Unit with 52 posts.  This  makes  me

think that the number of tax evaders must be quite

considerable, otherwise it would not be  necessary

to  expand  this Unit. I would like  to  tell  the

people who evade taxes that paying taxes is  their

duty.  To  evade  paying taxes is  despicable  and

immoral  conduct. There is a Chinese saying  which

goes  something  like this: "What we  obtain  from

society  should be used for the good of  society."

The  monetary  wealth  that  people  acquire  from

society  should not be exclusively for  their  own

use.  Part  of  it should be used to  improve  the

living  conditions of the poorer sections  of  the

community.  It would be very selfish  of  them  to

keep it for their private use. I would like to ask

these  people  to think again and to abandon  this

form  of selfish conduct. I would like to ask  the

Minister to punish severely those who evade  taxes

constantly, because, if nobody attempts  to  evade

taxes,  it would not be necessary for the Minister

to   set  up  this  Anti-Evasion  Unit,  and   the

expenditure  for  it could be utilised  for  other

projects  which would be beneficial to our  people

and our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, from the Budget speech of the

Minister  for  Finance, we all  know  that,  as  a

result  of  the rapid expansion of our industries,

there   is   a   severe  shortage  of   engineers,

technicians  and  skilled  labour.  In  order   to

support  the  expansion  of  our  industries,  the

authorities  have decided to relax the immigration

laws  so  that  those  with specialised  technical

skills could come and live in our country and look

for  jobs, whereas in the past they had to  get  a

job  first before they could be allowed to  settle

down  here.  On  the one hand,  the  Minister  for

Finance has provided for a larger amount of  money

to impose stricter immigration laws,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



whereas,   on  the  other  hand,  he  is  relaxing

immigration   laws.  Is  this  not  a  paradoxical

situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some young people in our country who,

because they are afraid of national service or for

other  reasons, go overseas to study,  and,  after

the  completion of their studies, they do not come

back.   This  is  a  form  of  brain  drain.   The

Government  should  do  something  to  make  these

people come back and play their part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have noticed that the vote

for the Ministry of Health has shown a significant

increase. The increased provision will, of course,

mean  that  the  people will  get  better  medical

services.  This is most commendable. I would  like

to  make  use  of  this  opportunity  to  ask  the

Minister  for  Finance what has  happened  to  his

promise  that  he would consider the extension  of

medical  benefits to the staff of Government-aided

schools?  When  is  this  extension  going  to  be

implemented? I would like to remind  him  that  on

the  11th  June  of last year in this  House, the

Parliamentary  Secretary, in reply to  a  question

put by me, said that the question of the extension

of  medical  benefits to the staff in  Government-aided   schools  was  under  discussion   by   the

Ministries of Finance, Health and Education at the

beginning of 1969. The Parliamentary Secretary had

promised  that the question would be given  speedy

consideration.  This could be  found  in  Hansard,

Vol.  29,  No. 1 (cols. 6-7). Fifteen months  have

already passed since the discussions were started.

I  would  ask  the Minister not to  delay  further

consideration of this issue.



<br><br>5.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Budget address given by the Minister for

Finance  on 9th March, 1970, is a painless  budget

and  is  a  source of joy and happiness to  people

from  every  stratum of society.  Indeed,  in  the

midst  of the imminent run-down of British  forces

and the decline in British military expenditure,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



and   the   consequent  increase  in  our  defence

expenditure,  our Government has  not  thought  it

necessary  to  propose new taxes. This  is  indeed

good news to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I would like to point out

is  that in the vote for Education, I notice  that

there is a ratio of three to one between technical

education and general education. I feel that  this

preponderance  in  favour of  technical  education

should not be maintained for too long. It is  true

that  the  implementation of our industrialisation

programme requires an army of skilled personnel to

staff  all  the factories. But we must admit  that

the  boom  and prosperity that we are experiencing

at  present  is not due to our preoccupation  with

scientific and technical education alone.  To  put

it simply, in addition to scientific and technical

education, we must also see to it that our  social

sciences  advance at an equal pace.  Otherwise  we

will  be  faced with the prospect of many  of  our

citizens   being   merely   tools   for   economic

production,  without a corps of economic  planners

at  the  helm to guide our economic destiny.  This

will  bring about political instability and social

insecurity.  And  finally  we  will  come   to   a

catastrophic end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me cite an example. Take

the  Ministers in the Cabinet. None of them is the

product  of  pure  scientific and technical  education.  Yet  they are able to transform this  small

island  of  ours,  without any natural  resources,

into  a  land  of prosperity and plenty.  This  is

indisputable  proof that the study of  the  social

sciences should not be neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I have noted that the

provision  for Social Welfare has been reduced  by

the amount of $4 million. This is bad news for the

poor   section  of  our  population,  and   is   a

retrogressive  step.  Everyone  knows   that   the

People's  Action  Party has  the  support  of  the

people,  and  was  given a  mandate  to  rule  the

country.  One  of the reasons for its  success  is

that   it   runs   a  very  honest,   clean,   and

incorruptible administration. But more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



important,  the  P.A.P., has all along  been  looking

after the welfare of the poor, and its achievement

in  social welfare services is unrivalled in  this

part  of the world. Although we know that we  must

incur  a greater amount of expenditure for Defence

so  as to enhance our defence capability, it  does

not  necessarily mean that we have to cut down our

provision  for the poor section of our  community.

This  reduced  expenditure  is  particularly  felt

since existing private charity organisations  have

not  spread  out enough or have not been  able  to

take  over  the functions of Government in  social

welfare  work?  We  must  not  neglect  the   less

fortunate sections of our people and allow them to

drift   along,  as  this  will  result  in  social

insecurity  and  unrest. I am sure the  Government

can  easily find this meagre sum of $4 million  to

provide for our social welfare services by levying

a  higher  rate  of duty on luxury items  such  as

cosmetics,  liquor, and tobacco. The poor  section

of  the  people who will benefit from this measure

will then express their boundless gratitude to the

Government. Moreover, by taking this measure,  the

social conditions will be more healthy, and  there

will  be less scope for criminal activity  in  our

society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past years many of us

in  this House have lavished praise on the  wisdom

and  far-sightedness  of  our  Finance  Minister's

budgets.  Even in those years when an  M.P.'s  life

was   made   very  uncomfortable  by  constituency

queries and criticisms of new taxation, many of us

could  not but have a sneaking admiration for  the

way  money  was raised, disbursed, and hidden.  I,

for one, had this suspicion that total expenditure

did not absorb all the taxes collected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is all for the better. Now we are told that

should  lean  times really come, we  have  put  on

sufficient fat to last it out. Looking around  the

city. I cannot but agree that the economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



infrastructure is there. Jurong is  thriving.  New

industrial  estates are fully occupied  and  newer

ones are planned and provided for. Never has there

been  so  much money in the bank and  in  people's

pockets.  Unemployment  has  turned  into   labour

shortage.  And the final proof is this  budget  --which,  in spite of larger demands for development

and  defence,  relies on increased  prosperity  to

bring in increased revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years of belt-tightening have been proved

timely and necessary. Now we are able to meet  the

economic  consequences of the  British  withdrawal

with the confidence derived from a vastly expanded

economic  stability  and  a  comfortable   savings

hoard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have but two observations to make on the

Government's  financial policy for  the  year.  We

have large amounts of money stashed away abroad. I

know some of it has to be so in order to meet  the

needs  of our currency backing. I understand  also

that  when we ask for foreign investments in  this

country,  we  ask for technological  know-how  and

international connections just as much as  we  ask

for  foreign cash. But are we making the best  out

of our funds?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the estimate for Interest and

Dividend  income for l969-70 was in the region  of

$30  million,  and that the estimate  for  the  12

months from 1970-71, instead of 15 months, is over

$43 million. Taking 12 months for comparison, this

revenue is estimated to increase by nearly 90  per

cent  from these two items. As nearly 70 per  cent

of  these  two  items  were derived  from  foreign

sources,  we must have staggering amounts invested

abroad  in  stocks  and bonds,  probably  more  in

bonds, as the 1970-71 Estimates show Dividends  at

about  5  per cent of interest. Can some of  these

sums be more profitably used here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past years the Government has quite

rightly  placed  a  great  deal  of  interest   in

investments  in  shipbuilding  and  the   shipping

industry. Neptune Orient Lines Ltd, has got off to

a good start, and more money is to be lent to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



it.  What  I hope the Government has not forgotten

is  the fishing industry. Just as it was futile to

wait  until  a big shipbuilder came  here,  it  is

equally  unrealistic to wait until a  big  fishing

enterprise decides to establish an industry  here.

I   would   like  to  recommend  for  the  Finance

Minister's consideration the need to start off  as

a  joint  venture or alone, if necessary, a  large

fishing  industry. In 1968 we imported  nearly  80

per  cent  of  our fish requirements.  Our  annual

consumption   exceeds  60,000  tons.   There   is

therefore,  a  fairly substantial home  market  to

start  off  with.  But a modern  fishing  industry

requires  enormous capital. The Government  should

step  in and take the lead, otherwise it will take

a long time before a local firm grows sufficiently

large to be able to afford the capital. And as  no

foreign  firm  has  shown signs of  investing  the

large sums needed, it would appear that we have to

finance  it  ourselves. Just as we  are  financing

Neptune  Orient Lines, I think we should similarly

start our own fishing company. This is perhaps one

of  the many possible ways in which our funds  can

be better used for ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second observation I would like to make is

that   there   do  not  appear  to  be  sufficient

allocations to make Singapore a greener and a more

gracious  place to live in. I quite  realise  that

this  is not the time to spend large sums of money

for  parks  and gardens. But follow the  model  of

Jurong Aviary, where a public amenity is entrusted

to  an incorporated trading company. I would  like

to  suggest a way in which we can have  a  greener

and  more  graceful Singapore,  without  too  much

public  expenditure. There are  large  numbers  of

people  in Singapore who grow orchids as a  hobby.

But  there are only a few orchid exporters, and  a

rather   large  international  market  is   hardly

touched.  Hawaii has ceased to be a  major  orchid

exporter because of prohibitive labour costs. More

people in Singapore will grow orchids if an outlet

is found. Orchid growing can be a profitable hobby

and if more people take up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



orchid  growing, Singapore will be that much  more

attractive,  It  would  appear,  therefore,   that

orchid  exporting, since it is inadequately served

by   private  enterprise,  is  a  good  field  for

Government to step in, not only to increase export

earnings but also to encourage people to like  and

grow flowers. I think the Government should set up

a   cooperative  to  promote  the  export  of  our

orchids.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I followed with great enthusiasm

the  presentation of the budget for the  financial

year  1970-71 by the Finance Minister. At the very

outset,  he  referred  to  "motion  picture"   and

"snapshots" while directing the House through  the

turbulent l960s. In this respect, I would like  to

associate  myself with the sentiments and  similes

expressed  by  him, and point out  that  both  the

Director  and  Producer of this technicolour  film

had   made  it  rather  attractive  as  could   be

visualised from the "curvaceous figures" displayed

by  the Treasury. To borrow an expression from the

Minister  for  Finance, the  "doubling"  of  Gross

Domestic  Product  during  the  sixties  is   well

appreciated, and I am quite confident that  if  we

continue  to compare our performance with  nations

of  more  or less similar size and population,  it

will  provide the necessary stimulus to accelerate

the pace during the more challenging seventies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perfectly true, as mentioned by the Finance

Minister, that human effort has to a large  extent

contributed    to   this   economic    phenomenon.

Nevertheless, we can hardly afford to de-emphasise

the  fact  that,  apart from  human  endeavour,  a

strong   currency,  political  stability   and   a

responsible  trade union movement have contributed

a  proportionate share in realising to  a  limited

extent  the short-run targets of our economy.  The

next  decade is likely to be less turbulent  since

we have already dealt with the labour pains during

the sixties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In analysing the budget in detail, Sir, I have no

hesitation  in  stating  that  all  sectors   have

received adequate attention, although I might wish

that  one  or two sectors perhaps deserve  special

attention. In the course of my speech, within  the

limited  time  available, I shall  make  a  modest

attempt to feel the pulse of the budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closely following the budget, I have been able to

observe  a  substantial increase in  manufacturing

industries,  especially with regard to  employment

opportunities.  From  the  figures  given  by  the

Finance Minister - I am referring to Table 14* - I

notice  that  during 1969, the  33  pioneer  firms

which  came  into existence provided 14,200  jobs,

while  in the preceding year, 1968, in the pioneer

section,  as a result of the addition  of  44  new

firms,  the employment opportunities were only  to

the tune of 4,105.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* See Cols. 527-8.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same period, i.e., 1968, the performance

of   all   manufacturing  industries  was   rather

astounding in terms of employment figures. In 1968

approximately 15,000 workers were absorbed by  the

manufacturing   sector.  A   close   scrutiny   of

employment    figures   for   all    manufacturing

industries  during the years 1968 and  1969,  with

special emphasis on the pioneering section for the

same  period,  reveals a strange phenomenon.  When

the   manufacturing  industries  in  general   are

expanding at a very fast pace, the pioneer section

is  moving in slow motion. On the other hand, for

the  year under study, namely, 1969, when  pioneer

firms have moved up both in number and employment,

the  manufacturing industries (excluding pioneers)

have slowed down again in pace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I am not mistaken, from a casual glance

at  the figures of employment for pioneer firms in

1968  and 1969, we might conclude that more labour

intensive  industries  are  entering  the   Jurong

complex.   Perhaps  the  Finance   Minister   will

consider it necessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



to  assist  us further in  appreciating  the

direction in which the industrialisation programme

is moving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has not overlooked the fact

that   the   phased  programme  of   the   British

withdrawal  would  necessarily  have  a   negative

impact  on  the economy and measures have  already

been   taken   to  cushion  off  the  effects.   A

flourishing       entrepot      trade,       rapid

industrialisation   with   expansion    of    port

facilities,  and  further improvement  in  tourism

could form a positive catalyst. The budget for the

financial  year  and  the  analysis  of  our  past

performance seem to indicate that the  nation  is moving in the right direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cargo handled at our port during the

decade  has increased nearly two and a half times,

from  14.21 million freight tons in 1959 to  37.90

million  freight tons in 1969, although there  has

been  a fall of nearly three million freight  tons

in  1964  from  the previous year,  apparently,  I

think,  due  to  Indonesian confrontation.  But  a

significant   feature  of  the  total  cargo trade

showed  that  general cargo handled  at  the  port

moved  at  a slow pace over the past decade,  from

6.40  million freight tons in 1959 to 8.30 million

freight  tons in 1969. On the other hand, for  the

same  period  the  cargo of  mineral  oil,  mostly

petroleum,  increased  from 7.74  million  freight

tons  in  l959  to 29.20 million freight  tons  in

1969.  Thus,  the lion's share of the total  cargo

trade  was taken up by oil, and this pattern might

continue,  especially with, oil exploration  going

on  in neighbouring countries and more refineries.

springing   up   in  and  around  Singapore.   But

simultaneously with the oil boom, if the  entrepot

trade  continues to flourish and the manufacturing

sector   responds   to   the  Finance   Minister's

treatment,  the  total tonnage  of  general  cargo

handled  at the port might rise at a faster  pace.

In  this  regard, the expansion of port facilities

must  be  planned  even now to meet  the  expected

requirements, failing which the Port of  Singapore

Authority's problems might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



multiply  manifold and the situation may be  worse

than  that which Port Swettenham is facing  today.

As  I  can observe from the figures -- I am referring

to  Table 13* -- during 1966 to 1969 there  was  an

increase of 10 million freight tons of mineral oil

alone,  while the increased general cargo  handled

for the same period was 1.86 million freight tons.

The  general  cargo handled at  our  port  is  not

likely  to remain at the same pace if the  Finance

Minister's   approach  towards   the   challenging

seventies  bears fruit. Under such  circumstances,

the  present facilities will be inadequate. I hope

the  Finance  Minister and the Port  of  Singapore

Authority will take all the necessary factors into

consideration to improve the port facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* See Col. 526)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Finance Minister has also

laid  sufficient emphasis on education and in this

regard the expenditure involved could be perfectly

justified. But I am more concerned to know whether

the manpower will be sufficiently tailored to meet

the   requirements  of  industrialisation  in  the

seventies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A casual glance at the statistics provided by the

Finance   Minister  with  regard  to   the   total

enrolment  in the educational institutions  during

the  last  decade indicates that  in  the  primary

schools the teacher/student ratio of approximately

1  to  30 has been consistently maintained  during

the  last 10 years. In the secondary schools, too,

the ratio is approximately one teacher to every 27

students.  This  also has not changed  during  the

last   decade.   In  tertiary  education   it   is

gratifying  to note that staff/student  ratio  for

1969  has come up to the level of 1 to 16.  If  we

make  a comparative study of other Asian countries

with regard to the enrolment of students and staff

requirements at tertiary level, I might  say  that

the  staff/student ratio in the case of  Singapore

can be better appreciated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the primary and secondary school

teachers in general, I am afraid that of late they

appear to have been over-burdened with duties  and

responsibilities     which,      under      normal

circumstances,  should  not  fall   within   their

purview. It is too much to expect teachers to  pay

individual attention to the health problems of the

students,  as  it is not our intention  to  create

quack  doctors among the teachers. I might suggest

that  the  Ministry  of Education,  with  the  co-operation of the Ministry of Health, should  think

in  terms  of  establishing first-aid  centres  or

health     clinics    within    the    educational

institutions, preferably with a qualified nurse in

charge,  if the Government feels that there  is  a

necessity to pay adequate attention to the  health

problems  of the pupils during school hours.  Sir,

if  this suggestion of mine can be implemented, it

will solve the unemployment problem of the nursing

profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment

on  the  Minister's passing reference to organized

labour,  especially  the  National  Trades   Union

Congress,  for  its co-operation extended  to  the

Government.  Sir, I would say that it augurs  well

for  a nation in the take-off stage to be able  to

offer  employment opportunities  to  the  tune  of

approximately  30,000  jobs  within   two   years!

Industries require skilled and semi-skilled labour

and  both  our Prime Minister and Finance Minister

have  emphasised  the  fact  that  our  tempo   of

industrialisation has reached  a  stage  where  we

might have to think in terms of attracting skilled

labour  from  abroad with all  perks  which  could

create the necessary incentives. But, at the  same

time,  if  you look at the Monthly Report  of  the

Ministry  of Labour for December 1969 and  January

1970,   you  will  see  that  approximately  4,800

skilled   and   semi-skilled   unemployed   labour

continue  to be in the register of the  Employment

Exchange.  Of  course,  I  do  not  rule  out  the

possibility that the skills that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



require  for  the  emerging  industries  might  be

different  from  the  skills  possessed  by  these

people  in  the  register of the Labour  Ministry.

Nevertheless, we can hardly afford  to  permit  a

situation  where  these  categories  of   workers,

however  small they may be, continue to remain  in

the register of the Labour Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, I might, with great regret, also

refer  to  the  high rate of industrial  accidents

which prevail in our factories today. According to

the  Monthly Report of the Ministry of Labour  for

the   month  of  January  1970, there  were   136

accidents reported to the Factory Inspectorate. Of

these,   two   were  fatal,  seven   resulted   in

amputation  of  the  workers'  fingers,  and   the

remaining  127  resulted  in  minor  flesh   cuts,

bruises, abrasions and burns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perfectly true that when, in a matter of

two  years,  you have 30,000 workers  put  in  the

factory  floor along with the machinery, accidents

are  bound  to  increase in geometric progression!

But  it  need not necessarily mean that we  should

ignore  the situation, because there are  adequate

provisions   under   the  Workmen's   Compensation

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I might suggest that the

following measures could form a basis to cope with

the  situation.  The observance  of  International

Labour  Organisation conventions and their  strict

application  to  industrial safety  could  be  the

first  step.  Secondly, it is  possible  that  the

sudden spurt in industries might have resulted  in

sidestepping  the necessity to provide  sufficient

floor  space  for easy movement. In this  respect,

early  inspection  and periodic  checking  by  the

Labour Ministry might ease the situation. Thirdly,

industrialists  should  be encouraged  to  install

modern  machinery with automatic  built-in  safety

devices  although the cost might be  on  the  high

side.  Economy  in  such cases  might  cost  human

lives.  Fourthly,  there  should  be  proper   co-ordination  among  the labour unions,  the  Labour

Ministry  and management for a periodic review  of

the situation. Fifthly, workers should be educated

in industrial safety. Lastly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



first  aid equipment with qualified nurses  should

be  introduced  in  medium-sized  and  large-scale

factories  as early as possible. Sir, I  am  quite

confident  that  if  the  above  suggestions   are

implemented, it could possibly minimise industrial

accidents so that factories would not present  sad

spectacles of crippled young workers.



In  conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like  to

associate myself with the sentiments expressed  by

the    Finance    Minister    with    regard    to

industrialisation in the seventies.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I thank Back-benchers for

their   various   comments  on  the   Government's

financial  policy? Whether they are in  praise  of

the  Government's policy or in criticism of it,  I

think  they  have made a valuable contribution  to

the  many  important aspects of our  economic  and

financial policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to deal in detail with the points

raised  by Members. First, the Member for Moulmein

has  some reservations about the usefulness of our

policy  in  relaxing immigration and  work  permit

requirements for certain grades of workers as well

as  professional personnel. He thinks that we  may

get third-rate workers and that differences in pay

between local personnel and expatriate staff would

lead  to discontent. Of course, these dangers  are

inherent  in  any scheme of relaxing  controls  on

entry  of  workers. That does, not  mean  that  we

should  not try to increase the supply of  workers

which   industry  now  needs  and  will  need   in

increasing  measure. Unless we  do  so,  we  shall

bring  about  a sudden halt in economic  expansion

and  I  do not think the Member for Moulmein  will

think that that is the price that we should pay in

order  to avoid some dangers. I agree that  these

dangers exist, but they can be guarded against  by

other measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's other point is that in some cases

where employees are already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



getting  very  generous retirement  benefits,  the

increase  of  the employer's contribution  to  the

Central  Provident  Fund has  not  benefited  them

because   this  increased  contribution   by   the

employer offsets the gratuities payable. He thinks

that  this  is a bad thing. I am not at  all  sure

whether  this is a bad thing. If the employer  has

been  giving  generous retirement  benefits,  then

obviously  when  we  are  raising  the  level   of

retirement  benefits, which  is  really  what  the

Provident Fund contributions amount to, why should

these enlightened employers be penalised by having

to  pay,  by  way of retirement benefits,  amounts

additional to what they already have been  paying?

It  is  one of the misfortunes or negative aspects

of  Singapore's  labour/management relations  that

the  good  employer  who makes  profits  is  often

penalised  by  having to pay better  than  average

levels  of  pay  and  fringe  benefits  than   the

inefficient  employer who cannot make profits  and

can  only afford to pay low wages and provide poor

working   conditions   to   his   employees.    An

enlightened policy on this matter would not punish

the  efficient  employer at  the  expense  of  the

inefficient one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has made a number of

useful  observations  on  the  general  policy  of

Government. I will go a long way with him on  most

of what he said. But I will take issue with him on

some  of the points he raised. First, he asks why,

instead  of  giving free entry  to  all  kinds  of

foreign investors, we should not hire experts from

abroad and use our own money



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If necessary bring back our reserves from

overseas  - and invest it in our enterprises  here

and not allow foreigners to make these profits? Of

course, in theory, this is all right. In practice,

whom do you hire and in what industry? How do  you

judge  whether that is the right line of  industry

to  put  your money in? Where you have  investors,

whether in Singapore or abroad, who are willing to

put their money in whatever industry it is, either

making



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



microphones  or  fountain pens, these  are  people

with  experience in these lines. They  think  that

there  is an opportunity to make money. They  have

the expertise, the confidence, and they do it.  If

we do not have this expertise and we go into it  - we  can  hire  management all right; we  can  hire

engineers - we may find that we have gone into the

wrong  line.  We have put in a lot of  money.  The

industry goes bankrupt. Or we may be in the  right

line and we may have hired the wrong people. It is

not  all  that easy to say that so and so, because

of his paper qualifications or because of his experience, should be able to manage the enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the difference between the Gross

Domestic  Product and the Gross National  Product,

there is something in what he says. But I think he

has  not  quite grasped this essential fact,  that

our Gross National Product, far from being smaller

than  our  Gross Domestic Product,  is,  in  fact,

larger. This is rather technical and perhaps I can

explain   the  relationship  between   the   Gross

Domestic Product and the Gross National Product in

terms   which   a   layman  can  understand.   The

difference  is, in broad terms, made  up  by  what

foreigners earn in Singapore by way of, profits on

their investments, know-how fees, technical trade-mark  arrangements and so on - what they earn  and

take  out  and what Singaporeans earn by investing

outside  Singapore. In the case of  Singapore,  we

get more earnings from our investments abroad than

the  profits we pay to foreign investors.  We  are

rather  unique  in  that respect among  developing

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards plans to offset the deflationary

impact  of reduced military expenditure, what  the

Member  for  Punggol says is quite true.  He  says

that  we should have plans in which money is spent

mostly  on projects which do not require a lot  of

imported  goods  so that most of the  money  would

then  generate income and employment. That is  the

correct  strategy.  Secondly, he  thinks  that  we

should  not  raise taxes but instead  borrow  from

abroad. I agree with this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



In  the  event  that we are faced  with  a  rather

serious  deflationary impact this year, next  year

or  the year after, the correct thing would be  to

run down our balances. In fact, I did hint at this

possibility in my Budget speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta is not very happy about the

democratic  socialist  content  of  our  policies.

Neither is the Member for Ulu Pandan. Both of them

think that the common people should have a greater

share  in  this prosperity. Of course, one  cannot

but  agree with them that the common people should

share  in this prosperity and everybody should  be

as  equal as possible. But, unfortunately, in this

world  things are not quite that way. People  have

to  be  paid according to their worth. If you  are

clever and hard-working and qualified in the right

lines,  such  as  a  lawyer or  a  surgeon  or  an

engineer, then, of course, you make more money. If

all  you  can do is to hawk vegetables,  then  you

cannot  expect to make as much money as a  surgeon

or an engineer. I do not think we can improve the

situation by just taxing the rich to pay the poor.

Many under-developed countries have done this sort

of thing and they have found to their astonishment

that, far from making everybody richer, they  have

made  everybody poorer. And the country goes  into

bankruptcy at an alarming rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to the Members for Delta and Ulu Pandan

that   the   common  people  do  share   in   this

prosperity. They share in having more than 100,000

flats, whereas before they had none. They share in

having  better  education for their children,  not

only  primary  education but  also  secondary  and

technical  education. And one hopes  that  in  the

coming decade, education in our Universities  will

be  open  to  more and more people  who  otherwise

would  not  be  able to get there. Their  children

will have more jobs. More or less 30,000 jobs will

be  created and the benefits, of course, go to the

common people.



Of  course,  the rich get richer.  I  will  not  pretend to deny that the rich do not get richer or

at least some of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



rich  do  not  get richer. This again  is  in  the

nature of things. In the upswing of a boom, if you

are in the right line, if you find oil or whatever

it  is,  you  are prosperous. You make  a  lot  of

money.  Of  course, one hopes that  the  rich  pay

taxes. We strengthen the Inland Revenue Department

with   what   I   hope  will  be   an   effective

investigation bureau so that if the  rich  do  not

pay  taxes, then they will suffer accordingly. But

here  we  are placed in a rather curious situation

and Members must always remember this: that we are

not  a  closed economy. We are the fourth  largest

port  in  the  world. Airlines come  in.  We  have

trading connections and banking services with  all

parts  of  the  world.  Therefore,  this  has  two

consequences.  Firstly,  if  we  do  not  pay  our

qualified  men  well, they will leave  and  go  to

other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of the tragedies of underdeveloped

countries  that they have been providing  some  of

the   best  brains  in  technology  to  the   rich

countries.  I was told by our Prime Minister,  who

has  done  some research in this matter, that  one

under-developed country alone- India - provides no

less  than 50,000 Ph.D.s in science and technology

to  the  western world. This is an enormous  brain

drain.  We cannot afford to do this. Being  a  big

continent,   and   having  several   hundreds   of

thousands  of Ph.D.s, a loss of 50,000 Ph.D.s  may

not be fatal to India, but we cannot afford such a

brain drain. The standards of pay which we have to

provide for our professionals, whether in business

or  in  the civil service, are determined  by  the

international rates which these people can command

in  the world. So this means that you have got  to

pay  your  qualified men well. If you do  not  pay

them  well  in the civil service, they will  leave

and   go   into  private  enterprise.  If  private

enterprise is not prepared to pay them well,  they

will  go to other countries. If we want to improve

our  industry  and  our  economy,  we  need  these

people.  We have to pay for them. That is  one  of

the  constraints under which we have to  work  and

which  nullifies this egalitarian principle  which

social democrats like to practise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect is just as bad. It is this. When

you   want  to  attract  industries,  particularly

during  the first stage of industrialisation,  you

have  to  get  people with the  know  how  or  the

entrepreneurship  or  the  technology   from   the

advanced countries - America, Japan, Europe and so

on  -  and these do not have to come to Singapore.

They compare Singapore with Hong Kong, Taiwan  and

South Korea. These are our front-line competitors.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to clarify certain points. I

feel  that the Minister has been stressing on  the

importance  of  providing sufficient  salaries  to

attract  highly qualified personnel, but this  can

be easily resolved. If we provide in our laws that

if  highly qualified personnel after having worked

here for some time should go abroad and work, then

their  citizenship  will be withdrawn.  We  would,

therefore, not experience a brain drain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that if our workers cannot enjoy

the fruits of their efforts, then all I can say is

that the Government's promises are empty promises.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we have this kind of policy,

then  it is unlikely that we shall be able to send

anybody  abroad, because once he goes  abroad,  he

will  never come back. These controls are counter-productive. They look quite simple at first sight,

but  they  have been tried by other countries  and

they just would not work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards paying our workers good rates of pay,

may I ask the Member for Delta to compare the wage

rates  in  Singapore with those paid in developing

countries?  Unfortunately, I am not in a  position

to  give chapter and verse because these countries

are  often  very sensitive and they  do  not  like

comparisons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan has a lot of

extraordinary  ideas whereby we can save  hundreds

of millions of dollars in our defence expenditure.

It is a pity that my colleague, the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



Defence, is not here. The Member says that  if  we

were to train school boys and also school girls in

the  gentle  art of war, then we do  not  have  to

spend 31 per cent of our budget on defence.



I  assure him that even if we do it, we will still

have to spend this amount of money. Modern war  is

not  fought with bows and arrows. Once you have  a

missile system, you just pay for it. A sum of  $35

million cash down, and then $10 million each year.

I  hope  the Member will go and see the  exercises

which our infantry battalions put up from time  to

time for V.I.P.s like him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Let me explain what I have said. I would like to

tell  the Minister that he has allotted a  lot  of

money on defence. Whom are we going to fight  with

missiles?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I can assure the Member for Ulu Pandan that we do

not want to fight with anybody. That is why we are

preparing for our defence. If we do not  have  any

defence,  then we can be sure that in no  time  at

all  we  will be eaten up. As I said,  the  Member

should  see the defence exercises at the Singapore

Armed  Forces  Training Institute. Every  time  he

sees  a soldier putting down a mortar bomb - I  am

told  they let fly about ten mortar bombs a minute

- he should remember that each bomb costs $60. And

we have several dozen of these soldiers letting go

with  their mortars. And this is the cheapest part

of our defence expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan thinks that we should

allow tenants of the Housing and Development Board

some  leeway in payment of rents. I am quite  sure

that  my  colleague,  the  Minister  for  Law  and

National  Development, is not a heartless  person,

and if people really want an extension of time  to

pay  rents, I am sure they will be allowed  to  do

so.  At the same time, if they cannot pay rent and

it  is obvious that they are in no position to pay

rent,  then  they have to leave. The  Housing  and

Development   Board   is   not   a   philanthropic

institution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some rather interesting

suggestions  about improving the agricultural  and

fishing  sectors. The Member for Havelock and  the

Member for Anson have put forward some ideas about

the  development of animal husbandry and  fishing.

The  Member for Anson says that we should have co-operative  societies  for  pigs  and  poultry.  If

setting  up  these co-operatives  means  that  the

farmers  will be better off, then why is  it  that

the farmers have not organised them?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> They have an association, Sir. I think the

association  is  not working well. The  Government

must  take  the initiative to form a farmers'  co-operative  society. In this way, the  farmers  can

sell  their  produce  to this society.  They  will

therefore   not  suffer  at  the  hands   of   the

middlemen.  The  middleman will  always  sell  his

goods  at  higher  prices than those  of  the  co-operative  society because he is  out  to  make  a

profit.   That   is  why  the  Government   should

encourage the formation of a farmers' co-operative

society.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member has greater confidence in the efficacy

of  Government  servants than I have.  I  remember

some  years ago fishermen organised a co-operative

society  and  they were doing quite  well  because

that  part of the fishing industry was monopolised

by  some middlemen. However, a storm broke out one

day  and their boats were swept away by the north-east  monsoon.  They  lost their  gear  and  their

boats, and they had no money. So they went to  the

Government  -  this was before our time.  At  that

time  it was not the Finance Minister who  was  in

charge, but the Financial Secretary, and he  asked

this question: "Is the storm an act of God? If  it

is  an  act  of  God, then the Government  has  no

responsibility  to  reimburse  these   fishermen."

Eventually, it was decided that the storm  was  an

act  of  God and therefore the Government  had  no

responsibility  to  pay  for  the  loss   of   the

fishermen's  boats and gear. So the fishermen  had

to go to their former dealers who used to advance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



them  money. But the dealers said. "Look, you  are

no  longer our customers. Why should we  lend  you

any money?" That was the sad end of the fishing co-operative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own belief is that so long as there is

competition  among  middlemen, then  the  farmers,

whether they are selling pigs or poultry, will get

the  best  prices. But then Singapore  is  such  a

small  place. Our communications are so  excellent

that   it   is  not  possible  for  middlemen   to

monopolise and have a grip on the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the fishing industry, here again I

really  wonder  why,  if  this  is  such  a   good

proposition,  it  has  not  flourished.  Obviously

there  must  be  some snag in  it,  otherwise  the

people will go and catch fish and make money.  Why

have  they  not  done so? I am not sure  what  the

answer is, but I am quite sure the solution is not

for  the  Government  to go into  something  which

private enterprise is not willing to engage in.  I

suspect  what  will  happen  is  that,  if,   say,

Government were to start a fishing fleet  as  they

have started the mercantile marine fleet, it would

be  very difficult to get our young men to go  out

in  these  fishing boats because they  like  shore

jobs.  I remember talking to Dr Tham Ah Kow about

getting jobs for boys on fishing vessels. After  a

lot of work, he managed to get some of our boys on

this  fishing  fleet. But after one journey,  they

all  packed  up and said, "We have had  enough  of

it." So obviously this is not an industry on which

we should risk the taxpayer's money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised a point about health

services  for aided-school teachers. My colleague,

the Minister for Education, will look into what he

has said. I remember vaguely that this subject was

raised some months ago, and we came to a decision;

but I cannot recollect what it was.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Bras Basah made some

interesting  contribution to  the  debate.  He  is

quite  correct,  of  course, in  saying  that  the

increase in pioneer industries in 1969 was due  to

the  growth of labour-intensive industries, A  lot

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



the  new electronic firms were established in  the

last one and a half years. This accounted for  the

very substantial increase in the number of workers

in pioneer industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also right in saying that the growth of

cargo has been greatest in the oil business.  This

is  accounted  for by the rapid expansion  in  oil

refineries in the Republic, as oil seems to be and

probably is now the No. I entrepot trade product.



I  also  agree  with him that health  services  in

schools  should be improved. In fact, the Minister

for Education, the Minister for Health, and I have

agreed  that  we should provide more  doctors  and

more dentists for school children. Of course,  one

hopes that this service will improve as time  goes

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the point about 4,800

skilled   and   semi-skilled   workers   in    the

unemployment register of the Ministry of Labour. I

suspect that these 4,800 names are really bogus so

far  as  unemployment goes. They  are  either  not

skilled, or they are not unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Perhaps they are looking for better jobs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, they are probably looking for better jobs. It

is  either that, or they are really lazy,  or  too

choosey.  There  is  no  reason  for  them  to  be

unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for industrial accidents. I certainly agree

with what the Member has said. This is, of course,

the  problem  of  my colleague, the  Minister  for

Labour.  The  Minister  wants  more  staff,   more

expertise,  or  whatever it  is,  to  handle  this

subject.  This  problem is  of  great  concern  to

everybody, because having trained workers at great

expense  and  then just to have them  put  out  of

action  through accidents is, I think, a monstrous

waste of resources which we cannot afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of

the  Government for the financial year 1st  April,

1970 to 31st March, 1971.
