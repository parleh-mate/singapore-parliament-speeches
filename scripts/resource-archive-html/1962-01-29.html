without  the Internal Security Council  were  to  be

accepted  by  this  House.  However,  after  merger,

defence and external affairs will be in the hands of

the  Government of the Federation of  Malaysia,  and

the elected government of the people of Malaysia can

decide  what  is  in the best defence  interests  of

Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the White

Paper  on  Merger setting out the Heads of Agreement

between  the  Federation  of  Malaya  and  Singapore

(Command Paper 33 of 1961) which was passed, without

dissent,   by  the  Legislative  Assembly   on   6th

December,   1961,  allows  for  local  autonomy   in

education for Singapore, and therefore the  position

of  Nanyang University is not in any way affected by

the merger proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson is doubtless aware that under

the  Barisan  Sosialis proposal  for  the  so-called

"complete



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



merger", which he supports, the Singapore Government

must treat Nanyang University in the same manner  as

the  Federation Government does. If education is not

a  subject  of  local autonomy,  there  will  be  no

question of recognising Nanyang University or  doing

anything  to  assist  it until it  conforms  to  the

national education policy. Even the bursaries we now

pay to Singapore students at Nanyang University will

have to cease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it difficult to reconcile the Member for

Anson's apparent concern for Nanyang University with

his support for a type of merger which means Nanyang

University will have to comply with the Rahman Talib

Report  or not to be supported at all and  so  upset

Chinese educationists in general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 31st October, 1961, in the Speech of the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara, Hansard, Vol. 15, No.  1, column

22,  mention was made of Nanyang University  in  the

following words:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government is as anxious as the founders of

Nanyang  University  that the University  should  be

reorganised.  Towards this end, a liaison  committee

comprising representatives of the Government and the

University  held  several  meetings  last  year   to

discuss   ways   and   means  of  implementing   the

recommendations  made  by  the  Nanyang   University

Review  Committee.  Although no agreement  has  been

reached  by  the liaison committee, nonetheless  the

Government is always ready to negotiate and  discuss

this  matter. There are hopes that this problem will

be solved in the coming year.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27th November last, at a dinner given by the

Prime Minister to the President and 9 members of the

Chinese  Chamber of Commerce which included Mr  Tan

Lark  Sye, discussions were held on the arrangements

for  local  autonomy on education and labour,  trade

and  commerce, language and citizenship.  The  Prime

Minister then suggested to Mr Tan that there should

be  agreement between the present Council of Nanyang

University and the Ministry of Education as soon  as

possible  before  July  or  August  1962   so   that

provisions could be included in the budget for 1963.

Mr  Tan  Lark Sye suggested, with the other members

of the Chamber of Commerce present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



agreeing, that the matter could be left to  informal

discussions between a member of the Chamber  present

who   was   named,  and  Mr  Lee  Khoon  Choy,   my

Parliamentary Secretary, who was also  a  Government

representative   in  the  Liaison  Committee   which

carried  out discussions with the Nanyang University

Council in 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the outstanding matters before agreement

can be reached is the question of representation  in

the new University Council. The Government stand  is

that  the  balance of representation in the  Council

would  and  should  leave academic policy  decisions

with   the   academicians  and   teachers   in   the

University,  whereas the proposals  of  the  present

Nanyang University authorities meant that all policy

decisions both academic and otherwise should be with

the merchants who first sponsored the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government was and is of the view that,

although  the  public-spiritedness and  interest  in

education  of  our Chinese merchants deserve  praise

for  having  helped  to create  Nanyang  University,

merchants  and  businessmen are not necessarily  the

best   qualified  people  to  decide  academic   and

educational matters involved in the running  of  the

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is prepared to discuss all details,

including annual grants by the Government to Nanyang

University, in accordance with the principles of the

Gwee  Ah  Leng  Review Committee's Report.  In  this

connection,  Dr  Gwee Ah Leng has  referred  me  to

reports published in both the Nanyang Siang Pau  and

the  Sin  Chew  Jit  Poh dated 27th  January,  1962,

attributed to Mr Tan Lark Sye at a dinner speech of

the  Chinese Chamber of Commerce held at the  Ee  Ho

Hean  Club on 26th. January in which Mr Tan alleged

that  Dr  Gwee had to amend his report three  times

because  the Government was not satisfied  with  it.

Dr  Gwee informed me that he had written to Mr Tan

Lark  Sye by registered post, asking him to  correct

this    unfounded   statement.   With   Dr   Gwee's

permission, I wish to table a photostat copy of  his

letter in Chinese.

  `Chairman Tan,



  I  have read in a report in the Nanyang Siang  Pau

of   27th   instant  of  your  speech  on   Nanyang

University at the dinner in Ee Ho Hean Club.  There

is  some  misunderstanding which I  would  like  to

clarify.  The amendments to the draft  report  were

necessary to arrive at a Unanimous decision. It  is

not  as  you  say  because the Government  was  not

satisfied with it. As far as I can remember I  have

never  expressed to you my regrets in  this  matter

as  far  as the Nanyang University is concerned.  I

am  not concerned with this personally, but I think

the  public should not be confused. That is  why  I

have  raised this matter and hope appropriate steps

will be taken to correct this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Original Question, as amended,

was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, in pursuance of the national objective of a

united Malayan nation, enlarged and strengthened  by

the   addition  of  our  brothers  in   the   Borneo

territories,  this  House declares  its  support  in

principle  for  the  plan  proposed  by  the   Prime

Minister  of  the Federation of Malaya, Tunku  Abdul

Rahman  Putra Al-Haj, and agreed to in principle  in

the Federation Parliament on 18th October, 1961, for

the  establishment  of the Federation  of  Malaysia,

comprising   the  eleven  States  of   the   present

Federation,  the State of Singapore and Brunei,  and

the territories of Sarawak and North Borneo.".



<br><br>Since which amendments have been proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 4, to leave out "plan" and insert

"motion":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 6, to leave out "in principle".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the word 'plan' proposed to

be  left out, be left out." As has been said before,

the  debate may range over both amendments  and  the

Original Question, as amended.

<br><br>2.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  the  House rose on Friday evening, I had  just

addressed  it  for  about  three  or  four  minutes.

Perhaps,  Sir, if you will allow me to  recapitulate

shortly what I had mentioned to the House in  a  few

words and then proceed from there, so that my speech

might then he received in proper perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first motion on merger with the

Federation  was discussed. I got the impression,  as

my  colleagues also did, that so far as the  Barisan

Sosialis  were  concerned, they  were  all  for  the

Malaysian concept as outlined by the Tunku. In fact,

the  whole  outcry  from the Barisan  Sosialis  side

against   the   Tunku,  insofar  as  Singapore   was

concerned, was that Singapore was not being  treated

in  the  same  way that the Borneo territories  were

being treated. It appeared from their side that  the

Tunku  had  offered  to bring in  the  three  Borneo

territories  as  three additional  States  into  the

Federation on an equal footing, shall we  say,  with

Johore  or Selangor or with any other State  in  the

Federation.  They also said that if only  the  Tunku

made  all  the Singapore citizens Federal  citizens,

they  would  be quite happy to go in as the  twelfth

State.  In fact, the whole outcry against the  Tunku

was  that  Singapore would not be made  the  twelfth

State.  Now  if that is the correct appreciation  of

the  main  line  on  which the Barisan  opposed  the

merger   proposals,  I,  at  the  moment,   do   not

understand  the line taken by them on  the  Malaysia

motion. I believe we started to debate the motion on

merger  with  the Federation on 17th  November  last

year  which lasted for two or three weeks. But since

then,  it would appear that the point of attack  has

changed.  The point of attack now is not  about  the

Borneo   territories  coming  in  as  the   twelfth,

thirteenth  and fourteenth States. It is  that  they

are  not being allowed to have a say in whether they

should  be  part of Malaysia or whether they  should

stay  out;  whether  or not the first  step  in  the

Malaysia proposals should not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



be  independence for each of these territories, then

an  understanding  between the three  of  them,  and

finally  their  coming into the  Malaysia  proposals

after that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it seems fairly clear now - to me

anyway, Mr Speaker - that there has been a change  of

front  insofar as the Barisan Sosialis are concerned

on  Malaysia. I got the impression, from  the  first

debate,  that they were all for Malaysia.  But  that

what is objectionable in the Malaysia proposals  was

the  status  that was being given to  Singapore  and

that Singapore citizens were going to become second-class citizens. Now the point of attack is something

quite  different. I was listening  to  a  number  of

Barisan  Sosialis Members speaking in the hope  that

they  would explain to the House why this change  of

attitude had taken place since the conclusion of the

debate on the merger with the Federation motion  and

the  commencement  of this debate  on  the  Malaysia

motion. I think it was the Minister for Culture  who

suggested to the Barisan Sosialis that the change of

front  was  because  the Barisan  Sosialis  are  not

following  a line of their own, and that their  line

is   being  dictated  to  them  by  forces   outside

Singapore and forces with which Singapore should not

be concerned at all. It has since been denied by the

Barisan  that  that is so. But the  facts  point  to

this,  that  during  the course of  the  West  Irian

debate, the Member for Thomson said that Malaysia is

an anti-Indonesian move. That idea was not mentioned

during  the debate on the original motion on  merger

with  the  Federation. Although  Malaysia  had  been

touched upon  - not at length, of course, Mr Speaker,

Sir;  the principle of it had been touched  upon  in

the first debate  - there was never any suggestion  by

any  of  the  speakers  on  the  Barisan  side  that

Malaysia  was an anti-Indonesian move.  Now  I,  for

myself,  fail to understand how the Barisan Sosialis

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- particularly the Member for Thomson - could have said

that   it  was  an  anti-Indonesian  move  when   my

understanding of the Malaysia proposals was that  it

had  the  blessing of the Indonesian  Government.  I

believe the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



Foreign  Minister  of Indonesia  has  stated  in  no

uncertain   terms  that  insofar  as  the   Malaysia

proposals   are   concerned,   Indonesia   has    no

objections.  Now  if  that is the  attitude  of  the

Indonesian Government, Mr Speaker, Sir, where  then

does  the Member for Thomson get the idea that  this

is  an  anti-Indonesian move? It seems  to  me  that

there  is something in what the Minister for Culture

has been accusing the Barisan of, that this new line

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis, that this  is  an  anti-Indonesian  move, is a line which is being  dictated

from  somebody  outside Singapore and not  connected

with  the Indonesian Government as a Government.  In

view  of the article which appeared sometime ago  in

the  Straits Tunes and which set out the line of the

Communist  Party in Indonesia, and in  view  of  the

statement  made by the Member for Thomson subsequent

to that, I get the impression  - unless they are going

to  deny it with rational statement that that is not

so -   that  they are following the line  set  by  the

Communist Party in Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I hope for the sake of Singapore that

it  is  nonsense. I was waiting for the  Member  for

Thomson,  when he made his speech on Friday evening,

to  deny  that  statement. You will  recollect,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that when the Member for Anson  moved

his  amendment,  he  did call upon  the  Member  for

Thomson to give some explanation for that statement.

I thought the Member for Thomson in his speech would

make  some reference to that and try to explain  it,

because  I  think it is important for the people  of

Singapore to know whether this is an anti-Indonesian

move  or not. If the Indonesian Government says that

it  is not an anti-Indonesian move, why then are the

Barisan Sosialis worried about it? Surely it is  the

people  of  Singapore who elected them and  not  the

people  of Indonesia. Our main interest is  to  find

out   first  whether  the  Malaysia  proposals   are

something  good for Singapore. After that we  should

consider   whether  it  is  good  for  the   Bornean

territories   or  whether  it  is   good   for   the

Federation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



I    would    have   thought   that,   as    elected

representatives  of  the people  of  Singapore,  our

first   duty   was  to  the  people  of   Singapore,

afterwards to the Federation, and afterwards to  the

Borneo  territories, and last of all  to  Indonesia.

But the point of attack in the Malaysia debate seems

to  me that the Barisan Sosialis are more interested

than  the  people  of  Singapore  are  in  what  the

Communist   Party  in  Indonesia  think  about   the

Malaysia  proposals. They are open to that criticism

because  of  the statements made by the  Member  for

Thomson and because he has not taken the trouble  to

deny it or explain it in any way to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to put this

proposition to the Barisan Sosialis and  what  their

attitude  would  be on it. Sir, the Tunku  has  said

that  he  is not going to have Singapore  enter  the

Federation  unless  and  until  the  three   Bornean

territories  come in at the same time. He  has  said

that most categorically, and he has not departed one

iota from that statement. But the Tunku has not said

that  if  the three Borneo territories agree  to  go

with   the  Federation  and  become  part   of   the

Federation, he will not take them without Singapore.

So  there  is  this possibility that if  the  Borneo

territories  agree to become part of the  Federation

as  the  twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth  States,

and  if  we lost on the referendum which God  forbid

them - we  might  reach  a position  where  the  three

States  in  Borneo become part of the  Federation - if

not   as  the  twelfth,  thirteenth  and  fourteenth

States, then at least on some other arrangement with

the  Federation - and with Singapore  staying  out  of

this  arrangement  as  an  active  opponent  of  the

Malaysian  concept. If that happened,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  I  ask  my friends in the Barisan Sosialis  to

think  of  the  pretty pickle Singapore  would  find

itself  in.  And  if  there is no  merger  or  close

understanding  or anything else with the  Federation

as  a result of a refusal on the referendum, I think

that  slowly  but surely the pressure  on  Singapore

will be applied and it will find itself isolated. In

those circumstances, what solution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



has  the Barisan Sosialis for Singapore? Do we  then

say  that we get the Internal Security Council  away

from  the  British and the Federation, keep internal

security  with the Singapore Government,  and  allow

the  British to continue to run the foreign  affairs

and  defence  of  Singapore?  Is  that  a  practical

possibility, Mr Speaker, Sir? Do they know  whether

the  British will agree to that? It is all very well

saying,  "Let the British defend us. Let the British

run  our  foreign  affairs."  But  can  the  Barisan

Sosialis give any assurance to the House that, under

the  conditions which I have just outlined  to  you,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the British  will  continue  to

remain here? I do not think the British will. If the

British  are not going to remain here, who then  are

going to look after our foreign affairs and defence?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The P.K.I.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do not think the Indonesians want to

be mixed up with us. Now where do you go from there,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir? [Interruption] No, Mr  Speaker,

the whole thing is impossible. And when one analyses

the arguments put forward by the Barisan Sosialis on

the  merger proposals with the Federation,  and  one

applies  the  basis  of  those  arguments   to   the

arguments   which   they  use  on   these   Malaysia

proposals, they conflict and cannot be reconciled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one gets the idea, therefore, that they are

not  being true to themselves in their arguments  on

this  issue  that  is  if  they  had  been  true  to

themselves in their arguments on the debate  on  the

merger  proposals. Now if there is this  falsity  of

arguments on these two issues, I think one must find

out  what  has  caused this falsity of arguments.  I

think  the Minister for Culture has a point when  he

urges  upon  the  House  that  the  reason  for  the

difficulties  in  which  the Barisan  Sosialis  find

themselves  at  the  moment is  not  that  they  are

following  a  line of their own, but that  they  are

following  a line which someone else is setting  for

them. The Minister for Culture is suggesting to them

that  it  is  being sent by the Communist  Party  in

Indonesia. Unless I hear anything further



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



on  this  from  the  Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  I myself will be inclined to  agree  with

the Minister for Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a further attack was made on the

Tunku  regarding the Commission that was  being  set

up,  that  he was doing this without consulting  the

Borneo  people. Sir, surely the whole point  of  the

Commission  is to ascertain the views of the  people

in  the  three territories of Borneo. I take it  the

Commission   will  sit  in  each  of   these   three

territories.  The  Prime Minister knows  more  about

this than he would probably tell the House. But what

I  expect,  and what would be the normal  procedure,

would be that the Commission goes from territory  to

territory  ascertaining the views of the  people  of

the  Borneo  territories and, on those  views,  they

will present the Commission's Report. So I really do

not  understand why the Barisan Sosialis should  say

that  the  Tunku is trying to rig the Commission  in

order  that it might give him a favourable  verdict.

What  the  Tunku has done, as I understand  it,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  is  that he has  given  the  Bornean

territories the maximum which Singapore is asking of

him.  Now if the Borneo territories do not want  the

maximum but they want something less, I feel certain

the  Tunku will accommodate them if that is the wish

of the Borneo people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are the Barisan Sosialis worried about?

Why  do  they  talk about elections first?  "Let  us

first have the three territories come in as one unit

before  we  have  a  Malaysia merger."  Surely,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, anybody knows that those proposals, if

carried  out, will take at least another ten  years.

The  Member for Cairnhill says more. Probably he  is

right, but I say at least ten years. Can we wait for

another  ten  years? Can Singapore wait for  another

ten  years? Speaking for Singapore. I say we  cannot

wait. I do not know about the Bornean territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, when there

was   a  Regional  Conference  of  the  Commonwealth

Parliamentary Association of which you were Chairman,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



I  urged upon the conference the necessity  to

get  together quickly. That was sometime in July  or

August  last year. I then urged upon the  conference

that the position of Singapore was such that it  was

Singapore  that wished the getting together  quicker

than  any other part of this area which is now being

called Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I say to Members of the Barisan Sosialis: let

us  look after our own interests first, and think of

somebody else's afterwards. Our interests are  such,

economically,  politically and every  other  way  in

which  this  Island is concerned,  that  the  coming

together  with the Federation and the  three  Borneo

territories is vital to our survival. Therefore, let

us  get  on  with  it.  Let the Bornean  territories

decide what is best' for them and let the Commission

help them decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it was curious that when the West Irian motion was being discussed - a matter which did not really concern the vital interests of Singapore - the P.A.P. Government, the Barisan Sosialis, the U.P.P. (who all originally started off in this House as P.A.P. Members) reached agreement on something which did not really concern Singapore. But on

matters  which  vitally concern our  existence  they

were  fighting  like cats and dogs, except  for  the

U.P.P.,  of  course, who agreed. But so far  as  the

Barisan  are concerned, they disagreed. I  think  we

have  reached  a stage in this House  where  if  the

P.A.P. were to say something is white, the  Barisan

are  going  to say that it is black; and  where  the

Barisan  were to say it is yellow, the P.A.P. would

say  it  is red. I think it is a great pity we  have

reached   this  stage  on  a  motion   of   national

importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recollect another

Barisan Sosialis Member saying, "We do not like this

because  this  is something the P.A.P. has  brought

about."  That is one of the reasons given.  Now,  is

that a valid, substantial reason on a national issue

such  as this? It is the good fortune of the  P.A.P.

to  be  the Government of the country at a  time  in

history  when merger is becoming possible. But  that

is  their  good fortune and it is not  due  to  them

entirely.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



It  is  the  historical sequence of events  that  is

bringing  merger about and it is their good  fortune

to be at the right place at the right time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I tell my friends in the Barisan

Sosialis:  it is not a P.A.P. merger; it  is  not  a

P.A.P.  Malaysia. It is Malaysia as we all think  it

should  be;  that all these five territories  should

come  together.  We have been told how  we  will  be

accepted into the Federation. The Tunku has told the

Bornean territories that he will accept them as  the

twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth States,  if  they

do  not  want  it,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  think  the

Commission will say so together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point they make, Sir, is a very

interesting  one. They say they are not  Communists.

They say they are not interested in a Communist form

of government. They say they Want democracy. When we

in Singapore talk about democracy, we talk about the

parliamentary   form   of  democracy,   not   guided

democracy or any other type of democracy.  Now,  one

of  the  arguments  that the  Barisan  Sosialis  put

forward  against Malaysia is this: that the Alliance

Government  is  a  Right-wing government;  that  the

Alliance  Government  is  a reactionary  government;

that the Alliance Government is this, that, and  the

other. If the Barisan Sosialis genuinely believe  in

a  democratic form of government, there will  always

be a Right and a Left. They are all on the Left, and

the  Alliance is on the Right. Because the  Alliance

is  on  the Right, and the people have put  them  in

power,  therefore,  they are in  power  rightly.  It

seems to me. Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Barisan  are

not  at all against Malaysia; really speaking,  they

want  Malaysia.  It  appears  to  me  that  had  the

Socialist Front in the Federation been in  power  at

the  moment,  there would not have been this  20-day

debate over these two topics in this House. So  what

the Barisan are really saying is that they will only

agree to a Malaysia or to a coming together with the

Federation  only when a Left-wing government  is  in

power in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



the Federation. That seems to be the whole point  of

the   attack.   If  they  really   believed   in   a

parliamentary form of government, they should  agree

to what is right for this whole area, and after that

convince the people that a Right-wing Government  is

not  in  the best interests of the whole  area,  and

that  it  is a Left-wing government that will  bring

prosperity to this Island, to the Federation, and to

the  three  Borneo  territories. That  is  how  they

should do it if they were genuinely interested in  a

parliamentary  form of democracy. But  as  they  are

not,  it  does appear to me that when they say,  "We

are  democrats," they are merely giving lip  service

to  it at the moment because they cannot do anything

else now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to touch on

anything  else on this debate. It has  gone  on  for

three or four days now. Everything that can be  said

about it has been said, and I do not wish to take up

any  more time of the House. But I do say this: that

in this debate, let us think of Singapore first, and

let  us  think of the Federation afterwards. Let  us

think of the three Borneo territories next, and  let

us forget Indonesia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir from the speeches given by Members  of,

the  House  over  the last week, we  discover  three

different stands on Malaysia. These three stands are

as  follows.  First  is  the  stand  of  the  P.A.P.

together  with the Alliance. They are in support  of

the  Malaysia  concept as planned by the  Federation

Government. Second is that of the Barisan  Sosialis.

They  oppose  this  Malaysia  concept  without   any

principles  whatsoever. They  are  blindly  opposing

this  Malaysia plan as brought up and  suggested  by

the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> On a point of

clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> The Member for Punggol says that

the  Barisan  Sosialis are against  the  concept  of

Malaysia.  In  fact,  we agree  to  the  concept  of

Malaysia, but it is the plan that we are against.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Make

up your mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  do  not know theories which are always their  own

theories.  I do not want to argue with them  further

in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all the unprincipled opposition to the concept

of   Malaysia  and  the  plan  as  proposed  by  the

Federation Government is the second stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third stand is that of the U.P.P. together

with  the  Workers' Party in support of the Malaysia

concept but against the Malaysia plan as proposed by

the   Federation  Government.  Mr   Speaker,   Sir,

geographically, economically, culturally, Singapore,

and  Malaya  together  with the  Borneo  territories

belong  to  the same family, just the  same  as  its

peoples.  The  peoples have common cultures,  common

races  and use a common currency. They have  similar

religions,  they  have a common mode  of  life,  and

their  separation  has  been brought  about  as  the

result  of  colonial rule. This  separation  of  the

peoples in these five territories is a result of the

divide-and-rule policy of the colonialists. By  this

policy,  the colonialists could exploit the  peoples

of  these five territories, and, therefore, in  this

pant of the world, when colonialism is dying out, we

can  say  that  the peoples of the five  territories

must gel together and rally under one flag to oppose

their  common enemy. In this way we will be able  to

go forward with history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is the greatest producer of rubber and

tin in the world. In Borneo there is a great deal of

natural resources waiting for the people to tap.  In

Singapore we have many trained personnel and skilled

workers.  In addition, we have a very good port  and

harbour facilities. In fact, we are the fifth  great

port  in  the  world.  If the peoples  in  the  five

territories  can unite together, then they  will  be

able to make full use of their natural resources and

their  skilled  labour in order  to  bring  about  a

better  future for the 10 million people  living  in

this  area.  That  is why we of the  U.P.P. are  in

support of the Malaysia concept,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



because  this should be the natural development  for

this area. Unfortunately, it is disappointing for us

to  note that during the debate on Malaysia in  this

House  and  in the Federation Parliament, there  was

opposition  to  the  concept of  Malaysia  from  the

Barisan Sosialis and the P.M.I.P. We and the  P.A.P.

are  quite different in our stands in this  respect.

Although  we  support the Malaysia concept,  we  are

against the plan of the Federation of Malaya. We are

opposed  to the merger proposals in the White  Paper

because  we  believe that the peoples  of  the  five

territories should have a common citizenship so that

they  will  be able to visit one another freely  and

they  will also be able to live in the same  family.

Moreover, they can look for jobs in any of the  five

territories without any restrictions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, last Thursday, I read in the

newspapers a report of the speech made by the Member

for  Changi  in which he criticised the  U.P.P. for

giving  support to the P.A.P.'s motion. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this  is a very serious criticism.  I  do  not

understand on what basis our friends in the  Barisan

Sosialis  made  the statement that we are  assisting

the P.A.P. in deceiving the people of Singapore.  We

can  proudly tell the world that when my  colleague,

the  Member for Hong Lim, left this House  and  then

reentered it again when he was re-elected,  he  went

in  on  a  majority of about 4,000  votes  from  the

people.   So  when  the  Barisan  Sosialis  Members,

without principles, oppose the Malaysia concept,  we

cannot   but  feel  very  dissatisfied  with   their

attitude. We thank them, of course, for reminding us

not  to fall into the trap of the P.A.P. But I  will

tell the Barisan Sosialis Members that the political

stand  of the U.P.P. cannot be influenced by anybody

at all. It is because of the firm political stand of

the U.P.P. that we were able to campaign and win our

struggle  with the P.A.P. it is because of our  firm

political stand that we were able to survive in  the

Hong Lim by-election. It is also because of our firm

political  stand that we are now unlike  the  P.A.P.

leadership. We left the P.A.P. because we believe in

our political stand. We are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



not  like  the  Members of the Barisan Sosialis  who

only  left the P.A.P. at a time when the P.A.P. ship

was  about  to  sink. The Hong Lim Resolutions  were

brought out because of our stand. The Members of the

U.P.P. never change their political stand as  other

political opportunists do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Hong Lim by-election, the people in the

Barisan Sosialis praised our Prime Minister. But all

of  a  sudden,  and almost overnight,  they  changed

their  stand. They now call themselves  the  friends

and  heroes of the people. I believe that if victory

in  the  by-election had gone to Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew,

then these people in the Barisan Sosialis would have

remained in the P.A.P. Government even up till  now.

They would still have been with Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the Malaysia concept,

I  beg  your  permission to  draw  an  analogy.  For

example,  if  you intend to have only two  children,

and because of failure in birth control, you have  a

third child, then -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Speaker would far

rather prefer that the simile be applied to somebody

else!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  that  case, I shall give an example  of  another

person.  Let us suppose that a person wants to  have

only  two  children. But unfortunately  because  the

birth-control  is  not effective,  he  has  a  third

child.  In that event, should he then give away  the

third  child  together with  the  first  two?  In  a

similar  way,  support for the Malaysia  concept  is

just  like  the analogy of having two children.  The

Barisan Sosialis say they want to have two children.

But  when they are going to have a third child, they

say  the  two children already born should be  given

away, together with the unwanted third child. Let me

remind  them that the Malaysia concept is one thing,

but  the  Malaysia plan is quite another  thing.  We

must  see  clearly the object of our opposition  and

our objections.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Anson moved an amendment to

the original motion, what he wanted to do was to ask

the  House  to  support unanimously the  concept  of

Malaysia.  His attitude is correct. That is  why  he

has  our support. But what we heard from the Barisan

is  the  concept  of  Greater Malaysia  which  would

include Indonesia, Singapore, the Borneo territories

and the Federation. We never deny that Indonesia  is

our friend and a good neighbour. We should always be

friendly towards Indonesia and regard it as our  own

brother.  To he friendly is one thing, but to  merge

with Indonesia is another thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China and Russia are just like America and

Britain.  They are very friendly. But  it  does  not

mean  that  two  countries  should  merge.  Although

politically,  economically and culturally  Indonesia

has  many  things in common with us, there are  some

differences.   Therefore,  we  cannot   merge   with

Indonesia. Let me tell my Barisan friends again that

we   cannot   by   ourselves  bring  prosperity   to

Singapore,  and  we hope that they  will  not  bring

disaster to Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  Malaysia  offers to the people  of  Singapore.

Sarawak, Borneo. Brunei and Malaya a great future, a

future    full   of   opportunities   and    immense

potentialities. Therefore, it is desirable and vital

that these opportunities should not be lost and that

the  creation of Malaysia be realised without delay.

When  established, Malaysia will  be  a  stabilising

force  in South-East Asia. We in Singapore are  very

fortunate to occupy an advantageous position, and we

will have an important role to play in the future of

Malaysia.  The  main opposition to  the  concept  of

Malaysia  within and outside these five  territories

has  been Communist-inspired. In Singapore and  here

in   this   Chamber,  the  Barisan   Sosialis   have

championed  the  Communist  cause.  They  say   that

Malaysia is British-sponsored and supported  by  the

Tunku. What is wrong with it?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



They say it is anti-Indonesia and is detrimental  to

the  advancement of our people. The  truth  is  that

Malaysia will be a setback to the Communists. It  is

for  this  reason that they and the Barisan Sosialis

have  opposed  it  bitterly for  their  own  selfish

interest.  When Malaysia is firmly established,  the

Communists  and their followers will have  no  place

and   no  chance  to  advance  their  interest   and

ideology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Barisan Sosialis have repeatedly

criticised   the   Government  Front   Benches   for

supporting merger and Malaysia, saying that they  do

so  in order to satisfy their own interest, which is

to remain in power. For the benefit of everyone, let

me  state  clearly here that none of the  26  P.A.P.

Members  who have remained loyal to the  people  who

have  elected  them to this Chamber  would  wish  to

remain  here longer than is necessary,  and  for  no

other  reason than our firm conviction that Malaysia

is  in the interest of our people. We would like  to

see  merger  and  Malaysia through to  a  successful

conclusion.  It is our duty to see that  mischievous

people  like  the Barisan Sosialis do not  have  the

chance to wreck it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments of Members of the Barisan Sosialis

are  most childish and absurd. They accuse the Prime

Minister and other Ministers of wanting to remain in

power,  and  that  is the reason  why  they  support

merger  and Malaysia. Why should the Prime  Minister

and  other  Ministers  face all  the  unpleasantness

created  by the Barisan Sosialis and their Communist

masters just to support merger and Malaysia?  If  it

is  true  that they are power crazy, would they  not

take  the  easiest way out like the 13  Members  who

have  defected and formed the Barisan Sosialis,  and

succumb  to  the demands of the six trade unionists?

Then  all  would  be well. Then there  would  be  no

Barisan Sosialis today and the 13 Members would  not

have  crossed  the Floor. Fortunately, Mr  Speaker,

Sir, I am glad the Ministerial Front Benches are not

men made of straw who would break so easily.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis and their Communist masters

oppose Malaysia. But what is their alternative? They

say, let the peoples of the three Borneo territories

have  self-determination first  and  then  they  can

decide   for   themselves.  In  the  meantime,   the

Communists can advance their ideology and  interests

in   these   territories.  We  can  appreciate   and

understand the anxiety of the peoples in the  Borneo

territories  in wanting time to make up their  minds

and so prepare themselves for the role they have  to

play  in Malaysia. To those of us who have been over

to  the Borneo territories, we know that the peoples

there  are  not accustomed to the fast pace  we  are

used to here. But I am sure they do not realise  the

danger awaiting them. It is on this pretext that the

Communists  have strongly championed  the  cause  of

self-determination for their own selfish interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the ordinary man in the street

or in the coffee-shop would like to know what merger

and  Malaysia mean. Do these affect their lives  and

their  livelihood? Through Malaysia the  peoples  of

these  five territories will be integrated into  one

common political unit and share a common destiny. We

have  strong historical, cultural and economic  ties

which  make  us fit in as a group. When  the  people

cried  for  merdeka, the British cunningly separated

us in their own interests. The time has now come for

us  to  reunite  into  one political  unit  for  the

advancement of our own peoples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia will accelerate the economic and rural

development  and  educational  advancement  of   the

Borneo territories. Most of our public services  are

at  present operated on a Pan Malayan/Borneo  basis,

the  agreements on which will have to  be  concluded

with  the  consent  of  all five  Governments.  With

Malaysia  under  a  strong Central Government,  this

will  help  to  improve  and expand  public  utility

services. Travel facilities can be made easier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis say that Malaysia is neo-colonialism and will not give the people economic

freedom.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



Economic  freedom can only be successfully  achieved

after   achieving  political  freedom  through   the

democratic socialist system by a continuous struggle

against   those  with  economic  power  and  without

dislocating  the  economy  of  the  people.  Do  the

Barisan Sosialis believe in the democratic socialist

system,  or  are they advocating a Communist  system

for Malaysia?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Malaysia is a constructive

approach to the unity and well-being of our peoples.

I fully endorse it.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, in debating the Greater Malaysia Plan,

my  Party's  Chairman,  the Member  for  Queenstown,

Comrade  Lee  Siew  Choh, has clearly  analysed  the

advantages  and disadvantages of the  Plan  for  the

people. After the analysis we have made, what he has

said  is  true. This Plan will not be beneficial  to

the  people of Singapore. We have dealt a heavy blow

to  the  P.A.P. From speeches made by the Ministers,

we  can  see that they are not analysing the problem

of  Greater  Malaysia. They have always accused  us,

the  Barisan  Sosialis, of being  Communist-inspired

and  stooges  of  the Communists. So  they  are  not

analysing  the problems, hut are only  accusing  us.

This  method  is  meant to confuse and  mislead  the

people on this issue and to silence them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the P.A.P. leadership has forgotten, that

in  1948,  the  colonial government  used  the  same

tactics of abusing and criticising those who opposed

colonial  rule. They even arrested the people.  What

was  the result? They could not suppress the  people

of  Singapore forever. As a result, there came  into

being the Rendel Constitution. We are not forgetful.

Under the Rendel Constitution, the puppet government

of Lim Yew Hock used the same tactics and methods to

criticise their political opponents and suppress the

progressive  organisations.  They  came  to  a  very

disastrous end. The P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



leadership are using the same tactics to  accuse  us

of  many  things,  but the people will  not  believe

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every street corner in Singapore, we see the

P.A.P. are  putting  up  bunting  and  posters  for

Malaysia  Week. They are carrying out  a  propaganda

campaign to stir up the people and win them over  to

their  side. The P.A.P. have been carrying out  this

line  of  propaganda for quite some time.  They  are

using  this  as  a political panacea to  save  their

political  future. They are now putting  up  bunting

and  decorations in every street and every  building

in  conjunction  with Malaysia Week,  thinking  that

they  can  make the people believe that  the  future

Malaysia  will be as beautiful as these decorations.

They  hope  the people can be trapped  by  all  this

outward   manifestation  and  propaganda.  If   this

Malaysia  Plan is in the interest of the people,  it

needs  no propaganda to sell it. A plan that  is  in

the  interest  of  the people and is  good  for  the

welfare  of  the State needs no slogans, dramas  and

stage  plays  to sell it. These things  are  only  a

waste of time, energy and money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can all remember that the

Malaysia concept was first mooted by the progressive

Left-wing  people.  The  original  Malaysia  concept

included Malaya, Singapore, the Borncan territories,

Indonesia  and the Philippines. Its purpose  was  to

oppose  Western colonial exploitation  and  rule  in

this  area, to strengthen and consolidate the people

of  South-East  Asia against colonial  rule  and  to

promote a world-wide anti-colonial movement,  so  as

to  contribute  part of its strength  to  the  world

movement against colonialism. But all this could not

be  achieved under the present Malaysia Plan,  which

is   in  the  interest  of  the  colonialists.  This

Malaysia  Plan will consolidate the colonial  forces

and spread the Right- wing reactionary influence  in

these five territories in order to suppress the anti-colonial  movement and struggle. At the  same  time,

the Right-wing colonial forces, under the protection

of  the colonialists, will be able to continue their

control  of  these  five territories,  so  that  the

colonial master can hide behind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



the  Right-wing stooges and direct them to  continue

to  exploit the people of these territories  and  to

continue their colonial rule in this area. Thus  the

British colonialists can have their vested interests

in this area preserved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the beginning of this

year, the anti-colonial forces are mounting in these

territories.  For  example,  the  people  have  been

fighting  for the liberation of West Irian and  Goa.

This  shows  the mounting force of anti-colonialism.

This  also shows that the people under colonial rule

want  to  free themselves. We can see that  even  in

territories  like Brunei and Sarawak the  forces  of

anti-colonialism are still increasing. Every day the

anti-colonial movement is gaining momentum and  they

are   demanding  a  national  referendum  on   self-determination.  But the colonialists,  fearing  that

they  may  fail  in  the general elections  and  the

national referendum, have postponed these events  in

order  to perpetuate their rule. We can clearly  see

from these facts that the Greater Malaysia Plan does

not aim at promoting the interests of the people  of

the  five  territories. In fact, this Plan  aims  at

frustrating the anti-colonial movement in the  three

territories  in  Borneo.  If  this  Plan  is  really

intended  to bring about prosperity and  to  promote

the  interest of the people in the five  territories

of this region, the rulers must first let the people

in the three territories in Borneo have independence

before  they can bring about the Malaysia  Plan.  If

this  Plan  is to be put into practice  quietly  and

handed  to  a Right-wing Government as  a  means  of

ruling  the  people in the five territories  in  the

interest of the colonialists, then it will not be in

the interest of the people in the five territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot forget that the Prime

Minister of the Federation, Tunku Abdul Rahman,  has

said that under the Greater Malaysia Plan, Singapore

will only be taken in on a partnership basis. As far

as   immigration  is  concerned,   there   will   be

restrictions in the five territories. But the P.A.P.

have been boasting that Malaysia will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



look after the interest of the 10 million people  in

these territories and that it will be a solution  to

all the problems of the people in this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government is now

launching   an  intensive  propaganda  campaign   to

deceive the people on the question of Malaysia. When

Malaysia is realised, unemployed people in Singapore

will  not  be  allowed  to  migrate  to  the  Borneo

territories  to seek jobs. So how can  the  Malaysia

Plan  solve  the unemployment problem in Singapore'?

The P.A.P. say that they can do so, but it is a lie.

Again, there is no difference whatsoever between the

Malaysia  Plan and the merger proposals as contained

in the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we say that this Malaysia Plan is impractical

and we will not support it.



<br><br>3.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,

after  the Second World War, we notice two political

trends:  (1)  colonies gradually  gain  independence

from imperial rule, and (2) small countries tend  to

unite together in order to survive and prosper. This

trend  of countries coming together is found in  the

West Indies and in Africa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people who live in the

territories comprising Malaysia have much in common.

The  concept  of Malaysia is a natural expansion  of

the concept of a united Malaya with the three Borneo

territories.  My  Party, the United People's  Party,

supports  the  concept  of Malaysia  as  the  United

People's  Party  supports the concept  of  a  united

Malaya.  Unfortunately, the Federation  Government's

Malaysia  Plan  would not bring  about  a  true  and

reunited  Malaysia  as  Singapore  would   only   be

admitted on a so-called partnership basis. In  order

to create a true Malaysia, two basic conditions must

be  observed:  firstly, there  must  be  one  common

citizenship, and, secondly, there must be freedom of

travel  and  residence  within  all  the  15  States

comprising Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We oppose the Plan put forward by the Federation

Government  because it is against  these  two  basic

conditions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



In short, we support the concept of Malaysia, but we

are  opposed to the Federation Plan because it would

not bring about a true Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a true Malaysia will bring much

benefit  to  the people of Singapore and will  solve

many  of  her  economic problems. For  more  than  a

century,  Singapore  has  been  the  heart  of   the

territories   which  comprise   Malaysia.   A   true

Malaysia,  when created, will therefore  be  in  the

best interest of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the original motion moved by the

Prime  Minister  of Singapore asks the  Assembly  to

support   the   Malaysia  Plan  of  the   Federation

Government.  The amendment suggested by  the  Member

for  Anson asks the Assembly to support the Malaysia

concept  instead  of agreeing with  the  Plan.  This

Malaysia concept has been approved by all Parties in

the Federal Parliament, including the P.P.P. and the

Socialist  Front,  but  has  been  opposed  by   the

P.M.I.P.   The   P.M.I.P. wants   the   territories

comprising Malaysia to be merged with Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Singapore Legislative

Assembly, it seems that all the Parties, except  the

Barisan Sosialis, support the Malaysia concept.  The

Barisan  Sosialis  claim that  the  U.P.P. and  the

Workers' Party have fallen into the propaganda  trap

of  the P.A.P. and have helped the P.A.P. to deceive

the  people. Mr Speaker, Sir, since we  fought  the

P.A.P. leadership from the days  of  the  Hong  Lim

Resolutions,  we  have never on any occasion  fallen

into  the  P.A.P. trap. Neither have we  helped  the

P.A.P. leadership to deceive the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was the Barisan Sosialis, as ex-P.A.P.

Members, who as late as the polling day of the  Hong

Lim  by-election helped the P.A.P. to  deceive  the

people.  They  helped  the  P.A.P. in  their  false

propaganda  to deceive the people in the Legislative

Assembly,  in  the  meetings at  the  Hong  Lim  by-election and elsewhere. They sang the praises of the

Prime Minister and flattered him as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



democrat, socialist and a man of the masses.  Within

a  few weeks after the Prime Minister's catastrophic

defeat  in Hong Lim, these same people, who  claimed

that  the Prime Minister was a good, honest democrat

and   socialist,  turned  against  him  and  started

repeating  the same things that we said. Instead  of

being  collaborators,  the  Barisan  Sosialis   have

assumed  a  new role. They have become the so-called

champions of the people. Can the people trust  these

political weathercocks? Is it not a fact that  these

Barisan  Assemblymen collaborated  with  the  P.A.P.

leadership for two years, enjoying life together? Is

it necessary to quote what they said in Hong Lim? On

the  other hand, we in the U.P.P. do not change like

these  political  weathercocks. We have  fought  the

P.A.P. constantly  and have not  collaborated  with

them in deceiving the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Malaysia concept, it is

the  Barisan Sosialis who will fall into the  P.A.P.

trap.  I  remember  not long  ago  how  the  Barisan

Sosialis  fell  into the P.A.P. trap  by  supporting

police action against students. They also fell  into

the P.A.P. trap by sending a delegate to the Malayan

Solidarity  Consultative Conference. The  U.P.P. is

opposed  to the Malaysia Plan as distinct  from  the

Malaysia concept. Also we would have nothing  to  do

with    the    Malaysia   Solidarity    Consultative

Conference. Participation meant acceptance. Sir, why

do  the  Barisan Sosialis often fall into the P.A.P.

trap  in  this Assembly and elsewhere?  One  of  the

reasons   is  that  they  have  no  fixed  political

principles - just changing their stand like  political

weathercocks. From the speeches, it seems  that  the

P.A.P. is prepared to accept the amendment  of  the

Member  for Anson because the Barisan Sosialis  have

decided  to  vote  against the amended  motion.  The

P.A.P.'s  trap  is  to isolate the Barisan  Sosialis

from  the national movement and, as is clearly seen,

the  Barisan Sosialis is plunging headlong into  the

P.A.P. trap. We in the U.P.P. have more  principles

and   more   experience  in  fighting   the   P.A.P.

leadership, even during the time when they  were  at

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



height  of  their  power and when  there  were  some

people   who   were  prepared  to   compromise   and

collaborate with the mighty Prime Minister  then  in

order to share the spoils and glory of power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we support the Malaysia concept.

We  oppose  the  plan put forward by the  Federation

Government  because  it  will  not  create  a   true

Malaysia.  We  also oppose merging  with  Indonesia,

although  we want to be friendly with the Indonesian

people. But that is a different matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

asked you to do this?" We must know this: during the

Why should you leave us? You have betrayed the Party

Sosialis  had not left the P.A.P., then there  would

have been stability and peace in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the U.P.P. also asked why should they,

the Barisan Sosialis, leave the P.A.P.? At that time

they  wanted to oppose the U.P.P. and now they  want

to  oppose  the  P.A.P. Now, who  has  been  playing

games?  Why should the Barisan Sosialis be political

turn-coats?  They have no political objectives,  but

are  waverers so they could bring chaos and disorder

to  the people and the State. The people do not want

to  study  and  workers do not want to  work.  Whose

fault  is  it?  The  Member for Anson  supports  the

Government's Greater Malaysia Plan. But they say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



it  is  wrong to do so. Then why should they support

the Member for Anson at the Anson by-election?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Barisan Sosialis

should   not   be  so  obstinate  in  opposing   the

Government.  I  hope they could contribute  concrete

and  constructive suggestions and not  engage  in  a

rambling debate in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support merger between Singapore and the

Federation  and also the Malaysia Plan.  Why  should

there  be  merger and why should there be a Malaysia

Plan?  We  can  see that taxi-drivers  in  Singapore

cannot ply in the Federation. What is the reason for

this?  Graduates of Nanyang University cannot go  to

the  Federation.  The reason is  that  there  is  no

merger. That is why we want merger. After merger  we

are  members  of the same family and we  can  travel

freely  in Malaya. But the Barisan Sosialis want  to

oppose   merger.  They  say  the  people   are   not

satisfied.  Here  and there in the streets  and  the

coffee-shops   people  are  accusing   the   Barisan

Sosialis  because they have taken  the  wrong  path.

What  is  politics? Politics means  support  by  the

people.  But  the people do not support the  Barisan

Sosialis.  What is their reason for opposing  merger

and  the Malaysia Plan? They are trying to fool  the

people.  They  are  only  looking  after  their  own

interests.  That is why the people  do  not  support

them  because  they are thought to be  arrogant  and

proud.  They  also try to create strikes  here  arid

there.  The people are not pleased with the  Barisan

Sosialis.  That is why they do not want  to  support

the  Barisan  Sosialis. They say  that  the  Barisan

Sosialis  are doing things contrary to the interests

of  the  people.  The  people have  also  asked  the

Barisan  Sosialis not to place party politics  above

the  interests of the people. They have  also  asked

the  Barisan to pay more attention to the  interests

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, after the realisation of Malaysia,

all the five territories will enjoy greater economic

benefits  and the employment situation in all  these

territories will greatly improve. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



will  be a great help to the peoples. Therefore,  we

must make Malaysia a success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago a Member of the Barisan Sosialis

said  that  we, the P.A.P., do not support Indonesia

in  their  claim  for West Irian. It  is  a  strange

accusation. We have already clearly declared in  the

newspapers  and  in this House that we  support  the

Indonesian claim to West Irian. Yet this  Member  of

the  Barisan  accused  us  of  opposing  Indonesia's

liberation of West Irian. Is it not a lie when  this

Member  said that we would not support Indonesia?  I

would  stress  again  that we support  Indonesia  in

their  claim to West Irian, but we must not by doing

so  let West Irian be a battlefield. It will not  be

in  the  interests of anyone. We  must  not  let  it

become  a  kind  of sacrifice on  the  part  of  the

Indonesian  people.  We  have  seen  such  a   thing

happening in the past. For instance, Communist China

wanted  to  reclaim Formosa but could not declare  a

war because it was an international issue.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is going back

to  the debate on West Irian. We have finished  with

that.  He  has lost his opportunity. In passing,  he

can  mention it, but I think he is going  into  much

too  much details. All what he is saying now  should

have been said when West Irian was being debated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have only mentioned it in passing. But why should

I mention it? It is because this has something to do

with the present situation in our Party. It goes  to

show  that all along our Party has been on the right

lines.  We  are nationalists and all along  we  have

been  struggling  against  colonial  domination  and

colonial  interests. But they  have  accused  us  of

being   Right-wing   people   and   supporting   the

colonialists.  All this is not true. We  have  never

done  such  a  thing. They have also accused  us  of

doing  many  other  things. We  have  supported  the

Indonesians in their claim. All along



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



we have been struggling along the right path. And we

have  the  courage  to  pursue  our  party  policies

according  to  the  democratic, socialist  line.  We

resolutely  oppose colonialism to  the  very  bitter

end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that Members of the Barisan Sosialis will

in  future  not  try to accuse the  P.A.P. of  such

things,  such  as Indonesia's claim to  West  Irian,

which we have supported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I will not waste the time of the

Assembly.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, as each day passes  the  Barisan

Sosialis  is exposing their true intentions.  It  is

becoming  very clear, Mr Speaker, why  they  oppose

merger between Singapore and the Federation and  the

realisation  of Malaysia, and why in  an  effort  to

break up merger and Malaya they are trying to create

confusion  among  the  people  by  falsehoods.   The

Barisan  Sosialis have been accusing the  P.A.P. of

negotiating a sell-out merger. The Barisan  Sosialis

are also saying that Malaysia is also a sell-out  of

some  kind to the British. But their antics  at  the

Socialists  Conference in Kuala Lumpur make  it  all

too  clear that it is the Barisan Sosialis which  is

trying  to sell out the people of Singapore and  the

10  million  people  of Malaya to  the  P.K.I.,  the

Communists in Indonesia. First, they tried  to  sell

out Singapore to the British colonialists. They know

that   merger   with  the  Federation   will   bring

independence to Singapore by ending British rule  in

Singapore.  The  Barisan Sosialis cannot  deny  this

logic.  Once there is merger, the British will  have

no  say either in the domestic or foreign affairs of

a  United Malaya. But what did the anti-colonialists

of  the  Barisan Sosialis do? They secretly went  to

see officials of the U.K. Commission and put forward

a  funny deal. They said they were prepared  to  let

the  British  have  control over  the  military  and

external affairs of Singapore in return for internal

self-government minus the Internal Security Council;

not   full  independence  through  merger  but  only

internal   self-government.  In  other  words,   Mr

Speaker, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



so-called anti-colonial nationalists of the  Barisan

Sosialis  were  prepared to sell out our  chance  of

independence  to  the  British  in  return  for  the

abolition of the Internal Security Council.  Why  do

they  want  the  abolition of the Internal  Security

Council?  Why  are they prepared  to  sell  out  the

chance  of independence for Singapore in return  for

the  abolition of the Internal Security Council?  It

is  because  they  know that the  Internal  Security

Council  prevents  the  Communists  from  trying  to

subvert  and destroy Singapore. They know  that  the

existence  of  the  internal  security  laws  in  an

independent   and  united  Malaya  would   be   most

disastrous   for   the  cause  of   Communism.   The

Communists  know  that  in  an  independent   united

Malaya,  they  will  meet with resistance  from  the

nationalists  if  they try to  set  up  a  Communist

Malaya.  They  know  that they cannot  extend  their

influence   under  the  cloak  of  anti-colonialism.

Therefore, they would rather prefer that the British

continue   to   rule  Singapore   and   the   Borneo

territories for a while. Then in that situation they

can  use  the  cloak of anti-colonialism  to  extend

their  influence in Malaysia. As you know, Sir,  the

Barisan  Sosialis  have lost the battle  for  merger

just  as  they  have steadily been losing  in  their

campaign to bust up Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their desperation, the Barisan Sosialis are now

embarking  on  a really big sell-out. They  are  now

planning  to  sell  us to the P.K.I.  They  are  now

looking  to  the P.K.I. to help them  out  of  their

difficulties.  They  want to break  up  Malaysia  in

order  to keep it weak and divided, so that  through

the  P.K.I. these territories could be subverted and

then  swallowed up one by one with the  aid  of  the

Indonesian Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that sometime ago, there

was   a   report   in  an  Indonesian  pro-Communist

newspaper,   the   Bintang  Timur.  This   newspaper

reported  Mr  Lim  Ching Siong as  saying  that  he

preferred a merger of Singapore with Indonesia to  a

merger  with the Federation of Malaya. Mr  Speaker,

he  denied this report later on. But it is clear now

that even if the report was untrue,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



the Bintang Timur had read the mind of Mr Lim Ching

Siong and the Barisan Sosialis. The P.K.I. has since

then  passed  a resolution denouncing  Malaysia  and

merger.  Some  of the Barisan Sosialis leaders  have

claimed that the fact that they are against Malaysia

and  the  fact  that the P.K.I. is against  Malaysia

does  not  therefore mean that the Barisan  Sosialis

are  following a pro-Communist policy  too.  Is  the

P.A.P.,  they ask, branding all who oppose  Malaysia

as   Communists?  The  P.A.P. has  always  made   a

distinction between non-Communists who are  critical

of  Malaysia  and even opposed to Malaysia  and  the

Communists   who   are  opposed  to   Malaysia.   We

understand  the sincerity of the non-Communists  who

are  critical or opposed to Malaysia. We think  they

are  wrong  in fearing Malaysia. It was  these  non-Communist  anti-Malaysia elements to whom we  wanted

to  talk at the recent Malaysia Socialist Conference

held  in Kuala Lumpur. We wanted at least to try  to

convince  them  both as socialist  and  nationalists

that  they  had everything to gain by Malaysia.  The

Communist elements in the Barisan Sosialis, or  what

should  be  more correctly described as the  Barisan

Communists, knew this. They were so scared of  being

exposed  that they managed to rig up the  conference

in  such  a  way that our working paper  giving  the

socialist  approach to Malaysia was  rejected.  They

did  not  even  give us a chance to explain  to  the

conference why our paper should be considered. After

all,  Mr Speaker, we did not object to the adoption

of  the working paper of the Barisan Sosialis though

that paper was a vicious and malicious attack on the

P.A.P.  Government and some of its leaders. We  knew

that  in an open debate, we could expose the  merits

and  falsehoods in the Barisan Sosialis  paper.  But

the  Communists  in  the Barisan  Sosialis  were  so

scared   of  even  adopting  our  paper  that   they

prevailed  upon  the unhappy Chairman  not  only  to

reject   our  paper  but  also  to  refuse   us   an

opportunity  to  explain why  our  paper  should  be

accepted.  This  suppression of  free  speech  came,

oddly  enough,  Mr Speaker, immediately  after  the

conference had passed a resolution defending freedom

of the Press. I repeat - freedom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



of  the Press. The pro-Communists believe in freedom

of  the Press, but not in freedom of speech for  the

P.A.P. They dare not allow free speech, moreover, in

a  conference packed with cheer leaders who had come

to  boo and shout down the P.A.P. delegates. But the

P.A.P. was nevertheless prepared to speak freely  to

the  non-Communist socialists at the  conference  in

order  to  convince them of our  point  of  view  on

Malaysia.  The conference Chairman said that  though

the  paper  would  not be adopted, we  could  debate

Malaysia  later on. But it is unusual. Mr  Speaker,

in  a democratic conference that all papers but  the

P.A.P.'s  paper should be adopted. The Chairman  was

even prepared to consider a paper which the Workers'

Party Chairman proposed to submit. The Chairman  had

not  even  seen  that paper. This is  the  so-called

democracy in which they believe. The truth  is  that

the  Communists were so uncertain of  the  case  for

Malaysia  that they dare not allow a  paper  by  the

P.A.P. to he adopted for discussion on Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is only a foretaste of the

kind  of  freedom we could hope to get in  Singapore

and  in Malaysia if the Barisan Sosialis were to get

control  of  this  country.  Why  were  the  Barisan

Sosialis  so scared of our working paper  that  they

manoeuvred to get our paper rejected? When  we  went

to   the   meeting   of   the  Malaysia   Solidarity

Consultative  Committee meetings in Kuching  and  in

Kuala  Lumpur, we were not afraid, Mr  Speaker,  to

take  the  Member for Thomson along  with  us,  even

though  we knew that he was really against Malaysia.

He  had  every  chance to say what  he  liked  about

Malaysia and the P.A.P. in Kuching. If he was silent

for  most  of the time, it was because he knew  that

whatever false or illogical things he said could  be

immediately challenged and exposed. It is clear from

the  resolutions  passed after the  P.A.P. walk-out

that  that conference was rigged in order to  enable

the   Communists  at  the  conference  to  trap  the

confused  and misled non-Communists who  were  there

into  endorsing the P.K.I.'s resolutions. We are  of

the view that the Communists are attempting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



to  use genuine fears about Malaysia to organise  an

anti-Malaysia campaign to further the  ambitions  of

the P.K.I. in this region. This is the biggest sell-out  of  the Barisan Sosialis. They have become  the

stooges  of  the Indonesian Communists and  are  now

engaged  in a treasonable plot to sell out Singapore

and Malaysia to the P.K.I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this the Barisan Sosialis

have  miscalculated. They will  not  only  earn  the

contempt but also the anger of the people. They will

be  rejected  by the people because the people  will

not  back  a  Party  which  in  its  desperation  is

prepared  to  sell  us  to  the  cause  of   foreign

Communism.

Speaker,  Sir, we of the Barisan Sosialis resolutely

and  wholeheartedly oppose the motion on the Greater

Malaysia Plan moved by the Prime Minister.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that this motion is similar to the motion

on the White Paper on merger. There is no difference

at  all between these two motions. At the same time,

we  cannot accept the amendment moved by the  Member

for  Anson. We are of the opinion that the amendment

of  the  Member  for  Anson  has  not  fundamentally

changed  the character of the motion tabled in  this

House.  Ministers of t1ie Government, together  with

the  Back-benches, have made many allegations during

their  speeches. They have said that it is only  the

Barisan Sosialis who are opposed to this motion.  We

will tell them that our stand is very clear. We will

do  whatever  we  think is right. We  will  also  do

whatever  is  in  the  interest  of  the  people  of

Singapore.   We   will  oppose  anything   that   is

detrimental to the people of Singapore,  as  we  did

with the merger motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have seen that the Four-Party Alliance

are  supporting the P.A.P. motion. It is no surprise

to  us  because  the  P.A.P. of  today  would  have

collapsed without the support of the Four-Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



Alliance. That is why they are toeing the same line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the Tunku moved the

motion  on  Malaysia in the Federal  Parliament,  he

stated clearly that there would be no merger without

a  Malaysia comprising the five territories of  this

region.  He also said that the citizens of Singapore

would  not  be  treated on a par with those  in  the

other  territories.  It  is  because  of  this  that

without  the  other territories coming  in  to  form

Malaysia, there would not be any merger between  the

Federation  of  Malaya  and  Singapore.  Our   Prime

Minister  is very anxious about Malaysia because  of

this  remark  made  by  the Prime  Minister  of  the

Federation. The Prime Minister of our State is  just

like  an  ant  on a hot pan. He will resort  to  all

kinds  of  means  to sell out the  interest  of  the

people  in  Singapore.  He  will  do  everything  to

achieve this end. He will do all sorts of tricks  to

divert the attention of the people of Singapore from

the  truth.  In this way, he hopes to cover  up  his

sell  out  plan. For example, today  and,  in  fact,

every   other  day,  they  have  talked  about   the

Communists.  They say that Mr Lim  Ching  Siong  is

controlled  by  the  P.K.I. and  so  on.  They  have

created  a  sensation in South-East Asia,  by  their

remarks about the Communists. We would like to point

out  to  them  here  that the game  which  they  are

playing is not new, and the people of Singapore will

not  fall  into their trap. I will go  into  further

details later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, about the so-called

theories of the P.A.P. The Minister for Culture made

a  speech last week in this House in which  he  said

that  we  of the Barisan Sosialis are fond of  using

words  like "masses" and "people". He said  that  we

mentioned  those words according to the  meaning  we

had  in  mind. He said that we used these  terms  as

defined in Lenin's book. Unfortunately, we have  not

been  able  to  get  a  book  written  by  Lenin  in

Singapore. It is indeed a pity -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Lots of copies here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In any case, we

would like to tell the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



Minister for Culture that we are not concerned  with

or   worried  about  his  allegations  whether   our

definition  is the same as that of Lenin,  Soekarno,

Nehru,  or  what has been said by the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  .to his members. We come from  the  people

and  we  shall return to them. We do not  care  what

kind of meaning he attaches to the words we use.  We

would  like to tell the P.A.P. leadership that  when

we  use the word "people", we mean the thousands  of

people  in the State who comprise the various  races

who  are  opposed to the merger plan of the  P.A.P.,

which  they do not welcome at all The word  "masses"

means  the big crowds which attended our mass  rally

in  Geylang Serai as well as those people  who  will

come  to  attend  our mass rally  in  the  Badminton

Stadium tomorrow afternoon and such other rallies to

come  in  future.  If the Minister for  Culture  and

other  leaders  in  the P.A.P. have  any  doubt  as

regards  the meanings of the words we used, then  we

shall invite them to attend our rallies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  last week when the  debate  on  this

motion  was going on, the McCarthy brothers  of  the

P.A.P. talked of certain interesting things such  as

would  surprise the people of Singapore. The  people

of  Singapore  are  surprised at  the  emergence  of

people  like McCarthy of America. They  are  of  the

opinion  that  these  people  here  are  even   more

interesting characters than Mr McCarthy himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, desperate people like the

leaders  of the P.A.P. can only have one  hope,  and

this  hope seems to be attached to a plan  like  the

Greater  Malaysia Plan, which will be a  saviour  to

them.  Without the Malaysia Plan, the  life  of  the

P.A.P. will  end very soon. It is because  of  this

that  they  hope  that the Malaysia  Plan  will,  if

possible,  materialise tomorrow. In order to  induce

the  people  of  Singapore to accept their  Malaysia

Plan,  the  P.A.P. are saying everywhere  that  once

Malaysia  materialises, there will be heavy rainfall

in Singapore to fill up all our reservoirs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



and there will not be any water rationing. They will

also  make  the  people believe that  Malaysia  will

bring a lot of gold to Singapore and the people will

lead a life of paradise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our Ministers appear to

be  great  magicians  who hold  the  magic  wand  of

Malaysia  with  which  they  think  they  can   give

whatever  the  people want. In  the  course  of  the

debate  on this motion, the leaders of the Party  in

power  have become all of a sudden great  heroes  of

nationalism  and  anti-Communism.  They  bring   the

banners  of  nationalists in order to sell  out  the

interests  of  the people of Singapore.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, the true nationalists are  those  who

strongly oppose colonialism. But the leaders of  the

Party in power are afraid to go against colonialism.

Whenever they hear the term "anti-colonialism", they

are  angry  and vexed. They are prepared  to  accept

colonial  rule. They think that this  colonial  rule

can  be dispensed with on the golf course. They call

themselves nationalists, but they have been  running

away from the people of Singapore who are struggling

against  colonialism. They are the defeated soldiers

of nationalism. I should say that they are deserters

from the rank and file of the nationalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when anti-colonial forces are expanding,

the position of the colonial rulers is becoming more

and  more  shaky. The colonialists are  afraid  that

after  independence, the peoples will not only  wipe

out   their  political  influence,  but  also  their

control   - economically and culturally. The  fear  of

nationalism  has  led colonialists to  approach  the

pseudo  nationalists whom they can make use of.  The

Malaysia Plan has come about from the background  of

a  colonial  game, which is played by  the  colonial

rulers  who  think that they can no longer  continue

their stranglehold of this region. That is why  they

want to get agents through whom they can exert their

control  and maintain their political influence  and

economic position in this region.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my colleague, the Member

for  Havelock, has very clearly said in this  House,

and in no uncertain terms, that the Malaysia Plan is

a  game played and sponsored by the British. It  has

been  brought  up by the British with the  intention

that  through this plan they will be able  to  exert

control and perpetuate their influence in this area.

The  British intend to go out by the front door  and

come back by the back door - [Interruption].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Member for Havelock has already exposed you

(the Prime Minister) for what you are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we feel it is regrettable

that  the  British have found their ideal agents  in

Singapore  in the P.A.P. The P.A.P. people  are  the

pseudo  nationalists. The leaders of the P.A.P. are

being  made use of by the British because they  have

taken  up policies that are against the nationalists

and  the people. Their position is now shaky because

of these policies they have adopted. So, in order to

preserve their political life, they have joined  the

anti-Communists  and  work hand  in  hand  with  the

colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaders of the PAP, say that only the Communists

are  opposed  to the Malaysia Plan. As a  matter  of

fact,  I  will  tell them that the true nationalists

and  the  broad  masses are opposed to  the  Greater

Malaysia Plan arranged by the British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me give you a clear

illustration to show that the true nationalists  are

opposed  to the Malaysia Plan. We all know that  the

Afro-Asian  Solidarity  Organisation   is   a   true

organisation  of  the Afro-Asian nationalists.  This

Afro-Asian  Solidarity Organisation has a  Permanent

Secretariat  which recently made  a  declaration  in

Cairo  condemning the British colonialists for their

part in playing the game of Malaysia in this region.

They  also  pointed out that it was the aim  of  the

British  to  play the Malaysia game to suppress  the

people   in   these  five  territories.   The   true

nationalists of Afro-Asia are opposed to the British

playing the Malaysia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



game.  Only  leaders of the P.A.P. who  are  pseudo

nationalists will support a plan of this nature.  We

can  see  that  the true socialists and nationalists

have  already, as reported in today's papers, passed

some resolution on the Malaysia Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to give some

examples  from the Sin Chew Jit Poh and the  Nanyang

Siang  Pau  which carried reports of the meeting  in

Kuala  Lumpur of socialists from Singapore,  Malaya,

Brunei,  and Sarawak and the resolutions  that  they

passed.    These   resolutions   were   passed    by

representatives   of   Parties   from    the    five

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, today's Sin Chew Jit Poh

carries  a  report on the meeting of the  socialists

concerning the Malaysia Plan. One resolution  passed

at this meeting reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This conference regrets that the P.A.P. has

staged  a  walkout and issued slanderous  statements

about  the  conference. We are convinced that  they,

the P.A.P. delegates, have come here to dominate the

conference,  failing which they tried to  wreck  it.

They are no more socialists as we believe and so  we

expel them.'.



<br><br>This  resolution was brought up by the Party Ra'ayat

in the Federation of Malaya and it was passed at the

Conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another resolution reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This conference condemns the three previous

Consultative  Solidarity Committee meetings  on  the

Malaysia  proposals on the ground that the delegates

to these meetings in Sabah, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur

represented   their  ownselves   and   the   British

interests.'



<br><br>This resolution was passed at the conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another resolution condemned any move to force

through  the  Malaysia Plan without first  obtaining

the consent of the Borneo people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another resolution condemned the three previous

Consultative  Solidarity Committee meetings  on  the

Malaysia  proposals on the ground that the delegates

to these meetings in Sabah, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur

represented   their  ownselves   and   the   British

interests.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from these two resolutions, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  we can see clearly that a true socialist Party

or  a  true nationalist Party will respect  national

self-determination  and  they  will  also  see  that

democracy  and  equality  are  achieved   in   these

territories. We can see clearly that the  P.A.P. of

today has been discarded by the socialist Parties of

the five territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, no sound arguments and

reasons have been advanced by the Ministers  of  the

P.A.P. and  their  colleagues in  support  of  this

motion.  Insofar  as  this  country  and  the  three

territories  of Borneo are concerned, this  Plan  is

not in their interest. We can draw these conclusions

from   the  speeches  of  the  Ministers  and  their

colleagues.  First,  after the  realisation  of  the

Malaysia  Plan the people of Singapore  and  of  the

three territories in Borneo will not enjoy very many

benefits.  There will be inequality  and  they  will

have  to  bear  the responsibility of  the  expenses

incurred  by  the  Central Government.  So  this  is

another form of colonialism if the Malaysia Plan  is

to  be  realised on these lines. Second, the British

colonialists   will  be  able  to   maintain   their

political and economic interest in this area  for  a

long time. Third, the people of this region will  be

involved  in a cold war between the two major  blocs

in  the  world because of the British bases in  this

region.  This  region might even  become  a  battle-front.  Fourth, the P.A.P. leaders think  that  they

will  be  able  to survive after the Malaysia  Plan.

Fifth, after the realisation of Malaysia, the P.A.P.

leaders  will work hand in hand with the  Right-wing

Government  of  the Federation and  join  the  anti-Communist organisation sponsored by the British  and

the  Americans in South-East Asia. Sixth, this  Plan

is  meant  to  frustrate the struggle  for  national

liberation  by  the nationalists and  socialists  in

these five territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is why our Chairman

has made our stand very clear on this motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  the  Barisan  Sosialis seem  to  have  a  very

strange  outlook on life. Time and again, they  tell

us  that they agree with the concept of Malaysia  or

with  the  principle of Malaysia and yet  they  have

taken  up four days of this Assembly's time  arguing

against the motion moved by the Prime Minister. They

explain this obstruction of theirs by claiming  that

they  are interested in the details of the  plan  as

well  as  in  the  principle. So  are  we,  but  the

important  thing  at this stage is to  realise  what

comes first -  and that is agreement with the idea  of

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at their "details", Sir. They seem to

be  more  concerned  about  whom  the  Minister  for

Culture lives with and what the Prime Minister  does

in his spare time - when, where and with whom he plays

golf.  These are certainly details - the sort you  get

in  petty gossip or personal sneering. These are not

worthy arguments against a proposal to drive out the

British  from their last stronghold in this part  of

the   world  and  to  strengthen  the  whole  region

economically  and  politically  in  the  nationalist

cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now look at the principles involved in

Malaysia.   Whereas  it  is  a  means  of  obtaining

independence for the people of Borneo,  the  Barisan

Sosialis  claim  that it is extending  the  colonial

rule. The plain fact is that this is a way of making

the British go out of Malaya. They claim that it  is

not  freedom  to exchange the British flag  for  the

Federation  one, but it is not so.  Apart  from  the

fact  that  this  is not very complimentary  to  the

Federation, it is an exchange of a colonial flag for

a  nationalist one. In this way, freedom comes  much

quicker  to the Borneo people who can share  in  the

constitutional development of the Federation and  in

all  its  political advances so much ahead of  their

own present position. We are expected to believe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



that   in  Malaysia  the  British  will  remain   in

disguise.  I  would  like  to  know  what  kind   of

disguise. All the other members of Malaysia will  be

people  of  the  same race, language  and  political

desires  as  themselves. The  Barisan  Sosialis,  of

course,  also talk a lot about the need to give  the

Borneo   people  self-determination,  as  if   after

Malaysia  they  will have no part  to  play  in  the

democratic government of the whole territory. Let us

be quite clear - principles should be simple. Malaysia

will  mean  the  end of colonialism and  the  Borneo

people  will  join a country which  has  proved  its

nationalism and made it succeed. They can board  the

bus to independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another principle involved is the greater economic

strength of the Malaysia unit. The reality  of  this

is  there  for everyone to see in the history  books

and,  most  of  all, in the map. And  on  that  map,

Singapore is seen to benefit most of all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I conclude by saying that all this talk of details

is  like  a  clear-cut case before the courts  where

there  is no doubt as to a man's innocence but where

he  is  convicted  on  a technicality.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  are  trying  to destroy  to  principle  of

Malaysia  - that is, the cause of Malaysia - by a number

of technicalities meant to confuse the issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has said that 1962 will be

a  memorable year. But let us not forget that it  is

the  Year  of  the Tiger - the year the Malayan  Tiger

extends     its     victory    over     colonialism.

[Interruption].  No doubt one day it  will  eat  the

Barisan  Sosialis. In South-East Asia, the tiger  is

the  King of our tropical forests and rules over all

his  enemies. The Malayan tiger already rules  alone

in  the  Federation,  but the  same  forests  extend

through Borneo and Singapore. So let the nationalist

rule be extended. There is the only way - Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of this debate

on  Malaysia  the  Government  speakers  have  drawn

attention  to  the  declaration  of  the  Indonesian

Communist  Party opposing Malaysia. We have  pointed

out how the Barisan Sosialis line in this matter  is

identical  with  that  of the  P.K.I.  The  original

concept  of  Malaysia as proposed by the  Communists

meant  the absorption of Singapore into the Republic

of  Indonesia.  The Member for Thomson  has  clearly

stated  his  approval  of this scheme.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  members have refuted and denied that  they

are Communists or stooges of the Communists. How did

they  try  to talk themselves out of this? My  view,

Sir,  is that they did so in the most infantile  and

ineffective manner. Many of the speakers,  including

the  Member  for Upper Serangoon and the Member  for

Thomson,  are  duped in this way. If the  Communists

oppose  the  present  Malaysia Plan  and  they  also

oppose  Malaysia, this does not prove that they  are

Communists. If the Communists see certain things  to

be  true  and they also come to the same conclusion,

this  does  not make them Communists.  No  one  will

dispute this obvious proposition. However, there  is

nothing original to this line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago the open front Communist leader,

Mr  Lim  Ching Siong, said that Communist eat  rice

and  he  eats  rice. But this does not  make  him  a

Communist. This way of arguing to disprove  a  well-known fact is quite childish. One might as well  say

that  since Mr Kennedy walks on two legs,  and  Mr

Khrushchev  also walks on two legs,  therefore,  Mr

Khrushchev  is  an  American.  This  kind  of  logic

betrays  the low mentality of the Barisan  Sosialis.

When  the  P.A.P. say that they are  Communists  or

stooges of the Communists, we have produced concrete

evidence and have challenged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



them to refute this evidence. They have not dared so

far  to deny the evidence that we have produced. Let

me  remind the House of what we have said about  the

Member for Thomson. May I quote from a broadcast  of

the Prime Minister? It is in page 75 of the booklet,

"The Battle for Merger", third paragraph, taken from

the 10th broadcast of the Prime Minister. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Communists have a wide range of persuasion

and  pressure  techniques for  the  manipulation  of

human  beings.  They  won over  S.  T.  Bani  partly

because their zeal and ceaseless work in the  unions

convinced  him  that  he  did  not  have  a   chance

competing against them, partly by the argument  that

the world is being slowly absorbed and converted  to

Communism,  and finally by the constant pressure  of

persuasion and argument wearing down his nerves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to see me in hospital in July last year.

He  said  we  had  made a great  mistake  in  taking

office, and that we should get out of office as soon

as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time there were acute conflicts in the

T.U.C.  Secretariat  between  Lim  and  Fong's  pro-Communist  faction, and Kandasamy and  Devan  Nair's

non-Communist faction, Bani was then on the side  of

Kandasamy and Devan Nair who was his closest friend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devan and Bani were such close friends that only

last  year  they  rented adjoining  houses.  But  by

October   last   year  we  slowly  discovered   that

something had happened to him. He had gone  over  to

the  Communist side. Now he is not on speaking terms

with Devan Nair although he still lives next door.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Prime Minister said is the truth and will

stand as the truth. If the Member for Thomson thinks

it  is a false allegation, it is a simple matter for

him to bring a charge against the Prime Minister for

defamation  of  character. He will  then  have  full

opportunity  in  a court of law to  have  the  truth

established. If the Prime Minister cannot prove  his

case,   the  Member  for  Thomson  will  be  awarded

handsome  damages. But like all the other Communists

mentioned in "The Battle for Merger", they know that

what  is said about them is the truth and they  know

that  if  it is brought to court the truth  will  be

confirmed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me also remind the House what the Finance

Minister said about the Member for Queenstown during

the debate on the motion of confidence on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



the  20th  July last year. I am going through  these

details  to show beyond all doubt that when  we  say

that   they  are  Communists  or  stooges   of   the

Communists,  we have full and irrefutable  proof  of

our statements. Sir, I am quoting from Hansard, Vol.

14,  No.  23,  col. 1729. This is what  the  Finance

Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... the Parliamentary Secretary [i.e. the Member

for  Queenstown] declared that the salvation of  the

P.A.P. lies  in  full  ... co-operation  with  the

Communists. Sir, I am not mincing my words here ...

In our discussions that we had, we did not use vague

terms   such   as   "extreme   left"   or   "Leftist

socialists".  We were talking about  the  Communists

and both he and I understood what we meant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I posed to him the question whether he had

understood  the risk involved in such  a  course  of

action.  I said to him, "If you are a Communist  and

act  as one, you have no cause to regret should  any

ill  consequences  befall you.  You  understand  the

ideology;  you are dedicated to the cause,  and  you

are  prepared for the sacrifices. But if you are not

a Communist and try to toe their line, then you have

only  yourself  to blame if events  overwhelm  you."

Now,   Sir,  the  [Member  for  Queenstown]  is   no

Communist.  He  does  not even understand  the  most

elementary tenets of Marxism-Leninism.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Minister is quoting, he

must  quote the exact words in the Official  Report.

The   words   are,  "Now,  Sir,  the   Parliamentary

Secretary  is no Communist." Of course, we  do  know

that "the Parliamentary Secretary" means "the Member

for Queenstown" in this context. But what I wish  to

point  out  is  that if there is a  quotation,  that

quotation must be quoted. Otherwise, of course,  the

Minister can paraphrase.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, can I substitute the words

"the  Member  for Queenstown" for "the Parliamentary

Secretary"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary is no

Communist. He does not even understand -'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister, of course, could

stop there and say, "The Parliamentary Secretary  is

the Member for Queenstown". The point I am trying to

make   is   that  words  in  a  quotation  must   be

mentioned. That is all there is to it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary [in this

case, the Member for Queenstown] is no Communist. He

does  not even understand the most elementary tenets

of  Marxism-Leninism. Indeed, a great  deal  of  his

behaviour  and  activity rather suggest  to  me  the

conduct of a foolish virgin who has entered  into  a

brothel area and proclaimed the brotherhood of men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did he want to embark on this hazardous

course?  He wants mass popularity for the Party  and

for  himself which he thinks only the Communists can

provide.  I repeatedly asked him whether or  not  he

had calculated the consequences... Sir, I have spent

a  long  time  with the Parliamentary  Secretary  to

convince him of the error of his assumption.'



<br><br>I am quoting from column 1730, second paragraph, 5th

line:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But I could not move him from that position ...

the British ... had convinced the Communists that it

is  safe for them to proceed, and the Communists  in

turn have convinced the Parliamentary Secretary that

no ill consequences would follow his throwing in his

lot  with  them. On the contrary, he would  get  the

advantage  of  mass popularity and  the  support  of

their  mass organisations in Singapore. And  in  the

end,  Sir, a delectable prize to win - the Premiership

of Singapore!'



<br><br>That  is  why  the  Member for  Queens-town  is  co-operating  with  the Communists and  is  willing  to

serve as their stooge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Upper Serangoon. He

has  spoken a great deal about the logic  of  saying

that   Mr  Khrushchev  is  an  American  just  like

President  Kennedy - he walks on two  legs.  Our  case

against  the  Member  for  Upper  Serangoon  is  not

whether  he  walks on two legs or on four  legs,  or

crawls on his belly or whether he eats rice or sweet

potatoes.  Our case against him is that  during  his

schooldays  he had already enrolled as a  member  of

the  Anti-British League. Everybody knows  that  the

Anti-British  League  is  the  cadet  corps  of  the

[Malayan  Communist Party. It is in the Anti-British

League that young men and women are trained and  put

through  their  paces in all kinds  of  illegal  and

conspiratorial  work.  The proper  A.B.L. graduated

into full membership of the Malayan Communist Party.

The  Member  for  Upper Serangoon joined  the  Anti-British League when he was in school,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



as  did  the  Member for Havelock. The  Anti-British

League  is organised on the same cell system as  the

parent  Malayan Communist Party. Each cell is guided

by  a leader. Now and then membership and leadership

of cells changed. The Member for Upper Serangoon was

under  the guidance of several leaders who had  been

underground  operators  for  the  Malayan  Communist

Party for a long time. One of these men was arrested

some  years  ago  and  banished to  China.  Recently

another  underground Communist with whom the  Member

for  Upper  Serangoon had close association  emerged

from  the underground and made contact with him.  It

was  this man who finally persuaded him to join  the

others  in attacking the P.A.P. Thus the Member  for

Upper Serangoon has renewed his association with the

underground  organisation of the  Malayan  Communist

Party.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I know  that  this  is  a

serious  charge  to make. If the  Member  for  Upper

Serangoon  cares  to  deny it, we  are  prepared  to

produce  evidence  in  support  of  not  only   this

allegation but also disclose further and more  lurid

details   of   his  association  with  the   Malayan

Communist Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, Mr Lim Ching Siong tries to

laugh away this business by saying that other people

have  accused him of being a Communist. The  trouble

is  that  other  people have  never  worked  in  co-operation  with the Communists in the  anti-colonial

struggle.  But we of the P.A.P. did so  for  several

years.  We,  therefore, know  what  we  are  talking

about. We know how they operate and we know who  the

guilty  men are. We have named them, and  they  have

not  dared to deny the particular evidence  we  have

produced.  The reason why the Communists  and  their

stooges  in the Barisan Sosialis oppose Malaysia  is

very  simple.  They  know  that  after  merger   and

Malaysia  they  will  stand  in  great  danger  from

security  action taken by the Central Government  of

the Federation. The Federation Government fought the

Communists  not only in their subversive  activities

but   also   in  a  prolonged  shooting   war.   The

Communists, therefore fear the elected government of

the Federation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



Malaya.  It  is  not  for us in the  P.A.P. to  say

whether or not these fears are justified. This is  a

matter  solely  for them to judge. I would  suggest,

however,  that  they  have  already  come   to   the

conclusion  that  a great store of  misfortune  lies

ahead  of both the Communists, their stooges in  the

Barisan  Sosialis, and their operators in  the  open

front  trade  unions  and other organisations  after

merger  or  Malaysia. Hence, their mounting  frantic

effort  to stop Malaysia. But they will fail  to  do

this.  Both  Malaysia  and merger  are  historically

inevitable  and the Communists themselves  know  it.

Most  of their stooges who are less intelligent than

the  Communists are slowly beginning to realise  the

awful  truth.  That is why they are trying  to  deny

that  they  have anything to do with the Communists.

But  as the ancient saying goes, "Truth is great and

it shall prevail."

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, you will remember that

during the course of the debate on this motion  last

week,  the  red  caps of the Communists  were  flung

about in this House. You will also remember how  the

leaders  of the P.A.P. called all those who  opposed

this  motion as Communists or stooges controlled  by

the  Communists. Mr Speaker. Sir,  these  rash  and

derogatory  accusations by the P.A.P. leaders  will

not  frighten  the broad masses into changing  their

stand and attitude towards the Malaysia Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. leaders' desperate

and  malicious shouts of madness have  already  lost

their  effect.  Starting from today the  P.A.P. are

having  their  so-called Malaysia Week during  which

the P.A.P. Government will invite a colonial officer

of Sarawak, namely, Mr Morrison of the Intelligence

Department,   to   give  a  broadcast   over   Radio

Singapore.  The P.A.P. Government have also  ordered

that  all  ships  anchored  within  the  waters   of

Singapore  should  be decorated  in  celebration  of

Malaysia  Week.  Again  the P.A.P.  Government  have

asked Mr Alex Josey, who was the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



Director  in charge of Psychological Warfare  during

the  Emergency in the Federation, to write all sorts

of  articles. In spite of all these moves  taken  by

the  P.A.P.  Government, I believe  the  peoples  in

Singapore,  the  Federation of Malaya.  Sarawak  and

Brunei can see one secret. The P.A.P. leadership  is

trying to play with the Malaysia Plan only with this

aim.  That  is, the P.A.P. hopes to go through  with

this  plan  in order to salvage its dying  political

power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what are the views of the

peoples  in the five territories of Brunei, Sarawak,

North  Borneo,  Singapore  and  the  Federation   on

Malaysia? Here I would like to acquaint you with one

fact.   At  the  Kuala  Lumpur  Conference  of   the

Malaysian    Socialists    yesterday,    all     the

representatives  from  Brunei and  Sarawak  strongly

opposed the Malaysia Plan. Even the Party Rakyat and

the   Labour  Party  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya

disagreed  with  the  stand of the  P.A.P. on  this

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to disclose to you

some more facts. The majority of the representatives

at  this  Malaysian Socialist Conference are Malays.

This  conference was conducted by a  Malay.  It  was

under  such  circumstances that the  P.A.P.'s  views

were   rejected   by  the  conference.   After   the

rejection,  the  P.A.P. delegation,  headed  by  the

Minister for Culture, walked out of the conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the anti-Communist heroes

of  the P.A.P. left the conference, the Minister for

Culture   abused  the  Communists.   He   made   the

allegation  that  this  was  a  conference  of   the

Communists  and  that  it  was  controlled  by   the

Communists. Mr Speaker, by uttering such  rash  and

discourteous words the Minister for Culture and  his

associates had not only insulted the representatives

from  the five territories at the meeting, but  also

insulted the people of all the five territories.  By

this behaviour, they have discredited the people  of

Singapore  in  the  eyes  of the  five  territories.

Communist this, Communist that! The red hats of  the

Communists have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



been  flown  from  Singapore to  Kuala  Lumpur.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, why should the Minister for Culture be

so  anxious  and  excited? It is simply  because  he

knows   that  the  true  socialists  of   the   five

territories   do  not  welcome  the  Malaysia   Plan

sponsored  by the Right-wing elements in conjunction

with  the  British colonialists who were behind  the

scenes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the history of Malaya tells us

that when a Party and its politicians are confronted

with  the prospect of being in their last days, they

will  resort to the last weapon. That is, they  will

play  with  communalism as their political  tactics,

and  in  the meantime they will shout anti-Communist

slogans.  But history also tells us that  all  those

who played with communal politics and shouting anti-communist slogans met with a very bad end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture is today just following the footsteps of the Member for Cairnhill in shouting anti-communist slogans. From his behaviour, we can see that even the Member for Cairnhill has to look up to him as an elder person in regard to the shouting of anti-Communist slogans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. delegation was

exposed in their attempts to wreck the conference of

the  Socialists in Kuala Lumpur. They have been held

up  as  a Party which is not socialist. It has  also

now  been shown that the P.A.P. leadership are anti-Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Malaysia Plan, I entirely

support  the  arguments advanced by the  Member  for

Queenstown  who  is the Chairman  of  our  Party.  1

therefore  appeal to the leaders of  the  P.A.P. to

forget   about  their  mad  shouting  and  malicious

abuses,  and instead listen calmly to the voices  of

the peoples in the five territories.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in the debate on merger, we

knew that the Barisan Sosialis were afraid to debate

or  to  take part in the voting. This was made clear

when  the  division was called. The Barisan Sosialis

revealed their fear by leaving the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



Chamber  and  not  taking part in  the  voting.  Mr

Speaker, on the merger motion too, the agents of the

Barisan  Sosialis took active measures to  meet  the

people  in  coffee-shops and agitating  the  Chinese

section  by frightening methods that if merger  were

realised, the Malays would overwhelm the Chinese. In

addition, the pro-Communist elements of the  Barisan

Sosialis have, by the use of their agents in Malaya,

tried  to  frighten the Malays that if  merger  were

realised,  it  would mean that the Malays  would  be

overwhelmed by the Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to the Malaysia motion. The Barisan

Sosialis  are  very  afraid  of  merger.  The   pro-Communists  are  even more afraid of Malaysia.  Just

now  the Member for Serangoon Gardens said that  the

P.A.P. always accused the Barisan Sosialis of  being

pro-Communists. This, he said, would not  frightened

away  the  people. It is true that the people  would

not be afraid. But the people who are afraid are the

pro-Communist Members of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, several Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen have quoted reports in connection with the Malaysian Socialist Conference held in Malaya. I also wish to quote an excerpt from page 1 of the Berita Harian of today's issue. It says that this Conference condemned the P.A.P. delegates led by Mr Devan Nair; the leader of the P.A.P. delegation walked out

of the conference and the conference considered that

the  P.A.P.  delegates  attempted  to  manipulate  the

conference.  After the resolution was  adopted,  the

Chairman, Mr Ishak, said, "The P.A.P. are no longer

socialists and with this they are expelled and  they

are hereby expelled." Mr Speaker, we know that this

conference was not a truly socialist conference.  It

was  merely  a camouflage and was organised  by  the

Communists.  If,  according  to  the  Chairman,  the

P.A.P. had been expelled, this does not surprise  us

because   we   are   a   genuine  socialist   party.

Furthermore,  Mr  Speaker, in  the  same  issue  of

Berita Harian, there is a report mentioning a speech

made  by  Mr Lim Ching Siong, the Secretary-General

of the Barisan Sosialis, who spoke in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



Mandarin  and  Malay.  In his speech  in  Malay,  he

denied  that  he was a Communist. Mr Speaker,  this

has  been  proved by the Prime Minister in his  book

The  Battle for Merger. He has said that if Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong  has  got  the  guts  to  refute   this

allegation, he should take court action against  the

Prime  Minister. And Mr Lim Ching Siong also denied

that  the Barisan Sosialis received inspiration from

the  Communist Party in Indonesia. "It is not we who

are toeing the line of the P.K.I. but the reverse is

the  case," Mr Lim Ching Siong said amidst applause

and  clapping  of hands. Mr Speaker,  I  personally

know Mr Lim Ching Siong. He has denied that he is a

follower  of  the  P.K.I. and  that  the  P.K.I. is

following his line. This goes to prove, Mr Speaker,

that two times five are 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis are genuinely afraid of the realisation of Malaysia or merger because they fear that out of this will emerge second-class citizenship and the question of internal security. Yes, Mr Speaker, internal security laws will be applied to real pro-Communist elements or Communists. But a real socialist fighter

need  not  be afraid of the internal security  laws.

Mr  Speaker. I personally underwent the  experience

of  having been persecuted by the internal  security

laws,   but  because  I  have  complete   faith   in

socialism, I met such persecutions bravely. Only pro-Communists  or  real Communists are  afraid  of  the

internal security laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens said the

Malaysian Socialist conference in Malaya was  guided

by a Malay. I know a number of Malays present at the

conference.  I  know  from my colleagues  that  only

three  Malays  attended the conference.  This  means

that in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya, pro-Communist  elements or Communists do  not  have  the

support  of  the Malays. I hope that all the  Malays

and other communities will be on their guard against

Communist  subversive elements who are  infiltrating

associations  and villages in order to frustrate  or

wreck merger and Malaysia and so on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to support the motion that is before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fail to understand the logic

of  the  Barisan Sosialis. They say they are fervent

anti-colonialists,  but  when  we  the  P.A.P. are

fervently trying to liberate the people not only  in

Singapore  but also in the three Borneo  territories

from the clutches of British colonialism, they,  the

Barisan, strongly oppose our attempt. They find  all

sorts  of methods to frustrate this movement. We  in

the  P.A.P. try to rally the forces and the strength

of  the people in these three territories so  as  to

liberate them who are still in the clutches  of  the

British  colonial  master,  but  they,  instead   of

organising the people and rallying them together  to

throw  off the colonial yoke, collaborate  with  the

British  High Commissioner to frustrate our  attempt

to bring the people into a united Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you will have observed, Mr Speaker, Sir,

during  the  debate on the motion last month,  which

embodied  the  proposed  terms  of  merger   between

Singapore   and  the  Federation,  they   vehemently

condemned it. Now, when we are discussing the motion

to  bring  freedom to the people of Sarawak,  Borneo

and  Brunei,  they too again oppose it. They  always

condemn  and  slander  us  as  pro-colonialists  and

Rightists.  Now,  let  us see what  the  Member  for

Queenstown had to say of the P.A.P. when he was with

us.  You  remember, Sir, the Member for  Queenstown,

the  Member for Mountbatten and the Member  for  Ulu

Pandan  represented the Singapore C.P.A.  Branch  to

the conference held in Kuching



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



in  August  1960. In the report which the  three  of

them submitted to the C.P.A. -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That report is confidential. I

think  the  hon. Member will find it is marked  "Not

for  Publication".  He should not  quote  from  that

report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> But anyway, the three of them

told  us  that Singapore was fighting the battle  of

democratic  socialism in this part of the  world.  I

remember,  Sir, in the appendix to that  report,  he

gave  his own impression of the conference and  told

us that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated that

that  report is confidential to the C.P.A.  It  must

not be referred to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Sir, I bow to your ruling. But

my  point  is  this. What I am trying to  do  is  to

refute  the allegations that are now hurled  against

the  P.A.P. When they were with us and even as  late

as  in  the Hong Lim by-election, they stood on  our

platform  and  told  the  public  that  we   are   a

progressive government and that we are the  vanguard

of  the  anti-colonial forces. We are, in fact,  the

Government that brought freedom and benefits to  the

workers  in  Singapore. But now, Mr Speaker,  after

the  split  and  in  a matter of months,  they  have

forgotten what they told the public about the P.A.P.

They are trying to hurl abuse at us, saying that  we

are  no more anti-colonial forces, that we are  pro-colonialists and Rightists. As I have said just now,

I   am  at  a  loss  to  understand  the  logic  and

philosophy of the Barisan Sosialis. When we  in  the

P.A.P. are  trying to organise the people  and  the

nationalist  leaders in Malaya,  Singapore  and  the

three Borneo territories to remove the British Union

Jack  and to hoist our own national emblem, they  do

not  want  to  join us. They still want the  British

Union  Jack  to  be hoisted on to the  flagposts  of

these three territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are discussing a

motion  which  will give freedom  not  only  to  the

people  of  Singapore  but also  to  the  people  of

Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. On one occasion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



when   we  debated  the  motion  on  merger  between

Singapore   and  the  Federation,   we   heard   the

convincing  story  of  what transpired  between  the

leaders  of  the Barisan Sosialis and Lord  Selkirk.

But  in  this  instance, when we  are  debating  the

motion  on  Malaysia,  we have  again  observed  the

betrayal  of the people by the Barisan Sosialis  who

connived   with   an  outside  body - the   Indonesian

Communist Party. In these two debates, we have heard

them accusing the PAP. Government of suppressing the

freedom  of the people by the use of the police  and

military forces against the people. But what have we

seen  at  the conference in Kuala Lumpur?  When  the

P.A.P. asked  that they be allowed to submit  their

working paper on their stand on the reunification of

all  the people in Malaysia, the socialists rejected

it.  They discussed instead something else which was

contrary  to  the  interest of the people  in  these

territories. The Barisan Sosialis always say that we

are  not  interested in the welfare of the  workers,

but  that  is  not  trite. We have  time  and  again

explained  to  this  House  that  the  resources  in

Singapore are limited. In order to bring benefits to

the  people, we must, first of all, wrest  political

power from the British colonial masters, and then we

will  be  able to shape an economy which will  bring

comfort  and benefit to our working class. This  has

always  been  our objective, but we only  meet  with

obstruction from the Barisan Sosialis leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the allegation that the

P.A.P. have suppressed the workers, I will have  the

opportunity  no  doubt of replying  to  it  When  we

debate  the next motion. But. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we

are trying to bring something good for the people in

Malaysia,  and therefore, we will fight against  any

people  who try to frustrate our plan. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  the  Barisan  Sosialis  oppose  Malaysia   not

because  it  is  bad  for the 10 million  people  in

Malaysia but because it is bad for the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is good for the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we say that

we  believe in parliamentary democracy. We  have  to

face the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



people  after our term of office. Sir,  the  Barisan

Sosialis have accused us of betraying the people  by

achieving  merger. They say that  we  are  still  in

office  for the good of ourselves and that  we  have

deviated  from our anti-colonial stand. So according

to  the  logic  of  the Barisan Sosialis,  if  these

accusations  are true, then we should fight  against

Malaysia  and merger. We will work for the  good  of

the  people  and we know what they want  us  to  do.

Therefore, we have to be firm in our stand in  spite

of  the  smear  that  we  are  pro-colonialists  and

Rightists.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> With regard to the allegation

that we are Fascists, it is very simple to rebut it.

As I said just now, I could not make my speech as  I

forgot  to bring some newspapers. We can quote  many

instances. What happened at the conference in  Kuala

Lumpur?   We  believe  in  the  achievement   of   a

democratic Malaya; we must have the courage to stand

up and fight against those who try to frustrate this

movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have also been accused by the Barisan

Sosialis  that we deny them the freedom  of  speech,

assembly,  and so on. These Members of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  who defected from our Party know the  laws

of the country but they make no attempt to apply for

a  permit  to paste posters or to hold rallies.  So,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, where is the truth  that  we  are

Fascists and that we are suppressing freedom?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are accused of betraying the

people. The truth is that we are not prepared to  be

manipulated by the Communist front organisations  or

by  the  Communists themselves. They left our  Party

and they now have no protection from us. That is why

they   are   scared  that  they  will   suffer   the

consequences  of  their foolishness.  That  is  why,

after realising what they have done, they want us to

give them the necessary protection. But the point is

this: we are going to fight for the interest of  the

people  in  Malaya,  and,  therefore,  we  are   not

interested in the safety or in the welfare of a  few

people. These people have been warned that if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



they want to carry on in the same way, it would  not

only  bring disaster to them but also to the  people

in  Malaya. That is our duty and we will continue to

look after the interest of the people.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I had not intended to speak on this subject but

the  illogical arguments advanced by the Member  for

for Havelock make it necessary for me to speak on  a

few points. I feel that on such an important subject

like  this,  which involves the lives of 10  million

people,  we  should  not  take  the  opportunity  of

playing politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last four days, I expected the

Government to mention the concrete benefits that the

man   in   the  street  will  get  if  Malaysia   is

implemented and the disaster that will take place if

Malaysia  is  not implemented. I also  expected  the

Barisan  Sosialis to put forward their views  as  to

what  disaster will befall the man in the street  if

Malaysia  is  implemented - with both of  them  giving

examples  in support of their arguments. Instead  of

which  we heard that travel would be made easier - how

many  of  the  ordinary  people  travel,  Sir?   - and

sweeping statements like, "There are potentialities.

Cultural and economic ties demand that we should  be

together."  Such  things do not affect  the  average

man.  But what I noticed was that mud and dirt  have

been flung around this Chamber; so I made up my mind

not   to   speak.  But  as  I  said,  the  illogical

statements  made  by the member  for  Havelock  have

stirred me into making these points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock said that because Lord

Selkirk  was  afraid that Indonesia would  turn  its

attention to Borneo after West Irian, we must oppose

Malaysia.  I do not see any logic in that statement,

Sir. Why must we cut our nose to spite our face?  If

we   are  going  to  have  more  potentialities  and

prosperity,  are  we going to oppose  Malaysia  just

because  Lord  Selkirk  is  interested?  He  may  be

interested in his own way. But whether we accept  it

or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



not  depends on whether the Government can prove  to

us  if it is going to be for the good of the people.

We  are  not  concerned with how Lord Selkirk  feels

about  it,  Sir,I do not see how that argument  can

hold water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I am speaking, I might as well touch on the

points  raised by the other Members which I consider

to be illogical. The two questions of West Irian and

Malaysia  are  quite  different.  That  is  why  the

Barisan  Sosialis  opposed  one  but  supported  the

other,  because the argument given was that  only  a

few  hundred Papuans in West Irian are involved  and

that  10 million people are involved in Malaysia.  I

cannot  see  the logic that because  a  few  hundred

people are involved we must not allow colonialism to

continue,  and  that because 10 million  people  are

involved  colonialism can continue. I  cannot  quite

follow that logic, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that the Malaysia Plan is a

White  Paper proposal. I think the Barisan  Sosialis

are giving the P.A.P. more credit than they deserve.

I  do not think they are all that powerful. I do not

think  that all the people of the Borneo territories

and  Malaya  are going to listen and adopt  a  White

Paper  of  the P.A.P. I do not think they  have  the

authority  to do it in the first place. The  Barisan

Sosialis  are giving them far too much credit.  They

went  on to say that because they rejected the White

Paper  merger proposals, they must also reject  this

motion  on  Malaysia.  I do not  understand  how  it

follows because the White Paper are details  on  our

merger.  They  have said that they are in  agreement

with  the  principle  and  concept  of  merger   and

Malaysia. But the White Paper are details which they

do not agree with. They have every right to disagree

with it. But it does not follow that because they do

not  agree  with  the  details of  our  merger,  the

concept  of Malaysia -  which they admit they  are  in

agreement with - must also be rejected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point they raised was that this Malaysia

Plan  should  be  motivated by a sincere  desire  to

promote  benefit for the people in the  territories.

They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



them  said  that the Plan is a project of  the  pro-Western politicians and that the real attraction was

the oilfields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that it was the leader of

the  Barisan  Sosialis  - I stand to be  corrected - who

sang  the praises of Tunku Abdul Rahman as being  an

honest  and  a frank person who never  told  a  lie.

These  words were uttered by one of the  Members  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis - I do not know  which  one  of

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> She is not sure!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Anyway, Sir, after having

said  that it was not motivated by a sincere  desire

to promote Malaysia for the benefit of the people in

the   territories,  they  now  suspected  that   the

promoters, and Tunku Abdul Rahman, the prime  mover,

of being pro-Western politicians. I stand corrected,

but  I  think the words "colonial stooge" were  used

about the promoters, of whom Tunku Abdul Rahman  was

one whom they have sung praises of. Then there was a

nasty insinuation  - that probably the real aim was to

control  the  oilfields. Sir, if a man  is  sincere,

frank,  and honest, I do not think he will do  that.

Those two do not tally. If they think he is fair and

honest, they must not say those things about him. If

they  do so, it is unfair to sing praises about him,

as that will only confuse us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter that they made capital of was the

utterance  of  the Prime Minister of the  Federation

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- to have the right Committee to recommend the right

things. Sir, may I ask, what are the right things? I

believe  the right things must be peace, prosperity,

advancement, justice for the people. Those  are  the

right  things. If you want the right things,  surely

you must have the right people to recommend. You  do

not  want  the wrong people to make a  mess  of  the

right things. If we are agreed that the right things

are  prosperity  and  so on, surely  [Interruption].

Healthy  for  women! Yes. Surely we  must  have  the

right people, and the right Committee. I do not know

what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



argument  there is in that. What do we want?  Do  we

want  the  wrong people to make a mess of the  whole

thing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we support this motion because, far from what

was  suggested by the Barisan - that it  is  an  anti-Indonesian  project - we feel  that  it  is  an  anti.

Communist project. That is why we are supporting it.

They  want  independence for Borneo before Malaysia,

and  they say, "What is the hurry? Why should  there

not  be  independence  first?  Why  must  there   be

Malaysia  straightaway?" I say this, Sir. The  hurry

is  this: we are running a race not with people like

the   Member  for  Nee  Soon  and  the  Member   for

Queenstown - I think they are quite innocent   - but  we

are running a race with the Communists who are very,

very  dangerous  people. You  know,  Sir,  Communism

thrives   and  breeds  best  among  poverty-stricken

people.  The Member for Queenstown, as was mentioned

just  now  by  the  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister for Labour, was with me in Kuching for that

conference. If I am not mistaken, he also did what I

did  - visited the different parts of Kuching and went

to  see how the indigenous people live. I am sure he

must  agree with me that the conditions ire far from

what  he and I would call satisfactory, Sir, so much

so  that - it is not now that I, feel it but  at  that

time  when I spoke to the authorities there  - I said.

"Don't you think that this State of affairs is ideal

for  Communism to breed in?" I asked him that,  Sir,

and  I  do  not want to go into the details  of  his

answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> What was the answer?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> That is why, Sir, I feel that

we cannot afford to delay. I shall endeavour to give

the reasons why I feel that we cannot delay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, as I said, the Communists are not

the people whom we can play around with. We all know

that  their creed is to dominate the world.  Are  we

going  to allow it? If not, what are we going to  do

about  it?  Secondly,  it  has  been  accepted  that

Communism rests on the assumption that the  tide  of

history is in their favour. And recent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



events, Sir, have more than proved that their aim is

to  make this tide flow faster. Thirdly, why I  feel

it  is to their interest for us to delay is that the

Communist choice of weapons is very, very wide,  and

unimpaired  by  moral considerations. For  instance,

Sir, their agents are world wide. They are found  in

the  World  Peace Council, the World  Federation  of

Trade  Unions,  the World Federation  of  Democratic

Youth,  the  International Association of Democratic

Lawyers,   the   World  Congress  of  Doctors,   the

International Organisation of Journalists. In  every

section  of the world population there is a  section

where  the  Communists can work  through,  and  work

fast,  with all these organisations. There  was  one

organisation,  Sir, the World Federation  of  Women,

which   I   see   in   the  directory   of   women's

organisations of the world. I do not see any reports

of this organisation recently. I do not know whether

it still exists, and so I have not mentioned it. But

it  is  found  in  the directory  of  world  women's

organisations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Democratic Women's

Federation.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, these organisations can

be  mobilised  to  organise  campaigns  at  suitable

moments. They have branches in most countries,  even

in  countries where Communism is banned.  The  World

Peace Council itself, Sir, has representations in 74

countries. The World Federation of Trade Unions  has

representations in 64 countries, until then  58;  it

has increased since then. With representations in 64

countries  they  have 88 million workers  supporting

them, and 60 million of these 88 million are in non-Communist  countries.  We  can  see  the   rate   of

infiltration.  That is why I feel it very  important

that we do not delay any longer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to show you the speed at which they work.

This  organisation  which I was talking  about,  the

World   Federation   of  Trade  Unions,   which   is

represented in 64 countries and with the support  of

88  million workers, was started towards the end  of

last war - around 1945, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



think, I do not know the exact date -  by whom? By the

British  Trades  Union Congress.  When  it  started,

Russia  insisted  that the post of Secretary-General

must  be  given to the Russian delegate. Having  got

that   positions  within  three  years,  Sir,   they

commanded  a  Communist majority  in  the  Executive

Bureau, the Executive Commission, and in the General

Council.  So  much  so  that by  1949,  the  British

delegates  found  it advisable to  withdraw  on  the

advice  of Arthur Deakin. This is what he said  when

he advised them to withdraw:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We started with an honest intention. But we were

not dealing with honest men.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, someone said - I am sorry I for-got the

name - that  the  communists  believe  that  the  flag

follows  the  trade; opposite to  what  the  British

believe. The British believe that trade follows  the

flag.  We  could  see this happening  and  we  could

believe  in  it because there are manifestations  of

it,  if  we look at the position of trade in Eastern

Europe and in the Soviet bloc. The Communist bloc is

moving very fast. Eastern Europe, which used to have

9  per  cent of Egypt's trade in 1953; has  absorbed

only  3.2  per  cent of Egypt's trade by  1958.  The

Soviet  bloc  took only half a per cent  of  Syria's

exports in the first half of 1957, but by the end of

1958 they commanded 21 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, Sir, in every way they are progressing

so  fast that if we are to hope to win the race,  we

too must move very fast, because a day's delay, Sir,

means  one  extra day for the Communists to  exploit

the  position.  Every  strike and  unrest,  Sir,  is

reported  back  to Communist headquarters.  I  would

like   to  quote  from  this  little  booklet,   the

Communist Plan for World Domination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To sum up, the moves in a Communist propaganda

campaign are roughly as follows...'



<br><br>and  it  goes on - 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, 6 and 7. I am really

interested in 6 and 7, and I will read 6:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`6. Results: Perhaps strikes, perhaps merely

numbers,  signatures, or demonstrators are  reported

back to Moscow. Claims of huge success [this is what

I am interested in] are published in other countries

and  the  Fronts emphasise the world-wide search  of

feeling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



in favour of the policy.'



<br><br>Then in summing up, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Propaganda may, of course, be used as the first

step  of  a  long  campaign  of  subversion.  It  is

particularly  useful in the war  of  nerves  against

social democrats which develops when Communists gain

a foothold in a parliamentary democracy.'



<br><br>Therefore,  Sir, you see why I say that every  day's

delay is an extra day for them to exploit us. It  is

horrifying  to think that every strike in Singapore,

probably  with  the most sincere  intention  of  the

labourers  to try and get better terms  of  service,

better salaries for themselves, is reported back and

used  as  propaganda for the Communists against  our

own country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the quicker we act, the better it

is for us. And I appeal to all those who claim to be

anti-Communists or even non-Communists  to  try  and

help  turn this tide which the Communists are trying

their  best  to make flow in their favour.  Try  and

turn  the  tide. The best way to do it  is  for  the

democratic forces like Singapore, Malaya and  Borneo

to unite, because unity is strength.



<br><br>6.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  the  Member for Hong Lim  has  said  quite

correctly  that  all  right-thinking  people  should

support  the  principle  and  concept  of  Malaysia.

Therefore,  it  follows  logically  that  those  who

oppose the principle of the concept of Malaysia must

be out of their minds. But we must carefully examine

the  lunacy  of those who oppose this  principle  of

Malaysia.  We  have in this Assembly  an  incredible

situation  where the Barisan Sosialis  is  the  only

Party that has opposed the motion in the name of the

Prime Minister. But it would be foolish indeed if we

were  to  think  that  the  people  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis are just mad men. I will prove to the House

that  there  is a sinister motive and method  behind

the apparent lunacy of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and again it has been said by us and by

Members  on  the Opposition Benches themselves  that

the Barisan Sosialis is taking the line from outside

sources. In other words, many of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>13 Barisan Assemblymen sitting on the opposite side

are  not  the  people who decide  or  determine  the

objects of the Party or the line of the Party;  many

of  them  are  mere  stooges, and there  are  bigger

people behind the scenes who are directing which way

the Barisan Sosialis should go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson, Mr Bani, attended two

C.P.A.  Consultative Solidarity Committee  meetings.

One  was held on the 18th and 19th of December  last

year  in  Kuching, and the other in Kuala Lumpur  on

7th  and 8th of January this year. At that time, the

Member for Thomson did not disagree with the idea of

Malaysia.  The  very  fact  that  he  attended   the

meetings  would  obviously indicate that  his  Party

supports the idea of Malaysia. But suddenly  on  the

18th  of  January, when we were having a  debate  on

West  Irian,  the  Member for  Thomson  uttered  two

startling statements. Firstly, he said that Malaysia

is   anti-Indonesia.  Secondly,  Indonesia  is   the

heartland of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have to find out why is it that the Member

for  Thomson has taken a sudden change in the  line.

The  reason  is  quite simple if I  were  to  inform

Members  of  the House that the Communist  Party  of

Indonesia,  the P.K.I., moved a resolution  opposing

Malaysia  on 31st December, 1961. Therefore,  before

this resolution of the P.K.I. was issued, Members of

the  Barisan Sosialis would not know which  line  to

adopt. After that resolution was issued on the  31st

December, 1961, it filtered down to Singapore to the

Barisan.  That was why on the 18th of  January,  the

Member  for  Thomson  uttered  these  two  startling

statements,  namely, that Malaysia is anti-Indonesia

and  Indonesia is the heartland of Malaysia.  It  is

very   obvious,  Mr  Speaker,  that  a  number   of

Assemblymen from the Barisan Sosialis did  not  know

that  this  resolution had been taken by the  P.K.I.

and  that  this  was  the  line  for  the  Communist

followers in Singapore to adopt. That would  explain

very clearly the sudden twist in the Barisan policy.

It  is  rather absurd for Mr Lim Ching  Siong,  the

Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis,   to

pronounce at the Kuala



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



Lumpur  Malayan Socialist Conference that it is  the

P.K.I. who  is following the Barisan  and  not  the

Barisan  that is following the P.K.I. May  I  remind

Members  of this House that the Communist  Party  of

Indonesia,   the  P.K.I.,  is  the   third   largest

Communist  Party in the world'? Who is  the  Barisan

that  the  P.K.I. should  follow  it?  The  Barisan

compared to the P.K.I., is only a Party of piddlers.

You  would not expect their Chairman, Mr Aidit, and

his  followers, to follow the Member for  Nee  Soon,

the  Member for Thomson or the Secretary General  of

the   Barisan  Sosialis.  They  are  faced  with   a

ridiculous situation where the Secretary-General  of

the  Barisan Sosialis is only a big frog in a  small

well, saying that it is the P.K.I. that follows  the

Barisan and not the Barisan that follows the P.K.I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis

incidentally  also  said in Kuala  Lumpur  that  the

latest   allegation  against  the  Barisan  Sosialis

Members  was  that they were reactionary Communists;

that is, as if reactionary Communists were something

and  progressive Communists something else. But  you

will  notice that he never at that conference denied

that  there are Communists in the Barisan  Sosialis.

He   just  tried  to  explain  that  there  may   be

reactionary Communists in the Barisan and that there

may  also  be progressive Communists in the  Barisan

Sosialis.  But may I also add that Lenin  also  said

that  there  are also good Communists and  infantile

Communists.  From what we can see,  there  arc  many

infantile Communists in the Barisan Sosialis. It  is

rather   an  awkward  situation  that  the   Barisan

Sosialis face now, that they find themselves  taking

the  wrong stand, and having taken the wrong  stand,

then  try to explain it away or to white-wash  their

stand  by  saying that we who support  Malaysia  are

anti-Communists. Therefore, to follow  that  logical

reasoning,  those  who  oppose  Malaysia   must   be

Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning's newspapers gave quite a

considerable  coverage  to the  so-called  Socialist

Conference in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



I  have no doubt that Members of the House have read

what  has  been  reported in the Press.  We  in  the

P.A.P. are not against any political Party per  se.

But  it  is  quite logical that when the  P.A.P. is

attacked, we must therefore reply. Here we have  Mr

Stephen   Yong,  Secretary-General  of  the  Sarawak

United  People's Party, saying at the  Kuala  Lumpur

Conference, "We do not wish to be liberated  by  the

P.A.P." Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. has no desire,  much

less  the means, to extricate Mr Stephen Yong  from

the  soup that he is in. We have not the wherewithal

to  liberate  the S.U.P.P. from the embrace  of  the

Communists or the clutches of the Barisan. It is  up

to Mr Stephen Yong himself to free his own Party so

that his Party will have its own independence there.

It  would  be churlish indeed, in fact it  would  be

presumptuous, for the P.A.P. to say that we want  to

liberate  him.  But I would say  to  the  people  in

Sarawak  that it is not the Federation of Malaya  or

Singapore  or the P.A.P. that is going  to  liberate

Sarawak. All I say is this. If Sarawak does not wake

up,  one  day  it will find that it is going  to  be

liberated  by  people who have  got  the  guns,  the

aeroplanes  and the warships. I do not  believe  the

people of Singapore and the people of the Federation

are  that war-like that we will go around liberating

Sarawak. On the contrary a large number of people in

Sarawak  and the Borneo territories, have  expressed

their  real  fears  that either they  come  together

united  with the Federation of Malaya and  Singapore

and so preserve their own integrity, or one day they

will be "liberated".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysia Socialist Conference

passed a number of resolutions one of which reads as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Strongly condemn the White Paper on merger

between   Singapore  and  Malaya  and  the   present

Malaysia  proposals of the Alliance and the  British

Governments  as  being hostile  to  the  concept  of

Malaysia and directed against progressive forces  in

this  region  and  aimed as  a  military  threat  to

Indonesia.'



<br><br>I would like to take up that point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is from the Straits Times, is

it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes, it is from the Straits

Times of today. I wouid like to take up two points

in this passage. (1) Malaysia being hostile to the

concept  of  Malaysia. (2) Malaysia is a  military

threat to Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our minds, the concept of Malaysia is

very   simple  indeed.  It  means  that  the  five

territories   of   the   Federation   of   Malaya.

Singapore,  North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei  come

together as a single unit - to be united as a single

State.  That is our concept of Malaysia. So  I  do

not possibly see how such a concept can be hostile

to  the  concept of Malaysia. This is where  those

who  supported this resolution at the Kuala Lumpur

Conference should clarify to the people.  What  is

their  concept of Malaysia? Does their concept  of

Malaysia  mean  in  the terms of  the  Member  for

Thomson,  that  Indonesia  is  the  heartland   of

Malaysia?  If that is so, then I fully agree  that

the  union  of our five territories - the Federation

of    Malaya,   Borneo,   Sarawak,   Brunei    and

Singapore - is not in keeping with the thinking that

was  propounded by the Member for Thomson, namely,

that Indonesia is the heartland of Malaysia. It is

quite  likely that when they moved this resolution

yesterday,  at  the back of their minds  they  did

think that the union of these five territories  is

hostile to their concept of Malaysia. It is rather

stupid  of  the so-called socialists  to  consider

such a union of our five territories as a military

threat  to Indonesia. Sir, we are not soldiers  in

this  House. It is pretty obvious even from common

sense that to be a military threat to any country,

first  of  all,  we  must  have  the  means,   the

wherewithal,  the arms, the forces  which  can  be

poised to attack. There are only 10 million people

in  the five territories of the proposed State  of

Malaysia  and  there  are 96  million  people,  in

Indonesia.  Can 10 million people  of  the  future

State  of  Malaysia  be  a threat  to  96  million

Indonesians? Why should such a concept of Malaysia

be  a threat to Indonesia? If there are powers  to

threaten Indonesia, it must be the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



colonial   powers.   The   Indonesians   know   it

themselves.  It  was  the Dutch.  We  supported  a

motion in which we agreed to the Indonesian  claim

to  West Irian. That was because Dutch colonialism

was  a  threat to Indonesia. But 10 million people

in  Malaysia  cannot  be a threat  to  96  million

Indonesians. Let me quote a statement made by  the

Minister  for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  during

the  debate on West Irian in the General  Assembly

of the United Nations on 20th November, 1961. This

is what Dr Subandrio said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are not only disclaiming the territories

outside the former Netherlands East Indies, though

they  are of the same island, but more than  that,

when  Malaya  told us of her intentions  to  merge

with  the three British Crown Colonies of Sarawak,

Brunei and British North Borneo as one Federation,

we  told them that we have no objections and  that

we  wish  them  success with this merger  so  that

every one may live in peace and freedom.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So that every one may live in peace and freedom."

That is what Malaysia intends to do: that Malaysia

will  live  side by side in peace with  the  Great

Republic  of  Indonesia. We have no  intention  of

liberating other territories; we have no intention

of  aggrandizement. How then  can  Malaysia  be  a

threat to Indonesia, when the Minister for Foreign

Affairs,  Dr  Subandrio, stated  in  the  General

Assembly that his country wished that this merger,

i.e.,  Malaysia, will meet with success?  Who  are

the people who adopt the stand against Malaysia?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Wednesday, the Straits Times published a

resolution moved by the P.K.I. opposing  Malaysia.

It is pretty obvious to all people who can add one

and  one are two and not three, that not only  the

Barisan Sosialis, but those who were in charge  of

this  so-called Malaysian Socialist Conference  in

Kuala  Lumpur were doing nothing but purely taking

up  the  P.K.I. line.  It is  a  sad  thing,  Mr

Speaker, that a group of people should seize  upon

the  word "socialist" and proclaim themselves also

as  democrats when at the Kuala Lumpur  Conference

those  who were in charge of that meeting  refused

to  agree to discuss a paper on Malaysia submitted

by the PAP. The so-called democrats



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



at the Socialist Conference were afraid of the facts

and  arguments which would argue for  the  cause  of

Malaysia.   Because   of  that,   an   extraordinary

statement  was issued that the P.A.P. bad  prejudged

the issue. But it is really the other way round.  Is

it   not   possible  that  those  who  wanted   that

conference to oppose Malaysia had also prejudged the

issue?  In  fact,  they were  prepared  to  receive

papers  or to listen to speeches which were  against

Malaysia. These are the so-called democrats and  so-called socialists who refuse to agree to even  allow

a   delegation,  an  invited  delegate,   at   their

conference to speak on what was considered  a  basis

for the argument that Malaysia should be founded  as

soon  as possible. In fact, the P.A.P. went  to  the

Conference  just as much as we went  to  the  C.P.A.

Solidarity   Consultative   Conference   with    the

understanding  that those who attended  the  meeting

would agree on the idea of Malaysia. It was called a

Malaysian Socialist Conference to discuss Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, Sir, if we had known right from the

beginning  that that conference had no intention  at

all  of accepting Malaysia, then it would have  been

correct  for us not to attend that meeting,  hut  to

decline  the invitation. We do not wish to attend  a

meeting  where the idea is to disagree. We  wish  to

attend  a meeting of parties where agreement can  be

reached.  It was a sad case indeed that we misjudged

the   intentions   of  those  who   organised   that

conference in Kuala Lumpur. We had accepted in  good

faith  that they would receive the idea of  Malaysia

and  would put out concrete proposals how socialists

in  Malaysia could come together to help to  advance

the  cause of Malaysia. Instead my colleagues to the

delegation,   the   Minister   for   Culture,    the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   `Minister   for

Education, Mr Devan Nair, Mr Jek Yuen Thong, Inche

Rahim Ishak, were treated with a show of booing  and

shouts  of,  "Go back to Singapore!" The Member  for

Queenstown, who is not here now, took great  delight

in  this  Chamber  just now that my  colleague,  the

Minister for Culture, was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



booed  at. But it just shows, Mr Speaker, the  rude

and crude manners of the Barisan Sosialis -



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> P.A.P. talking

about manners!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Here at least we can conduct a

meeting where we allow people to speak and we do not

resort  to booing. But this is Barisan civilisation,

Barisan culture, Barisan manners - rude and crude.  We

were shouted at, "Go back to Singapore!" I, for one,

would say, Mr Speaker, I am glad that my delegation

came  back  to  Singapore where proceedings  can  be

carried out in a more civilized manner than in Kuala

Lumpur.  We do not treat our guests as if they  were

lepers  to  be booed at. Sir, even lepers at  Sungei

Buloh  are  treated with good care.  If  you  are  a

guest, you are a guest. You expect some hospitality,

some  kindness and not to have a group  of  ruffians

placed in the gallery to boo, heckle and Shout,  "Go

back to Singapore!" This was a socialist conference.

I thought. Sir, socialists are gentlemen. I am quite

sure this is not part of Marx's or Lenin's teachings

of  socialism. These are people who are immature and

infantile -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Hitler.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - who tried to practise their

own  ideas  of socialism, who want to be  two  marks

above  Marx  and three marks above Lenin,  and  four

marks  above Stalin. That is the Barisan  and  their

colleagues  who organised that conference  in  Kuala

Lumpur -



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Go back, the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, there is one very

significant  point at that meeting in Kuala  Lumpur.

The  P.A.P. may have been condemned and expelled  by

that  socialist meeting. May I say this  also:  that

the Member for Anson was not present at the last day

of  the  meeting of the conference. Was he expelled?

Was  he  condemned? Perhaps the Barisan could answer

it.  He  was  not  present on the last  day  of  the

conference when these resolutions were carried out -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Seconded by the Workers'

Party.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is what I say. It is with

very  great regret indeed that today we are debating

a  motion  which has been amended by the Member  for

Anson.  U.M.N.O., S.P.A., the United People's Party,

the  P.A.P. have agreed to accept the amended motion

proposed by the Member for Anson -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Chairman of the Workers' Party.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Chairman of the Workers'

Party.  It  is a matter for great regret  indeed.  I

feel very sorry for the Member for Anson in that his

delegation  should  go along and  take  a  different

stand  behind  his  back. A great pity  indeed,  Mr

Speaker.  I sympathise with him and I hope  that  he

will  learn  his lesson, just as we have learnt  our

lesson. Sir, the P.A.P. has been expelled. And  why?

"Ha, ha! The P.A.P. has been expelled! They are more

socialists! Ha, ha! I am hereby expelled!" Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was wondering how the

Official  Reporter is going to report that sentence.

[Laughter] Dr Toh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I think the world must be

tickled with laughter to hear who should decide  who

should be sodalists. Is it God who should decide who

is a socialist and who is a non-socialist? Or is the

Member for Nee Soon or the Member for Queenstown  or

the  Barisan  who  should decide  who  should  be  a

socialist and who should be a non-socialist? -



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The P.A.P. should decide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Barisan will decide.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It is quite clear. Their

argument  is this: the P.A.P. went to the conference

in  Kuala Lumpur to uphold the principle and concept

of  Malaysia, whereas the others - the seven so-called

socialist  Parties - were against Malaysia. Therefore,

those who are against Malaysia are socialists. Those

who are for Malaysia are not socialists. That is -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> P.A.P. logic.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - the logic of that conference

at Kuala Lumpur - reductio ad absurdum. Sir, we could

not   care   less   what  grandiose  statement,   or

resolution that conference at Kuala Lumpur issued on

our  expulsion. We could not care less. We know that

there   are   bigger   people  behind   the   scenes

controlling  the  conference. The  Chairman  of  the

Conference himself admitted that he attended -  here,

may I quote from the Straits Times:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Inche Ishak added: "I went to Indonesia not

because  my Party sent me or my Party paid  for  me,

hut to learn and to see for myself."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite correct - Chairman of Labour Party. Inche Ishak,

Chairman of Party Raakyat, Inche Boestamam, attended

a  Parti  Indo  conference, a  conference  of  Party

Indonesia.  I put it to the House, supposing  I,  or

any  of  my  colleagues, had  attended  a  political

meeting  organised by some foreign  country  and  we

came  back here, would we be dubbed as nationalists?

Do  we  fight really for the benefit and welfare  of

Singapore, Malaya and Malaysia? Do we or do we  not?

The  inference is quite clear. A conference was held

of  Parti  Indo  in  Jakarta sometime  in  December,

attended  by  the  Chairman of  Party  Raakyat,  the

Chairman  of the Labour Party has admitted  in  this

statement. Suddenly we find a change in the line  on

Malaysia.  What other conclusions can we draw  other

than  that the line was laid down in Jakarta? It  is

not the Member for Nee Soon who, I hope, is going to

speak  after  me, who decides what the Barisan  line

is,  or  his colleagues sitting down there. The  big

chaps  who will decide the Barisan line are  not  in

this  chamber.  They are outside.  I  say  that  our

Barisan Members in this Chamber are just puppets and

stooges,  and  I  feel sorry for  them  because,  at

least,  when they were in the P.A.P. we  had  weekly

Assemblymen's meeting where they could criticise  us

and scold us for any shortcomings, and they could at

least  try  to have a say in formulating  the  Party

line. But these poor 13 Assemblymen are now stranded

like  fish  amidst a flotsam on the  shore.  I  feel

sorry for them indeed. So it is very clear that  the

Barisan,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



like  the  six other so-called socialist Parties  at

this Kuala Lumpur Conference, are just adopting  the

P.K.I. resolution moved on 31st  December,  or,  at

least,  issued on 31st December. We could understand

why  the  Member  for  Thomson,  Mr  Bani,  at  two

successive   meetings  of  the   C.P.A.   Solidarity

Consultative  meeting in Kuching and  Kuala  Lumpur,

did  not  attack the idea of Malaysia. It  look  one

week  for  that  resolution moved by the  P.K.I. to

filter down to Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Now, he will attack it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - and then it was adopted. That

was  the tactic, the line, the direction given  that

is now being adopted by the Barisan. I will say that

the  P.A.P. first  and foremost  is  a  nationalist

Party.  I can say this for me and for a good  number

of  my colleagues, that we formed the Party to fight

colonialism because we were nationalists and against

British  colonialism. We are still nationalists  and

we  have always put the cause of nationalism  first.

We put party ideology second. I say that the Barisan

Sosialis  is not a nationalist Party. It is prepared

to  sacrifice the interest of the people of Malaysia

in  the interest of the Communist ideology. In other

words,  they  are  prepared to be a  stooge  of  the

P.K.I.  They  were  all for the liberation  of  West

Irian. They were very enthusiastic indeed. They were

very  keen to liberate West Irian. They put up three

girls as a front - as the vanguard. The women are  the

vanguard and the men are the rearguard. The  Barisan

Sosialis were very keen to liberate West Irian.  But

when  it  comes  to the interest of  the  people  of

Singapore,   the   long-term   interest    of    the

heterogenous  people  who live  in  the  territories

which we call Malaysia -  the Malays, the Chinese, the

Indians, the Dyaks and the Ibans - the people  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis say that such a concept  is  anti-Indonesian, it is a military threat to Indonesia and

that, instead, Indonesia should be the heartland  of

Malaysia. We can see from their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



gimmicks   that   they   have   thoroughly   exposed

themselves,  that they are not a nationalist  Party,

and  that they are prepared to sacrifice the  people

of Singapore to some other foreign power.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I stood

up  in  this House and, in all seriousness,  made  a

profound pronouncement -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Written by somebody else.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - that in order to study the

English  language one must first learn to  read  the

think  that I have suddenly developed a link  in  my

head.  For  what,  Sir? For what I  have  sought  to

pronounce  in all seriousness is but a  simple  home

truth,  one  so true that to reiterate  it  in  this

Chamber would certainly appear ridiculous. But  when

it  comes to matters a little more complicated, many

people  begin  to see only the wood and  lose  sight

completely  of the trees. Having sat  for  the  last

four  days  now in this Chamber listening  to  words

both  articulate and eloquent, I am  convinced  that

many  of  the highest intellectual order can succumb

to  the  malady  of losing sight of the  fundamental

principles in the field of minutiae.

House  seeks  support  in  principle  for  the  Plan

proposed by the Prime Minister of the Federation  of

Malaya.  Tunku  Abdul  Rahman,  and  agreed  to   in

principle in the Federal Parliament on 18th October,

1961 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Did the Socialist Front agree?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - for the establishment of the

Federation of Malaysia. In moving his motion in  the

Federal  Parliament on 16th October last  year,  the

Tunku  made  it  abundantly clear  that  insofar  as

Singapore  was  concerned  the  new  Federation   of

Malaysia meant the admittance of Singapore into  the

proposed new Federation on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



basis of the P.A.P. proposed merger. In order not to

misunderstood, the Tunku went on in some  detail  to

clarify the word "merger" used in the context of his

speech  in Parliament that day. He said - and this  is

to  be  found in the Straits Times of 17th  October,

1961, at page 10:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to say at this point that the word

"merger" has generally come to be accepted as a  way

of    expressing    the   future   integration    of

constitutional relations between the Federation  and

Singapore.  But let us not forget that  the  broader

concept  of Malaysia of course is a merger too,  hut

on a larger scale.'



<br><br>He continued to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Therefore when I refer to "merger", it will be

directly  in  relation  to  Singapore  and  also  to

Malaysia  because  merger  with  Singapore   is   an

essential part of the Malaysia ideal.'.



<br><br>Sir,  in the new proposed Malaysia, Singapore cannot

be   accepted   on   the  basis  of   equality   and

proportionate   representation.   This   has    been

established  as  a  fact. Singapore  would  only  be

admitted  on  the  basis of partnership  in  Command

Paper  No.  33 of 1961 which sets out the  heads  of

agreement  for  a merger between the  Federation  of

Malaya  and  Singapore. In the first  page  of  this

document,  Sir, the Prime Minister of Singapore,  in

his  letter to the Prime Minister of the Federation,

made  it very clear that he understood that Malaysia

meant the participation of Singapore on the basis of

P.A.P. merger contained in this White Paper, for  he

had written in his letter to the Tunku - I quote:



<br><br>`My dear Prime Minister,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall that in our discussions on the

constitutional  framework to effect  the  merger  of

Singapore with the Federation of Malaya in  the  new

Federation   of   Malaysia   we   agreed   upon    a

memorandum...'-



<br><br>making  it  very clear that insofar as Singapore  is

concerned, merger and Malaysia is one and  the  same

thing.  Yet, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is this strange

attempt  to  pass  off Malaysia as  something  quite

different  from  the  P.A.P. merger,  and  the  more

surprising  part  of the story is  that  there  were

people gullible enough to swallow this line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have seen Members who outright rejected

Command Paper No. 33



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



of  1961 in this House and yet supported this motion

after making high-falutin speeches in support  of  a

vague  concept which was never meant to  apply.  The

concept of bringing smaller nations together under a

planned  economy  for  the  mutual  betterment   and

upliftment  of  each  other is laudable  and  is  in

keeping  with  socialist thinking and  is  something

that  no  socialist  can  reject.  But,  is  planned

economy the objective of the proposed Malaysia?  No,

it  is not. And all honest people know and say  that

it  is not. But then, how is that that certain self-proclaimed socialists still support this Plan? There

must  be quite a lot of political confusion in  this

House  on  this  issue.  But  then,  Sir,  political

confusion does not seem to be anything new  in  this

House, for during the debate on the motion on merger

moved  by  the Minister for Labour, we had witnessed

how adept and expertly the Member for Cairnhill, who

has just left the Chamber, was in the art of turning

political  somersaults.  He  had  so  very  fiercely

attacked  the Government for calling something  that

was  obviously not a merger a merger, and  when  it

came  to  an  amendment expressing his doubts  in  a

positive form, he rejected it.



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It now appears, Sir, that the Member for Cairnhill

is  not  alone  in this House in the  art  of  being

politic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is my intention to

develop my arguments in three phases on this motion.

Firstly, I want to show that as far as Singapore  is

concerned, Malaysia means P.A.P. merger, and  P.A.P.

merger  means Malaysia. I hope I have made my  point

very  clear and will not want to further labour  the

House  on  the obvious. So far as we in the  Barisan

Sosialis  are  concerned, we are consistent  in  our

political stand. We have rejected the P.A.P. merger

as  contained in Command Paper No. 33  of  1961.  We

therefore  are  now moral-bound and honour-bound  to

reject  this motion before the House. Secondly,  Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The P.K.I. has said no

Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - I intend to trace the

political  background that led to the P.A.P. merger

and  the concept of Malaysia insofar as the Minister

for  Finance  has given this House his side  of  the

story  - though  it was quite uncalled  for,  because

what he said were the second-hand extracts from  the

Prime  Minister's broadcast talks recently. In  view

of  this, Sir, I am sure the House will hear me  out

with  indulgence. Further, the Minister for  Finance

was   reiterating  propaganda  material  which   has

already been tabled in this House and distributed to

all  Members  in  the form of a  booklet  named  The

Battle for Merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about propaganda booklets, Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I am reminded of the story told to  me

of   the   embarrassment  of   the   United   States

Information  Service in Hongkong not  so  very  long

ago.   The  U.S.I.S. used  to  produce  a  lot   of

propaganda booklets for distribution in Hongkong and

other   South-East   Asian  countries.   They   were

extremely  pleased with themselves when  they  found

that as soon as the booklets were produced they went

out  of  circulation and reprints  had  to  go  into

press.  But  after some time, they  discovered  that

nobody  seemed to have heard of - far less read of - the

information contained in those booklets and  it  was

only after a great deal of trouble and investigation

that  they  found, to their great dismay, that  some

enterprising paper-mill had taken care of all  their

publications!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Some of your henchmen carry it

around.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The propaganda booklets had

met  their inglorious end in the pulping machine  of

the  paper-mill.  And the mess of printing  ink  and

paper  pulp, after being duly treated and  bleached,

was  remade  into white paper. The paper mill  owner

was,  I  am told, by no means a Communist or even  a

pro-Communist. On the contrary, he was  a  real  and

true  capitalist. He was quite ready to explore  and

exploit every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



avenue that could bring in profit. But the Americans

in  Hongkong had some decency left, for they did not

attempt  to smear the owner of the paper-mill  as  a

Communist.  Quite  unlike  the  P.A.P.,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir. In the third part of my  argument,  I

would  like  to  retrace some  of  the  events  that

transpired after the Tunku made his proposals and of

the  Communist and pro-Communist smear of the P.A.P.

against  all those who did not see eye to  eye  with

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I will begin where the Minister for

Finance  passed off. It is a pity he is not  in  the

House now. I will begin in the pre-general elections

era  when the P.A.P. was supposed to be at the  peak

of  political good fortune. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.

I  was  alleged  to have joined the  P.A.P. at  the

height of its popularity and scooted on the day when

the  fortunes of the P.A.P. were at its lowest  ebb.

Obviously, Sir, the purpose of the allegation is  to

brand   me   as   an  opportunist,   for   character

assassination is the spearhead of the vicious  smear

campaign  of  the P.A.P. The leaders of  the  P.A.P.

knew  that it would be laying it on too thick  if  I

were called a Communist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Fair enough.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Has the Member forgotten he

told  me  that  he  did not think that  even  if  he

applied for membership, the Communists would  accept

him  because  he  did not have enough  iron  in  his

stomach?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my

point  is  exactly that, because the Prime  Minister

knew it would be laying it on too thick to brand  me

as a Communist. He had to invent some other name.  I

am not here to prove that I am not a Communist. I do

not care whether they call me a Communist. The Prime

Minister  knows he cannot get away  with  it  if  he

calls   me  a  Communist.  So  I  was  labelled   an

opportunist. And he has just made the point  clearer

than I can put forward.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put the record straight, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, it is a pity that the Minister for Home Affairs

is not here, for he will know the truth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He is only interested in men

with iron in their stomachs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I had been in the P.A.P. since

1957  and was re-registered during the second  phase

of  re-registration in the Party in 1958. I am  sure

the  Prime Minister will remember that his authority

in  those  days  was never respected by  the  Changi

Branch  and that it was I who, after re-registration

in the P.A.P., was appointed Secretary to the Branch -



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> Order. I hope the

Member  can satisfy the Chair, but right now I  find

it difficult to understand how all this fits in with

the  motion  we are now debating. It  is  quite  all

right  for  the Member just to clarify  remarks,  if

any,  made by the Government Benches; but if he goes

too much into the details of his personal conduct in

the  P.A.P. and so on, then he is completely out  of

order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> With great respect, Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, before I pursued my line, I  made  it

very clear that the Minister for Finance had taken a

great  deal  of  time in this House to  explain  the

political  background that led to the split  in  the

P.A.P. and  subsequently to the  disagreement  over

Malaysia. I have said, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that

in  view of his remarks and in view of the act  that

the  Prime Minister had thought fit to make a series

of  12 broadcast talks about us, and in view of  the

fact  that a new book entitled The Battle far Merger

is  now  being published and tabled, I am sure  this

House  would be indulgent enough to hear me  say  my

little piece. I will not be very long, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Minister for Finance

has explained the historical background of the split

that  led  to the formation of the Barisan Sosialis,

that  is not anything personal about the Member  for

Nee  Soon. So if the Member likes to touch on  that,

he can briefly touch on the background of the split.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> With great respect, Sir, I

will  take your advice. I am sure the Prime Minister

will remember that his authority was never respected

in  the  Changi Branch before the general elections,

and  it  was I who helped him to steer the Committee

and  to help him get the committee to accept certain

of his directives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Pshaw! Come on!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> He seems to have a very short

memory.  It  is more accurate, Sir, to  say  that  I

joined the P.A.P. during a very difficult period  in

the P.A.P. I joined the Changi Branch when there was

a  crisis in the Branch. And it was the people  like

me  and  all the candidates together who helped  the

P.A.P. win the elections; certainly not the Minister

for  Education  Who has also been called  the  Asian

expatriate  among  insurance  circles.  Perhaps  his

memory will not be too short too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be pertinent, Sir, to mention that when I

left the Party, I left it when it was in government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You were expelled; you did not

leave the Party.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> And it is not too pretentious,

Sir, to add that when I was in the Party, I was then

in the good books of the Prime Minister, much to the

discomfiture -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I still cannot follow

how  all this fits in with the motion which  we  are

now debating. I have already made my ruling, that if

the  Member  for  Nee Soon wishes to  touch  on  the

background of the split between the Barisan Sosialis

and the P.A.P., it is all right. But if he goes into

the  details of his personal conduct in the  P.A.P.,

then it is completely irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg

your indulgence to let me say two more sentences. It

is not that I want to show what a good chap I am.  I

do  not  intend to do that. The important  thing  is

that  the P.A.P. myth that all those in the  Barisan

Sosialis are either Communists or opportunists  must

be  burst,  punctured, and exploded. And it  is  for

that  purpose  that I have reiterated  my  political

association -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on another point of

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Has the Member for Nee Soon

forgotten  that a few days ago, before the  vote  of

confidence  in  this Chamber, When he abstained  and

subsequently was expelled for it, he told me that he

saw  no way out because there was a collision coming

between the Communists and the P.A.P., that  he  did

not  want to be involved, and that he would like  to

retire from politics?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that

was only part of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, tell the whole lot.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, if you will allow me the

indulgence  of going through the whole  lot  in  the

House - if  you give inc that undertaking, Sir - I  will

certainly tell the whole lot.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think it is

right  for  the  Chair to let  the  House  hear  the

personalities  between the Prime  Minister  and  the

Member for Nee Soon. Perhaps it would be better  for

the Member to proceed with the motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I am much obliged. Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir. Thank you for the ruling. I will  look

for  another  opportunity to tell  my  part  of  the

story.

the extravagance of having it printed.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member please

proceed?  Perhaps  it would be  convenient  for  the

Member    to   address   the   Chair   and    ignore

interjections.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I will

attempt  to turn round and look at you and,  at  the

same time, refer to my notes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the basic P.A.P. political philosophy in

Singapore is that for the one man one vote system to

operate  in  Singapore,  only  Left-swing  political

Parties may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



get  a hearing from the people. The P.A.P. therefore

took  a Left-wing political stand to get into power.

Once  in  power, they were forced to  discard  their

political  mask,  for there was the  weight  of  the

Right-wing  reactionary  opinion  that  had  to   be

accommodated.  The  more  accommodating  they   made

themselves to the Right-wing reactionary forces, the

more  unsure  the P.A.P. leadership felt  themselves

vis-a-vis  the  masses. And every  reaction  of  the

masses  brought to their attention became the shadow

or  substance  of  the  Communist  line.  There  was

practically  a pathological fear, in the  hearts  of

the   P.A.P. leadership,  of  the  electorate   who

returned them to office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister was heard to comment on many occasions that if the system of democracy as interpreted into one man one vote was to be operated, in the sense of the word it would lead us all to ruination. I myself, Sir, would have used the word "ruin". Even my friends from Sarawak have heard

his  utterances  in this respect and  have  had  the

benefit  of his advice to do something about  it  in

Sarawak since the system of one man one vote is  not

yet  operative  there. As fear  began  to  grip  the

imagination of the P.A.P. leadership, they began  to

lose their sense of proportion. As the popularity of

the Party and of the Government dwindled from day to

day,  they  decided that they would throw  the  ball

hack to the people, particularly after Hong Lim, for

then they hoped going to the country would kill  two

birds with one stone. For in doing so it would  also

have  saved the face of the Prime Minister from  the

sound thrashing he received in Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You campaigned too.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Oh, yes, unfortunately, and

fortunately  not effective enough. [Interruption]  I

am coming to that.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Please proceed



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with

a  great  deal  of  respect.. I  shall  proceed.  We

consider that while



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



we  were in the P.A.P. we had been elected to fulfil

an election pledge to the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You chaps did not want to

resign.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Our main task was to pave the

way  for  a socialist Society. If in the performance

of our task we had met with difficulties - no doubt we

had - we should try to overcome those difficulties.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You have got no guts.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> And failing so, explain our

failings  to the people. To throw our hands  up  and

say  "We quit", was no solution to our sacred  task.

For  the  next  socialist government would  then  be

confronted  with even more difficult  obstacles.  It

was  then  that  those  of us  now  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis began not to see eye to eye with the P.A.P.

leadership.  We felt the paramount interest  is  the

interest of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And decided to take over.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> No, we never decided that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> So that you could become Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> No. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

the  Prime Minister and his associates felt that the

interests  of the ruling clique of the  P.A.P. must

take  precedence over everything else, even that  of

the  people,  and so they decided to resign  and  we

opposed the resignation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Party conference called to discuss this

matter,  our view prevailed, and it was agreed  that

we  should postpone the matter till after the  Anson

by-election. In the meantime, the Prime Minister and

his associates felt a deep pang of anxiety, for they

had   lost   their  iron  grip  on  the  hand-picked

cadres - cadres  hand-picked  by  the  Prime  Minister

himself  under the provisions of certain  safeguards

written  into  the  P.A.P. Constitution.  They  were

perturbed,  Sir,  that another  section  of  opinion

could have so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



easily prevailed over their own. What was even  more

disturbing was the fact that that section of opinion

was  led  by  Assemblymen and Organising Secretaries

who  were  at that moment the only cadre members  of

the  P.A.P. This meant that if anything came  up  to

the properly constituted cadre conference, the Prime

Minister  and  his  associates, unless  they  mended

their  ways, could easily be defeated by the supreme

authority  of  the Party. The cadre conference  thus

gave  them the jitters. For they were left with  the

choice of one of two roads. They could either return

to  the path of socialism or split the ranks of  the

socialists.  The  open  fight  between  the  genuine

socialists -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And the Communists!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - and fake socialists began.

Those who disagreed with the Prime Minister and  his

associates -  Rightist deviation  - were  regarded  as

anti-Party and had to be crushed at all costs. Those

of  us who had joined the P.A.P. for our ideological

convictions  and  not  for  cushy  jobs  were  in  a

dilemma.  We could neither accept au fait the  Prime

Minister's policy of Rightist deviation nor the open

split in the ranks of the socialists. We argued with

the  Prime Minister about the folly of his moves and

tried -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Could the Member just explain

what he meant by Rightist deviation and where he got

that term from?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, you

will  recall that when the Prime Minister got up  to

interrupt  me,  I explained that I  would  be  quite

pleased  to do that provided you would be  indulgent

enough to let me paint the whole background.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated to the

House  that the Member for Nee Soon could  reply  to

the  statement made by the Minister for Finance. And

so far he had made the point very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



clear,  that  is  the reason for the  split  in  the

P.A.P.  But  if  the Member is going into  too  many

details, then he is completely out of order. So  far

the Member has made his point very clear. I hope lie

will  go  on  with the motion which we are  debating

today.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

instead  of listening to us, he called us  Communist

stooges.  In his frenzied state of mind, he  saw  in

every  shadow a Communist threat. Instead of  trying

to  see  our point of view, he deliberately  blunted

his  previously acute mind to make believe  that  we

were  either naive or opportunistic. What  was  more

unfortunate, Sir, was that those of us who were with

him then, because we understood the difficulties  of

being  in  government and sympathised with  him  and

tried  with  reasonableness to convince him  of  the

wrongness of his policy, were slowly being  regarded

as his political enemies which we had never meant to

be. Sir, with the abruptness of the lightning symbol

of  the P.A.P., the purge was crashed into top gear.

Those of us -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you, I am very happy,

Mr Deputy Speaker -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member for Nee

Soon  should, as far as possible, try to avoid these

interjections and concentrate on his speech. If  the

Member  wants to make cross-talk across  the  Floor,

then  he  is  inviting more interjections  from  the

Government  side.  Will he please proceed  with  the

debate on the motion?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.

But  when compliments are being hurled this way,  it

is  only right for me to bow in acknowledgement. Now

that the Minister for Finance has just discovered my

latent talents, I must be very elated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I will put it down in writing!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Compliment from Woodhull!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Those of us who were then in

office  had  to  choose  between  sticking  to   our

political   convictions  or  to  seek  comfort   and

consolation in cushy jobs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> On a point of order,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I do not see any relevance in

all those remarks.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I have made the point

very  clear. Since the Minister for Finance has gone

into  this,  I  have given the Member for  Nee  Soon

ample  time to reply. If the Member for Nee Soon  is

going  into  too many details on this  controversial

subject of the split in the P.A.P., then I think  he

is completely out of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I was just

about to finish.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Thank God!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> My personal decision to quit

Government  was  not  a very difficult  one.  I  had

joined  the  Party from my ideological  convictions,

and  being a professional man, I would not and could

not  be  unemployed if I left the  Government.  But,

Sir,  my  colleagues who had to face  an  indefinite

period  of  unemployment had no qualms at all  about

quitting  their comfortable jobs. For that,  Sir,  I

saluted them in silence. The P.A.P. leadership,  now

in the last throes of its death struggle -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Are you mad?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - have suddenly found a new

viable   group  on  their  left,  and,  by   logical

displacement,   they  have,  therefore,   themselves

become  Right. It meant political suicide to  go  to

the  country.  So the election pledge at  Anson  was

conveniently  forgotten. An  all-out  onslaught  was

made on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



Barisan  Sosialis. The only good way left to  them

to kill the Barisan Sosialis was by labelling them

as Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Barisan Communists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - and take care of it under

the  P.P.S.O. That was not going to be a difficult

task,  if  the  Federation Government  would  play

ball.    The    Prime   Minister   stated    quite

categorically  in the Fourth Anniversary  Souvenir

that   the   Alliance  leaders   make   no   clear

distinction  between  democratic  socialists   and

Communists.   Anything   Left   is   viewed   with

apprehension. For anything Left is thought  to  be

Communist  or potential Communist and,  therefore,

that  was a convenient concept to use against  the

Barisan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia, Sir, was the first concrete step taken

by the P.A.P. to fix the new viable Left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the concept of Malaysia was

announced  long  before the Barisan  Sosialis  was

formed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, if I were to argue that

point,  I  could easily argue that the concept  of

Barisan  Sosialis  came  about  long  before   the

Barisan Sosialis -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, having spoken of the

viable  Left,  I  feel  it necessary  to  give  my

understanding of its meaning in this House so that

I may not be misunderstood. I anticipated that the

Minister  for  Finance  would  misunderstand   the

meaning of the word.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I thought we had discussed it.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I use the term "viable Left"

to  mean  and  to  cover all  Left-wing  political

forces  in  this country which are definitely  not

Communist.  The  Communists cannot be  politically

viable in Singapore because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



the  Communist Party is outlawed. The  P.A.P. has

always maintained that the ultimate contenders  in

the  Singapore political arena would be the P.A.P.

and the M.C.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> This statement is made with

the  fullest force. I hear echoes from  the  Back-benches. It is made with the fullest force so that

should  any challenge to the P.A.P. come from  the

Left, it could always be labelled as Communist. We

now  see the coming to fruition of that diabolical

plot.  The fact that the Barisan Sosialis  is  the

only  Left-wing more Left than the  P.A.P. today,

and only as Left as the P.A.P. was Left before  it

formed  the Government, has become a thorn in  the

flesh of the P.A.P. Whatever the P.A.P. may say to

the  contrary,  whatever irrelevant remarks  their

Back-benches make, that will not be worth a rebut.

The  people will know who is socialist and who  is

not  socialist. A general election will settle the

matter easily and conveniently. If I am a fake,  I

will be thrown out of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You will!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Let us go to the country and

see  who  gets thrown out. I do not mind if  I  am

thrown   out.   I  am  sure  other  more   genuine

socialists, so to speak, will take my place  here.

But when fake socialists are thrown out -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Nee

Soon  is  inviting more interjections and  counter

arguments from the Government side. I have already

indicated to him to address the Chair and  not  to

Members of the Government side.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, ever

since  the  Hong Lim by-election, the  P.A.P. was

looking  for  a good issue to throw  back  to  the

people.  But  the choice of the issue  is  a  very

delicate  matter. The issue must appear  to  be  a

nationalist  issue so that all  the  people  would

support  it. More important still, Sir,  was  that

the  issue  must weigh heavily in  favour  of  the

P.A.P., so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



should  a  referendum  be taken,  the  P.A.P. could

consider  a renewal of its mandate if the electorate

voted  for  it.  Merger was thought to  be  such  an

issue. But after preliminary tests were made of  the

ground   reaction,  the  Government  was   not   too

confident.  Now,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am

suggesting that the Government is seriously thinking

of  using  Malaysia  as an issue.  The  play-up  for

Malaysia in recent days is apparent. One has just to

step   out   of  the  Assembly  to  see  the   gaudy

decorations  around the circus and in front  of  the

town hall. There are multi-coloured posters all over

the place. The play-up for Malaysia can only be said

to  be  stupendous  in Singapore.  Malaysia  is  now

peddled  around  by the P.A.P. as the  panacea  that

would  cure all the ills of the people. We  saw  the

Prime Minister running around,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



Kuala Lumpur to Kuching; Kuching to Bangkok; Bangkok

to Saigon. He went all over the place trying to sell

the  idea of Malaysia. But, Sir, when it came  to  a

conference of genuine socialists -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is the Member suggesting that

I am a salesman for Malaysia in Bangkok -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.
