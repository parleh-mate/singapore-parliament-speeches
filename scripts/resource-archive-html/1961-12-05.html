pleasure to inform hon. Members that after the  motion*

was  carried  by  a majority vote at  11.45  p.m. last

night,   first   condemning  the  pickets   for   their

unreasonable  action, and, second,  sanctioning  police

protection   for  students  who  wish  to  take   their

examinations and for their parents who accompany  them,

there  were  no  more  pickets  today  in  any  of  the

examination  centres.  A total  of  628  students  took

supplementary  papers today for the  second  compulsory

paper  of  the  examination in Elementary  Mathematics,

making the total number of students who have taken  the

examinations 2,145 so far, i.e., 68 per cent.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House condemns the actions of the picketers in obstructing, intimidating

or otherwise forcefully preventing students from taking their examinations, and in

response to an appeal from parents of students who wish to take these examinations that

they and their children should be offered Police protection, hereby resolves that this

House approves of any action according to law by the Government through the Police to

protect students wishing to take their examinations to ensure that they are not intimidated or

injured, and that the students and their parents who accompany them are given free passage and access

into and out of all examination halls.

[21st November, 1961] to Question [20th November,1961],

reunification  of  Singapore  with  the  Federation  of

Malaya and to remove the artificial division created by

the  British by their policy of "divide and rule", this

reunification of these two territories in a  merger  of

Singapore   with   the  Federation  of   Malaya.".-(The

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I will continue my speech made last

Friday. Unfortunately, this debate on an important

question - merger - has been interrupted unnecessarily

by -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon.

Member is justified in saying that the debate has

been interrupted unnecessarily. It was quite an

important motion that was debated the whole of

yesterday.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what I mean to say is this, that this question of

merger is very important and should be clearly

decided upon so as to show what kind of phoney

merger the P.A.P. is trying to bring about to the

people. We in the Barisan Sosialis, especially the

Member for Queenstown, have indicated at the time

of moving the amendment that the Prime Minister has

already been exposed in bringing about a phoney

merger. Several questions were raised but there was

no reply whatsoever from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of citizenship after merger and the

significance of the so-called nationality  have  so

far  not  been  properly  clarified  by  the  Prime

Minister  to  the people of Singapore. Furthermore,

there  has been a great deal of unnecessary  issues

and  side issues on the nationality and citizenship

problems  to confuse the vision of the  people.  It

was  reported  in  the leading newspapers  of  this

country - the Sin Chew Jit Poh and the Nanyang  Siang

Pau - on the 26th and 27th of November that the State

Advocate-General had stated the distinction between

"citizenship" and "nationality". The State Advocate-General  said that according to the merger proposed

by  the  Prime  Minister, the present  citizens  of

Singapore  and  those  in the Federation  would  be

equally   considered  as  nationals  of   the   new

Federation on Merger Day. That is to say, they will

enjoy equal rights and privileges on Merger Day and

will  thereafter  shoulder  equal  obligations  and

responsibilities without any distinction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



at  all. Mr Speaker, Sir, the S.A.G.'s explanation

of  nationality is correct. We can  see  that  this

question of nationality has a meaning only  as  far

as  foreign countries are concerned, but  from  the

newspaper report of the 26th November, we also read

a  statement issued by the Prime Minister's  Office

pinpointing the opinion given by the S.A.G. In this

statement,  it is stated that whether a  person  is

called a Federation national or citizen, he has  no

addition to or subtraction of his rights.  What  is

the  meaning of the statement issued by  the  Prime

Minister's  Office? I think it is  nothing  but  to

confuse  the  views  of the  people  in  regard  to

nationality   and  citizenship.  If   this   merger

arrangement  materialises, I  would  like  to  know

whether  the local citizens in Singapore  would  be

able to have a common political life with those  in

the  Federation. Would it also mean that  according

to   the  merger  arrangement  made  by  the  Prime

Minister,  the  unemployed  citizens  in  Singapore

would  be able to get employment in the Federation?

There  is another question, that is, after  merger,

will  the  Federation  Government  treat  Singapore

citizens  without  any  discrimination  whatsoever?

From  this Statement issued by the Prime Minister's

Office,  we  can  see  that a  citizen  is  usually

considered  to be a person enjoying certain  rights

within  his  own  country,  and  the  question   of

nationality is only applicable to the status  of  a

person  in  the international field. So  from  this

paragraph  we  can see clearly that  the  so-called

nationality   is   only   applicable   to   foreign

countries,  and  this  so-called  equal  status  of

citizens  is  only applicable to  our  own  country

alone.  Therefore,  we can  see  that  there  is  a

distinction  between citizenship  and  nationality.

This  distinction  is  not inexplicable.  Then  why

should the Prime Minister have to give radio  talks

and   press   conferences  on   several   occasions

regarding this question? In spite of all  talks  by

the  Prime  Minister, the people of Singapore  have

not understood what he is trying to drive at. So it

is  obvious  that our Prime Minister is  not  being

frank and honest. He is afraid that the people will

easily discover that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



his merger is a phoney one. Whenever the Prime Minister

has occasion to talk about citizenship and nationality,

he  usually  tries to be very evasive and  talks  about

unimportant  things  in order to cover  up  his  phoney

merger which is a sell-out. As a result of this, he has

had to give directions to the State Advocate-General to

prepare  a  statement in regard to the nationality  and

citizenship questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the phoney merger arrangement made

by  the Prime Minister will bring about three different

classes  of  citizens.  The  first  are  those  Federal

citizens  who have absolute control in the  Parliament.

The   second  are  those  Singapore  citizens  who  are

eligible  to  elect  representatives  to  the   Central

Parliament  in  the Federation. The  third  are  those

citizens not born in Singapore and are not eligible  to

apply  for  Federal  citizenship.  This  last  type  of

citizens  will  not be able to take  part  in  national

affairs  although  they  have  to  carry  out  whatever

resolutions are passed by the Central Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, according to the phoney merger of the

Prime Minister, we can see that there is no true merger

or  a reunification of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya.  As  a  matter of fact, our Prime  Minister  is

trying  to come to a compromise with the Federation  to

sell out Singapore.



<br><br>2.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the debate on merger has

already  entered  the 11th day in this  House  and  the

Chairman  of the Barisan Sosialis, that is, the  Member

for  Queenstown, has given in his seven-hour speech his

analysis of the phoney merger of the P.A.P. leadership.

According to his analysis, this phoney merger is a sell-out of the interests of the people of Singapore. He has

also stated clearly the stand of our Party which is  to

bring  about  a true merger between Singapore  and  the

Federation in order to achieve a reunification  of  the

two territories. Singapore will enter the Federation as

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>



twelfth  State  and  all citizens  of  Singapore  Swill

automatically become Federal citizens on Merger Day.  A

proportionate number of representatives in relation  to

the  number  of citizens can be elected to the  Central

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that the so-called

merger  of the P.A.P. has been recognised as  a  phoney

merger which is a sell-out. The P.A.P. leadership -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> On a

point  of  order. So far the speech of the  Member  for

Serangoon  Gardens has been a repetition  of  what  the

previous speaker said. Can we not get some fresh  ideas

from the Barisan Sosialis?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am inclined to agree with that point

of  view. There has been repetition but fortunately  it

is  not  a  late  hour.  The repetition  has  not  been

tedious. Mr Leong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Why should the

P.A.P. leadership  want  to bring  about  this  phoney

merger?  I  think  they want to try to save  themselves

from  their  precarious position. What will the  phoney

merger  of the P.A.P. bring to the people of Singapore?

It will bring to them the loss of citizenship rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the true merger as proposed by the Barisan

Sosialis,  the  people of the two territories  will  be

better able to enjoy a common political life with equal

citizenship rights so that they will be able to have  a

political reunification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me explain clearly that the

P.A.P. is trying to bring about this phoney merger  to

save  themselves from their difficult position. We  all

remember that in 1959, the P.A.P. -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of order. We have

heard  about the 1959 elections and so on. All this  is

just a repetition of previous speeches.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister can be quite assured that I

have  my  sympathies for him and for  Members  of  this

Assembly, and I trust he has his sympathies for  me  as

well. I think the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>



hon. Member could still carry on a little while more to

see whether he can try my patience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In the last

general  elections, the P.A.P. got the full support  of

the  people  because they were toeing the line  of  the

people.  Now  they are discarded by the people  because

they  have gone against their Party platform  and  they

have  disregarded  the  opinion of  the  people.  Their

number  has  been reduced from 43 to 26 in this  House,

which means that they have a majority of only one seat.

So  now  nobody can be sure whether any  of  the  Back-Benchers might not come over to this side of the  House

after  examining their conscience and listening to  the

criticisms of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. leadership realise the expansion of the

Left-wing  forces in both Singapore and the Federation.

In  Singapore especially, the new socialist forces have

become  quite formidable, so that the P.A.P. leadership

have  now  to resort to mean methods to save themselves

from  their  precarious position. They try to  get  the

support of the S.P.A. in this House. They, want to  co-operate  with a Right-wing figure, namely,  the  Member

for  Cairnhill, so that they can stand together. During

the  debate  in this House, they have expressed  almost

the  same  views. From this, it is very clear that  the

P.A.P. is  going to the Right. Outside this  Assembly,

they are making use of the radio and the newspapers  to

disseminate fear by branding some persons as Communists

in  order that the people will not have the guts to  go

against them. They are trying to distract the attention

of the people so that they can bring about their phoney

merger  which  is  a sell-out of the interests  of  the

people  of  Singapore.  So  they  are  trying  to  save

themselves  at  the  expense  of  others.  The   P.A.P.

leadership  have even gone to the extent  of  splitting

unions  and brought politics into the unions. They  are

trying  to create suspicion among the races.  They  are

trying  to gain the support of the English-educated  so

that  they can perpetuate their divide-and-rule policy.

Apart  from  all this, the P.A.P. leadership  have,  in

fact, begged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>



for  assistance from the Federation in  order  to  save

themselves from their present predicament.



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, the so called phoney merger  of  the

P.A.P. is  nothing  but a sort of association  between

Singapore  and  the  Federation  on  the  basis  of   a

partnership.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Does the hon. Member agree with

me that that statement, "The so-called phoney merger of

the  P.A.P. is  nothing  but a  sort  of  association"

between  the two countries has, in fact, been  used  by

Members  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  perhaps  about  ten

times? I would like an answer because I do not want  it

to  be  said that I have misheard the speakers. I would

like to know whether I am right in my estimation of the

repetition  that  has occurred in  this  debate.  Am  I

right?



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I am just trying to go over this simply.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member does agree

that  there  has been a repetition of that phrase  time

and  again. So if he does agree, then perhaps  when  he

continues  his speech, he will try not to repeat  other

phrases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what will the phoney merger of the P.A.P. bring to the

people of Singapore? The P.A.P. is trying to disregard

the objective of the people of Singapore in their

struggle for citizenship since 1946. The P.A.P. even

goes to the extent of lowering the status of Singapore

citizens to one of second-class citizenship. If the

phoney merger of the P.A.P. materialises, then

Singapore citizens will be classified into three types.

The first type will be those who are Federal citizens

the second type will be Singapore citizens who  were

born here, and the third type will be Singapore

citizens who were not born here but -

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He is repeating exactly the words

of the previous speaker - three classes of citizens. Why

all this repetition?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I suggest to the Minister to be a

bit  more  patient,  and  try to  emulate  the  Speaker

perhaps?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Very well, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  know that because Singapore citizens cannot  become

Federal   citizens   automatically,   the   number   of

representatives elected to the Central Government  will

not   be  proportionate  to  the  number  of  citizens.

Originally  Singapore was entitled to  25  seats.  This

number  has  now  been reduced to  15.  Therefore,  the

Singapore  representatives in  the  Central  Parliament

will not have adequate strength to speak for the people

of  Singapore. Singapore citizens, because of the  loss

of citizenship -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Coward!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Did I hear the word "coward"

being used by an hon. Member? I am afraid I do not know

who  said  that word, but if the hon. Member  used  the

word "coward" of another Member of this Assembly, then,

of course, that is wrong. It is unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The workers in

Singapore  will not be able to seek employment  in  the

Federation. So the question of unemployment will not be

solved.  The farmers in Singapore will not be  able  to

get   allocations  of  land  in  the  Federation.   The

businessmen  in  Singapore,  because  of  the  loss  of

citizenship,   will   not  be  able   to   have   equal

opportunities  of  doing business  in  the  Federation.

Graduates of Singapore schools, because of the lack  of

proper  citizenship rights, will not be able  to  apply

for  admission to the civil service in the  Federation.

Can we retain the so-called



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>



autonomy forever? Or is this a question yet  to

be  answered by the Central Government, as  it  is  the

supreme authority in deciding policies?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One quarter of the revenue of Singapore, namely, $90

million,  has got to be paid to the Federal Parliament.

And  in  order to cover up the deficit, the  Government

here  may have to increase taxes. In the end, the lives

of the people of Singapore will be more difficult.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that we want to have a true

merger. We in the Barisan Sosialis endorse true merger,

so  that  Singapore  citizens will be  able  to  become

automatically   Federal   citizens    and    so    that

representatives  can  be elected from  among  Singapore

citizens, the number to be in proportion to the  number

of  its  citizens. Singapore citizens will be  able  to

stand  for  election  on  a national  basis,  including

election  to  the  Federal  Parliament  and  the  State

Assembly.  In  this way, there will be a  strong  force

from  the  representatives of the people of  Singapore,

and  we will be able to amend unreasonable legislation.

In this way also, workers, farmers, businessmen and the

produce of Singapore citizens will be enjoying a better

life because they have Federal citizenship. And in this

way  too,  the peoples of the two territories  will  be

able  to  enjoy common citizenship rights  and  lead  a

common political life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we want to distinguish between the

advantages  and  disadvantages  of  merger.   We   must

ascertain  the opinion of the people whether merger  is

advantageous  or  disadvantageous,  and  what  kind  of

merger we must have. This question should be decided by

the  one man one vote method. Who should represent  the

people of Singapore in the talks on merger between  the

Federation and Singapore? Well, we can have  a  general

election to answer this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am in full support of the amendment

tabled  by  our Party Chairman, who is the  Member  for

Queenstown.  In  this amendment,  we  want  to  seek  a

genuine merger.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Assembly has been

debating  for  over  two  weeks  the  question   of

supporting  in  principle the  merger  of  the  two

territories, and the amendment moved by the  Member

for  Queenstown. I do not want to  waste  any  more

time of the Assembly over the same question, as  my

colleagues  have replied to the criticisms  by  the

Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen. But there are several

points  which I feel I must bring out for emphasis.

These  points  have  already  been  emphasised   by

several Assemblymen in this House. What are these?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the debate began, several speakers have

stressed that the interests of the people must come

first,  that  we must always listen to the  people,

and  that  the interests of the Party  should  come

next. This is correct, of course. My colleagues and

I  entirely  agree with this point. And because  of

this,  the present political situation in Singapore

has  come about. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say this:

if  we are not carrying on in the interests of  the

people,  then our Party will be broken up.  But  we

are  acting  in  the interests of  the  people  and

trying  to  fulfil our promises to them. Therefore,

we  are  not  worried about the activities  of  the

opponent political Parties. This is the essence  of

democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the question of merger was raised, the

public  and  newspaper editorials have given  their

opinions.  They have all said that it is inevitable

that  there will finally be merger. It  is  only  a

question of time. The coming of merger is just like

the sun rising from the east, and the water flowing

into the sea. This is a natural course, and is also

a  natural  law. Nobody can change this course.  If

anybody wants to cover up this truth by tactics and

manoeuvring, he is only ignoring the  tide  of  the

present  era,  which is impossible. I have  already

pointed out that all this is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>



natural law. And so as the sun will, of course,

rise from the east, it will set when the time

comes. That cannot be changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since many Assemblymen have

already emphasised the importance of the livelihood

of the people, may I stress further by asking

whether merger between Singapore and the Federation

of Malaya is also one of the questions relating to

the livelihood of the people of Singapore? In my

opinion, it is so. It concerns very much the

livelihood of the people. The Assemblymen of the

Barisan Sosialis have talked about many things,

amongst them, socialism. May I say that in my view,

as Singapore is a small island of 225 square miles

and without natural resources, it will find it

difficult to realise socialism by itself? That is

why we have to seek a merger of the two territories

in order to realise socialism. After the

reunification of the two territories, socialism can

be achieved in Singapore. Otherwise, all talks and

plans are only mere words on paper, and are without

any effect. The population of Singapore keeps on

increasing. Can all these talks help to solve the

acute problems facing us today in Singapore? We

feel we cannot achieve certain aims or realise

certain objectives by just delivering empty talks

or writing thesis. We can only achieve our

objectives through concrete work and practical

planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out further that it is because we

stress the importance of placing the interest of

the people above the interest of the Party that we

are not willing to do the things that the Members

of the Barisan Sosialis have done. They are acting

like clowns in their attempt to confuse the vision

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I want to answer also some of the charges made by the Barisan Sosialis. They have stressed several points during these few days. I

want, to reply to the charges they have levelled

against us. My colleagues have already given their

replies to some of them and there is no need for me

to repeat them. But I feel it is necessary for me

to point out some of the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



charges.  In the course of the debate during these  few

days,  they  have repeatedly accused us of selling  out

the  rights of the people of Singapore by this  merger.

Let  us  define the words "sell-out". We recognise  the

fact that the people of Singapore and the people of the

Federation  of  Malaya  are brothers.  They  have  been

separated  for  16 years by artificial means.  How  can

this reunification be considered as a kind of sell-out?

To sell out means to sell what belongs to us to someone

else.  But since the Federation of Malaya is our sister

State, how can we say that we are selling ourselves  to

the  Federation  of  Malaya? Since the  people  of  the

Federation of Malaya are like our brothers, we  are  of

the  same family. Therefore, now is the time for us  to

unite  together. How can an act which brings about  the

reunification  of the two territories be  termed  as  a

sell-out?  I hope other Assemblymen in this House  will

give a further definition of the word "sell-out".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to reiterate that at the

inauguration   of   our   Party   sometime   ago,   the

reunification  of the two territories was  one  of  our

objectives.  We have been working hard  since  then  to

realise  this objective. In other words, we  have  been

working  hard  to  fulfil the hope  of  the  people  of

Singapore.  This is also the fulfilment of one  of  our

promises to the people. The people elected us  to  this

Assembly  in the hope that we can bring about a  better

life  for  them. As representatives of the  people,  we

have to respect their views, wishes and hopes. But when

we respect the views and wishes of the people by acting

accordingly, our friends in the Barisan Sosialis accuse

us  of  turning Right. If this is their kind of  logic,

then  I think the definition of words in the dictionary

should be changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these few days, Assemblymen of the Barisan

Sosialis have incessantly accused us of trying to  push

through this merger in order to safeguard our political

position.   My   colleagues  and   I   can   say   here

categorically  that we do not form the Government  just

for our own benefit. We have been conducting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>



the  business  of  government in the  interest  of  the

people.  It is for this reason that we are now  in  the

Government. We are now faced with many difficulties and

problems.  Why should we endure all this?  Our  efforts

and our work are only to benefit the people and to give

them  a better life. We are doing all his, and not just

to  preserve our power as they have been saying. I feel

that  they are not interested in the livelihood of  the

people. We have been elected as representatives of  the

people. But what have we gained during all this period,

Mr  Speaker? You know that we have spent much time and

energy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes. Just now we have

heard the Member for Jurong saying that his coming into

this  Assembly  is to act on behalf of the  people.  Of

course,  as representative of the people he has  to  do

that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the hon. Member does not

know  the  meaning  of a point of  order.  That  is  an

argument.  The Member for Moulmein has not  spoken.  He

will have an opportunity of answering that argument.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just as the Member

for  Moulmein  has  said,  as  representatives  of  the

people, we are not carrying out our work just to fulfil

our  own wishes and hopes. Instead, we are working  for

the  benefit  of the people and to fulfil their  wishes

and  hopes. That is why we have spent so much time  and

energy  to achieve this aim. During these few  days  of

debate,  you  can  read from the  newspapers  that  the

situation   in  Singapore,  especially  the   political

situation, is fluctuating. There are ups and downs. Why

is this so? I think we can all understand this. We will

exert ourselves and try to do whatever we can. That  is

to  say, we must have a good beginning and we must have

a  good  end.  We  will  carry  on  with  our  work  in

accordance with the principles in which we believe.  We

will not act like our accusers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, for several days we have been debating the question of citizenship rights without any conclusion. We have all along emphasised the

question  of  citizenship. The Barisan Sosialis  is

advocating  a  merger  like  that  of  Penang   and

Malacca.  We have already said - and it is  reported

in  the  newspapers - that if we were to merge  with

the  Federation of Malaya as the twelfth  state  on

the   basis  of  Penang  and  Malacca,  then  those

citizens  of  Singapore  who  were  not   born   in

Singapore  would  have to apply again  for  Federal

citizenship. This will be a loss to the citizens of

Singapore. This is also unfair.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that is a repetition

of  an  argument  which has been  advanced  by  the

Government benchers time and again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I was only quoting a very short passage.  The

reason  is that the Members of the Barisan Sosialis

have  all  along  said  that the  people  are  very

concerned with the question of citizenship. That is

why  the  Assembly has been debating this  question

for  so many days. This is one of the reasons.  Why

is there such a heated debate on this question?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not want to act like the

Members  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  who,  by  their

arguments, have advocated many fanciful  plans.  We

are  practical.  Singapore and  the  Federation  of

Malaya  have been separated for 16 years.  We  must

now  seek  the reunification of the two territories

in order to bring a better life to our people. Only

through  merger  can we bring better  opportunities

and  better  rights  to the  people  of  these  two

territories.  My  colleagues have also  touched  on

several of these points and I do not want to repeat

them. But there is one point I want to stress,  and

that  is that we have never been conceited or self-complacent. We are practical men. We dare  not  say

that  in  a  short  period of a few  years  we  can

improve  the livelihood of the people. We can  only

say  that we want to try and achieve that.  But  if

merger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>



of  the two territories can come sooner, then  this

will help greatly towards achieving this end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I resolutely oppose the

amendment  moved  by the Member for  Queenstown.  I

feel  that this amendment is unnecessary and, as  I

have  pointed out, it is only a sugar-coating which

has, in fact, no true meaning.



<br><br>3.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  important question about the Singapore people

has  been  debated for several days. Originally,  I

did  not have the intention to participate  in  the

debate, but being a representative of the people, I

cannot shut my mouth on this important issue  about

the  people of Singapore. If I do not speak  a  few

words,  then  I  will not be doing justice  to  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have constantly heard of the

sell-out merger and the genuine merger. I will  try

in  this  House  to  speak on this  question.  Some

people have said that the P.A.P. have sold out  the

interests  of the people of Singapore. But  one  of

them  has said, "How can the P.A.P. Government sell

out  the  interests  of  the  people?  If  we  were

children, it might be possible for them to sell us;

but  we  are adults, so how can they sell us?"  The

people  of Singapore cannot become Federal citizens

under this definition. This can be termed as a sell-out. Singapore has to contribute $90 million to the

Federation  of  Malaya. This,  of  course,  can  be

justly  said to be a sell-out, since we are  giving

up  our  money to them. From where then can we  get

taxes  to  replace this sum? Of course,  the  taxes

will  have  to come from the people themselves.  In

other  words,  before merger,  the  Government  has

raised  taxes by 100 per cent. But if after merger,

the  Government  has  to give $90  million  to  the

Federation  of  Malaya, then that  means  that  the

Government of Singapore will have to spend more. It

will  therefore  have  to increase  taxes.  Perhaps

there will be a 200 per cent increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The separation of Singapore from Malaya was

created  by  the  colonial  masters.  However,  the

heroic people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  have  been  resolutely against  colonialism.

They have fought for independence and the reunification

of  the  two territories. The inauguration platform  of

the  P.A.P. in 1954 was able to meet the demands of the

majority of the people. Therefore, the P.A.P. was voted

into  office  with the support of the people.  However,

before  long,  they  changed their quality,  and  worse

still  now, they have given orders, like an emperor  on

the  throne, in order to create widespread terror. They

have completely forgotten their promises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that under colonial

rule  and  dictatorship, the people  are  oppressed  by

military  forces and fooled by culture.  The  political

rights of the people have been exploited. The political

concept  of  the governed all over the world  has  been

raised to a considerable extent. In every corner of the

world,  the voices of anti-colonialism have been  heard

constantly fighting for freedom and democracy. Now, the

P.A.P. leadership have tried to use a phoney method  to

reach the objective of selling out the interests of the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have noted the Prime Minister's remark that if

Singapore does not merge with the Federation of Malaya,

then the Federation Government will cut off its water

supply and Singapore will be finished. Now, the P.A.P.

Government, coming on the heels of the Prime Minister's

remark, have announced that the water level in the

reservoirs is low and there is not enough water for

consumption. They have now imposed water rationing,

causing inconvenience to the people. However, during

this rainy season, the water level must be quite high

and yet the Government is still imposing water

rationing -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are dealing with merger. What

has the fact that we have rainfall or no rainfall got

to do with merger?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

only use this point of argument to substantiate the

fact that the P.A.P. Government is cheating the people.

Just a short passage -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think that short passage is a bit too

long.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Well then, I will try

my best. Today the water level has risen, but still

there is this water rationing -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think we should debate

water rationing now. Let us go on to the merger

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): All right then, and

thank you very much. I will bow to your ruling. Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have just said that the P.A.P. are now

trying all kinds of tactics and resorting to all kinds

of means to deceive the people. This is contrary to

democratic progress and the aim of a true merger. The

colonialists in Singapore and the general masses have,

in the past, acquired a three-quarters Merdeka for

Singapore, but now this three-quarters Merdeka is not

sufficient to resolve the problems of the people.

Therefore, the people of Singapore will have to

continue with their anti-colonial struggle to realise

the reunification of all the people of Singapore and

Malaya. The leadership of the P.A.P. say that since

there is no longer colonialism in Singapore, then

everything can be resolved by this so-called merger

between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. But,

Mr Speaker, if the merger proposed by the P.A.P. is a

true merger and is wanted by the people in both

territories, then, of course, it can be a merger. But

is this so? The Prime Minister of the Federation of

Malaya said clearly in the Federal Parliament that what

he wanted was not a true merger between Singapore and

the Federation of Malaya. Singapore was only accepted

as a partner and the citizens of Singapore could not

become citizens of the Federation. Everybody knows that

if the citizens are separated, then the people cannot

become one and the country cannot be united. The people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>



living  in  this divided country and with  separate

citizenship will be just like a bird in a cage that

will  be manipulated by the master. This is a  true

fact   which  everybody  can  see  clearly.  People

without citizenship rights cannot do anything.  The

fundamental principle of merger should be that  the

two territories should be reunited, with the people

in  the  two territories enjoying equal citizenship

rights and sharing a common political life. But the

Prime  Minister  has talked at  length  on  various

problems  such as autonomy in labour and education.

I  would  say that without citizenship  rights  all

these autonomies are useless and are only something

to  deceive  the people. Without true merger,  true

unification and equal citizenship rights,  all  the

problems of the people cannot be resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour policy of the P.A.P. is not so very

progressive as it is claimed to be. The workers  of

Singapore  have gained very good working conditions

through  their own efforts and not because  of  the

work   of   the   P.A.P.  They  have  gained   very

advantageous  working conditions because  of  their

own  efforts  and  because of the  co-operation  of

certain employers. This is not the result of the so-called pro-labour policy of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see how the P.A.P. is exposed in the

present  situation involving students.  This  shows

that  its  education policy is not as sound  as  it

claims to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This merger question brought up by the P.A.P. is

being  used  only  as a smokescreen  to  blind  the

vision  of  the people of Singapore.  Mr  Speaker.

Sir, the people of Singapore are not absentminded.

During  the  by-election  in  Anson,  there  was  a

promise  made  by the P.A.P. that we would  achieve

independence through merger. What was  the  result?

The  people in Anson lost confidence in the  P.A.P.

So the beautiful promise made by the P.A.P. did not

get  the support of the people. So the Party  which

has  lost  the  confidence of the people  has  been

shown for what it is, and yet it is still trying to

cling to power. The P.A.P. Government is trying  to

play political tricks to deceive the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



people  and to influence their political  life.  Is

this  the intention of the P.A.P.? If this  is  not

so,  then  why should the opinion of the people  be

disregarded, and why should the P.A.P. try to force

through  a  merger in spite of the  fact  that  the

people are not in favour of that type of merger?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Government has lost the

confidence of the people, then the people have  the

right to doubt the proposals brought forward by the

Government,  especially in regard to the  proposals

affecting their livelihood. They will not let these

proposals pass so easily. They will want to ask for

an  explanation from the Government, and they  will

raise criticisms on the question concerned. In  the

last  few months, they have been very unhappy about

the  talks  going on behind the scenes between  the

P.A.P.  Government  and the  Federation.  This  has

raised doubts in their minds. The details of  these

talks concerning merger have not been disclosed and

made  public.  In  fact, they should  not  be  kept

secret.  The people have a right to know  what  has

been going on. The P.A.P. Government are trying  to

keep  the terms of the merger a secret. Maybe  they

have  something which they do not want to  disclose

to  the  people. So the people have every right  to

suspect them. Formerly, the Lim Yew Hock Government

sold Christmas Island. So the people think that the

minority in the P.A.P. leadership may be trying  to

sell  the island of Singapore as well, because they

are very secretive about things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the course of this

debate, we have unmasked the P.A.P. and we can  now

see  its true appearance. The doubts and suspicions

of   the  people  have  been  very  justified.  The

P.A.P.'s promise that we would achieve independence

through  merger has been proved to be  false.  What

kind of merger is this? Is Singapore to go in as  a

State  like Sarawak, Borneo and Brunei? These three

territories can join the Federation as States,  but

it  is  not  so in the case of Singapore. Singapore

will  only  be  considered as a  partner.  Strictly

speaking,   this   is   not  compatible   with   an

independent  State.  The  P.A.P. merger   is   not

conducive to the interests of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



people  of  Singapore. In fact, this merger arrangement

will place the people of Singapore on an unequal status

with  the  people  of  the  Federation,  so  that  true

independence for Singapore cannot be achieved. In fact,

the  P.A.P. is trying to make Singapore a satellite  of

the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the question of citizenship is of the

utmost   importance.  How  should  this   question   of

citizenship  be solved? The P.A.P. Government  has  not

aid  anything  about  uniting the  people  if  the  two

territories  in a common citizenship. On the  contrary,

it  is  trying  to  separate  Singapore  citizens  from

Federation citizens. It is not trying to get automatic

Federal   citizenship  rights  tor  the   citizens   of

Singapore.  So  can  we  say  that  Singapore   is   an

independent  State if there are two types  of  citizens

living in it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Nanyang Siang Pan of 20th July, the Prime

Minister   is  reported  to  have  said  at   a   Press

conference - over  the radio - that the  status  of  the

citizens  of Singapore may be on an unequal basis  with

that  of the citizens of the Federation. He brought  in

Algeria  and  France  as examples to  substantiate  his

statement.  He said that a person may be a  citizen  of

Algeria,  but it does not necessarily mean that  he  is

also  a citizen of France. Therefore, he can only  tote

within  Algeria, but if he wants to vote in  France  he

must  first apply for French citizenship. This is  what

the  Prime  Minister  said at a Press  conference  over

Radio  Singapore. We all know that Algeria is a  colony

of France and that its people are opposing the colonial

rulers.  They  are  struggling  for  independence.   At

present, France has sovereignty over Algeria and it  is

trying to keep Algeria as a colony. Therefore, there is

no question at all that the people in Algeria are on an

equal  status with those in France. But in the case  of

Singapore  which  is  trying  to  achieve  independence

through  merger,  there is every reason  for  Singapore

citizens  to  become  Federal citizens,  otherwise  the

merger  is not genuine and the status of Singapore  can

be likened to that of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



Algeria.  Now  the  minority in the  P.A.P. leadership

undoubtedly  agree  that  Singapore  can  automatically

become  Federal citizens. So it is up to the P.A.P. to

fight  for  this citizenship right for  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Nanyang Siang Pau of 26th July, the Prime

Minister is reported to have said at a Press conference

that  if  the Opposition Parties in Singapore  were  in

favour of automatic Federal citizenship rights for  the

citizens  of  Singapore, he would ask them  to  get  in

touch  with  their Federation friends to speak  in  the

Central  Parliament on this question so that  Singapore

citizens can automatically become Federal citizens. You

can  see that the Prime Minister has forgotten what  he

promised  during  the general elections  of  1959.  Why

should  he shirk his responsibility when he has already

made a promise to fight for the interests of the people

of  Singapore?  Why should he give  the  money  of  the

people  of Singapore so easily to the Federation?  From

this, we can see that the P.A.P. will do one thing  and

say  another  thing. In other words,  their  deeds  and

their  words  are  entirely different.  Now  they  have

discovered  that the people know that the  question  of

citizenship is very important and that their rights are

being  sold out. Therefore, they have introduced a  new

term "Federal national" to console the people. They say

that  Singapore citizens will become Federal  nationals

on Merger Day. This method has been employed to explain

away the non-existence of the equal status between  the

people  in  both territories. The use of such  a  legal

term to deceive the people is not right. The Federation

when dealing with court cases will treat you as Federal

nationals,  and you will be punished according  to  the

law because you are Federal nationals. And when you are

citizens, you will be treated likewise. In the case  of

passports, it will be the same. You will have a Federal

passport  and so you should be proud of it because  you

are  not  holding a British passport. But you will  see

that   this  equal  treatment  is  the  same   in   all

independent States. But this is not enough  to  deceive

the people. If there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



is  equal  status  between  the  two  peoples  of  both

territories,  then  how is it that  Singapore  citizens

cannot become Federal citizens after merger? Why should

the  Federation disallow Singapore citizens  to  become

Federal  citizens? So from this point we can again  see

that this is a phoney merger to deceive the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again we ask: how is it Singapore citizens can only

vote  in  Singapore and not anywhere in the Federation?

If there is equality between the two peoples, how is it

that  the  election of representatives will not  be  in

proportion to the number of citizens? Now we know  that

Singapore  can  only  have  15  seats  in  the  Federal

Parliament.  This  means  that some  200,000  Singapore

citizens will he deprived of their citizenship rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we feel that merger between

Singapore  and  the  Federation is the  desire  of  the

people  of both territories, and we believe that  broad

measures  in Singapore and the Federation are good  for

the people. They can live together like brothers. There

is  no conflict of interests among them. They can  live

together in an independent State after merger. In  this

way,  they  will have fuller co-operation and  will  be

united  all the more if there is true merger, which  is

the  desire of the people. This true merger will  bring

to  the  people of both territories a reunification  of

these territories and common rights, so that the people

will  be  able  to  enjoy political  rights  with  more

freedom than the people of any other independent  State

in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Party in power should not act against the desire

of  the  people by depriving them of their  citizenship

rights.  If they should do so, then the people will  be

all  the  more dissatisfied. If the people are deprived

of  their  economic  rights, then  they  will  be  more

dissatisfied.   We  must  try  to   bring   about   the

reunification of all races in both territories. In this

way,  we will have greater economic benefits, and there

will  be fuller co-operation between the two States  in

the  field  of industrialisation, and job opportunities

will be created for the people of both territories. For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



example,  if  there  is  closer  economic  co-operation

between the two States, then this co-operation will  be

conducive  to  the interests of both territories.  Only

those  who are against the interests of the peoples  of

both territories are opposed to a genuine merger. So  I

am  speaking in support of the amendment to the  motion

tabled by the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, what we have heard in the last two  weeks

are   nothing  but  slogans,  "sell-out",  "losing  the

confidence of the people" and so on and so forth. I  do

not  want to waste the time of the Assembly by  dealing

with  this. They have been using all kinds of confusing

terms to confuse the people. But before I reply to what

they  have  said against us, let me tell a Malay  story

from the Sejarah Melayu. The hero in this story is  the

Sultan  of  Malacca  who loved the Princess  of  Gunong

Ledang.  He  asked for her hand, but the princess  said

that if the Sultan wanted to marry her, he should build

for her a gold and silver bridge from Malacca to Gunong

Ledang,  and to provide seven dishes of the  hearts  of

certain  animals, a dish of deer, and  a  bowl  of  the

blood of Rajah Ahmad, a son of the Sultan. "If you  can

do  all  this, then I promise to marry you." I  believe

that  even  a seven-year old child will know  that  the

Princess  of  Gunong  Ledang  was  not  sincere   about

marrying the Sultan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the lengthy speech of the Member for

Queenstown for 7½ hours, and the lengthy speeches made

by the other Barisan Sosialis Members which were all of

the  same content, we know that the representatives  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis are just like this  Princess  of

Gunong  Ledang. They are not sincere in seeking  merger

between  Singapore  and the Federation  of  Malaya.  No

matter  how  the Member for Queenstown and his  friends

talk  of their being in favour of merger, and no matter

how  they  play with words to turn our merger  proposal

into  a  phoney  merger and a kind  of  sell-out,  they

cannot cover up their intrigues and real intentions  to

sabotage merger,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>



i.e. purposely to advocate a kind of merger  which  is

not   in  keeping  with  the  present  conditions   and

situation prevailing in the two territories.



<br><br>4.11 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  everybody will agree that before dealing with  an

issue  of national importance, disputes between parties

and  groups of people that cannot be resolved  amicably

should  be  resolved and conciliated  through  peaceful

discussions, and an understanding arrived  at.  But  if

all  the  parties concerned have no real  intention  to

solve  the  problem, then the problem cannot be  solved

even if they continue to talk for days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Barisan Sosialis are not in favour

of merger. This belief is not groundless. The amendment

moved  by  the Member for Queenstown is a good example.

Who does not like the 630,000 citizens of Singapore  to

become citizens of the Federation after merger? But the

raw  fact and objective realities have made us  advance

our  merger  in accordance with these objective  facts.

Undeniably the colonial rulers' divide and rule  policy

has sown the seed of suspicion among the various races.

Before we can thoroughly disperse the suspicious  frame

of  mind existing in the Malays and Chinese about  each

other,  if  we  ask  the Federation to  give  automatic

citizenship  rights to Singapore citizens,  and  if  we

make  this a pre-condition for merger between  the  two

territories, then it is unrealistic. But for  the  sake

of  the future of Singapore and in the interest of  the

people   of  Singapore,  we  do  not  want  to  advance

unrealistic conditions for merger. We want  to  discuss

calmly and peacefully with the Federation of Malaya  in

order  to  resolve this question, so  that  the  sister

State  of Singapore can achieve reunification with  the

Federation of Malaya early. The proposal in  the  White

Paper  on  merger tabled in this Assembly is  the  most

proper  and adequate merger proposal under the  present

circumstances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis are unreasonable. They do not

want  merger  for the following reasons. Firstly,  they

know  that  the Malays in the Federation are suspicious

of  the  people of Singapore. They are, therefore,  now

putting  in  this amendment to the motion in  order  to

frighten  the Malays in the Federation. Secondly,  they

know  clearly  that under their so-called true  merger,

Singapore's  labour  and education policies  and  other

policies  will come under the control of the Federation

Government.  In spite of the fact that they  have  been

trying  to  argue and to persuade the people to  accept

their  true merger proposals, and to hand over autonomy

in  labour  and education to the Federation of  Malaya,

they  know  very  well that this cannot  be  done.  The

leaders  of the Barisan Sosialis know that they  cannot

convince the principals, students and their parents  to

accept  the  education  policy  of  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  That is why they have proposed their  kind  of

merger, that is, to hand over autonomy in education  to

the  Federation Government. Is this not a good  example

to  show  that  they  do not want merger?  The  Barisan

Sosialis,  on  the  one hand, criticise  the  education

policy  of the Federation as incorrect and wrong.  They

say  that  after merger, many Chinese students  in  the

Federation  will  come  to Singapore  to  join  Chinese

schools  here.  This means that they do  recognise  the

fact  that there is autonomy in education in Singapore.

But,  on the other hand, they say that in order to seek

true  merger they are willing to hand over autonomy  in

education to the Federation of Malaya. Is this kind  of

talk not contradictory?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 13th September, the Member for Queenstown made a

statement in the Press asking the P.A.P. Government  to

state  whether it agreed with the education  policy  of

the  Federation of Malaya. I say this is  childish  and

unnecessary.   If   the  Chinese-educated   people   in

Singapore could immediately accept the education policy

of the Federation of Malaya, then there would have been

no  need  for the Prime Minister to say that  Singapore

would  ask the Federation Government to grant Singapore

autonomy in education. Now I want to ask the Member for

Queenstown if he knows



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



what will happen if the Barisan Sosialis' so-called

merger   does  materialise.  First,  if  in  future

students of the 28 Chinese middle Schools  want  to

sit  for  the  Government common examination,  they

will  have to answer the papers either in Malay  or

in  English. Second, the Chinese middle schools  in

Singapore from Junior I to III or Senior I  to  III

or  the  present  4:2 system will be  abolished  in

future.  Third,  the Government will  not  be  able

thereafter  to  use public funds  to  give  aid  to

Chinese   schools  and  to  build  Chinese   middle

schools.  Fourth, the question of giving assistance

to  and the development of Nanyang University  will

be a problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the Member for Queenstown and his colleagues

really  believe  that  they  have  the  ability  to

persuade Chinese education circles to accept  these

conditions?  If they have this great ability,  then

let  them describe here what they can do. Let  them

move a motion in this Assembly asking the people of

Singapore  to  accept the education policy  of  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Resign!



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member for

Havelock - they   all  smack  of  the   same   smell.

Otherwise, they would not call upon us to resign. I

want to ask the Member for Queenstown, the Chairman

of  the  Barisan Sosialis, this question.  Does  he

know  that the P.A.P. gives equal treatment to  the

four  streams  of education, and that  the  Chinese

students have a chance to sit for their examination

in their mother tongue!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the recent incident about the boycotting of

the examinations. All the efforts of the Government

to  promote  equal  treatment for  all  streams  of

education  have  been sabotaged by instigators  who

incited  the  students to boycott the examinations.

They  have  accused  the Government  of  trying  to

destroy  Chinese education. The events in the  past

few  weeks  have proved to us that for the  Chinese

students  and educators in Singapore to accept  the

education policy of the Federation of Malaya is not

as  easy  as  the  Barisan Sosialis have  imagined.

Their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



views are unrealistic. If autonomy in education  is

in  the hands of the Federation Government, then it

would  not be easy to handle the consequences.  All

this  goes to show that the leaders of the  Barisan

Sosialis are not sincere in their talk. On the  one

hand, they shout for merger, but on the other hand,

they try to sabotage it. On the one hand, they  say

they  want  to persuade the people of Singapore  to

hand  over  autonomy in education to the Federation

Government;  but on the other hand,  they  secretly

incited   the  students  to  boycott   the   common

examination, accusing the Government of  trying  to

destroy  Chinese education. They have  brought  out

all  kinds  of  slogans deliberately to  smear  the

P.A.P.  Government, saying that the  Government  is

trying  to destroy Chinese education. Now,  who  is

destroying Chinese education? Who has been  trying

to  hinder  the development of Chinese  education?

The  P.A.P.  Government is not like the governments

in  many  other countries in South-East Asia  which

have closed down many Chinese schools. Instead, the

P.A.P.  Government has built many  Chinese  Primary

and  Secondary schools. It has spent large sums  of

money  building Chinese schools, both  Primary  and

Secondary.  The  Government  is  also  prepared  to

enable  the  Chinese-educated to  go  right  up  to

university   level.  Does  this   show   that   the

Government  is trying to destroy Chinese education?

Those  people  who accuse us of this act  can  only

raise  some  kind of argument which is  groundless.

For  instance, they have asked us to let those  who

have  not  passed the Junior IV examination  to  be

allowed to sit for the Senior II examination.  They

use  all kinds of unreasonable arguments to  accuse

the   Government  of  trying  to  destroy   Chinese

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the people who drafted this declaration want to rouse suspicions among the various communities. They are really trying to do

this  to  achieve their own aim. In our society  in

Malaya,  if  people try to play up communalism  and

spark   off  feelings  of  communalism,  then   the

consequences  will be disastrous to all  of  us.  I

want  to  ask  this  question  of  the  Member  for

Queenstown and the Barisan Sosialis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>



Assemblymen, who claim that they are trying to seek

complete merger. Do they want to hand over autonomy

in  education  to  the Federation of  Malaya  after

merger,  and  thus  abolish  the  giving  of  equal

treatment to the four streams of education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that if we can

achieve complete merger, he is willing to hand over

autonomy  in education and labour to the Federation

Government.  May I ask him whether he can  persuade

the  Chinese-educated people in Singapore to accept

the Rahman Talib Education Report of the Federation

of Malaya? If he really believes at this stage that

he  has that ability, especially after the incident

of  the  boycott of the examinations, then I  would

advise him to see a doctor about his health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown and the Member for

Anson have argued that the education system in  the

two  territories should be unified so as  to  avoid

its  developing  along two different  lines,  which

will have disastrous consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all hope that the people of the two

territories  can  have a unified education  system.

This  is  the  ultimate  objective  of  the  P.A.P.

Government. But the divide and rule policy  of  the

colonial  rulers has separated Singapore  from  the

Federation of Malaya and, as a result, we have  the

present  unhealthy  situation  here.  In  order  to

prevent  these  education systems developing  along

two different lines, we are trying to seek an early

merger so as to unify the education systems in  the

two  territories through negotiations after merger.

If  merger  cannot be realised soon, then Singapore

will  be isolated under the Greater Malaysia Plan.

The   education  systems  in  Singapore   and   the

Federation  of  Malaya will then be  going  towards

different  extremes  and  the  people  of  the  two

territories will go along different lines,  further

and  further away from each other, so that  in  the

end,  only  by  the  use of  force  can  merger  be

achieved. This would be disastrous. At present, for

the  purposes  of  realising an  early  merger  and

reunification of the two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>



territories, we have to resort to practical  plans.

We  cannot  insist  that the Federation  of  Malaya

should  accept our education policy, and it is  not

easy for us to persuade the people of Singapore  to

accept  the  education policy of the Federation  of

Malaya.  That is why we want to ask the  Federation

of  Malaya to let us have autonomy in education. In

this  respect, we have their sympathy and they have

agreed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the representatives of the Barisan Sosialis have said over and over again that our proposed merger is a sell-out. What do we sell

out?  Is  it  the citizenship right?  The  624,000

citizens of Singapore will retain their citizenship

rights.  For  what  are  we  sold  out?  From   the

impression  we have gained after all these  events,

we  know that the people of Singapore have acquired

their  present  citizenship  rights  through   many

difficulties. Now, what they are afraid of is  that

their  acquired citizenship rights  will  be  lost.

That  is their only fear. Here, I wish to quote  an

excerpt from the Nanyang Siang Pau of the  1st  of

December.  The  Chinese Chamber of  Commerce  at  a

meeting  has  agreed to convene a  forum  of  local

organisations  to discuss the question  of  merger,

and  they have requested Government t Ministers  to

take  part  and, explain  to  them  the  questions

relating  to  merger.  The Government  has  agreed.

According to the report here, the Directors of  the

Executive  Committee  of  the  Chinese  Chamber  of

Commerce  have  all agreed that in  the  past,  the

Chinese  have tried very hard and have gone through

many  difficulties before they have acquired  their

present  citizenship right, and this  right  should

not  be endangered. Now, from the speeches by these

representatives, we gather that what they  fear  is

that  the citizenship right, already acquired, will

be  lost. If those people who accuse us of  selling

out were to look at the White Paper on merger, they

would  see that after merger, the 624,000  citizens

of  Singapore  will still retain their  citizenship

right and they can still take part in elections and

stand    for   election   in   Singapore   to    be

representatives   in   the  Singapore   Legislative

Assembly or in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>



the Federal Parliament. Is this a sell-out? A sell-out  must mean that you must have something to sell

out. If you do not sell out anything, how can it be

termed  a sell-out? If they do not understand  this

point, let them go back to school and start afresh,

learning  their lessons there and to look up  their

dictionaries. The citizenship already acquired will

be retained. Now, if this can be termed a sell-out,

then  I  say  that  those people should  consult  a

doctor. The Member for Queenstown has forgotten his

pledge  when he joined the P.A.P. He has signed  an

agreement that in the case of leaving -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think this is a repetition.

This  argument has already been put forward by  the

Government benches.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): As a man, he

should  keep his promise. What do we sell out?  The

people  of  Singapore  have  secured  an  education

policy which gives equal treatment to all the  four

streams  of  education. The people  have  got  this

after going through many difficulties. Now, is this

a  sell-out? If there is a merger on the  basis  of

Penang and Malacca, then this would truly be a kind

of  sell-out,  because under it, many  citizens  of

Singapore will lose their citizenship right. If  we

go  according  to  the conditions proposed  by  the

Barisan   Sosialis,  then  our  policy   of   equal

treatment to all the four streams of education will

be  sold out. If there is anyone who is selling out

the people, it must be the Barisan Sosialis. We can

still  use four languages to express our  views  in

this  House. But if we follow the Barisan Sosialis'

so-called complete merger, then I believe  many  of

the  present  Assemblymen will not be able  to  sit

here  again  because they cannot express themselves

either in English or in the national language.  But

under  the P.A.P. proposed merger, the equal status

of  the four streams of education and the right  to

express oneself in the four languages will still be

preserved.  Then  how can you  term  this  kind  of

merger  a  sell-out? When our merger proposals  are

realised,  businessmen and merchants  of  Singapore

can still carry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



on  their business as usual, but under the  Barisan

Sosialis'  merger, I am afraid many merchants  will

lose their business. That can then be termed a kind

of  sell-out. We do not sell out the people. On the

other hand, we have tried to preserve the fruits of

the  people, and we have tried hard to reunify  the

two  territories  so that the  people  of  the  two

territories  can come closer together as  early  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has raised several points,

but because time is rather short and as many of  my

colleagues  have  already given  their  replies,  I

therefore do not propose to waste too much time  of

this Assembly. Based on the reasons given above,  I

therefore  oppose  the  amendment  moved   by   the

Minister  for  Queenstown. In order to  achieve  an

early  merger,  we have to recognise the  practical

objective  of  reunifying the  people  of  the  two

territories as soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the past few  days  we

have been debating the amendment brought forward by

the  Member for Queenstown. In the course  of  this

debate,   we  have  on  many  occasions   got   the

opportunity  to  hear  the contradictions  made  by

Members on the Government benches. On the one hand,

the  motion  moved by the Minister for Health  says

that  it  is the true objective of all nationalists

to  achieve  a  merger between  Singapore  and  the

Federation. On the other hand, -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> On a point of order, Sir. The

motion was moved by the Minister for Labour and not

the Minister for Health.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On the other

hand, in the policy speech delivered by the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  on  the 31st of  October  in  this

House,  it  is stated that we are not  prepared  to

have a complete merger. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>



Members in the Government, on the one hand, contend

that  only the Communists are afraid of merger  and

therefore  they are opposing merger.  But,  on  the

other hand, they say that those who want a complete

merger  are  the communists. On the one  hand,  the

Government  Ministers say that  Singapore  and  the

Federation should merge so that Singapore  citizens

can  become Federal nationals. They also  say  that

Federal   nationals  mean  the  same   as   Federal

citizens,  so why should they oppose our  amendment

to the motion? Is it not a contradiction?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we in the Barisan

Sosialis  advocate a complete and  genuine  merger.

Because of this, we have been accused of being anti-national.  The  motion of the Minister  for  Labour

says  that it is the true objective of all patriots

to reunify the two territories of Singapore and the

Federation.  On the one hand, the Government  makes

the  accusation that we in the Barisan Sosialis are

afraid   of   being  controlled  by   the   Central

Government  in the event of merger.  On  the  other

hand,  it  says that if we hand over our  education

and  labour  rights to the Central  Government,  it

will be bad for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been accused that our demand for equal

citizenship rights is only for the interest of  the

Chinese, and that this is a good example of Chinese

chauvinism. On the other hand, the Member for Jalan

Besar  said that in the event of a genuine  merger,

the  Bank of China would not be allowed to continue

its  business here, that is to say, China would not

be allowed to continue her trade with Singapore. So

who  is  guilty  of Chinese chauvinism?  We  demand

equal  rights for the citizens of both territories,

but  the  Government Members have  a  very  strange

explanation  for the term "equality". For  example,

the Member for Bras Basah said that you cannot come

here  and  you  cannot go there, and that  this  is

equality.  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we  have  heard

over  the  last few days speeches which  were  very

strange. The logic used was also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>



very strange. If their logic is accepted, then  the

only  reasonable conclusion to be  drawn  is  this.

Those who claim to be patriots and nationalists may

well  be those traitors who are trying to sell  out

the  interests  of the people. On the  other  hand,

those  accused of being anti-nationalist and  anti-patriotic - according to the inference  to  be  drawn

from  the logic of Members of the P.A.P. - can  be

said to be true patriots and nationalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we in the Barisan

Sosialis  have  introduced  the  amendment  to  the

motion  because of necessity. Everyone of us  knows

that  Parliament  is the pivot  of  the  democratic

system and that, therefore it should not indulge in

saying  things  which are not true. It  should  not

call a horse a deer, or a deer a horse. A horse  is

a horse and a deer is a deer. There should never be

a  dispute about that. Now before our clever  Prime

Minister  came to this House to debate the question

of  merger,  he  talked  a great  deal  over  Radio

Singapore  and  he  was  widely  reported  in   the

newspapers. He tried to tell us that a horse is the

same  as  a  deer  because both of them  are  four-legged. He said that the citizens of Singapore  can

become   Federal   nationals  and  that   therefore

Singapore citizens and Federal nationals  mean  the

same  thing. If he had not spent a lot of  time  in

trying to say that a horse is a deer and a deer  is

a  horse,  that  the constitutional arrangement  is

actually  a  merger when it is  not  so,  and  that

citizens  are nationals when in fact they  are  not

so,  we  would  not  have  found  it  necessary  to

introduce  our  amendment to the  motion  with  the

provision   that  all  Singapore  citizens   should

automatically  become Federal  citizens  on  Merger

Day.  This amendment put forward by us is the means

to  test  whether the merger is true or  phoney.  I

feel  that  those  in this House  who  are  out  to

protect parliamentary democracy should not come  to

tell lies in this dignified House.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Did I hear the Member

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the object of our

amendment  to  the  motion  is  to  achieve  common

citizenship  rights  for  the  people  of  the  two

territories on Merger Day. We want to achieve  that

so  that the people of Singapore and the Federation

will be able to share a common political life after

merger.  This  is  the  basic  objective   of   all

socialists.  If  the P.A.P. is  a  socialist  Party

which adheres to the principles of socialism, I  do

not  see  why they should oppose common citizenship

rights for the people of the two territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as regards the rights of

a citizen and those of a Federal national, are they

the  same? In this connection, I would like to know

whether  the arrangement as contained in the  White

Paper is a true merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>



Two persons have spoken on this matter. One was the

Prime  Minister of the Federation of Malaya,  Tunku

Abdul  Rahman, and the other was the Prime Minister

of  our State. In the discussions between these two

persons,  there  can only be one truth.  The  Tunku

said  that  the present constitutional  arrangement

between  the  two territories is not a merger,  but

the  Prime Minister of Singapore said that it is  a

merger.  The  Prime Minister of the Federation  set

down   terms  in  a  letter  dated  13th   November

addressed to the Prime Minister of Singapore  which

are  very  clear.  In the fourth paragraph  of  his

letter,  he stated that he had already agreed  that

all  Singapore citizens would reserve their present

rights  and become automatic nationals of  the  new

Federation.  In  the  next  paragraph,  the   Tunku

pointed  out clearly that the demand for  automatic

conversion  of citizenship on merger could  not  be

accepted in his Constitution.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  just now I quoted a letter dated 13th October

from  the  Prime  Minister of  the.  Federation  of

Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, addressed to the  Prime

Minister of Singapore. This letter proved that  the

Prime  Minister  of the Federation was  willing  to

accept  Singapore  citizens  as  Federal  nationals

under  the  Federation constitutional arrangements.

But  he did not accept the automatic conversion  of

Singapore  citizens into Federal citizens.  On  the

other hand, our Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



has  repeatedly  informed the people  of  Singapore

that the definition of "citizenship" is the same as

that of "national".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said just now that there

can  only be one truth. In the conversation between

the   Prime   Ministers  of  the   Federation   and

Singapore, there can only be one person who  speaks

the  truth.  And everyone of us is aware  that  the

person  who speaks the truth is the Prime  Minister

of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government Members and the

Ministers  criticise us saying that we the  Barisan

Sosialis  fight for citizenship rights  because  we

are  going to stand for election in the Federation.

They say that that is wrong because the people  of

Singapore have fought for the rights of citizenship

and  for  participation in the  livelihood  of  the

people since the operation of socialism. We can see

this  sort  of reports in the newspapers  recently,

fighting for the rights of citizenship. As early as

1947  a group of Singapore merchants initiated this

type  of  movement to struggle for  the  rights  of

citizenship. The right of citizenship is to protect

the  right of everybody, participation in political

life and the livelihood of the people. How can  the

P.A.P. say that the fight for citizenship is by the

Barisan Sosialis and is only for the interests of a

few of them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I want to talk about

whether  we can get what we want. Just now  I  have

pointed  out  that  to  seek the  reunification  of

citizenship  rights in the country is  one  of  the

principles  of socialism. In Singapore the  present

ruling  P.A.P. Government has been elected  by  the

people  of Singapore. The P.A.P. Government has  no

right   to  hand  over  so  many  rights  to   the

Federation Government without preserving the rights

of   the  citizens  of  Singapore  in  the  Federal

Parliament. Rut the P.A.P. Government,  elected  by

the  people of Singapore, is not willing  to  fight

and will not fight for equal citizenship rights for

the  citizens of Singapore. Instead, they say  that

it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



unreasonable to fight for citizenship  rights,  and

they  accuse us of trying to confuse the people  by

demanding  equal citizenship rights. This  kind  of

argument by the ruling P.A.P. has angered many. The

fight  for  citizenship  rights  is  a  matter   of

principle. But whether we are able to achieve  this

is  not a matter of principle. When we want  to  do

something,   in   addition   to   resolution    and

willingness, we have to know how we are going to do

it, and what strength we have got to achieve it. On

the  question  of fighting for citizenship  rights,

the  Prime  Minister of Singapore did not  mobilise

the  people. Instead, he went to the Federation  of

Malaya to play golf by himself alone. Of course, he

could not achieve anything by doing this.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In this debate, I do not wish

to have any personalities of that nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, not to fight for what we should fight for, but

to fight for something which the Right-wingers want

to  give us; and not to want to fight for something

which the Rightist elements do not want to give us:

is  all  this not opportunism? We should especially

now  fight  for  what  we  should  fight  for.  But

instead,  they have not tried to do so.  The  Tunku

said that he was not willing. But he did not say it

could not be done. On this question, the Government

of  Singapore  has quoted the Constitution  of  the

Federation of Malaya at random, and has  been  misquoting  the Federation laws in trying  to  declare

this and that, but in the end the whole thing is in

a mess, and everything is confused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the motion by the

Minister  for  Labour  is unnecessary  because  the

search   for   the   reunification   of   the   two

territories, Singapore and the Federation, and  the

avoidance  of their separation have all along  been

the objective of Malayan nationalists and patriots.

In the platform of the P.A.P., merger is one of the

objectives.   In  the  platform  of   the   Barisan

Sosialis, merger is also one of the objectives. But

today the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>



want  to  embarrass  us  by  putting  forward  this

motion.  Is it not because we are opposed to  their

form  of  merger? Therefore, their  motion  include

such  phrases  as  "patriots" and "nationalism"  in

order  to  confuse the vision of the  people.  They

think  that  if  the  Barisan Sosialis  oppose  the

motion  by  the Minister for Labour, it will  prove

that the Barisan Sosialis are not patriotic but are

anti-nationalist. I want to ask: if we  oppose  the

motion   by  the  Minister  for  Labour,   are   we

unpatriotic? Are we not nationalists? I think  that

is  not  the  correct way to judge. I want  to  ask

them: when the Prime Minister of the Federation  of

Malaya said that he did not want merger between the

two  territories, did they say that the  Tunku  was

not  patriotic and was not a nationalist for having

said that? From this we can see that whether he  is

patriotic  or  nationalistic cannot be  decided  by

whether he supports the motion of the Minister  for

Labour.  For  instance, if the  Singapore  People's

Alliance  support  the motion of the  Minister  for

Labour,  can  they  be  termed  as  patriotic   and

nationalistic?  Even  now the British  colonialists

and  rulers  are  not  opposed  to  merger  between

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. Can we then

say  that  they  are  also  patriotic  and  Malayan

nationalists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. Government have all along stressed the question of autonomy in labour and education as proposed in the White Paper on merger.

They have repeatedly stressed that there should  be

such  a guarantee under the proposed constitutional

arrangement.  Mr  Speaker,  in  the  eyes  of  the

people, constitutional safeguards are useless.  The

reason  is that in the present Constitution of  the

Federation  of  Malaya, it is not stated  that  the

people should not have freedom of assembly, speech,

association and travel. The Constitution  does  not

also  provide  for  the  deprivation  of  political

rights  and  citizenship  rights.  But  today  when

certain citizens of Singapore wish to travel to the

Federation of Malaya, permits may be required.  For

instance,  when the students of Nanyang  University

travelled  to the Federation, they were accused  of

doing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>



so   without  first  having  obtained   a   permit.

Everybody   knows   the   case   of   the   Chinese

educationist, Mr Lim Leng Geok. He spoke on behalf

of Chinese education, but in the end he was accused

of  not being patriotic and loyal to the Federation

Government.  My  contention is that  written  safe-guards  in the Constitution cannot bring  peace  to

the  people. On the other hand, the fact  that  the

P.A.P.  Government  wants autonomy  in  labour  and

education  shows  that it knows that  many  of  the

policies  of the Federation of Malaya, particularly

in  regard  to  education  and  labour,  cannot  be

accepted by the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to enumerate a few instances to show that

the people do not believe in written safeguards  in

the   Constitution.   This  is  because,   firstly,

everybody knows that the Federation Government  has

the right, through the Central Parliament, to amend

the   Constitution.  Secondly,  and  this  is  more

important,  the people of Singapore have themselves

learnt  from two years' experience that the  P.A.P.

leadership are not doing things according  to  what

they have promised to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the first Anniversary Souvenir of the P.A.P. the Secretary-General, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, wrote an article on the stand of the P.A.P. In this

article,  he says, "What we want is an independent,

democratic   Malaya."  Our  political  beliefs   and

objectives  can  be achieved through  peaceful  and

constitutional means. In a democratic  Malaya,  any

citizen,  as long as he is willing, will  have  the

right  to  persuade the people to form a democratic

Malaya  or  even  a  Communist Malaya."  Today  the

people know that the P.A.P. have forgotten what  they

have  said. The P.A.P. have all along stressed that

they  do  not  belong  to  the  Russian  bloc,  the

S.E.A.T.O. bloc  or the anti-Communist  bloc.  All

this  is written in the first. Anniversary Souvenir

of  the  P.A.P.  All  this is what  the  Secretary-General, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, said in this Souvenir.

But today his stand has changed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today everyone of us knows that the Tunku is a staunch anti-Communist. Whether or not the Tunku's anti-Communist attitude is correct is another

matter.  But  we  know that since the  Tunku  is  anti-Communist, only is he anti-Communist in Malaya, but his

stand  on  anti-Communism has been extended beyond  the

shores of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the Nanyang Siang Pau of 25th November

said when reporting a Reuter's news item issued on 23rd

November.  It reported the Tunku's answers in  a  Press

conference when replying to questions put by reporters.

When  a  journalist asked the Tunku whether he  thought

that  after the establishment of Malaysia, there  would

be  a greater opportunity for him to counter the threat

of  Chinese  Communists, Tunku  Abdul  Rahman  replied,

"Yes.  I  think it is correct to say so."  In  all  his

talks, the Tunku has stressed that his main interest in

Malaysia was mainly to oppose Communism. I do not  want

to  criticise the Tunku and say whether he was  correct

or not in saying such things. But I just want to remind

the people that the P.A.P. has changed its stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now want to quote from the P.A.P.

Party  organ  of 7th November, 1958. This is  from  the

editorial  of  the  21st issue. The  title  is,  "Anti-Communist,  non-Communist and pro-Communist."  It  then

says  that to be anti-Communist means to fall into  the

hands  of  the  reactionaries. This is  a  useless  and

negative   policy.  The  end  would  be  disaster   and

unfortunate.  This  is to support people  like  Syngman

Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek in their fight against the 600

million  Chinese people. The revolution  in  China  has

been  the  greatest event in recent history.  The  most

insignificant  thing that can be done  in  Asia  is  to

oppose  this  revolution and to oppose the 600  million

Chinese. That would be a most futile thing to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore are acting

according to their own experience. They fully know that

what the P.A.P. have uttered in so many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



words  on  paper  are useless. How can  they  make  the

people  of  Singapore  believe that  once  autonomy  in

education  and labour is written into the Constitution,

this  autonomy will be safeguarded and the people  will

be  well assured? This is especially so when, in  their

two  years  of office, the P.A.P. have not carried  out

their  policy  on labour and education,  as  they  have

promised.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to point  out  once

more  that according to the P.A.P. type of merger,  the

citizens of Singapore cannot have pan-Malayan franchise

and become citizens of Malaya. Then what is the meaning

of  this  merger?  According to  the  P.A.P. type  of

merger, the future citizens of Singapore, wishing to be

citizens  of  the Federation of Malaya,  will  have  to

comply  with  the  Five-year  or  ten-year  residential

qualification.   They  will  be  restricted   by   this

qualification and limitation. According to the contents

of the P.A.P.'s White Paper on merger, i.e., after this

kind of merger is realised, the people of Singapore and

the  status of Singapore cannot even be compared to the

status  of  the Bornean territories before  they  merge

into the new Federation. On the question of citizenship

rights,  the Member for Queenstown and the  Member  for

Thomson have both given very clear explanations. It  is

not necessary for me to reiterate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want now only to reply to several questions which

the Ministers and P.A.P. Assemblymen have asked us. The

Minister for Culture and the Minister for Home  Affairs

have repeatedly asked us whether we agree to the Rahman

Talib Report. I want to tell them categorically that it

is  not  necessary for a citizen of a country to  agree

entirely with the policies of the ruling Party and  the

P.A.P.  On this question, we advocate that the citizens

of  Singapore should automatically become  citizens  of

the Federation on Merger Day. It does not mean that  we

agree   with   all  the  policies  of  the   Federation

Government. The policy of a country is decided  by  the

people.  In  other  words, it  depends  on  citizenship

rights.  Whether  or not we agree to the  Rahman  Talib

Report, we already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>



explained this very clearly on the 28th of August.  Our

Party Assemblymen have also quoted what we said on that

day in regard to these questions. But I want to mention

it  here once more. From what the P.A.P. Ministers have

asked  us, we can see that their views are that  anyone

who  wants to be a citizen should agree with the policy

of  the ruling Party. Now, this explains why there  are

so  many  people in Singapore who have not yet acquired

citizenship rights. In fact, there are no provisions in

the  constitution of any democratic country to say that

a  citizen  should support the policies of  the  ruling

Party in order to become citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Singapore and the Federation of Malaya have been separated by the British colonialists for 16 years. After this 16 years, the Federation of Malaya

has   a   Right-wing  Government  which  supports   the

capitalists.  But on the other hand,  in  Singapore  we

have a Left-wing people who dominate the population and

who    support   socialism.   Even   capitalists    and

reactionaries who want to organise Parties must  do  so

in the name of socialism in order to get the support of

the  people.  So  from these two sets of  circumstances

existing in the two territories, we can see that  there

is  a  great deal of difference. If the present  Right-wing  Government  in  the Federation  does  not  accept

complete   merger   then  that  is  but   natural   and

understandable. But the question is, if the  Federation

Government is not willing to have complete merger, then

we  should, on our part, try to seek other ways of  co-operation  between the two territories.  In  the  first

place, the Government should hold meetings with all the

political Parties in Singapore. It should also  consult

the people's organisations to seek ways and means of co-operation  between  Singapore and the  Federation.  The

Government  should by no means try to rush matters  for

the  sake of their own power. The Government should not

try to hand over the destiny of the people in Singapore

to  the Right-wing Government in the Federation.  There

are  many  Members in this House, including Members  in

the Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



who  have  said that merger is necessary. It should  be

something  which  has come out of necessity  from  both

sides.  I will ask them to consult the people and  find

out  from  them  whether they are  willing  to  have  a

merger.  I  have  just  said  that  Singapore  and  the

Federation  have  two different sets  of  circumstances

and, therefore,  things  which  are  beneficial   and

advantageous to the Federation Government need  not  be

advantageous to the people of Singapore. The Federation

Government  is a feudalistic and capitalist Government.

But  in  the  case  of Singapore, the  great  force  is

socialism. So in these circumstances, to use  force  to

rush  through the P.A.P. type of merger will not  bring

prosperity  and well-being to the country.  This  is  a

question  which is worth our consideration. The  people

of   Singapore,   especially   the   Chinese,   support

socialism,  but  the ruling clique  in  the  Federation

prefers  the capitalist system. So if we have a  merger

according  to  the P.A.P. plan, then  the  question  of

communalism  will become more and more acute.  This  is

because  the  P.A.P. has itself said in  a  publication

during  the election that the struggle against economic

exploitation  can  easily be described  as  a  communal

conflict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have spoken from the Opposition side.

They  have  pointed out that according to the  type  of

merger proposed by the P.A.P., it is doubtful that  the

life of the people in Singapore will improve. This  has

not  been denied by the Minister for Finance. In  other

words,  he cannot even assure us that after merger  the

people  in Singapore will be able to enjoy a prosperous

life with many employment opportunities. The P.A.P. think

that the people of Singapore are dissatisfied with  the

present  situation and so they want to have  merger  as

soon as possible. But the dissatisfaction of the people

with the present situation cannot be resolved by merger

alone. The dissatisfaction has mainly stemmed from  the

fact  that  there is a strong force of colonialists  in

Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of the  last

two  years  I  have been a Member of the Government.  I

know the difficulties of forming a government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



and ruling the country. But the question is whether the

Government,  when  confronted  with  difficulties,   is

courageous enough to face them and tell the people  the

actual cause of such difficulties. On the contrary, the

Government, instead of doing this, is trying  to  cover

up  these  difficulties in defence of the colonialists.

Generally  speaking, the dissatisfaction of the  people

has  come about because the Government is arrogant  and

dictatorial  in  its  attitude.  Instead  of  examining

itself for its faults, the Government is trying to  get

assistance  from  the  Right-wing  Government  in   the

Federation -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There appears to be something

wrong   with  the  interpretation.  It  is  not  coming

through. Would the hon. Member like to try again?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we

all know that every true follower of socialism wants  a

society  in which there is no exploitation  of  man  by

man,  that  is to say, he wants to reform  the  present

situation. He must necessarily, through his  words  and

deeds,  organise  the  people so that  they  will  come

forward  and take part in a social reform.  The  P.A.P.

knows what kind of Party is in power in the Federation.

In  an  article written by the Minister for Culture  on

19th  April, 1959, he stated that the communal  parties

in  Malaya  were  generally of  the  opinion  that  the

present economic system should be maintained. In  other

words,   the  P.A.P. want  to  maintain  a  capitalist

society.  If  after merger we still remain a  socialist

Party, we will continue to fight for the objectives  of

socialism  and  we  will still  continue  to  create  a

society  in which there is no exploitation  of  man  by

man.  If  we  do  all this, it will  be  considered  as

subversive  activities.  It will  be  natural  for  the

P.A.P. to say so. The Federation Government  will  not

like  to have such a Party and it will not allow people

to carry out social reforms or overthrow the capitalist

system. All activities in this respect will not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



allowed. Anybody who wants to carry out social reforms

will be considered a Communist by the Party in power

which wants to maintain the status quo.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder how the argument which

is being put forward can be an argument in favour of a

genuine merger. It seems to be an argument against

merger. Let us try to stick to the amendment which asks

for a genuine merger. Mr Chan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in

a short while, I will

be talking about our stand because, in the course of

speeches made by the Ministers of the Government,

accusations were made against us to the effect that we

are afraid of being arrested by the Federation

Government. In his speech, the Prime Minister himself

said many, many things about communism, communalism,

socialism and nationalism. I will take about one or two

minutes to explain this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not care whether our actions

are advantageous or disadvantageous to the Communists.

Our main aim is to do things which are in the interest

of the people. The Prime !Minister himself has said

that things which are conducive to the interest of the

people may also be conducive to the interest of the

Communists. Therefore, on this question of merger, we

are not afraid of being scolded or being called any

names by anybody. We want to go about merger in the

interests of the people and the socialists. Now the

P.A.P. says that as the fight for citizenship rights is

beneficial to the Communists, we must not pursue it.

This is not acceptable to us. The Ministers in the

Government have said that a Communist is only known to

himself and his God. Of course, you also have

intelligence agents who know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of merger, I would like to ask the

P.A.P. to say whether a sell out of Singapore, is not

detrimental to the interest's of the people. I think

this question can only be answered by the people

themselves, apart from God and the P.A.P. itself. We

have stated that we are content to have a complete

merger even if it may bring frustration to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



the  socialists. As long as the people  have  equal

citizenship rights with those in the Federation, we

in  the  socialist front are prepared to make  such

sacrifices.  If  the Federation  Government  cannot

accept  Singapore  citizens as  Federal  citizens,

then we should try to find other ways .and means to

bring about more co-operation between Singapore and

the    Federation,   The   two   territories    are

economically  associated and they are complementary

to  each  other. We do not care about the political

beliefs  of  each  Government so long  as  the  co-operation  between the two Governments will  enable

the  people  of both territories to find  ways  and

means to bring them closer together. Our contention

is   that  if  the  Federation  Government  is  not

prepared  to  accept complete merger, then  we  can

have a form of confederation or .even complete self-government.  I do not see anything wrong  in  this.

Even  in  complete self-government, foreign affairs

and the defence of Singapore can be handed over  to

the  Central  Government in  the  Federation.  The

P.A.P. have  all  along  been  in  favour  of  the

existence of the Internal Security Council  because

they   want  to  have  an  excuse  to  shirk  their

responsibilities.  The  Member  for  Cairnhill  has

pointed out that trade unions and so on should  not

be   interfered  with  by  the  Internal   Security

Council. This explains why the P.A.P. want to  have

the Internal Security Council so that they can have

an excuse to shirk their responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me show whether the P.A.P. are sincere

towards  the Federation Government. It is  a  pity

that  the Prime Minister is not in this House today

for he will not be able to prove to us that what I

am  going  to say is false. Before the P.A.P. came

into power I had occasion to discuss with the Prime

Minister the relationship between Singapore and the

Federation. He told me that the best way  would  be

for  Singapore and the Federation to merge so  that

the   Singapore  Government  would   be   a   local

government. If that is the case, it would be easier

for  the  people to take charge of the  government.

The  Prime  Minister  also  said  that  if  we  did

anything good, credit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



for it could be claimed by the local government  of

Singapore. But if we did anything bad, it could  be

pushed on to the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we see that the P.A.P. is stressing and

repeating again and again autonomy in education and

labour.  This  is only a realisation  of  what  the

Prime  Minister  thought at that time.  The  P.A.P.

Government  said  that the situation  after  merger

would  be one in which Singapore will have autonomy

in  education and labour, that is to say, the  pro-labour  policy  will  be a  credit  to  the  P.A.P.

Government and the system of equal treatment of the

four language streams will also be a credit to  the

P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the arrest of people and the toeing of the

Right-wing line in the international field and .the

inability  to improve the livelihood of the  people

of  Singapore,  the  blame  could  be  put  on  the

Federation.  This  is  the true  intention  of  the

P.A.P. merger. This intention, in my opinion,  does

not  show  the  sincerity  of  the  Prime  Minister

towards the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has this to say on the present situation in Singapore. The Prime Minister in his analysis had occasion to tell me, before I left the P.A.P., that Singapore could only have three types of situations. The first situation would be one in which the S.P.A. would come in again to take office. The second situation would be one in which the P.A.P. Government continued in

office until the constitutional talks in 1963.  The

third  situation would be one in which a  Left-wing

Party  rose to take office. According to the  Prime

Minister,  it this Left-wing Party should  come  in

and  take  office, it would mean the suspension  of

the   constitution  and  chaos  in   our   society.

Therefore, the Prime Minister said that  the  Tunku

was in favour of having a Right-wing Government  in

Singapore,  since  it would be beneficial  to  the

Federation  Government. And if  the  P.A.P. should

continue to hold office so that the status  quo  is

maintained,  then nothing harmful would  happen  to

the  Federation Government. But in the  case  of  a

Left-wing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



Government, the result would be the suspension  of  the

constitution.   And  this  situation  would   also   be

disadvantageous to the Federation Government.  This  is

the  view  of  the Prime Minister on the  situation  in

Singapore.   He   knows   that   under   the    present

circumstances, genuine Left-wing forces are  trying  to

overthrow  the  P.A.P. Government  and  replace  it  by

peaceful   means.  He  knows  that  this  is  possible.

Furthermore, he himself feels that there is no evidence

to  explain that Singapore would be in chaos if a Party

which  is more Left than the P.A.P. should take office.

So  the only way he could choose now is to prevent  the

Left-wing  forces  from taking over the  place  of  the

P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the P.A.P. must depend on

its own strength to maintain its position.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was waiting very patiently to hear the

Member  for  Upper Serangoon relate all  this  to  the

merger  problem.  As I have indicated  earlier  on,  he

seems  to be arguing against his own amendment.  If  he

will come back to his amendment, perhaps we will get

on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I feel that what I

have said is not irrelevant but explains why the P.A.P.

wants to bring up their original motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances as I have mentioned, the only

way  for the P.A.P. is to contest with Lim Yew Hock for

the support of the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the P.A.P. is no longer a Left-wing Party. It

is  no  longer enjoying the confidence of  the  people.

Although in the motion of the Minister for Labour there

is  some  mention of colonialists, in actual fact,  the

P.A.P. is not scolding the colonialists any more.  The

People's  Action  Party Ministers try  to  analyse  all

sorts  of  forces in their speeches. For  example,  the

Deputy  Prime Minister said in Hong Lim Green  on  22nd

February,  1959,  at  a  mass rally,  that  behind  the

Singapore People's Alliance, there were three types  of

forces. The first force was the compradores in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



local  banks.  The  second force lies  in  Britain  and

America,  who  are supporting Lim Yew Hock.  The  third

force  lies  in  the Ministers of the  Federation,  for

example, the Education Minister,. Inche Johari. I would

like  to  ask  the Ministers in the P.A.P.:  where  are

these forces which support Lim Yew Hock? How is it that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am still in the dark as to how

these remarks are related to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It is my intention

to  point out why the Four-Party Alliance supports  the

P.A.P. in  this type of merger. I want to explain  why

they should have concerted action on this question.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is that relevant to the

amendment?  We are asking the House, on the  amendment,

to affirm and declare that "the avowed objective of all

true patriots of Malaya is to achieve the reunification

of    these   two   territories"   - (taking   in    the

amendment) - "in a genuine merger of Singapore  with  the

Federation  of  Malaya,  with  Singapore  entering  the

Federation  as the twelfth state, and all its  Citizens

automatically becoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day."

The fact that Parties gang up in this matter surely  is

not relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have  brought up this amendment to the motion  to  show

that  Singapore citizens must become Federal  citizens.

When  we  do  this, we are shouted at by the  Party  in

power. The Minister for Finance says that our amendment

to  the  motion has been brought up in order to  create

trouble  and  confusion among the people. The  Minister

for  Culture even goes to the extent of saying angrily,

"Well,  you must be careful. The locomotive of  history

will  come  and run over you." Why should  they  be  so

angry? Well, this reminds me of a story written by Hans

Anderson  of Denmark. The story is entitled,  "The  new

cloak  of  the Emperor." I do not wish to  relate  this

story  at  length. But I would suggest to the Ministers

that they go and buy a copy each of this book published

by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



Oxford  University  Press  in London,  entitled  "Fairy

Tales  by Hans Anderson". From this book they  will  be

able  to  pick up the relevant paragraphs so that  they

will know why the Emperor was very angry when he put on

a  cloak which was non-existent. When a boy pointed out

to  him that he was actually wearing a cloak which  was

non-existent, he became very angry. Mr Speaker, Sir, I

will  tell  you this. Many students in Chinese  schools

know  this fact very well. Mr Speaker, Sir, I  do  not

know  whether  you will allow me to relate  this  story

briefly  because the Minister for Finance seems  to  be

challenging me.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think we have had enough of

fairy   tales.   We  had  one  fairy  tale   from   the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Education.

Now  we  are  having a fairy tale from the  Member  for

Upper  Serangoon. I think we have had enough  of  fairy

tales. Let us get on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  already  said that the Minister for  Culture  has

emphasised that merger is inevitable. He said that  the

locomotive  of history might run over us.  I  ask  him,

"What is this locomotive of history?" Is it the P.A.P.?

No.  Is  it the Federation Government? I will say  "No"

again.  The locomotive of merger is to be found in  the

forces of those who are anti-colonialist. The so-called

Greater  Malaysia and the so-called merger between  the

Federation  and  Singapore will  chart  the  course  of

events  very clearly. Merger is inevitable because  the

forces of anti-colonialists are constantly expanding in

these territories. This is not only so in Singapore but

also  in  the whole of South-East Asia. We can even  go

beyond  this  and  say  that  anti-colonialism  extends

throughout the whole world. The anti-colonialist forces

are expanding. They are the locomotives of history. You

can  see  this anti-colonial struggle in the Afro-Asian

countries.   If   the  P.A.P. are  no   longer   anti-colonialist, then it is they who will be  run  over  by

the locomotive of history. The locomotive of history is

running  very  fast.  So if they  do  not  want  to  be

eliminated, then, in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>



words of the Minister for Culture, they still have some

time to rectify their ways. They had better make use of

this opportunity. Go home and sleep.



<br><br>6.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, if we want to establish a nation, we must

have  a  national basis on which to build this  nation.

But  while the P.A.P., on the one hand, propagate  that

they  want  to merge with the Federation, on the  other

hand, they refuse our reasonable and legitimate request

for  automatic equal citizenship rights. The Government

have  used  the  term "national" to  explain  away  the

difference between "citizenship" and "nationality".  We

believe  this  intention will  not  be  successful.  We

resolutely oppose the White Paper on merger proposed by

the   Government.  We  oppose  this  even   though   it

stipulates that Singapore will have autonomy in  labour

and  education. We should think in terms  of  long-term

objectives and interests. This is better than  what  is

envisaged in the Government's White Paper and certainly

more  beneficial to the people. The Minister for Labour

is  asking the Assembly to support the motion.  One  of

the  platforms  of  the United People's  Party  is  the

concepts   of   merger  between  the  two  territories.

Therefore, we believe that merger should be  a  genuine

merger.   But   the   constitutional  arrangements   as

envisaged in the White Paper are not conducive to  that

aim.  The  motion is contradictory to what is contained

in  the  White  Paper. If we accept  the  Minister  for

Labour's   motion,  we  will  be  opposing  the   Prime

Minister's  proposal,  because under  the  White  Paper

there will be two kinds of citizenship. Therefore,  our

stand is to accept the principle of merger as contained

in  the  motion  by  the Minister for  Labour,  if  the

Government   accept  the  amendment  by   the   Barisan

Sosialis, as we have accepted it, because merger  means

equal  citizenship rights. These are not contradictory.

When   we   consider  the  amendment  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  we  feel that the White Paper by  the  Prime

Minister  will be more acceptable after the  amendment,

because there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



should  not  be  two kinds of citizenship  in  the  two

territories.  That is our stand on the motion  and  the

amendment before us.



<br><br>6.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is generally accepted in countries which are pledged to

the  democratic  form of parliamentary government  that

the  main  function of the Opposition is to oppose  the

Government.  That  is  the reason  why  the  Opposition

exists.  Even  in  the older established  parliamentary

democracies  like England, occasions have  arisen  when

the  Opposition  has felt that it is not  its  duty  to

oppose the Government but to support it. Such occasions

are  those  which concern the safety of the State,  the

people  as a whole, and the country at large.  That  is

so,  Mr  Speaker,  even in the older  countries  where

societies  are stable, and where religious differences,

racial  differences  and  the little  annoyances  which

create  trouble  in democratic institutions  have  been

eliminated. In a young and small country such as  ours,

which has set its destiny purposely and avowedly on the

parliamentary   road,  and  where  we   have   not   an

established society in the sense that society at  large

thinks  coherently as one interest,  it  is  even  more

vital  and more urgent, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  certain

areas of government should not be purely party matters.

So  far  as  I  am concerned personally, I have  always

advocated that there are certain areas of government in

Singapore  which  are  not party matters  but  national

matters.  It is not only the concern of the Government,

but  it  is  also  the concern of the  Opposition  that

whatever   political   creed  or   whatever   political

philosophy we may have, there is one common  ground  on

which all Parties must meet, and that is he advancement

and the betterment of our country. I think the question

of  merger,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is one such  subject.  I

speak  not  as a member of my Party nor as a Member  of

the Opposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



but  as  a Member of this House, which  necessity

must  be  interested in the ultimate  destiny  of  this

country and its place in Asian history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I was privileged to take part in that historic forum where I think the Minister for Finance spoke for the Government; the Member for Queenstown

spoke for the Barisan Sosialis; the Member for Hong Lim

spoke  for  the United People's Party; and  I  for  the

Alliance. Sir, in respect of one of the questions  that

was posed to the forum, I advocated that the Government

should call a round-table conference on the question of

merger.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, it was not my intention  to

embarrass  the  Government  by  calling  a  round-table

conference. But I honestly and sincerely felt then, and

I  do feel now, that merger is not a P.A.P. matter.  It

is not a party matter. It is a matter that concerns the

P.A.P., as well as the Alliance, the Workers' Party  or

any  other political Party in Singapore. That is how  I

felt  then,  Mr Speaker, Sir, and that is how  I  feel

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Order Paper, Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have  this  motion which was proposed on  the  20th  of

November,  1961, since when, as you so often have  said

at  every sitting of this Assembly - meaning the 21st  of

November,  1961 - an amendment was proposed thereto.  We

are still on the amendment, and with some luck we might

get  through with it this evening. And for this, I hold

the Prime Minister entirely to blame. If he had adopted

an  entirely  different attitude  to  the  question  of

merger, and had posed this whole problem to the  people

of  Singapore  without giving a party slant  to  it,  I

venture  to  suggest to you, Mr Speaker, Sir,  in  all

earnestness  and seriousness, that we  might  not  have

been  debating the amendment 11 days after it has  been

moved,  and I think a lot of the acrimonious discussion

that  has gone on in this Chamber could well have  been

avoided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have accused the Government of

salvaging  its  bankrupt fortunes by  trying  to  bring

about a merger. The position, in reality, is this: that

all  the  Parties - the Singapore People's Alliance,  the

Workers' Party,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



and every single Party that contested the elections  in

the year 1959 - accepted merger as the ultimate political

solution  for  Singapore. So we are  all  committed  to

merger,  now, tomorrow or in the future, and  the  only

thing  that  kept us away from merger  was  whether  we

could get merger.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question whether we could get merger, it

depended on how readily the Federation Government would

react  to  any suggestion of merger from the  Singapore

Government. It has so happened that up till sometime in

May  1961,  the  Federation Government had  steadfastly

refused to discuss the question of merger, and it  only

became  possible  to  discuss it  when  the  Federation

Government, speaking through the Prime Minister of  the

Federation,  Tunku Abdul Rahman, made  an  announcement

that he thought that the time was opportune. I think it

was  the leader of the Barisan Sosialis who asked  this

question  of  the House, directed at the Government - why

was  it that the Tunku, who had so steadfastly set  his

face  against a merger, should, on the face of  it,  so

suddenly  appear to change his mind? Not only  did  the

leader  of the Barisan Sosialis ask this question,  but

various  Members  from the Barisan Sosialis  side  also

asked  the  Government that. But  no  answer  has  been

forthcoming.  Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may  conjecture  a

reason for it. The Barisan Sosialis have suggested that

the  real  reason  why  the Federation  Government  has

agreed  to  a  merger at this stage is that  the  Prime

Minister of Singapore has been shooting a line  to  the

Tunku  about  Communists  in Singapore  and  about  the

Barisan  Sosialis, and has so worked up the Tunku  that

he  has  got frightened and thought it better  to  have

merger now. That is the line the Barisan Sosialis  take

on the question why the Tunku has agreed to a merger. I

do  not  agree  with  that line  at  all.  That  rather

presupposes that the Tunku does not know what is  going

on  in  Singapore. I venture to suggest to the  Members

behind me that the Tunku is very well informed of  what

is going on in Singapore. With due respect to the Prime

Minister - and I hope he does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



not  take offence - perhaps the Tunku is as equally  well

informed of what is going on in Singapore as the  Prime

Minister  himself and his colleagues in the Cabinet.  I

do not think, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Tunku was sold

a  pup  by  the Singapore Prime Minister. He  knew  the

situation and he knew that he had to act. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, with great respect to the Member for Cairnhill,  I

do  not  believe the Tunku would agree to  merger  with

Singapore  merely because the Member for Cairn-hill  is

his good friend. Histories of countries and nations are

not  decided  on  this basis - "He  is  my  good  friend.

Therefore, I will give him what he wants." If that were

the  basis  for any sort of merger, we might  have  had

merger three or four years ago. But we did not have it.

So what then is the reason for the sudden volte-face of

the  Tunku? Some reason must be forthcoming. I  venture

to  suggest one reason. Whether it is a correct one  or

just  a conjecture or a fairy tale I do not know. Since

all  of  us are indulging in fairy tales, perhaps,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, you might allow me one little fairy tale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Federation was set up and Singapore was

split from the Federation, it suited the purpose of the

British  and  the  Federation  Government  to  separate

Singapore. That was the only reason that kept us apart.

If  the  Federation had wanted us then and the  British

had  wanted to keep us, I think we would have  gone  to

the  Federation. The real reason why we were  separated

was  that the Federation then thought Singapore  should

be kept apart, and this also happened to tally with the

British desire to keep Singapore as a Colony. That  was

about  15 or 16 years ago. History has moved very  fast

in   this  region.  Although  Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  at  the back like to flog the dead  horse  of

colonialism, it is well and truly dead today. Not  even

the  Barisan Sosialis can revive it, however much  they

try.  It  is well and truly dead, and the British  know

it.  The  British  are  smart, much  smarter  than  the

Barisan  Sosialis. The British know that  the  days  of

colonialism are dead and gone.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the little fairy story that

I  want to tell you; that the British have gone to  the

Tunku  and told him, "Look, Mr Prime Minister, we  are

clearing  out  of Singapore, and that is  God's  truth.

Singapore  is going to be your baby. You have  to  look

after  it."  Well, the Tunku is a responsible  man.  He

knows that if the toenail is infected, the poison  will

soon  travel to the heart and the brain. He has got  to

do  something  about it. It is not a  question  of  the

Tunku  wanting to help Singapore and Singapore  wanting

to  help  the  Federation. It is a question  of  mutual

necessity.  I  have always maintained  the  proposition

that  the  Federation  must sooner  or  later  take  in

Singapore. It is not today that I am saying this but  I

have  said  this on every single occasion  and  at  any

single  opportunity that I have had of  ventilating  my

views on this. I have always said so. I took this  line

at   the  C.P.A.  Conference  here  when  I  told   the

Federation representatives, "You will have to  take  us

in  whether you like it or not." And they have to  take

us  in. There is no question of anybody being sold  to

somebody.  It  is a question that our mutual  interests

have  to bring us together. Our economic interests  are

such  that  we have to join up with the Federation  and

their  political interests are such that they  have  to

take  us  in.  It  is  our good fortune  that  on  this

particular  occasion, our interests meet  and  coincide

and there is a mutual desire to come together, and that

is  why we have come together. It is not a question  of

the  Prime Minister of Singapore selling a line to  the

Tunku,  that  the  Barisan Sosialis  are  at  it;  that

Singapore is ridden with Communists, and all that  sort

of thing; because, on that, the Tunku is much more well

informed than are the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Sir, if you will forgive me, I want to tell

another  little fairy story before I wind  up  on  this

subject of fairy stories. Sir, we have heard about  the

internecine quarrels among the P.A.P. These  have  been

going on since the Government took power in June



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



1959,  up  to the time they openly parted company.  Mr

Lim  Ching Siong and the Prime Minister were  lying  in

the  same  bed - uneasy bed-fellows. But they would  have

continued to remain uneasy bed-fellows quarrelling with

each  other.  The person who parted them, Mr  Speaker,

Sir - and  this is the fairy tale - is the Tunku himself.

When the Tunku made the announcement that merger was  a

possibility,  then  it was that the bed-fellows  parted

company.  That  was  the point of time  when  the  open

differences of the P.A.P. came about. That was the time

when  Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong, the ex-Member  for  Bukit

Timah,  decided  that he could not carry  on  with  the

Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister knew that he was

getting  the better of Mr Lim Ching Siong. As soon  as

the  Prime  Minister  of  the  Federation  announced  a

merger,  they parted company. That, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

is  my  second fairy story - and I did not get that  from

Hans Anderson's Fairy Tales!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think it was the Member for Anson who used be phrase "a political amendment", and by a political amendment, I think he meant an amendment not

really  mean what it said on the face of it. My quarrel

with  the motion and with the amendment is this - and

this  is  the difficulty, and that is why we  have  had

this  12-day  debate in this House - that the  Government

was trying to get the better of the Barisan Sosialis by

this motion. The Government said, "We will propose this

motion  and we will see how the Barisan Sosialis  react

to  it."  Mr Speaker, Sir, I blame the Government  for

this.  As  I  have  indicated  previously,  this  is  a

national  issue.  This is not a little  party  struggle

across this table here. The interests involved are  too

vital, too urgent and too important for the survival of

this little island of ours for this issue to be made  a

party struggle and for the Prime Minister to score over

the  Barisan Sosialis. The Barisan Sosialis reacted  as

humans would. They said, "If you are trying to get  the

better of us, we will try and get one better over you."

They have proposed an amendment which is even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



more  deplorable than the motion itself. Because  I  am

convinced in my own mind that the Barisan Sosialis  are

not  politically such children as they make  themselves

out  to be. If you are trying to negotiate with another

country  about  merging with them, you, as  responsible

people  of  the  country, know exactly  what  would  be

acceptable to the other side. You know what  the  fears

of  the  other side are. If you are really sincere  and

honest  in  your  desire to come to them,  you  do  not

kindle  those  fears to get some sort of understanding.

You try and play those fears down. After having secured

an   agreement,   you   then  try   to   revive   these

controversial issues, and try to quench the fears which

the  other side has. Whether those fears are reasonable

or not is not the point at the moment. But the point at

the moment is that those fears do exist and we have  to

recognise  them as fears, whether or not  we  are  true

socialists,  as the Member for Thomson  has  said.  The

difficulty of the Member for Thomson, in my  own  view,

is  this.  He  is  an earnest young  socialist.  As  an

earnest  young socialist, he thinks that  human  beings

should  behave in a certain way. The government of  the

world should be carried out in a certain way. If it  is

not carried out in a certain way, then he blows up. But

that  is  not how life is lived. We have to accommodate

ourselves  to  other points of view. If the  Federation

thinks in a certain way and if we do not agree with  it

and if we have to come back to the Federation, then  we

have  to readjust our way of thinking, our way of life,

and even our political institutions maybe, in order  to

accommodate them. After merger and using the democratic

process, we can help to rectify any errors and  try  to

dilute  some  of the difficulties which, in  our  view,

exist over there. This is the way and that is the  time

to do it. But while going to the Federation and saying,

"We  want a merger, we want reunification, we  want  to

come  back to our brothers," we yet say, "Oh,  we  will

only  come  back  if a, b, c and d are  given  to  us,"

knowing full well that it was a, b, c and d which  kept

us  apart  from  1945  up to now.  Therefore,  to  that

extent, I consider this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



amendment a political amendment, and I am confirmed  in

this  view  by what I have read in a Press  statement - I

think  it  is called The Wartawan - published in November

1961 - where a number of political Parties were asked  to

contribute  their  views.  Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong,  the

Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis, was asked to

contribute and he did so - and what an excellent article

it  is.  I  intend  to  use it today.  In  one  of  the

paragraphs, he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It has now become obvious that only the people of

Singapore  want merger while the Federation  Government

does  not  want  merger. For merger to materialise, it

must have the consent of both parties.'



<br><br>That  is what I thought and that is what Mr Lim  Ching

Siong  thought. But listening to the debate  on  either

side,  between  the Barisan Sosialis  and  the  P.A.P.,

apparently the consent of both sides does not matter. I

will read on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In view of the Federation Government's attitude, the

aspirations  of  the  people for genuine  reunification

cannot be achieved at this juncture.'



<br><br>I will read it again, Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In view of the Federation Government's attitude, the

aspirations  of  the  people for genuine  reunification

cannot be achieved at this juncture.'



<br><br>I am informed - I am subject to correction here -  that

although  the  paper was dated November  1961,  it  was

published for reading before 31st October, 1961. I make

a  point  of the date because this motion was moved  on

20th  November,  1961,  and the amendment  thereto  was

moved  on 21st November, 1961. When this amendment  was

moved by the Barisan Sosialis, the Secretary-General of

the Barisan Sosialis, who, I take it, is to the Barisan

Sosialis  today  what  the Prime Minister  was  to  the

People's Action Party in 1959 and is the mouthpiece  of

the  Party, adumbrating the policies of the Party,  the

hopes  and fears of the Party, and the person who  puts

out  analyses of the situation - political,  economic  or

otherwise - as  seen by the Party. The analysis  then  of

the  situation on 31st October, 1961, from the  Barisan

Sosialis, was this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In view of the Federation Government's attitude, the

aspirations  of  the  people for genuine  reunification

cannot be achieved at this juncture.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



Is  it a correct analysis. If it is a correct analysis,

what  is the point and purpose of this amendment?  What

game is the Barisan Sosialis playing? Is it to make the

approach so difficult that the answer must be  a  "No".

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I am fortified in  that  suggestion

because,  in  the speech by the Member for  Queenstown,

not  only  did  he say that he wanted all  the  640,000

Singapore  citizens to become automatically  registered

as  Federal citizens and Singapore to come  in  as  the

twelfth State, but he made this further very astounding

statement  which rather surprised me - I am  subject  to

correction   if   I  misunderstood   the   Member   for

Queenstown - "I  want  it written into  the  Constitution

that  it  will  not be possible to have  any  of  these

persons deregistered."



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> For political

reasons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, political reasons maybe

or  economic reasons, but what I am suggesting  to  the

Member  for Queenstown is that this is not the  way  to

get a merger of any sort, be it phoney or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They do not want merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis are

saying  that they want a complete merger now. 'That  is

the  point  and purpose of this amendment. Here  again,

may I quote the mouthpiece of the Barisan Sosialis -

the  super-analyst of the present political  situation?

On page 3, column 2, about midway down, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Tunku, in discussing his present views on

merger,  stated that because of the differences arising

from  separate policies, complete merger at the present

moment  would  cause some degree of uneasiness  in  the

minds  of  the  people of both territories.  He  stated

again.  "But one thing is certain and that is we cannot

take  Singapore  with us in complete merger  without  a

great deal of unhappiness and trouble."'



<br><br>So  the Barisan Sosialis know all this. They know  that

unhappiness  will be caused there and I  am  sure  they

also  know  that unhappiness will be caused here  in  a

complete merger. And yet we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



have  had  it  for  ten days now, "We want  a  complete

merger.  This  is the only way to make  the  people  of

Singapore  happy  and our brothers  in  the  Federation

happy." Now which is the honest statement, Mr Speaker,

I ask you? Both of them cannot be true because they are

both contradictory.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, they are not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Now having said that, then Mr Lim Ching

Siong  said in page 3 - I had better read  the  whole

sentence,  otherwise I might be accused of quoting  out

of context:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It will, in practice, not only fail to bring our

peoples   together  but  will  widen   their   existing

differences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The struggle of the people of Singapore against

exploitation and for more freedom and democratic rights

will  then run against the Federation Government.  This

will  provide a fertile field for communal  politicians

to  thrive  upon.  We  have already  warned  that  this

arrangement will bring about disastrous consequences to

national harmony.'.



<br><br>Here the argument goes one way and the argument in this

House  has gone another way, that if we do not  have  a

complete   merger   soon,  there   will   be   communal

differences.  It is very difficult to follow  when  one

expert  analyses  in  one way and  the  Leader  of  the

Barisan    Sosialis   analyses    in    another    way. [Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I have patiently listened to the Member

view,  it is a greater performance on my part  than  on

his part. Sometimes it is more difficult to listen than

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> More painful.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, after having analysed the situation

on  that  basis,  Mr  Lim Ching Siong  then  tried  to

provide   a   solution - quite  rightly.   One   of   the

difficulties



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



I  have  had  in  this House listening to  the  Barisan

Sosialis on this merger debate was this. They have been

condemning  everything. I had hoped for  some  solution

from  them to the problem. None was forthcoming. I have

listened  to  them patiently over these 11  days.  They

have  been condemning all the time. They say, "This  is

wrong. That is wrong. Everything is wrong." I had hoped

they  would provide some constructive suggestion  which

would   benefit  Singapore  today,  but   nothing   was

forthcoming,  except  the  suggestion  that  they  want

complete  merger today and that it be written into  the

Constitution that 640,000 citizens be given inalienable

rights - even for registered citizens. That was the  only

concrete  suggestion that came from  them.  Other  than

that, they have nothing but

"Let   us   listen  to  the  voice  of   the   people."

[Interruption] Oh Yes, I am willing to learn all this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us now consider the idea of some form of

relationship with the Federation of Malaya  as  a  step

towards eventual merger.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, you see the words  of  a  wise  man

there:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us now consider the idea of some form of

relationship with the Federation of Malaya  as  a  step

towards eventual merger.'



<br><br>Is  that not what is now before the House? With Mr Lim

Ching  Siong's permission, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am going

to  use  his words in an amendment which I am going  to

move  in this House on this debate later and I  hope  I

will  get  the  support of the Barisan Sosialis  on  my

amendment, because Mr Lim Ching Siong claims to be the

voice  and mentor of the people, and if I use the exact

phrase he has used, I am sure the Barisan Sosialis will

accept the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he goes on to describe the steps towards merger.

I  wanted  to make the point that we had arrived  at  a

political situation in Singapore where, because of  the

fears  in the Federation and in Singapore, it  was  not

possible  to have a merger. Therefore, our duty  is  to

think  of  the  next  step which  will  bring  the  two

territories together, because the longer we delay until

ideal conditions arrive, the more difficult it is going

to  become. Therefore, some step should be taken now to

bridge the gulf and Mr Lim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



Ching  Siong, as an astute analyst, realises  that.  He

says,  " We must take a step forward," and I think,  in

my   own  view,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  White  Paper

proposals are a step forward. Where the Government  has

gone  wrong, I blame the Prime Minister. He is  in  the

House  and  I  repeat  it again,  "I  blame  the  Prime

Minister."  Because he has insisted that his  proposals

are  a  merger and nothing short of a merger, confusion

has arisen in Singapore not only amongst the people but

even amongst enlightened people - people like the Barisan

Sosialis. They cannot understand it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one conception of a merger in the political

sense   is  this.  When  two  parties -  A  and  B - come

together,  A  loses its identity in B or  B  loses  its

identity in A, or the two of them get so mixed  and  so

fused that a new identity of C is created. That is what

one normally understands by a merger. If only the Prime

Minister  had  told  the people  of  Singapore  in  the

various radio talks and Press conferences that  he  has

had,   "This   is  not  a  merger.  This   is   not   a

confederation.  This  is  a constitutional  arrangement

between the Federation and ourselves. This is the  only

possible thing which can be achieved at the moment  and

which  will  help  dampen down the  fears  of  the  two

territories  and  bring  the  two  territories   closer

together," in the hope that the fears which  now  exist

in  the minds pf the peoples of the two countries would

be  dampened  down,  I think a lot of  the  acrimonious

debate - may   I  repeat  that  phrase  for   the   Prime

Minister's benefit - a lot of the acrimonious debate -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> You believe

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister knows the

Standing Orders just as well as I do. If he wishes  for

elucidation, all he has to do is to stand up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must

apologise  for  not understanding the  weariness  which

descends  upon this House because I have the  privilege

from  time  to  time of betaking myself off  from  this

Chamber. But I thought that my interjection might  help

to enliven matters. What I wanted to ask the Member for

Farrer  Park is whether he believes if we  call  it  by

some other name, so long as security is in the hands of

the  Central Government in the Federation, the  Barisan

Sosialis would willingly endorse it and be happy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the answer is a short one - 'No'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> How do you avoid the acrimonious

debate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> All I was interested in, Sir, when I said

"acrimonious  discussion", was not that I was  thinking

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis, but I was thinking  of  the

House  and  you,  Mr Speaker. Sir,If only  the  Prime

Minister  had  said all that, a lot of the  fire  would

have been taken out of the Barisan Sosialis, the matter

would   then   have  been  looked  at  in  its   proper

perspective, and we would have been able to discuss  it

without  the acrimony that there was in it. Because  it

seems  the  Prime  Minister has provided  material  for

argument  on the other side - "This is not  a  merger  .

This  is  not a merger, and therefore I will  not  have

anything  to  do with it." That is the line  they  have

been taking all this time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Answer it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That is the line they have been taking.

"If  it  is a merger, then all Singapore citizens  must

become Federal citizens. Because it is not so, this  is

not  a  merger.  Therefore, I do  not  agree  with  it.

Therefore, I move the amendment, which is the best sort

of  merger." That is the line we have had all the time,

Mr  Speaker, Sir. It is as simple as that. And we have

been listening to it for 12 days!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not believe the Barisan

Sosialis in this. Inche Boestamam has said, "There  are

three alternatives for Singapore. One is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



merger, the other is a confederation, and the third  is

for  Singapore  to  remain a Colony with  the  Internal

Security Council abolished and the British remaining in

charge of foreign affairs and defence: Might I ask  the

Barisan  Sosialis: if they are really keen on a  merger

or  a confederation with the Federation of Malaya,  how

can   they,   in   any  honesty,  suggest   the   third

proposition? They know what the fear of the  Tunku  is.

It  is  not  a  personal  fear. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,It

reflects  the feelings of the people of the Federation.

If  we  say, "We want a merger because we want  to  get

back  to our kith and kin", to whom apparently we  have

been  sold out - Mr Speaker, Sir, we are being sold

out  to  our  kith and kin in the Federation,  and  the

Barisan  Sosialis  do not like that kind  of  sell-out.

'They do not mind being sold out to somebody else.  But

if  the sell-out is to our kith and kin, they object to

it vigorously. But if it is to be a sell-out to British

interests,  they do not mind that; not a  bit.  If  the

third  proposition  is  a  genuine,  serious  political

proposition made in all honesty, bona fide, then it  is

certainly   incompatible  with  proposition   one   and

proposition two. And the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  are  not political children. They know what  they

are  doing.  They  know  the third  proposition  is  an

impossibility.  If  they mean (1) and  (2),  it  is  an

impossibility. But if they do not mean (1) and (2) ,  it

is  a definite possibility. How will the Tunku react to

an  independent Singapore without the British? How will

the  Tunku  react  to  a Singapore  with  the  Internal

Security  Council in the hands of the  local  Singapore

Government? Of course, the answer possibly  could  well

be  that the Tunku has no business to object. But I ask

them  to give the answer against the background of  our

wanting  to  get back to the Federation. This  problem,

Mr Speaker, must he viewed not with what is absolutely

right or what is absolutely wrong, it is not an ethical

problem  or a problem in politics, but it is a  problem

against  the background of our wanting to get  back  to

the  Federation. We must view this problem against that

background, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



only  then provide the answers which will bring  us

nearer  and nearer, and not say that the rights  of

man   are  being  denied,  as, according  to   the

socialist  way  of thinking, that  is  wrong,  and.

according to the Communist way of thinking, that is

right. These things do not get us anywhere. Let  us

be practical about this problem. Let us look at the

problem  not  as  Sosialist  or  Communist  or   as

belonging to this and that political party. I am  a

Singaporean, and I want to see the right thing done

by  Singapore.  And  if, as the  Member  for  Upper

Serangoon says, the Communists are going to  get  a

bad deal in the Federation then I am very sorry for

them.  The  Member is not here.  The  line  he  was

taking  was  to  ask the House what  guarantee  the

Communists will have of security in the Federation.

I would like to ask him whether he is a Communist.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not think he said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Lim Ching Siong has openly

declared  that  he  is not a Communist - not  to  the

local  papers,  I understand, but  to  the  English

Press. If Mr Lim Ching Siong has denied that he is

a  Communist, then he is not a Communist. And if he

has  stated that he is not a Communist, then I must

only  assume, Mr Speaker, Sir, that he  made  that

positive  statement because he was not a Communist,

and  he did not like being called a Communist,  and

that  he  did not like the foreign Press  to  think

that  he was a Communist. It was only on that basis

that  he made that statement. All that needless  is

"he is not a Communist."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what objection then could the Federation

Prime   Minister  have  to  Mr  Lim  Ching   Siong

participating   in  the  Tunku  politics   in   the

Federation?  He  is  not a  Communist.  He  has  no

objection to Mr David who is a socialist.  He  has

no  objection to Mr Seenivasagam who is a Rightist

So   why  worry?  He  does  not  object  to  ultra-Rightists. He does not object to an ultra-Leftists.

But he objects to the Communists. Who can say he is

wrong?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



I  object  to the Communists, Mr Speaker,  Sir,I

think  I  am  a  reasonable man. I will  object  to

anything  which  seeks  to destroy  the  democratic

system.  The essence of Communism, as I  understand

it,  is  to  destroy the democratic system  and  to

build thereafter their society. I object to that. I

do  not object to their economic creed, where  they

want  every man to be equal economically. It  is  a

very  good  creed, Mr Speaker, Sir. But when  they

come to destroying the existing social system,  the

existing   form  of  government,  and  then   build

something on it, I am against it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the point and purpose of breeding

Communism  in the Federation? Stamp it  out.  The

Tunku is right. But leave the socialists alone. The

socialists  want  to build on the existing  system.

They  use the existing forms of government to build

an  equal society. That is absolutely correct. That

is the form of government we want to fight for. But

if  it subscribes to a creed which seeks to destroy

the existing system of society, the existing system

of  government,  and the existing way  of  life  to

which we are all committed, I say, destroy it,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, and quite rightly too. I agree  with

the Tunku wholeheartedly on that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anybody who says that such persons

should be protected in the Federation and if it  is

because  of  that that we are objecting  to  merger

then let him declare himself here and now. It is  a

pity  the  Member for Upper Serangoon is not  here,

because I was going to give him a chance to explain

himself.   Because  he  definitely  gave   me   the

impression that he was worried about what is  going

to  happen  to the Communists if there  was  to  be

merger between Singapore and the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I explain, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.

face. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You can go and call him here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the argument on the

other  side  was that socialists will  be  trampled

upon  by  the  Tunku, and that Mr Lim Ching  Siong

will  be locked up. I am willing to take a bet with

the  Member  for Queenstown that the Tunku  is  not

going  to  lock up Mr Lim Ching Siong. He  is  not

going  to lock up anybody. Unless the overt act  of

destroying the State is committed, the Tunku is not

going to lock up anybody. I know that for a fact.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You know there are overt acts -





<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If the overt act is committed. Mr

Speaker, Sir, then the law must take its course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the two main points the Barisan

Sosialis have been making about merger - and  I  am

afraid  I  must  constantly refer  to  the  Barisan

Sosialis  because  they seem to  be  the  ones  who

propound them - are (1) a phoney merger: and if  by

a  phoney merger they mean a merger which does  not

mean what is generally understood by "a merger"  it

says,  then I agree with them. But if by  a  phoney

merger they intend to carry across to the people of

Singapore that this is something which you must not

touch,  this is something which will do the  people

of  Singapore more harm than good, then I  disagree

with  them.  If  that is the impression  which  the

Barisan  Sosialis  are  trying  to  give  by  their

repeated  use of the word "phoney", and  if  behind

that word "phoney" there is a political purpose and

intent, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



they  are trying to smear this arrangement  between

the   Singapore   Government  and  the   Federation

Government  to evoke disgust, then I do  not  agree

with them. But if they mean that the Government has

in  this connection used the word "merger"  in  its

wrong sense, then I am entirely with them, but  not

otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second main point they make

is  the "sell-out". "It is a sell-out." If you want

to  sell  something to somebody, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

you  must have a buyer, you must have a seller, and

you  must have a commodity. Now, who is the seller?

The  seller is the P.A.P. Government headed by  the

Hon, the Prime Minister. He sells Singapore for $90

million, I was told.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What do I do?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> This is a funny kind of sale where we

sell  to  get rid of ourselves. Now, sell to  whom,

Mr Speaker, Sir? This is where the political angle

comes in.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Kith and kin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Our kith and kin across the Causeway,

about a mile long. Who are our kith and kin in  the

Federation?  The  Malays - 54  per  cent?  Or   the

Chinese - 46 per cent? Who are our kith and  who  are

our   kin?  Both  of  them?  Right.  To  whom   are

Singapore's 70 per cent Chinese being sold? Let  us

not  talk  like this. This is a dangerous  line  of

talk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been in public life,

some  of  us under colonial days, some of us  under

semi-colonial  days, but still in  public  life.  I

have  always felt, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the first

duty  of  a public leader is not to excite communal

passions;  not  to  make  any  statement  which  is

likely,  or  remotely likely, to stir  up  communal

passions  or  communal  feelings.  Fortunately   in

Singapore  for  the last 30, 40 or  50  years,  our

leaders,  he they colonialists, or be they anything

you  like,  have steadfastly avoided  the  communal

line in all issues. They have never made statements

publicly and openly which are likely to excite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



communal passions. Communal passions are there, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  and let us not kid ourselves.  They

are  there.  If only we scratch them, we  will  see

them.  And  a  virulent form too.  And  I  tell  my

Barisan  friends  behind us not to make  statements

either  inadvertently  or  advertently  which   are

likely   to  cause  communal  trouble  and   excite

communal feelings. Therefore, let us not talk about

selling our kith and kin. Selling our kith and  kin

to whom, may I ask the Barisan Sosialis? Let us not

make  these  wild statements which  are  likely  to

excite  the people of Singapore into thinking  that

somebody  is  betraying them. Nobody  is  betraying

them,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. So let us put  things  in

their proper perspective.

the  same door to open. That is why I am with them.

They  happen to push the same door that I  want  to

open.  But  apparently  the Barisan  Sosialis  want

another door.

with  the P.A.P. or anybody who can take me through

that door.

not  because he has done anything. Sir,  I  do  not

said that it was the Prime Minister who did it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, no! It was the Barisan

have  done better than you." Perhaps he might have,

Mr Speaker. We do not know. Instead of getting  15

seats, he might have got 20. I accept that. But  on

the  broad  issues, Mr Speaker, the picture  would

have  been  the  same, whether  it  was  the  Prime

Minister or Tun Lim Yew Hock.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Whether it was even the leader of the

darker!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

Singapore, and if I should be so fortunate as to be

returned  to this House again as Member for  Farrer

Park - if he opens the door a little further,  I  can

assure  him  now that I will be there  pushing  the

door with him. That is a promise, Mr Speaker, Sir.

And I will not be pushing it because I am enamoured

of the Member for Queenstown, but because he pushes

the same door that I want to push.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Make sure that it is not a swing

door!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I will see to it that I go in first!

The  other matter on which the Barisan Sosialis are

trying to confuse the issue is this. I use the word

"confuse"  advisedly,  because,  to  my  mind,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  there is nothing political  in  the

sense  that the Member for Anson has used the word.

If we are going to be honest about this, if we want

to  get  across  to  the people of  Singapore  what

exactly the White Paper means, let us tell them the

truth.  If it offends the Prime Minister,  it  does

not matter. But let us tell them the truth. Let  us

not  tell  untruths which the White Paper does  not

contain. The Barisan Sosialis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



Members   have  said  time  and  again  that  Singapore

citizens are third-class citizens. I think for the last

ten  days  they have said that there are two  types  of

citizens. But today they come up with three classes  of

citizens.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I said that on the first day. You

did not hear it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Did I not? May be, Mr Speaker, Sir,I do

not  know. But anyway, this is the first time the point

came  into my consciousness. Up till now I thought that

the  point made was that Singapore citizens are  either

first  class  or second class. But now we  have  third-class  citizens  too.  According  to  the  Member   for

Serangoon Gardens Estate -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Leong Keng Seng is the Member for

Serangoon Gardens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Serangoon Gardens - the ex-Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education. First of  all,

Mr  Speaker, let  me congratulate  the  Minister  for

Education  for having got rid of him. If  that  is  the

sort  of advice he was giving to the Minister,  if  the

line of argument he was putting out on this is the sort

of advice he was giving to the Minister -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Which he had.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - I can well understand why the Minister

for  Education  now  finds himself in  this  difficulty

about 4:2 and 3:3.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He did not take the advice!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It appears to me, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

his  ex-Parliamentary Secretary thought that 4:2 or 3:3

added  up  to  six,  therefore  it  is  all  the  same.

'Therefore, he accordingly advised the Minister who  is

in  the English stream and whose Mathematics is not  as

good  as the Member for Serangoon Gardens'. Hence,  the

Minister  found himself in this difficulty. But  I  see

that he has now somewhat extricated himself out of  the

trouble  which  his ex-Parliamentary Secretary  brought

upon him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to come back to the question of citizenship, Mr

Speaker, Sir. What exactly do the White Paper proposals

contain?  Mr Speaker, Sir, this is rather  important,

because    passions   are   being   aroused    outside,

particularly  in  places  whether  people  gather   and

gossip, that Singapore is being sold down the drain and

its  citizens  with it, because they are all  going  to

become second-class citizens.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Now third-class citizens have been added

to  make a distinction between Singapore-born Singapore

citizens  and Singapore citizens who were not  born  in

Singapore. They are to become third-class citizens. Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I was born in the Federation.  I  am  a

Singapore  citizen.  According to the  ex-Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education, I am going  to

be  a third class citizen. Let me here and now tell him

that  I  can  well look after myself. I  know  what  my

rights  are going to be. I am not going to be a  third-class  citizen. Under no conditions, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

Not a third-class citizen. I am going to be a Singapore

citizen,  not a first-class citizen, nor a second-class

citizen,  nor  a third-class citizen. The truth  behind

the  proposals is that Singapore citizens, as they find

themselves today, will remain Singapore citizens.  They

will  exercise  all  their  rights  and  privileges  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Join the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Now, Federal citizens remain Federal

citizens. They cannot interfere in Singapore. We cannot

interfere with them. But to the Federal Parliament,

Singapore citizens will vote in Singapore, be they

Singapore horn or otherwise. This is the important

thing, Mr Speaker, Sir, because it is being put

round - I do not know by whom - in coffee-shops -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> By the Barisan Sosialis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for

willing to give way to him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They are not rumours.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> But most definitely. Mr Speaker, Sir.

I  know  this.  We  also have people  who  tell  us

things; that in the coffee-shops people are  saying

that if you are a Singapore-born Singapore citizen,

you have extra rights. But if you are born in China - it  is  all  China, Mr Speaker,  Sir:  this  non-Singapore  horn  citizen is only a  cloak - and  you

have  become  a  citizen here, you  are  absolutely

third  grade.  You are no good.  That  again  is  a

dangerous line to take. It is naturally a dangerous

line  to  take, because it is not true. A Singapore

citizen,  be  he  Singapore born, or  born  outside

Singapore and by virtue of registration has  become

a  Singapore  citizen, remains a Singapore  citizen

for  all  purposes  under this proposal.  There  is

absolutely  no  difference  between  the  Singapore

citizen who was born here and the Singapore citizen

who  has  acquired  his citizenship  by  virtue  of

registration  or  naturalisation.  But   yet,   Mr

Speaker, responsible educated Chinese have come  to

me and asked me, "Why are you doing this to us?" So

I  say, "Who is doing what to you?" They say, "This

is  what I say. This is what people tell me. I  was

born  in  China,"  he tells me, "I  was  registered

here.  I  have  been living here for  the  last  50

years.  Why  should somebody born here have  better

rights  than  I  have?" I tell him that  nobody  is

depriving  him of any of his rights. But  he  says,

"Yes,  that  is  the impression  I  have  got  from

reading  the papers." I ask, "Which papers  do  you

read?" He says. "I read the Chinese papers."

against  the  background of truth, not against  the

background of lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, I am sure the Member for Upper

Serangoon must have been one of the brighter  stars

on  the  Government side. I had  a  great  deal  of

respect for him when he was on the Government side.

Whenever  he spoke. I always listened to  him  very

carefully because I knew he was one of the brighter

stars in the P.A.P. As he has now come across here,

possibly  the star is if anything a little brighter

now,  because he has not got to shine amongst other

stars.  The brighter stars are over there, I always

listened  to  the Member for Upper  Serangoon  with

great  interest. After all, I am from  the  English

stream, and  I like to listen to people  who  have

been  swimming  in other streams in order  that  we

might   understand  each  other's  point  of  view.

Listening to his arguments, both on the motion  and

on  the  amendment -  although  the  leader  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  made the point  that  he  wanted

merger straightaway as the twelfth State, just like

Johore and any other State - (I am afraid to make  a

forceful   statement   because   the   Member   for

Queenstown might pull me up), I got the  idea  that

the  Member  for Upper Serangoon was  advocating  a

cause   which  is  not  a  merger  cause.  He   was

expressing   fears  of  the  Federation  Government

getting control of this, that and the other. And he

gave  his  arguments as to why fears  in  Singapore

were  being  aroused. Now, if the Barisan  Sosialis

really mean what they say in their amendment,  then

I  cannot  see  how the Member for Upper  Serangoon

could  have spoken in the way he did. He used  such

phrases as this, "the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



Federation's    feudalistic    and    capitalistic

Government". How could he entrust the lives of the

people   of   Singapore  to  a   feudalistic   and

capitalist Government? That was the emotional  cry

he was making in this Assembly. How then does that

tie  up with the amendment moved by the leader  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis, the Member for Queenstown?

Sir, it is interesting to note the line which  the

Member  for  Queenstown has taken, and  the  other

line  which  the  equally bright star  from  Upper

Serangoon  has taken. It becomes more  interesting

when  one  reads  Mr  Urn  Ching  Siong  in   the

Wartawan, in which he said this. Sir, I am looking

for  the passage where he said that if only he and

his  Party were convinced that a certain line  was

the  correct  line,  then he and  his  Party  were

willing to go out into the streets, into the homes

and perhaps even into coffeeshops.
