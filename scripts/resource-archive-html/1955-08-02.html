<div align="center"><b>(INTERPRETATION)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Message from the Governor)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members, I have a message from

His Excellency the Governor. It takes the form of

a letter addressed to me, and is dated the 2nd of

August, 1955. Here is the message:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the 25th July you delivered to me a

certified  copy of the Resolution passed  by  the

Legislative Assembly on that date and, in a reply

which  I  handed to you on the same afternoon,  I

explained that I would require time to study  the

implications of the Resolution before I could put

you  in  a  position to convey  a  reply  to  the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I communicated the terms of the Resolution to

Her  Majesty's Principal Secretary of  State  for

the  Colonies,  and, during his recent  visit  to

Singapore,  he  took the opportunity  to  discuss

both with the Chief Minister and with myself, the

various issues raised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussions are to be continued when the

Secretary  of State returns to Singapore  on  the

15th August, I am not yet in a position to send a

full reply. I would, however, be grateful if  you

would  convey the following observations  to  the

Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point raised in the Resolution, I

am  very  glad  to  be able to inform  Honourable

Members that the Secretary of State has asked  me

to  assure  them  of  the continuing  sympathetic

interest which Her Majesty's Government takes  in

Singapore's  problems and  of  the  sincerity  of

their policy to assist Singapore to achieve self-government within the British Commonwealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point raised, I gladly repeat my

former  affirmation of my sympathetic  desire  to

give  the  Government all possible  help  in  the

execution of its policies. In so doing I  do  not

propose to exercise my discretionary powers in  a

didactic   or  harsh  manner,  or  in   any   way

calculated   to   frustrate  the  Government   in

discharging  the responsibilities  which  it  has

accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third and fourth points in the

Resolution,  valuable  and  friendly  talks  have

taken  place between the Secretary of State,  the

Chief  Minister, and myself, and  examination  of

these important points has been carried as far as

it  could  be  at  present.  As  I  have  already

indicated,  it is proposed to resume these  talks

on  the  return  of  the Secretary  of  State  to

Singapore on the 15th of August and I hope to  be

able  to send a substantive reply to the Assembly

on the 18th August."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, is it possible to have  copies  of

this message for Members?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, that will be done.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I was wondering, Mr

Speaker, Sir, whether in these circumstances  you

would exercise your discretion in suspending the

sitting for half an hour to allow hon. Members an

opportunity to consider the message, and also  to

consider  what  action they might  wish  to  take

after deliberation with their colleagues.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, I am, of course,

faced  with  the same difficulty as I  was  faced

with  last time. This actually is not a  complete

reply  to  the Resolution. Under your Resolution,

you   will   remember  that  the   Assembly   can

immediately  take such action on motions  without

notice as the circumstances may require, that is,

provided  we  have  a  complete  reply   to   the

Resolution. But, of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



course,  if  hon.  Members wish  to  suspend  the

sitting for half an hour to discuss the matter, I

have no objection at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I the assent of all hon. Members present

that the sitting should be suspended for half  an

hour?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The sitting is then suspended for

half an hour.

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 10.37 a.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems

to  be  the  feeling of a large  number  of  hon.

Members  that  this message should  be  discussed

freely,  and, in the circumstances,  subject  to

your  guidance,  Mr Speaker, I  move  that  this

House   do  resolve  itself  into  Committee   to

consider the message so that Members will be free

to speak more than once if they be so inclined.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, my difficulty

is   that  under  Standing  Orders  there  is  no

provision  for this step to be taken,  but  I  am

allowing that motion under the fifth paragraph of

your Resolution, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Speaker do report back to this House

on  the reply he receives from His Excellency the

Governor  to  this message, and  that  thereafter

this  Assembly  do  take such action  on  motions

without notice as the circumstances may require."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I have your motion again, Mr Chief

Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am indebted to you, Mr

Speaker, Sir. My motion is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House do resolve itself into Committee

to   consider  the  message  received  from   His

Excellency the Governor this morning.

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, I feel I

should  report to hon. Members, in so  far  as  I

can, and very briefly, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



conversations  that took place on the  Resolution

of   this  House  which  was  presented  to   His

Excellency  the  Governor. Several  conversations

took   place   yesterday,  and  His   Excellency,

although   naturally  maintaining   what   I   am

convinced  is his sincere view of the correctness

of  his interpretation, went out of his way to be

of every assistance he could to me in putting the

position, not only of the interpretation but  the

views  of  this House, and I would  be  churlish,

Sir,  if  I did not recognise the genuineness  of

his  efforts for an honourable solution  and  his

desire   to   meet  the  legitimate   aspirations

indicated by this House. The Secretary of  State,

who  had just arrived after a tiring journey, was

most friendly, but there are implications, in his

view,  of  a  character,  which  require  further

clarification, consultation and consideration. In

the  circumstances, Sir, I did not feel it proper

to  press - not  that I might have been  successful

had  I  pressed - when he suggested that he  would

prefer  to  give a final decision  after  further

consideration and consultation on his return.  He

will  be  returning to Singapore on the  15th  of

August,  and  the suggested date  is  the  l8th - a

matter of 16 days hence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues involved are of a vital character,

and  I think they do merit the full consideration

that  the Secretary of State seeks to give  them.

The   delay  is  not  a  long  one,  nor  is   it

inappropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, for myself, that I am indebted to His

Excellency  for the assurances indicated  in  his

message,  and that for the time being perhaps  we

should  rest  there and proceed with  the  normal

business  of  the country. I am aware  that  many

Members  on  both sides of the House take  strong

opposite  views, but, as I have always indicated,

I am prepared to be guided by the feelings of the

House  on the matter. I am ready to proceed  with

the business of the day, Sir, if the House should

be  inclined to accede to my suggestion that that

should  be  so.  But  if - and  I  think  there  is

considerable validity in that view - they feel that

the  issues  may to some extent be  clouded,  and

that   they  must  be  now  maintained  in  their

pristine vigour, and perhaps pursued outside this

Chamber, I cannot see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>

that any damage would ensue by a postponement for 16 days of the immediate business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say this: that at its worst, it is my

intention that there should be a further  sitting

of  this House in order to enable the legislation

before  the  House  to  be  passed  and   to   be

effective. The social legislation we have  before

us  is  of  a  vital character,  and  I  have  no

intention, in so far as it lies in my  power,  to

take  action, which would prejudice its  becoming

law. I am entirely subject to the guidance of the

House in the suggestion I have made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Chairman,

it  is  my  anomalous position today to  be  more

fierce than the Hon. the Chief Minister. He is  a

terribly   sincere   man,  and   I   accept   the

explanation he has given why he wishes the  House

to  carry on with the normal business of the day.

I  feel  that  in this Assembly we are  not  just

expressing our personal view of what is right  or

wrong.  We  are the representatives through  whom

the  people  can put their somewhat  inarticulate

but,  nevertheless, very real  feelings  on  this

question  of self-government, and the  very  real

feelings  that  have  been  aroused - as   I   said

accidentally - on    this    question    of     the

interpretation  of  a section  of  the  Order  in

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, there is nothing in this reply,

which  we  have  received this morning  from  His

Excellency  the  Governor, which  has  materially

altered the position from what it was on the 26th

of  July, except that on that day we had  a  much

fiercer Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Chief Minister has said

that  he  would wish to be guided by the feelings

of  this House. We did not have the advantage  of

the  personal consultations and discussions  with

Her   Majesty's  Secretary  of  State   for   the

Colonies.  We are therefore unable to fathom  the

depths  of  Her  Majesty's Secretary  of  State's

sincerity. We, like the other people in Singapore

and Malaya, must judge him by his actions, by his

public conduct, his public declarations, and  not

his private assurances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in this message, which has

taken us further than where we were when we  last

adjourned on a matter of grave public importance.

We felt then that an issue had arisen, which must

first be resolved before we could go on with  the

day-to-day  business  of a  legislative  chamber.

There  is  nothing  in this  message,  which  can

properly influence us away from that stand. If we

go  on  with the normal business of the  day,  my

view,  and the view of my Party, is that we  have

publicly  indicated  to the people  of  Singapore

that   we,   as   their   representatives,    are

sufficiently  satisfied  with  this  message,  to

withdraw  from the very definite stand  which  we

took  at  the  last sitting. In my view,  if  all

Members  are agreed that they are satisfied  with

this  reply,  regardless of what happens  on  the

18th  of  August, then we can go on.  If  we  are

not - that, in fact, the future course  of  events

will  be  determined by what His  Excellency  has

been  pleased enough to call a substantive  reply

on  the  18th  of August, and it is a substantive

reply  that will decide the course of events - then

the  view  of  my Party is that we  should  leave

things  as they are. We should give Her Majesty's

Secretary  of  State for the Colonies  sufficient

time  to  consider  the  matter,  and  give   His

Excellency  the  Governor  sufficient   time   to

convince  the Secretary of State for the Colonies

of  the  very  real  feelings of  the  people  of

Singapore  in  this matter. Not  necessarily  the

feelings expressed in the English language  Press

which  has  been  somewhat unkind  to  the  Chief

Minister  lately, but the feelings of  those  who

are not sufficiently educated to write letters to

the  "Man  in  the  Street" or  "We  the  People"

columns  in commercial newspapers whose interests

must  necessarily be reflected in the  policy  of

their paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope, by the time Mr Lennox-Boyd and Lady

Patricia Boyd return from their sojourn in Borneo

and   other  parts  of  the  British  Empire   in

Southeast  Asia,  we  should  be  able  to   give

sufficient articulation to the inchoate desire of

a  large mass of the people to be done away  with

what  is  now  considered  a  term  of  abuse - the

colonial  system. It is my view,  therefore,  Mr

Chairman,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



that  we should leave things as they are. We make

no step forward; we make no step backward; and on

the  18th  of  this month we decide  whither  we

shall go.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  I  agree with the Chief Minister to proceed

with  the business of the House. I certainly feel

that all of us sitting in this Assembly here have

a duty to perform. There is before us some urgent

legislation  that should be carried out,  and  we

will  be  failing in our duty if we do  not  make

legislation to replace what is old and obsolete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from the Chief Minister that even

if  there  should  be a drastic  decision  to  be

taken,  we  still  would have to  have  one  more

sitting  here to push through the legislation  we

want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel that there would be no loss

whilst we carry on with the business of the House

today,  and perhaps tomorrow if it should not  be

finished,  and  then  await  a  reply  from   the

Secretary of State for the Colonies. It does  not

mean that we are compromising in any way, because

we  will take the answer and consider it  on  its

own merits.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  entirely  agree  with the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) that we should postpone

any business before us today to the next sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue involved is a very vital one, where

the  honour  of  the people of  the  Colony,  the

honour  of  the Ministry, and the honour  of  the

Members of this House are at stake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in this message, which could be

discussed  now, and we are told that  a  definite

reply   will   be  given  later.  Therefore,   by

postponing  today's business for a fortnight,  we

have  nothing  to lose, I would suggest  that  we

adjourn to the 18th of August.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Chairman. Sir,

when I read through the reply from His Excellency

the Governor to the Resolution we sent to him,  I

tried  my best to understand whether it has  gone

any way towards solving the problem that faced us

at our last sitting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As things stand at present, I should like to

support  the proposal put forward by  the  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar  that we should  adjourn  the

sitting  to  the  18th of August  when  we  shall

receive  a  reply that we asked for at  the  last

sitting of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

when  I  heard  you  delivering His  Excellency's

message to this House, I was under the impression

that it contained some matters of vital interest,

which would be considered very favourably by  the

Assembly. However, on going through the  message,

I  find  that  there are other  matters  involved

which  should be considered by the Assembly.  One

of  them  is the wording of the Resolution  which

this Assembly approved a few days ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-government and independence, as we all

know,  are vital principles, and we, the  elected

Members, who have pledged ourselves to carry  out

our  duties  and responsibilities  to  serve  the

people  cannot be satisfied with a reply of  this

nature.  To  me,  Sir, this would  appear  to  be

couched  in an absolutely civil service language,

which cannot be accepted as a reply to our demand

for self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope, Sir, in the light of my statement,

that the House will agree to adjourn this sitting

to   a   later  date,  when  we  will  have   the

opportunity of examining His Excellency's further

reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I feel

myself, like the Member for Tanjong Pagar, to  be

in an anomalous position. I am in this House as a

Nominated Member, and I cannot therefore stand up

and  claim that I have behind me the voice of the

people.  I  am  here  by the  nomination  of  the

Governor to the appointment of a Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also in an anomalous position because I am

not only British by nationality, but also British

by  birth - in fact, more British than many people,

because  the  real British are the Welsh!  It  is

worth  noting,  of course, that  the  British  in

Wales were the first subject race to be conquered

by  the English! They have not yet achieved self-government either!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my position as a Nominated Member and

as  a Britisher by race may perhaps make my voice

worth  listening to since I can reasonably  claim

to  speak with some impartiality. I would like to

refer, in a spirit of impartiality, to some words

in   this  message  at  the  end  of  the  fourth

paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the sincerity of their (Her Majesty's

Government's)  policy  to  assist  Singapore   to

achieve self-government within the British Commonwealth".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To achieve self-government within the British

Commonwealth". Now, when I spoke earlier on  this

same matter at our last sitting when we discussed

this crisis, I indicated that I thought that this

territory  would  necessarily have  to  associate

itself with one of the great world groupings, and

that  I personally and emphatically preferred  to

associate  Singapore  with  the  Commonwealth  of

Nations.  However, I feel that if we  are  to  do

that, we must do it of our own free wish, by  our

own  choice,  and not as the fruit  of  a  policy

decided  for  us elsewhere. I have throughout  my

life  felt  that  freedom  of  will,  freedom  of

choice, and freedom of action are basic to  human

dignity,  and if we take any political decisions,

we  must take them for ourselves - right or  wrong.

Freedom  has  no  meaning unless you  can  choose

fully  and  freely for yourselves, and  it  means

freedom  to make a mistake as much as to do  what

is  right. There must be nothing lacking  in  our

determination  to  stand  by  that  principle  of

freedom and to demonstrate it in every way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not feel personally that it is of very

great  significance whether we push  through  the

legislation today, or whether we delay it for  16

days.  I  was inclined at first to feel  that  we

might  as well go on with our legislation  today.

but  on further thought I see that if we do that,

it  may be taken as a sign that we are not really

going  to go ahead with our firm demand  for  the

principle  of  freedom. I therefore  support  the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar in his urging  that  we

should  suspend  public business  until  we  have

received  a  fuller reply. I would  like  to  add

this, in answer to arguments that have been.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



raised  in  the Press and elsewhere. People  have

said  that we are going too fast. We are hurrying -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Thomas, can we keep to this message, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Arising from the message, I will

continue  on  this point of the  policy  that  we

should achieve self-government within the British

Commonwealth. I refer again to the  principle  of

freedom and say that if we appear to be hastening

faster  than the policy here indicated, the  need

for  speed  on  our part is not because  we  have

delayed  in  the  past, but  it  is  because  the

predecessors  of  the  Secretary  of  State  have

delayed in the past: that no proper movement  was

given   to  this  country  towards  freedom   and

democracy until the post-war years, and that  the

policy of the past was to hope that nobody  would

ask, and then nothing would have to be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is in this country a danger of

Communist  subversion, of violence and terrorism,

of  unrest and labour difficulties, they can  all

be  traced back, in my opinion, to the  delay  in

moving  this country forward towards freedom.  It

is  impossible  for me to accept  the  view  that

further  delay  will do anything except  increase

the  danger  and  promote in  every  way  further

difficulties  and damage to the welfare  of  this

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those thoughts in my mind, I do support

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar that in this  small

matter  of delaying public business for  a  short

period,  we  are giving a clear demonstration  of

our  feelings,  and  we  should  therefore  delay

public business.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, the reply we received this morning from  His

Excellency the Governor is more or less the  same

as the one we received on the 26th of July, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full support of all the points raised by

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew),

the  Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy), and

the  Hon. the  Minister for  Communications  and

Works (Mr Francis Thomas).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the fact that we have not received

any  substantive reply, I suggest that we suspend

this sitting until we receive one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, may I just

clarify one point for the Chief Minister?  If  it

should be necessary on the 18th of this month  to

take any step, which, in his view, would mean the

dissolution  of  his Government, he  should  feel

confident of this: that this House will be prepared to sit with  him

right  through  all  the  stages  of  the  social

legislation which he has tabled, and when it  has

been  pushed  through  in a  proper  and  orderly

manner, then we can go and face the country. That

is  an  assurance which I thought was so  obvious

that I had not given it before But if he feels in

the  least bit unhappy at the prospect of leaving

his   legislation,  which  is  almost   finished,

unfinished, then I think he should remember  that

no  one  would  quarrel with going on  with  this

Assembly  until  all  the  legislation  has  been

pushed through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say - and I realise I am saying

this publicly - that I share his confidence that  a

reasonable  solution will be worked  out.  But  I

cannot share his confidence to such an extent  as

to  abandon  my  stand and  to  go  on  with  the

business  of  the day. To do so would,  I  think,

suggest that we had acted rashly and foolishly on

the  26th  of July. For myself I do not think  we

did. We weighed the odds before we decided to  do

what  we did. I believe we were right then,  that

there  was no other step for us to take  than  to

stand  firm until we had resolved this  issue  on

which  the  Chief Minister had clashed  with  His

Excellency  the  Governor. If we had  that  issue

resolved  today,  then we would be  justified  in

altering  our  stand.  But  there  has  been   no

alteration whatsoever in the overall position. So

if  there  is any other reason which  deters  the

Chief Minister from adopting the view that I have

expressed,  perhaps he would be  good  enough  to

enlighten us.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, I am indeed

indebted  to my learned Friend across  the  floor

for the generous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



assurance  received. I would add, in fairness  to

him and his friends on the opposite Benches, that

I  did not fear their lack of co-operation should

that  unhappy  eventuality arise,  and  that,  in

fact,  I  anticipated  that  should  we  have  to

dissolve  this  House I would have  hon.  Members

opposite entirely with me in finishing the social

legislation that is now ready for completion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, Sir, that perhaps we have not given fair

and  sufficient consideration to His Excellency's

message.  It  is  not true that it  takes  us  no

forrader. It is a courteous interim message  that

has   a   substantive  personal  assurance,   and

although  it does not take us forward as  regards

the  main  issue,  I felt, Sir, that  there  were

reasons  why we should proceed with the  business

today.  The  main reason is that the Land  Titles

Bill,  for example, is one of a complex character

which  I should have liked to see referred  to  a

Select  Committee  in order  to  enable  the  Bar

Committee,  which is particularly  affected,  and

other  interests  to make proper representations,

before  it  is  taken for its Third,  and  final,

Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the question of the Land

Acquisition (Temporary Provisions) Bill, which  I

hope   this  House  would  pass.  I  would  like,

however, before I cease being Chief Minister,  to

see  it take effect as law. Hon. Members opposite

will remember that all the process of legislation

is  not in our hands, and that His Excellency the

Governor has that final power of signing  or  not

signing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That will be the death warrant

of the Rendel Constitution!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is important for this

House,  before  it dissolves, I feel,  that  that

aspect  of  legislation which  has  held  up  the

development  of the country for some time  should

be  known  to have not only been passed,  but  to

have  become law in this territory. I  would  not

like  to  say,  and  I would be  very  unfair  in

saying,  that my successors would not  face  that

obligation honestly, but we have evidence in  the

past  of certain politicians shirking the  issue; and  it is a Bill that I would like to see become

law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the reasons why, Sir, I felt we might

go on with the business today, and I felt that we

should  also  acknowledge the  very  considerable

assistance  we have received from His  Excellency

recently, and that the conflict is  not  one  of

personalities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add, to my learned Friend opposite and

to  hon.  Members  that it  would  be  unwise  to

indulge    in    over-confidence.    There    are

interests - let   us   face  it  frankly - commercial

interests  which see in the present situation  an

opportunity  for  Her Majesty's  Government  to

dismiss  this  House, which seems  to  have  been

difficult   and   to   have  worried   commercial

interests in this territory, and to do  it  in  a

dignified fashion, putting the blame on  us,  and

thereafter to suspend the constitution. There are

interests,  both  here  and  in  the  Lobbies  of

Westminster - and   I  think   hon.   Members   are

conscious of the strength and power of the rubber

and  tin  Lobbies in Westminster - who are  working

against  a  sympathetic  understanding   of   the

aspirations of the people of this territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let us not be over-confident about getting a

solution.  I  am not unhopeful, as being  one  of

those  primarily concerned in the  conversations,

but I would not go further than that. I feel that

we  should  go on, Sir, and try to  get  as  much

legislation through as we can, but I  repeat:  if

the  House  feels  that we  would  be  losing  in

dignity or losing in strength in the position  we

hold,  I  am quite willing to go with the  House.

There is no question of the Whip being used on my

side, and I am grateful for the suggestion, which

will  be  adopted in the event of our  having  to

take a drastic decision, that the House will  sit

continuously  to  see  all  legislation   through

before dissolution.

Sir,  I  strongly  support the  Chief  Minister's

stand  that we should carry on with the  business

of   the   day,  particularly  with  a  view   to

committing to Select Committees, some of the very

long and difficult Bills which we have before  us

like the Land Titles Bill. I was going to suggest

also   that   the  Land  Acquisition   (Temporary

Provisions) Bill should be referred to  a  Select

Committee,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



and the Labour Bill, which has been committed  to

a  Select  Committee, I observe,  is  now,  on  a

motion, to be referred back to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can refer at least some of these Bills to

Select Committees, we shall not be wasting  time.

We  still will have some work done. Sir, on those

lines  I  suggest that we should go on  with  the

day's business.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, since no elected Minister

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly support the suggestion put forward by

the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar. It is rather  odd

for  me,  sitting on this side of the  House,  to

support  a  Member on the opposite Bench,  but  I

business on these two Bills - the Land Titles  Bill

and  the  Land Acquisition (Temporary Provisions)

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government or the Chief Minister can

always  get  an opinion on the Land  Titles  Bill

from  the Bar Committee. We have got 16  days  in

which to obtain an opinion from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister has said that there

is  some legislation which he thinks should  come

that  as an elected representative of the people,

what is of more interest to this House is not the

passing  of this legislation, which can wait  for

another  16 days, but a definite reply  from  the

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before somebody moves the

adjournment, I have a communication to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On The 25th of July in this Assembly, I was

asked  by the Hon. the Chief Minister to consider

whether a report, which appeared in The Singapore

Free Press of Friday, 22nd July, was a breach  of

the liberties and privileges of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report was headlined "Royal message

attacked"  and  "MARSHALL: I FELL  FOR  IT",  and

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Chief Minister, Mr David Marshall, in the

special Legislative Assembly meeting this morning

said  that  his faith in the workability  of  the

Rendel  Constitution  was  strengthened  by   the

messages  of the Queen and the previous Governor,

Sir John Nicoll.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Referring to the sentiments of the Queen about

the  constitutional progress  of  Singapore,  Mr

Marshall said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was full of promise. I fell for it - hook,

line and sinker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believed every word of it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Then after a reference to Sir John Nicoll's

message,  he added: "Now the claws of  the  beast

show through the velvet glove."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will remember that a Bill the short

title  of  which  is  "The  Legislative  Assembly

(Powers  and  Privileges) Ordinance,  1955"  went

through  all its stages in this Assembly  and  is

now  awaiting the signification of Her  Majesty's

pleasure  in accordance with section  62  of  the

Singapore Colony Order-in-Council, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain powers and privileges of this Assembly

are  defined in that Bill, and clause 24 (1)  (c)

makes  it  an offence for any person  to  publish

"any  writing  containing  a  gross,  wilful   or

scandalous misrepresentation of the speech of any

member in the proceedings of the Assembly".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, it was perhaps unfortunate that the

writer  of the article should have seized upon  a

reference to the Royal Message and made headlines

of  it without regard to the context of the whole

speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister appears to have assumed, as

he  was  indeed  entitled  to  assume,  that  the

sentiments  of  Her Majesty the  Queen  were,  in

fact, the sentiments of Her Majesty's Government.

To quote the words of Sir Thomas Erskine May:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Queen cannot be supposed to have a private

opinion   apart  from  that  of  Her  responsible

advisers."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister's "attack" (to adopt the word

used  in  the report), as was apparent  from  his

whole speech, seems to me, in fact, to have  been

an  "attack" on Her Majesty's Government and  the

interpretation put on the Rendel Constitution  by

Her Majesty's Representative in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This regrettably does not end the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writer, in the first paragraph of his

article, has put words in the mouth of the  Chief

Minister,  which  I cannot find in  the  Official

Report  of  the Chief Minister's speech  made  in

this Chamber. In addition, the words in the final

paragraph of the article were so taken out of the

context  of  the speech that a reader might  well

consider  that they referred to what is described

in  the  article as "the sentiments of the  Queen

about the constitutional progress of Singapore".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these additions, the impression must have

been  created  in the minds of some  readers,  as

pointed out by the Chief Minister, that the Chief

Minister was guilty of casting some reflection on

Her   Majesty.  This  particularly  is  extremely

unfortunate. I was and am entirely satisfied that

no  disrespect  was  shown or intended,  and  the

Chief   Minister  has  himself  stated  that   he

personally  resents very strongly the  suggestion

that  he should be capable of discourtesy to  Her

Majesty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inclusion of the words in the final

paragraph  of the article out of the  context  of

the   Chief   Minister's   speech   resulted   in

misrepresentation, which is to be deplored.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whether such misrepresentation was "gross,

wilful or scandalous" is something, which, on the

face of the article, is not easily apparent,  and

if  the Powers and Privileges Bill had been  law,

the appropriate action would have been for me  to

refer the matter to a Committee of Privileges for

further inquiry.

make a short statement on what you have just read

out to the House?

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

indeed obliged and very grateful to be vindicated

from  any  charge of discourtesy to Her  Majesty,

and  I feel certain that this House is happy that

a  charge  of that character levelled  against  a

Member should have been so clearly proved  to  be

inaccurate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, representations have been made

to  me  on  behalf  of  the  reporter  concerned,

suggesting  that what appears in a  newspaper  is

not always the fault of the reporter, because the

manner in which his "copy" is treated is entirely

out  of  his hands, and he is no more responsible

for  what appears in it than the photographer  is

responsible  who sends in a dozen photographs  of

me  with  my  hand open in salute and finds  that

just   the   one   where  I   had   it   clenched

unconsciously as I stood up is picked for  front-page treatment!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say, Mr Speaker, that I have

the   highest  regard  for  a  very  hard-working

profession, and journalists work in usually  very

difficult circumstances, and in the light of  the

representations  made, I am  satisfied  that,  as

regards this particular reporter, there was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



no  malice intended; nor, as far as I can gather,

was  there  any effort on his part to distort.  I

should  also  like  to  say  that  there  was  no

personal  reflection on the reporter intended  by

me in my complaint.
