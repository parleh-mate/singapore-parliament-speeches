<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head LA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1004*.

(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Cheong  Yuen Chee and Ong Teng Cheong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the Ministry of National Development

announced  that 45 acres of land at Bah  Soon  Pah

Road would be used for commercial pig farming, and

that  the land would be subdivided into eight lots

of about five acres each for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



development by public application. This is  a  new

project  for pig farming in Singapore  as  we  are

encouraging the development of pig farming into  a

commercial  enterprise. I have  gone  through  the

terms  and  conditions attached to the application

form.  It  is  clearly stated that  the  applicant

should  put  up  the building and  all  facilities

including  multi-storey piggeries  on  the  5-acre

land  and  maintain a production of 1,000  porkers

per  acre per annum. Therefore, this project  must

involve  at least a capital of $« million or  even

more. As such a big capital is required. I am sure

that  even  if pig farmers in Singapore  have  the

desire    and   the   practical   experience    of

participating  in  this project,  they  have  very

little  chance  of  doing  so  because  they   are

individual smallholders without big capital. I  am

very  disappointed over the fact that the Minister

does  not  take  into  consideration  the  present

condition of pig farmers in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



Singapore, whereby provision could be made to give

them  a  chance  to participate in  this  project.

Therefore,  I  sincerely  urge  the  Minister   to

consider if the Government can set aside a portion

of  this land for the small pig farmers? Moreover,

I  propose that Government be responsible for  the

building  of  multi-storey piggeries and  all  the

other  necessary facilities, including  pig  pens.

This  piggery can then be subdivided into  smaller

units  which  will be suitable for the  small  pig

farmers. Such pig farming units can be rented  out

to   the  pig  farmers  or  sold  to  them  on  an

instalment basis. This will enable the pig farmers

to  benefit from the project, and at the same time

help  them to develop their pig rearing in  a  far

better environment. Sir, if this can be done 1  am

sure the farmers will deeply appreciate it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the

announcement  in increases in prices  for  Housing

Board  fiats made by the Minister on 30th November

last   year  came  as  a  stunning  blow  to  many

prospective   flat   owners.  With   the   current

inflation, the increase in prices is an additional

burden to the ordinary wage earners. Sir, you will

appreciate  that before one decides to  apply  for

the purchase of a Housing Board flat, he will have

to ascertain whether the price of the flat and the

instalment  payments  allowed  fit  in  with   his

financial resources. He will then decide on either

a  three-, four- or five-room flat and the  period

of  repayment,  whether it is in  10,  15,  or  20

years. Many applicants who have applied for  flats

two  or  three years ago have based their decision

on  these  assumptions. But the increase  of  more

than   50  per  cent  in  prices  will  entail   a

corresponding  increase in the monthly  instalment

payment.  Such  a  move by the Housing  Board  has

indeed  caused  a  major upset  in  the  financial

circumstances of these prospective flat owners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not in disagreement with the reasons

given  by  the  Minister but I am questioning  the

manner  in  which  this considerable  increase  in

prices  is  being  imposed. In his  statement  the

Minister stated that the cost of providing public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



housing  has risen considerably. These  are  facts

that  cannot  be  disputed.  But  why  cannot  the

increase  in  prices be spread over a  period  of,

say, eight years, thereby gradually increasing the

burden rather than a sudden blow. By doing so, the

price  of a three-room flat will only be increased

at  the  rate of $500 each year. Moreover, such  a

scheme will apply to a lesser number of applicants

at  any one time. It will be gradual. Probably the

Minister   feared   that  the   private   property

developers  will take advantage of  this  and  use

this  as an excuse for raising the prices of their

properties.  Sir,  prices  of  properties  in  the

private  sector have been increasing by leaps  and

bounds over the last eight years, which is several

hundred per cent more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to touch on another problem

faced by applicants for Housing Board flats.  Many

applicants have been waiting for their  flats  for

as  long as three years. Since the Board is unable

to  meet  the needs of these applicants many  have

resorted  to  unauthorised occupation  of  Housing

Board  flats  rented  from  the  flat  owners   or

tenants. Unfortunately, the Housing Board  took  a

dim view of these happenings, and eviction notices

were served on the owners or tenants. Notices read

like this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You are hereby requested to evict so-and-so and

resume  proper  occupation of your  flat,  failing

which  legal action will be served to recover  the

said property.'



<br><br>Sir,  where can these people go to for alternative

accommodation,  if  the Housing  Board  itself  is

unable    to   provide   them   with   alternative

accommodation because of the length of time in the

construction of flats. They are all ordinary  wage

earners and they are in no position to find  cheap

alternative  accommodation in the  private  sector

unless  they  want to live in shacks  in  squatter

areas.  I am not encouraging or condoning breaches

of Housing Board regulations, but in situations of

this  nature sympathetic consideration  should  be

given  in  order to alleviate the plight of  these

applicants  for  Housing  Board  flats.   May   I,

therefore, suggest that unauthorised occupiers  of

Housing Board flats, who have registered for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



purchase  or  rental of Housing  Board  flats,  be

permitted on compassionate grounds to stay in such

flats until they have been allocated flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Sir, you may

recall the announcement that was made in September

last   year  regarding  the  restriction  on   the

purchase   of   residential  properties   in   the

Republic.  It stated that non-citizens,  permanent

residents, and companies incorporated in Singapore

or   abroad  must  obtain  permission   from   the

Government   to  buy  houses.  This  announcement,

though  rather belatedly, was welcomed  as  it  is

intended   to   curb  speculation  in  residential

properties  with  a view to assisting  our  middle

income group of citizens, who are not eligible  at

the  present moment to purchase HDB flats, to  own

private houses as part of the Government's overall

home ownership policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the announcement in last September,

there was a complete silence on the subject.  Some

of  the  permanent residents and non-citizens  who

wish  to  buy houses genuinely for their own  use,

hoping to make their home in the Republic, are  at

a  loss  as to where their applications should  be

submitted,  or  how  to  go  about  obtaining  the

necessary permission. Some of them have  tried,  I

believe, and they have been going around from  one

department  to another. Some of them  are  in  our

civil  service  and industry and  other  services.

Many  of them are making a useful contribution  to

the progress and prosperity of this country. There

is  no  doubt  that  we wish them  well  and  look

forward  to  their  continued  contributions   and

service.  Therefore,  I will  be  pleased  if  the

Minister could kindly inform the House as to  when

will  he  introduce legislation relating  to  this

announcement   last  September  to  regulate   the

purchase  of local residential property. And  will

the  Minister  also indicate the reasons  for  the

delay  in enacting this piece of legislation,  and

whether the delay is a deliberate measure?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am still on the subject of home

ownership, I wonder if the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



Minister  could elaborate on a recent announcement

that  the  Government will be building houses  for

our  middle-class citizens. Would  he  inform  the

House  as  to  who  will be  responsible  for  the

project?  Where  and when will  this  middle-class

housing estate be constructed? How many units will

be  built annually? What will be the terms of sale

and  whether  there  will  be  any  income  limits

imposed on the purchase of these houses? I am sure

that  not only members of the middle-income public

are  thrilled by the announcement, but  also  some

Members of this House are just as anxious to  hear

more about this scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Sir, I rise in support

of  my  colleague, the Member for  Bukit  Panjang.

Sir,  though  we  cannot deny the commendable  job

done  by  the  Primary  Production  Department  on

agriculture  over the decade, we must  admit  that

sometimes  it does make silly decisions.  Although

we  are not discussing the merits and demerits  of

the  Department  at this juncture,  I  cannot  but

point Out to the Minister one or two mistakes made

by  the  Department recently. One  mistake,  which

appeared  somewhat shameful on  the  part  of  the

Government,  was  that sometime  ago  the  Primary

Production   Department  ordered   the   feedstuff

merchants  to  decrease the  price  of  feedstuff.

However, later the merchants not only ignored  the

order but also jacked up the price further. Surely

the  Department could have studied the supply  and

demand  of feedstuff before placing an order,  and

then the order could be made firm and effective.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another mistake was the decision to lease out the

plot of land, as mentioned by the Member for Bukit

Panjang, only to big-time farmers for the  purpose

of  pig rearing. This is another evidence that the

Primary Production Department is in favour of big-time  farmers only. Ordinary farmers,  I  believe,

are  frightened  by the rules and  regulations  in

respect  of this proposed pig farm. In  the  first

instance,  I think it is basically wrong  to  look

after  the big-time farmers only, for this  is  in

violation of the fundamental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



principles of democratic socialism which our Party

advocates.  It is the small-time farmers  that  we

should look after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that land is scarce in

Singapore and we have to make use of air space  to

develop  agriculture. Surely  the  Government  can

build   standard   multi-storey   pigsties    with

infrastructure provided and let them  out  to  our

small-time farmers to enable them to make a living

out  of pig rearing. I think this is more workable

and  beneficial  to  our farming  community  as  a

whole.   I  will,  therefore,  urge  the  Minister

concerned  to give serious consideration  to  this

proposal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to touch on a very small point on  the

Government's  policy  on  land  acquisition.   The

Government policy has caused dissatisfaction among

those property owners who have been affected by it

because  they felt that the compensation  was  not

only  inadequate but also unfair as the  offer  of

compensation  was made to them nearly  four  years

after they were informed of the acquisition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has started

acquiring   houses  for  urban   renewal   in   my

constituency since 1969, and the owners were asked

to   submit   claims  for  compensation   to   the

Commissioner  of  Lands. In  compliance  with  the

notice, all affected house owners submitted claims

for  compensation through their certified  valuers

in  1970.  But after that, nothing was heard  from

the  Commissioner of Lands. However, in 1974, four

years   after   the  submission  of  claims,   the

Commissioner of Lands has just made up his mind to

announce  his offer of compensation to the  people

concerned. Sir, you will agree with me that  there

is a world of difference in land prices as well as

the  purchasing  power of money between  1970  and

1974.  There  is no need for me to  illustrate  or

elaborate on this. They felt that the Commissioner

had  taken unfair advantage by delaying the matter

for four



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



years,  as  the claims for compensation  had  been

forwarded to the Commissioner since 1970. Why  was

it  necessary  to  take  four  years  to  pay  the

compensation? Besides this unnecessary delay,  the

compensation offered by the Commissioner of  Lands

was only half of what they claimed four years ago.

No  doubt, there is provision for appeal  if  they

feel that the compensation is inadequate. But  let

us  be frank about it. How many people would  like

to  go to court and appeal against the Government?

Going  to  court and fighting a case  against  the

Government is one thing, there is also  the  legal

expenses,  the  time  spent  in  court,  and   the

inconvenience caused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  ask  the  Minister: is four  years  the  usual

length  of  time  that the Commissioner  of  Lands

needs  to determine the offer of compensation  for

acquisition of houses?

Government  policy to urgently  meet  the  housing

needs  of  the  lower income group.  The  fact  of

owning  a  home or staying in one at a  reasonable

rent  is  satisfaction  of a  basic  physical  and

social need of the people and the achievement of a

sense  of  security. This is a basic need  of  the

middle income group as much as it is a basic  need

of  the lower income group. Where this need  could

be  satisfied by their own efforts a few years ago

(that  is, the people in the middle income group),

the  dramatic rise in the value of houses  in  the

private   sector  has  removed  hopes   of   their

realising this need.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prevailing restriction, Sir, on the sale of

private  property to non-citizens was enforced  in

September  last year to lower the  steep  rise  in

property  values,  so that home ownership  may  be

spread  among the different categories of  workers

in   our  society.  The  restriction  has  had   a

dampening  effect  and property values  have  been

said  to  fall by 15 to 25 per cent of  values  in

August  last year. However, prospect of a  further

significant  decline in property values  does  not

appear  to  be real in view of the steep  rise  in

prices  and costs of building materials,  services

and  labour.  The  present  property  values  seem

already  grounded upon real cost of materials  and

construction  and appear unlikely to fall  further

significantly.  This notwithstanding,  the  middle

income group generally cannot afford the prices of

houses  in  the  private sector  today,  as  these

prices remain beyond their financial resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation makes it important for the

Government  to start programming for ownership  of

HDB  homes by the middle income group. The  middle

income      group     comprises     professionals,

administrators, and executives both in the  public

and  private sectors upon whom, as the  Government

has  admitted last year, the security and progress

of  Singapore  depends. The  middle  income  group

would be assisted in some measure towards buying a

home from the private sector if a portion of their

savings  in  the Central Provident Fund  could  be

used  by  them  for  this purpose.  However,  this

suggestion  was  turned down by  the  Minister  of

State  for Labour a few days ago in the debate  on

the Estimates for his Ministry. As long as all our

workers  can  find in the meaning of hard  work  a

practical  realisation of their basic  aspirations

relating  to true necessities and sound  luxuries,

our  nation will continue, I think, to survive and

prosper  by  the loyalty, skill and dedication  of

the middle income group workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will be able to state a

favourable answer to me on this issue as  much  as

to the hon. Member opposite and which answer, I am

sure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



and  agree  with  him,  is very  much  awaited  by

members of the middle income group.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I agree with the Members for  Bukit

Panjang and Jurong when they said that the Primary

Production Department should build small pig farms

for  letting out to small scale farmers so  as  to

enable  them to carry out pig farming.  There  are

reasons for such a move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this will help small farmers to

alleviate their economic difficulties. At present,

pig  farmers  in  the  rural areas,  for  example,

Sembawang and Jurong, Bukit Panjang, and Nee Soon,

are faced with the same difficulties. In order  to

comply with the regulations of the Ministry of the

Environment,  in  other  words  they  should   not

pollute the water resources, they must construct a

drain round the pig farms to ensure that there  is

proper drainage of the filthy water. But it  costs

a  few  thousand dollars to build  such  a  sewage

system.  This  is quite beyond the  means  of  the

small farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the building of pig farms will increase

pig  production. We know that because of the  high

cost  of animal feed, small farmers were not  able

to  carry on with pig farming, and hence there was

a  shortage in the supply of pigs. The result  was

that  pig prices went up by 300 per cent from  $50

to  $220 per picul. This will increase the  burden

on   the   consumers.  So  long  as  the   Primary

Production Department could let out the pig  farms

at  low  rentals  to the small  farmers,  and  buy

animal  feed  in bulk and sell it to  the  farmers

there  will  be  a reduction in prices  of  animal

feed.  Thus,  there will be a balance between  the

supply and demand of pigs to bring down prices  of

pork.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to prevent pollution in the farming

areas  where  there  are  modern  pig  farms   and

facilities,  the  pig  farmers  can   be   grouped

together in a collective farm so that the  problem

of pollution will not arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Member for Jurong said that in

drafting  such  a project, the Primary  Production

Department seems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



to  look  after the interests of the  big  farmers

because they are able to put in $1 million  or  $2

million  capital, but for the small  farmers  even

$10,000  is quite beyond their means. Sir, letting

out  such pig farms to the small farmers will  get

rid  of  the monopoly of the big farmers  so  that

more  and  more pig farmers can take part  in  pig

farming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Minister could accept

such   suggestions,  namely,  that   the   Primary

Production  Department builds pig farms  and  then

sell  or  rent them out to farmers, I believe  the

small farmers in the rural areas will be grateful.

to the Hon. Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



who  has  helped me solve a number of very  knotty

problems  connected  with the resettlement  in  my

constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to $506 million to be given as a

loan  to  the Housing and Development Board  under

subhead   AA   3008   and  the  appropriation   of

$10,552,000  to the Resettlement Department  under

subhead AA 3006, $30 million is to be given  as  a

contribution under subhead AA 2730 to the  Housing

and Development Board for the financial year 1974.

This  totals up to $546,552,000. Sir,  I  am  sure

that  doubling this appropriation would  not  even

save  the  Housing and Development Board from  the

difficulty  that  it  is facing  in  building  the

required  number of housing units for  our  needs.

Although  the  Housing and Development  Board  has

been   accorded   world-wide   acclaim   for   its

achievements, it has not been able to satisfy  our

needs,  the  local  needs. I  believe  it  is  not

because  we  do not have the means to  build  more

flats than at present but because the planning and

programming of our housing requirements have  gone

haywire.  Perhaps, the Minister being  an  amiable

man  has allowed himself to give in too easily  to

pressures  by  other Ministries and the  statutory

boards.   As   it  is,  the  people  affected   by

resettlement, although eligible for priority, have

to   wait   for  years  before  they  are  offered

alternative   accommodation.   There   are   other

categories  of persons who are also  eligible  for

priority accommodation. The latest addition to the

priority list is ex-national servicemen. If we  go

on adding to this list of priority cases, then the

day  will come when normal applicants for  Housing

Board flats may have to wait a decade before  they

are allocated flats.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  if the Minister is not careful, one of these

days,  the  Minister for Health, who is  not  here

now,  is going to ask for priority for people  who

undergo voluntary sterilization. As it is, we have

now two queues - one for persons with priority and

the other for persons without any priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain what I mean by bad planning and

inadequate programming. I can best illustrate this

by  quoting examples from my own constituency.  By

the  end  of 1971, part of Pulau Brani was  to  be

used by MINDEF and the other part was appropriated

for PSA. A survey was made and residents were told

that  they  had to move out, but no Housing  Board

flats  were  set  aside nor  planned  for  orderly

resettlement. They had been asked to register  for

areas  of their choice. Many of them wanted  flats

in  Telok Blangah, but upon registration when they

requested  that they be registered  for  flats  in

Telok Blangah, they were told that they would have

to   register   for  Henderson  area   which   had

apparently been set aside for them. However,  when

the  Henderson flats were balloted, only a handful

of  them were allotted flats there. Again, in 1972

a  few  households were allocated flats  far  away

from Telok Blangah, resulting in undue hardship to

the persons affected. It took almost two years  to

resettle  about  half  the households  from  Pulau

Brani.  Meanwhile, the school on  the  island  was

closed,  quite rightly, as the student  population

had  decreased  and the remaining islanders  found

themselves practically marooned on the  island  as

the  sampan-ferrying  facilities  were  disrupted.

Sir,  to-date almost 2« years after being informed

that  they  would be resettled, a large number  of

households  are  still on the island  without  any

basic  communal or social service such as schools.

Moreover, the houses on the island, which are  not

brick  and mortar houses but built on stilts  with

planks and attap or zinc roofing, are in a serious

state of disrepair. They need constant repair  and

maintenance. Once indication was given  that  they

would be resettled soon, neither the chief tenants

nor the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



house-owners  were  prepared to  incur  additional

expenses on repairs. Partially abandoned huts also

pose many health and fire hazards. This is what  I

mean  by improper planning and programming  before

urban renewal is undertaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, resettlement is not a pleasant business

though  it  is sometimes necessary. Let  me  liken

resettlement  to  surgery for  the  removal  of  a

cancerous growth with which you are very familiar.

Sir,  when  a surgeon needs to perform a  surgical

operation, he will have all his instruments ready,

the theatre prepared, a ready bed in the ward, and

assurance  of  an adequate supply  of  blood  made

available,  before  even  deciding  to  wheel  the

patient  into the theatre. And during surgery,  he

will use a sharp scalpel and make a firm deft one-stroke incision. He does not go about it using  an

old  razor  blade, nor after having  gone  halfway

through the operation look for a hospital  bed  or

look for a supply of blood when the patient begins

to bleed. This is what the Housing and Development

Board is doing today.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> After such a gory description of

resettlement, perhaps the Minister would  like  to

reply!



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, may I first deal with the question of commercial pig farming which has been

referred to by three Members of Parliament? First,

the  Member  for  Bukit  Panjang  has  given  some

details  about  the proposals,  which  were  quite

right. There are eight 5-acre lots of land located

off  Bah Soon Pah Road which were recently offered

for   commercial  pig  farming.  Members  may   be

interested to know that of the lots offered  there

have  been  seven tenders, some wanting more  than

one  lot. The whole object of this exercise, which

is  a  pilot scheme, is to increase the supply  of

pigs  for  the market. The Members have  suggested

that  the  Government should  build  these  multi-storey structures and rent them out to the smaller

farmers. The Member for Sembawang went further  to

say  that the Primary Production Department should

buy the feed in bulk and sell them to the farmers.

Next, he will suggest that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



Primary Production Department should rear the pigs

for them! I think all these three Members know, if

they are active in their constituencies, that  the

work  done  by  the Primary Production  Department

over  the years has been to help small farmers.  I

do  not  propose  to go into the details.  But  to

allege  that we are only helping the rich  farmers

and that it is not in accordance with the policies

of  our  own  Party, is not fair. They  have  also

grumbled  about  the silly mistakes  made  by  the

Primary Production Department, one of which was to

let  out  these lots of land. Only time will  tell

whether  this  is  a silly mistake.  Assuming  the

project  is  successful, we  may  then  go  on  to

smaller projects. But for the moment, in order  to

be  successful we think that the project ought  to

be a substantial one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also surprised that the Primary Production

Department  is  blamed for evicting small  farmers

from  the catchment areas. The Members should have

taken  this  point  up when the  Ministry  of  the

Environment was being discussed in this House.  It

is  the  Ministry of the Environment  that  is  in

charge   of  pollution,  and  it  is  the   Public

Utilities Board that is building the reservoir  in

Kranji.  The question is whether they want  enough

fresh water or enough pigs. So where the pig farms

pollute  some  of the streams, we move  them  away

from the streams. Hence, this pig farming project.

But  they  have got to decide what they want.  And

sometimes the Government decides this for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh grumbled about the

increases  in  prices of Housing  Board  flats.  I

would  not  go into the details as to the  reasons

why the prices have gone up. He just wants to know

why  we did not spread this over a period of eight

years  so that the blow would not be so heavy.  It

is not easy to spread it over eight years. Because

I  do  not  know what will happen in  eight  years

time!  Perhaps the prices will have to go up again

at  the  end of this year or next; I do not  know,

but I hope not. But to plan for so long and spread

it over eight years is not a practical solution to

the problem of rising prices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then said that because of the shortage

of  flats, unauthorised subletting should  not  be

interfered  with.  The Member will  remember  that

sometime last year or early this year, the Housing

and  Development Board announced that  sublettings

would  be  allowed.  A three-room  flat  could  be

sublet,  so  could a four-room or  five-room  flat

provided  there are not many occupants already  in

the  flat. I would suggest to the Member  that  he

advises  his  constituents who have  sublet  their

flats to regularise the position because it is  no

longer illegal to sublet Housing Board flats.  And

they  can go further; they can even sublet Housing

Board flats to non-citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Keat wanted to know when

legislation  will  be  ready  in  respect  of  the

Government  statement  made last  September  about

foreigners owning land, and whether the  delay  is

deliberate. I can assure him that it is not.  What

is  the  point  of delaying this legislation?  The

Government gets no benefit from this.  It  is  not

simple  legislation and we have had several drafts

drawn up by the Attorney-General. The Member  will

be  happy to know that a final draft is now before

Government, and the Bill will be introduced at our

next  meeting  of  Parliament,  after  the  Budget

session.  Meanwhile, the Registrar of  Titles  has

received  quite a few applications from foreigners

to  purchase  land. These applications  are  being

processed by a committee and replies will be given

soon.  Anyone who does not know whom to apply  to,

should apply to the Registrar of Titles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah grumbled about land

acquisition. He made some good points. One  is  on

delays  in  issuing awards. There have  been  some

delays  of  up  to four years, which  I  agree  is

unfair. But I had on several occasions in the year

before  last  directed those in  charge  to  issue

their awards as soon as possible and at the latest

within  a  period  of six months.  But  there  are

difficulties in cases where a large piece of  land

has  been  acquired  and there  are  thousands  of

people on the land,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



and  in  cases where there are several  owners.  A

survey  of  those present on the land  takes  some

time. But the Member can rest assured that I  have

already directed and the Land Collectors are doing

their best to expedite the issue of awards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also talks of appeals, saying that

appeals  are no good because they cost  money  and

who  wants to appeal against the Government. Well,

some  people do. Is the Member suggesting  that  I

amend  the  Land Acquisition Act  to  get  rid  of

appeals?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Kim Keat and Serangoon Gardens

want  to  know  more details about  middle  income

housing.  I only hope some other Members  opposite

do  not  accuse  them of not being  for  the  poor

people. The Housing and Development Board and  the

Urban  Redevelopment  Authority  will  jointly  be

constructing  about  1,500  to  2,000  residential

flats  per  year  for sale to  the  middle  income

group,  that is to say, those who are not eligible

for  HDB housing. Six sites have been selected  to

provide  about 3,200 units of flats in  the  first

few  years. The first lot of flats is expected  to

be   ready  in  1976  and  more  details  will  be

announced  shortly.  The six  sites  proposed  for

these  houses are at Tanjong Rhu, on the reclaimed

land  in  front  of the Singapore  Swimming  Club,

about  760  units; Upper Thomson  Road  about  240

units;  Farrer  Road about 600 units;  East  Coast

reclaimed  land  about 900 units;  Mount  Pleasant

about  320 units; and Braddell Road, near Braddell

Rise,  about  400  units.  A  joint  company,  the

Housing  and Urban Company (Proprietary)  Limited,

has    been   incorporated   to   undertake    the

construction  and sale. Obviously  there  must  be

limits to the incomes of those wanting to purchase

these  flats. At the moment, if a person's  income

exceeds  $1,500  a  month, he  cannot  purchase  a

Housing  Board flat. Perhaps it would be  fair  to

allow  those  earning,  say,  between  $1,500  and

$2,500  or  $3,000  to purchase these  new  middle

income houses. Of course, they must be Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



citizens and, further, they must not own  any

other property. If they already own a house,  then

they  will be prohibited from buying any of  these

new flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens also wants an

answer  from me about the use of Central Provident

Fund  savings for middle income housing.  The  CPF

does  not  come under my Ministry, and whether  or

not  it is desirable to allow intending purchasers

of  middle income housing to draw their CPF monies

is  a matter over which I have no jurisdiction and

on which I have no comments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah alleges that

planning  has gone haywire in my Ministry.  If  it

has,  God  help  Telok Blangah.  He  compares  the

exercise in Pulau Brani with that of a surgeon who

does  not prepare at all but goes in with a  blunt

scalpel. The "surgeon" in Pulau Brani is  not  the

Housing   Board  or  the  Ministry   of   National

Development. It is the Ministry of Defence and the

Port of Singapore Authority. They have gone to the

island to develop it and my Ministry has been left

to  pick up the parts. We do not want Pulau Brani,

and we never pushed the Member's constituents out.

Others  did  it.  But we are supposed  to  provide

public housing.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> You are the instrument!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> We are not the knife. We are supposed

to  provide housing as quickly as possible because

pressure  is put on us by the Ministry of Defence,

who  are in a hurry to get in, and by the MP,  who

is  in a hurry to get houses for his constituents.

All  I  can  say is: be patient. We are doing  our

best. It is not easy to build Housing Board flats.

It  is not like producing motor cars, chickens  or

eggs.  We  are increasing the number of flats  and

there  are  so many demands spread throughout  the

island.  So  it  is not fair to  allege  that  the

number of those entitled to priority is increasing

to  such a great extent that no one else will have

a chance. The number does not exceed ten per cent,

whether it includes the Army, the Police or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



some  civil servants. But I assure the Member that

about  90  per  cent goes to the  general  public,

including the resettlement cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know whether I have dealt with all

the  queries. There have been so many.  But  if  I

have  not, I am prepared to be reminded of what  I

have omitted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, may I just clarify the

question  I raised in connection with unauthorised

occupiers?  I  am  aware of  the  Housing  Board's

recent  policy  to  allow  subletting  to  certain

categories of applicants. In fact, I have assisted

quite  a number of these people to regularise  the

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was referring to is the group of

unauthorised   occupiers  who  cannot   meet   the

required stipulations, in other words a flat owner

has  more  than three children to a room  and  the

unauthorised  occupiers  number  more  than   four

persons to a room. These are the people who are in

a   desperate  position  because  while  they  are

waiting  for a flat to be allocated,  maybe  in  a

year  or  two years from now, they are  unable  to

find  any other form of alternative accommodation.

So  my request to the Minister is whether he would

ask  the  Housing Board to consider relaxing  this

rule?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if I were to ask the Housing

Board  to relax that rule, the whole of Toa  Payoh

will  be  turned into one big slum. The answer  is

no, unless the Member wants over-crowded flats.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, for the record, I wish to state

that I was not seeking an answer from the Minister

on  the  issue  of the Central Provident  Fund.  I

merely mentioned that, in view of the Minister  of

State  for  Labour having turned down the  request

for   the   release  of  Central  Provident   Fund

contributions for the purchase of property in  the

private  sector  by people not qualified  for  HDB

flats,  the decision by the Minister, such as  the

one  released just now, was very much  wanting.  I

was,  in  fact,  not  seeking  an  answer  on  the

provident fund from the Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, may I say that the answer given by the

Minister  has  indeed been favourable,  and  I  am

gratified for it and I am sure that a large number

of people in the middle income group are similarly

gratified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

Minister  for National Development said  just  now

that  he  does  not agree to the  construction  of

flatted  pig farms for renting purposes.  He  also

said that the next thing I would ask is to get the

Primary Production Department to rear pigs for the

farmers. This is not my intention at all.  But  if

it  is  the intention of the Minister to  get  the

Primary  Production Department  to  rear  pigs,  I

think it will be most welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I appreciate that water pollution comes

under  the  portfolio  of  the  Ministry  of   the

Environment,  I  think the present  problem  is  a

policy for the Government to implement. If we have

modern  flatted pig farms made available to  small

farmers  on a renting basis, it will help a  great

deal in reducing water pollution. Irrespective  of

which Ministry is responsible for water pollution,

the  ultimate  result  is  the  same.  With  these

flatted farms we can cut down water pollution, and

that  is the Government's intention. So this is  a

plan  to  be  welcomed. In any case,  I  urge  the

Minister  concerned to reconsider this matter.  If

it cannot be done at the present stage, perhaps he

can  consider it at the second or third  stage  so

that when this plan is implemented we will be able

to have flatted farms available for small farmers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, as the Minister has rightly

put  it, whether or not the Bah Soon Pah farm will

succeed  only  time will tell. The  Minister  also

informed  the House that besides the  big  project

there  are some smaller projects. I wonder whether

the  Minister  could  inform the  House  what  the

smaller  projects are that his department  intends

to undertake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of pollution, I think the

problem  is  not so acute that we have  to  choose

between   water   and  pig  production.   If   the

Government is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



more sympathetic towards the affected farmers,  it

can help them move away from the streams which run

into  our  reservoirs,  by giving  them  financial

assistance  in  the  form  of  subsidies  or  low-interest  loans. I think the Government should  do

something  now  to help these poor affected  small

farmers,  otherwise they will disappear  and  only

the  big farmers will be left, i.e, the capitalist

farmers,  who can then easily manipulate  the  pig

prices.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, the Minister did not

quite  fully answer my question just now. I wonder

whether  he  would indicate the  price  range  for

middle income housing which he proposed, and  when

will this be open for registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now speak on resettlement and

compensation, which had already been touched on by

other Members?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think it is better to let the

Minister reply first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> All right, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if I am to take all 15 Members at

once,   I  must  at  least  combine  the  subject,

otherwise they will not get a satisfactory  reply.

And  if all 35 Members opposite are going to range

over  the whole Budget, then I will not give  them

satisfactory answers. So let us confine  ourselves

to  the subject on which we are discussing. If any

Member  wants  to  speak in clarification  or  for

further information, by all means do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I would like

to give my support to the point made by the Member

for  Jurong. As far as I know, some of these farms

are  situated quite far away from the  reservoirs.

Even then the farmers have been asked to implement

certain  measures which cost a lot of money,  such

as  building septic tanks. It would cost something

like  $10,000  to $20,000 to build a septic  tank,

and  I do not think any of these small farmers can

really afford it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps what the Government could do is to

consider  a  comprehensive plan. Look at  any  one

particular  area and see whether Government  could

subsidise  to some extent, because after  all  the

Government builds sewerage, drains and  all  sorts

of  infrastructure which are not charged  directly

to  the  citizens. Therefore, by  developing  such

kind  of  facilities  on a collective  basis,  the

Government can definitely cut down the  cost,  and

even  if it asked the farmer to contribute to some

extent, I am sure they will be prepared to do  so.

At  the moment, they seemed to be at the mercy  of

the  inspector going around. If he feels like  it,

he  says,  "Look here, I want a septic tank  built

there. If there is no septic tank, your licence is

withdrawn."  This is not the way.  I  think  there

should  be  a  comprehensive plan to  develop  all

these measures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, to the Member for Sembawang, I

was  merely pulling his leg. I think he understood

that. He said that we should do something. We  are

doing something. Hence, these five-acre lots which

we  have offered, and which he has criticised.  We

are not against the poor farmers, in spite of what

the Member for Jurong says. We can still have pigs

near  the catchment area provided the streams  are

not  polluted, which means that the pig farms have

to  be moved. If there is available land, they can

move    there.   When   Seletar   Reservoir    was

constructed,  it  was Government  that  built  the

cesspits.  The  Member  should  have  raised   his

question  with  the Minister for the  Environment.

His  inspectors go round and check  on  pollution,

not  mine.  But  we  are doing  our  best  not  to

eliminate  the poor farmers, but in the process  I

think  the backyard farmer will be pushed out.  He

is  not really a farmer. He lives there with a few

fruit trees, rears a few chickens and keeps a  few

pigs for Chinese New Year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, although my constituency is

an  urban  one - we do not have pigs in  an  urban

constituency -- I fully agree with the Member  for

Jalan  Kayu  who suggested that Government  should

give subsidy to the farmers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



so  that  they can bring down the cost of  rearing

pigs.  I would like to suggest that, if Government

were  able  to  give a subsidy, it would  be  good

because  it would enable the farmer to reduce  the

price  of  pigs.  And when the price  of  pork  is

reduced, it would be in the interest of the people

of Singapore who eat pork.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Just a point of clarification,

Sir,It  is not my intention to suggest  that  we

subsidise  the farmers. What I have  suggested  is

something quite different.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am glad that Members have clarified

the  air,  as  it were. Perhaps I  can  close  the

discussion  on this particular item  by  reminding

those  Members from the rural areas  of  the  time

they  ran  around just before the  last  election,

when  the prices of pigs went below $50,  and  put

considerable pressure on my Ministry as to what we

would  do  and  could do to help the pig  farmers.

Now, the price of pigs has gone up. All I say  is,

who  are  the Members who represent the  consumers

here?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $766,590 for Head LA ordered to stand

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head LD be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BA 1111*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ong Teng Cheong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an item in respect of the Bases

Economic  Conversion Department.  In  my  dealings

with  this  particular Department,  I  have  often

found  them to be quite inflexible and insensitive

to human problems. I had on a number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



occasions to go there concerning notices  for  the

demolition  of illegal structures or  unauthorised

change  of  use of premises. Despite my pleas  for

extension  of time, the officers have displayed  a

complete  lack of sympathy by flatly  refusing  to

grant  an extension in a number of cases. Yet,  in

one  particular  case, after my  constituents  had

managed  to  obtain  a letter  from  a  particular

Minister  -  incidentally it was not the  Minister

for  National Development - the extension of  time

was   immediately  granted.  So   one   gets   the

impression  that  the  department  seems   to   be

practising double standards. They seem to consider

that  the  request is based not  so  much  on  the

merits of the case but on who puts it up. From the

complaints  I  have received, some  of  the  staff

would  appear to be rather off-handed in attending

to   members  of  the  public.  I  give  them  the

allowance, as this is a fairly new department.  It

may  well  be  that the staff are not sufficiently

well-oriented to provide courteous service, and  I

would appreciate the Minister's attention in  this

matter.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only wish

to ask the Minister if he will inform the House of

the  achievements of the Bases Economic Conversion

Department, and the progress made so  far  in  the

conversion  programme. I need not stress,  in  our

land-scarce  State, the vital role played  by  the

Bases    Economic   Conversion    Department    in

expeditiously redeploying land, formerly  occupied

by British bases, to economic use. I shall also be

pleased  if the Minister could indicate when  will

the  full  conversion programme be completed,  and

what  will  be  the status of the  Bases  Economic

Conversion  Department after it has completed  its

conversion programme?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Bases Economic Conversion

Department was formed in 1968 and it was under the

portfolio   of   the  Prime  Minister.   But   the

Department  has  since the 1st April,  1973,  been

functioning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



as a division of the Land Office  in  the

Ministry  of Law. I hope it is not being suggested

that   civil  servants  in  the  Department   were

previously inflexible and that since coming to the

Land Office things have changed. But the policy is

the  same  and,  since 1972,  the  Department  has

handled  a  total of 149 enforcement  cases  which

have  been  the  subject  of  representations   by

Members  of  Parliament. Of these, 100 cases  were

dealt  with  departmentally -  35  representations

from  Members of Parliament for extension of  time

to  permit voluntary demolition were all approved,

and   65   cases,  18  of  which  involved   minor

alterations  and  contraventions,  which  did  not

violate  the  planning  or building  by-laws  were

regularised. The remaining 49 cases were rejected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy appears to me to be flexible. Seven

appeals against decisions of the Land Office  were

dealt   with  by  the  Licensing  Committee  which

authorised  regularisation  in  four   cases   and

rejected  the other three. Of the 42 appeals  made

to  me,  38  have to be rejected, three have  been

regularised,   and  one  case   is   still   being

processed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant that out of these 149 cases, 77

cases  were from the Chia Keng and Simbang  areas.

Simbang  is  a  catchment area, and  most  of  the

appeals    that   were   turned   down   concerned

unauthorised  structures, mainly pigsties,  within

the  immediate  vicinity of the  catchment  areas,

thus  adding to pollution problems. At Chia  Keng,

most  of the appeals encountered concerned illegal

motor  workshops or illegal and unsightly  dumping

of  junk  on  State land. Enforcement  action,  of

course, had to be vigorously pursued in this area,

which  would  otherwise have become a  centre  for

illegal   workshops  and  factories.   Enforcement

officers have the unpleasant task of ensuring that

policy objectives are successfully implemented and

not  frustrated  by violations  of  conditions  of

temporary   occupation  licences.   Only   limited

discretionary   power   is   allowed   to   Senior

Enforcement   Officers   in   regard   to    minor

infringement for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



period of time that could be granted to carry  out

demolition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Keat wants to know details of

the  work  done  by the Bases Economic  Conversion

Department. The planning work involves both short-term  and  long-term planning. Short-term planning

has,  as  the  main objective, the  evaluation  of

claims  and  the  allocation of facilities  handed

back to the Singapore Government to ensure optimum

utilisation of land and buildings. In the case  of

vacant land or land used for farming purposes, the

immediate  objective was to prevent  encroachment.

Wherever  possible, such facilities were converted

to  commercial or industrial uses. Thus, the Naval

Dockyard which was transferred to the ownership of

the  Singapore  Government on 1st December,  1968,

was converted to commercial use, and the Sembawang

Shipyard  (Pte.)  Ltd, has now  developed  into  a

major  thriving  ship-repair yard. Similarly,  the

weapons  and radio repair facilities of the  Naval

Dockyard  were  converted  into  an  international

service  centre, and the Singapore Electronic  and

Engineering  (Pte.)  Ltd.,  wholly-owned  by   the

Singapore  Government, was formed to  operate  the

facility. The Loyang Boom Defence Depot  with  its

pier,   slipway,  warehouse  and   machine   shop,

equipment  and  buildings, provided the  necessary

facilities  for the establishment of  an  offshore

support base for oil drilling operations in South-east Asia. Various facilities at the air-bases  at

Seletar   and   Changi  have  been   utilised   in

connection  with the development of the  aerospace

industry.  And, as the Member will  know,  Sentosa

itself   is   being  developed  by   the   Sentosa

Development Corporation into a tourist resort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term planning proceeded simultaneously.

Plans for the redevelopment of the entire areas to

fit in with the overall Master Plan for the island

were  prepared  by  the  Planning  Department   in

consultation  with  the Bases Economic  Conversion

Department.  These  long-term  plans   are   being

continually  reviewed, revised and implemented  in

accordance with the overall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



timetable for the redevelopment of the areas. Thus

former Defence lands which fall within the general

areas of Telok Blangah, Woodlands, Ang Mo Kio  and

Changi   Village,   are  being   integrated   with

adjoining  State land, or private land  which  has

been     acquired    to    enable    comprehensive

redevelopment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Changi and Telok Blangah redevelopment

schemes  are  underway,  and  proposals  for   the

necessary   land  acquisition  to  implement   the

Woodlands and Ang Mo Kio New Town development  are

being  undertaken. The Senoko area  of  the  Naval

Base  has  been  levelled off by the  Jurong  Town

Corporation  for  redevelopment as  an  industrial

area.  Seventeen acres of land at the  Naval  Base

are  being  developed by the JTC to provide  about

660  units  of housing. Perhaps I have  given  the

Member sufficient information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just

like to clarify that my complaint of inflexibility

is  more  on the question of extension of time.  I

have  pointed out that - and I think the  Minister

would  appear  to  seek to evade  the  issue  -  a

request put up by a Minister was granted, but from

a  Back-bencher the request for extension was  not

granted. What explanation is there for that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am sorry I did not touch on that

point.  Let  me  assure  all  Members  here   that

requests from Members of Parliament, on behalf  of

their  constituents for extensions  of  time,  are

dealt with by my Ministry very sympathetically. We

do not distinguish between Ministers, Ministers of

State,   or  Backbenchers.  If  I  had  personally

refused  the Member's request for an extension  of

time,  I  would  never have given  blessing  to  a

similar request made by a Minister, unless it  was

a  mistake.  One  can  never justify  granting  an

extension  of  time  when  a  Minister  makes  the

request,  after  having  turned  down  a   similar

request from a Backbencher.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I must thank the Minister for

the  assurance.  I  do hope that  the  message  is

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the acute shortage of housing in

Singapore, the private developers are engaged in a

new  racket. Before an estate is declared open for

booking,  relatives and associates  of  developers

book  the  houses in advance. So when  the  actual

advertisement comes out in the papers the property

is  already three-quarters booked. What little  is

left  open to the public is grabbed by speculators

within  the first hour or two. The genuine  house-buyer  who shows interest in any property is  told

that  he  has  to wait for someone to  cancel  his

booking.  This  is where the speculators  make  an

instant  profit. What measures does  the  Minister

intend  to  take  to stop this  racket?  Too  many

members  of  the public have been made suckers  by

these  unscrupulous capitalists. Can the  Minister

bring  about  legislation to  fix  a  ceiling  for

prices of these private houses?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy, do you know

what this subhead says?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes, Sir. And I am speaking

on that subhead, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is all right then.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I wish to raise another

two  or  three  points with regard  to  buildings.

There  are some old buildings which are  going  to

collapse,  but  the owners do not want  to  repair

them.  It is very dangerous for the subtenants  to

live  in  those  buildings. The  Building  Control

Division  of  the PWD must go and check  on  those

buildings to find out whether they will stand  for

long or not. If they agree that the buildings will

not last long, they should ask



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



the  owner to repair them. Otherwise, they  should

demolish the buildings, take the land and  put  up

new  buildings. Many tenants have been complaining

of  leaks here and there, they have no other house

to  go to, and the owners do not want to carry out

repairs. The Minister must look into the matter to

see  if  something could be done about  these  old

houses.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, private housing

developers are at liberty to sell their houses  to

whom  they  like,  whether relatives,  friends  or

members  of the public. They are not even  obliged

to  advertise their housing development; they  can

sell  their  houses by private negotiations.  Some

people merely register their intention to buy many

houses,  of course hoping that prices will  go  up

and  then  resell. Is it advisable that we  should

stop  this  practice?  Intending  purchasers   are

subject to the market forces of supply and  demand

as in any other commodities, and control of prices

of houses cannot be a good measure. What we can do

is   to   encourage  the  construction   of   more

residential  units by giving incentives,  such  as

higher   densities   and  exemption   of   certain

development  charges. The Member's  suggestion  to

have  legislation enacted to deal with this matter

is   certainly   not   going  to   encourage   the

construction of housing units. In fact,  it  would

be  unwise  for Government to interfere  with  the

free   enterprise  system.  If  such  control   is

attempted,  houses are likely to be  sold  in  the

black  market,  making it even more difficult  for

members  of the public to buy houses in  the  open

market.  It  is  also likely that private  housing

developers  will build less residential  units  if

they are subject to such control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards old houses, I take it that the Member

is  referring  to  houses  which  are  under  rent

control.  The  owners, of course, are  anxious  to

evict   their  tenants,  sub-tenants   and   other

occupiers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



and,  therefore,  would not repair  the  premises.

Sometimes  the premises are repaired by  those  in

occupation,  and sometimes we call the  owners  in

and  order  them to repair their houses.  In  some

cases  we  acquire land on which such  houses  are

situated. There have even been cases where  owners

were ordered to repaint their houses. This has led

to many representations from Members of Parliament

saying  that  the  prices of paint  have  gone  up

considerably  and  that their constituents  cannot

afford to paint their houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

agree  with  the Minister that in a  situation  of

free  enterprise, the question of price fixing  is

determined  by the position of supply and  demand.

But  here,  it is not a simple question of  supply

and  demand. I think it is a question of excessive

manipulation. In the other areas like  the  prices

of  basic  commodities and so on, the Ministry  of

Finance  has set up an Anti-Inflationary Committee

to deal with them. This excessive manipulation has

helped  to  inflame the inflationary situation  in

the  prices  of  houses. In consistency  with  the

recent  policy  of Government to fight  inflation,

which  must also include housing, I wonder whether

this   matter  could  be  referred  to  the  Anti-Inflationary Committee set up by the  Ministry  of

Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think it is

a   question  of  legislation.  The  Housing   and

Development Board is building more houses for  the

lower  income group. Moreover, Members have  heard

me  just  now stating the sites where  the  middle

income housing is coming up. But if the Member  is

suggesting  that  we interfere  with  the  private

developers and restrain them from selling to  whom

they like and at what price, then I would say that

such  a  move would be highly inadvisable. We  had

some  limitations placed on land speculation  last

year,  which were announced in the policy decision

of  the  Government  and  is  to  be  followed  by

legislation,  but not in the manner  suggested  by

the Member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding

the  price  ceiling, the Planning  Department  has

some  power to deal with this matter. For example,

before approving the plan, the Planning Department

can  find out how much the building will cost  and

how  much the developers are going to sell it. The

Planning  Department can investigate on all  these

matters and put a ceiling on the selling price  in

relation to cost. The Planning Department has  the

power  to  approve any project.  If  the  Planning

Department  turns  down  a  project,  a  developer

cannot  put up any building. Therefore, developers

must  keep  proper records of a building  project,

how  much  it costs and so on, and only then  will

the  Planning Department consider it for approval.

I  do  not know whether the Minister will consider

my suggestion and take action on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the same

suggestion,  and  I have said that  it  interferes

with  the  business of the private developers.  If

planning  approval is going to be made subject  to

the  cost  of the buildings, are we to go  further

and say that a developer should sell his buildings

at  a certain price, and allow him to make only  5

or  10  per  cent profit? We might  not  have  any

private  developers  around.  But  if  it   is   a

situation  where we want to control the amount  of

development, then we could go into the question of

costs. In fact, a Statistical Unit is being set up

by  my Ministry, with the help of the Deputy Prime

Minister,  to  computerise not  only  the  various

components  of our building capacity but  also  to

give   details   at  any  time  of  the   building

construction   industry.  From   the   information

gathered we can regulate our planning approvals on

a much better basis. But certainly it is not to be

done with the object that the Member has in mind.

and Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head LG be

<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head LG be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 2730.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is most regrettable to learn that in the

implementation of the recent redevelopment plan by

Government,  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  the

constituency   concerned  was  not  consulted   in

respect of the resettlement scheme. No notices  of

eviction   were   also  given  to  the   residents

affected.  As  in  the case of  urban  renewal  in

Kampung  Ubi  last year, the Member of  Parliament

for  that constituency was not consulted. This has

caused  confusion, and has created the  impression

that  the work has no system at all. What is  most

regrettable is that the residents affected by  the

resettlement   are  holders  of   Singapore   blue

identity  cards and they have been  staying  there

for   many  years.  They  own  these  houses  and,

therefore,  they  have  not been  offered  Housing

Board  flats.  Some  of these blue  identity  card

holders were born in Singapore. Because they  lost

their  birth certificates and they cannot remember

the  dates  of their birth, they were  given  blue

identity cards by the Government. These people  do

not  have  alternative accommodation in Singapore,

and  the  notice of resettlement compels  them  to

leave  but the Government does not offer them  any

alternative   accommodation.   This   has   caused

confusion among the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask this question. If these

people  are  not  given the right  to  alternative

accommodation  in  Singapore, what  about  letting

them   live  on  rafts  in  Singapore  territorial

waters?  Will they be given permission to live  in

rafts in Singapore waters? If this happens, more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



tourists  will  come  to  Singapore  to  see   our

citizens  living on rafts in Singapore  waters,  a

way  of  life  that is permitted by the  Singapore

Government.  It  will  be very  surprising  if  it

happens.  On humanitarian grounds, the  Government

should  not  shirk its responsibility towards  the

permanent residents holding blue identity cards if

their   houses   are  affected  by  re-development

projects.   It  is  the  responsibility   of   the

Government  to find alternative accommodation  for

these people because they have nowhere else to go.

The  Government  should consider  this  matter  on

humanitarian  grounds  so  that  justice  can   be

upheld.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek

a  clarification  from the Minister  for  Law  and

National Development. Can the Minister explain  to

this  House  the development projects for  Kampung

Kembangan  constituency? Listed in the Budget  for

1974, we find a contribution of $30 million and  a

loan   of   $506  million  to  the   Housing   and

Development Board. There was an explanation by the

Minister earlier, but there was no mention of  any

development   in   Kampung  Kembangan.   I   would

therefore like to ask the Minister when  will  the

development   plans  for  Kampung   Kembangan   be

implemented.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

sometime  ago the Government did come  up  with  a

plan  to construct pre-fabricated houses. Can  the

Minister  enlighten  me  as  to  when  these  pre-fabricated  houses will be built or if  they  have

already  been  built? These pre-fabricated  houses

will  alleviate the housing problems that  we  are

facing  at the present moment, especially  housing

for the lower income group.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if I may first deal with the

Member  for  Potong  Pasir with  his  request  for

start  sometime  this year, but it  will  take  at

least  a year or more before the first flats  come

up.

<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I remind the Member for Geylang Serai

that  there  are  certain advantages  in  being  a

Singapore citizen. One advantage is that a citizen

is  entitled to low-cost accommodation.  There  is

such  a  long list of applicants, more than 80,000

wanting to purchase flats and about 25,000 wanting

to rent. Last year we built about 23,000 units. So

obviously  our capacity to build is  not  adequate

enough  to  meet all demands. It is for this  good

reason that we are unable to provide accommodation

for  those who are not our citizens. Citizens come

first. However, to relieve the hardship of certain

deserving cases, the Housing and Development Board

has allocated BECD or British reverted quarters at

economic  rentals  to  permanent  residents.  More

recently,  Housing  Board flat  owners  have  been

permitted  to sublet one or two rooms to permanent

residents who are eligible as sub-tenants, so that

those  with  blue identity cards are  not  exactly

homeless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complains that not one of the MPs

for  Geylang Serai, Kampung Kembangan and  Kampung

Ubi  has  been consulted on resettlement.  In  the

past  I have on many occasions seen all three  MPs

to  try and help iron out some of the problems  in

the  Perseverance Estate. The MP himself  is  well

aware,  having been in this House, of Government's

acquisition of large tracts of land in the estate.

The  first phase of development at the Jalan Eunos

estate bounded by Paya Lebar Way, Jalan Eunos, the

extension  of  Sims Avenue and  Paya  Lebar  Road,

falls  partly  within the Kampung Ubi Constituency

and    partly   within   the   Kampung   Kembangan

Constituency.   Resettlement   of   the   affected

residents  is  now in progress. Construction  will

commence in about three months' time after all the

affected  buildings  have been  cleared  from  the

site.  The Housing and Development Board  proposes

to  build  the  following flats within  the  first

phase  of  development: about 700 two-room  flats;

1,350  three-room flats; 550 four-room  flats  and

380 five-room flats, at a total estimated cost  of

$50.5 million.

<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I did not

mean to ask about those who applied for HDB flats.

I was referring to those people with blue identity

cards   whose   houses   are   affected   by   the

redevelopment project. These people own the houses

they   live   in.   They   have   no   alternative

accommodation. Where can they go? Do they have  to

live   on   rafts?  These  people  are   permanent

residents  holding  blue identity  cards.  If  the

Government shirks its responsibility, why must  it

give  blue  identity cards to permanent  citizens?

Their  houses  are  affected by the  redevelopment

project.  This  does not mean that  they  want  to

apply  for  HDB flats. Therefore, on  humanitarian

grounds the Government should think of giving them

alternative accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I have already set out the

reasons   why   we   cannot  provide   them   with

alternative  accommodation. But  there  are  other

ways  in which they can find accommodation, and  I

have  mentioned that they can rent BECD properties

or,  if they wish, they can be sub-tenants of  HDB

premises.  But  taking it a step further,  is  the

Member  suggesting  that unless  we  provide  such

accommodation  the redevelopment of Geylang  Serai

must cease?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I am just wondering

whether  the  Minister is aware that compensations

are   being   paid  to  owners  and   tenants   of

unauthorised structures and buildings,  which  are

affected by clearance and resettlement schemes, in

order  to  make  room  for development  of  public

schemes. Some of these unauthorised structures and

buildings  were under court mandatory  orders  and

because   of  the  substantial  backlog  of   such

mandatory  orders, action on many of  these  cases

has  been pending for years. There is obviously  a

serious   lack   of  co-ordination   between   the

departments  concerned. I hope the  Minister  will

look   into   the  matter,  as  this   unnecessary

expenditure and wastage of public funds has got to

be stopped.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, it is easier to detect

unauthorised structures on State land.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



If  they are put up and allowed to remain,  it  is

only  because of the condition that when they  are

required  to vacate the State land, they will  not

be  paid  compensation. It is more difficult  with

cases   of  unauthorised  structures  on   private

property. Sometimes where the project is an urgent

one,  the  department feels that perhaps a  little

compensation   would  give  them  quicker   vacant

possession.  But if this has happened  in  many  a

case,  I  will certainly look into the allegations

made by the Member for Kim Keat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, would the

Minister  care  to explain why the  Housing  Board

fell  short  of the target of building  25,000  to

30,000 flats, as we had publicised last year?  And

what  were  the shortcomings? Would  the  Minister

urge  the Housing Board to accelerate the building

programme to cope up with the long waiting list?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> There were no shortcomings. It was not

the  intention to build 30,000 units overnight  or

over  a  year. It is not easy to raise our  target

from 20,000 to 30,000 units in one year. We can do

it  over several years, and the target is to do it

over  five  years  with  the  ultimate  object  of

building 40,000 units per year. But it is going to

take  time.  It means more architects, more  land,

more    building   construction   workers,    more

materials. Once again, I have to tell Members  the

same thing: it is not like producing motorcars.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, developing on

the point of increasing the number of units to  be

ask  the Minister whether it is his view that  the

programme  to  improve  or  to  convert   one-room

standard  type Housing Board flats built some  ten

or  more  years ago will necessarily  have  to  be

shelved  for the next five years? If so, will  the

consequent   labour  available  be   employed   to

construct more flats?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member need not have any

Vol.  32 [cols. 916-7]. Sir, I am sad to say that,

to-date, the situation has not changed. Take,  for

example, the pedestrian pavement at Hong Kah  Road

in  my  constituency. The work was so  badly  done

that it was damaged within three months after  its

completion.  Reports were repeatedly made  to  the

department  concerned. By now only  one  side  has

been  repaired. The other side is still in  a  bad

condition. I do not know what has gone wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is a road called Lorong Kabong

which  was metalled half a year ago. Now pot-holes

exist all over the road, and some are so big  that

the  diameters  are  not  less  than  1.5  metres.

Naturally this road needs a major repair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point I am trying to stress is that

instead  of  patching up pot-holes every  now  and

then,  why  do  we  not  correctly  plan  on   the

necessary  quality of road to be constructed  and,

at   the  same  time,  strengthen  supervision  on

construction to ensure that no malpractices,  such

as  the short-supply of materials or short-work of

labour, take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



place?  In so doing, I think we can save a lot  of

money  which can be utilised to build  more  roads

for the rural folk.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I agree

fully with the Member for Jurong that construction

work in the rural areas should be taken care of by

the  Government. More funds should be provided for

construction work in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that there is an increase in

the  allocation of funds for road construction  in

the rural areas. Although the amount increased  is

not very substantial, it shows that the Government

is  looking after the interests of the  people  in

the rural areas. With this meagre sum of money  it

is  difficult  to  carry out work  effectively.  I

would   suggest   to   the  Minister   that   more

construction  work should be carried  out  by  the

national  service  boys in the  spirit  of  gotong

royong,  so  that  the local  residents  can  also

participate in it. As the cost of labour is rising

and  also  the prices tendered by the  contractors

have  gone  up,  we  should  encourage  the  local

residents   and   the   national   servicemen   to

participate  in construction work, in  the  gotong

royong style, so that we can save labour costs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, since so much has been

said  on roads, I thought I might as well join  in

the  chorus  rather than wait until my  amendment*

under Head LH subhead BA 1109 comes up



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)That the sum to be allocated for Head LH be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BA 1109.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the last few years many new roads

have  been constructed and many existing ones have

been   widened   in   Singapore.   Generally   the

department is to be commended for a job well done.

Had it not been the case, traffic congestion would

have  been  much  worse  than  it  already  is  in

Singapore.  However, in recent months  it  is  the

consensus  of  the  travelling  public  that   the

condition   of   road  surfaces  seems   to   have

deteriorated  rather  badly.  It  could  well   be

another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



indirect  measure  to  discourage  car  ownership!

Except  for  the  so-called VIP roads,  pot-holes,

uneven  surface, protruding manhole  culverts  and

poor  patchy repairs are to be seen all  over  the

island.  I am not so worried about the comfort  of

people  travelling in cars but rather the question

of road safety. I think poor roads are quite often

the  cause of road accidents. Repair work  appears

to  progress too slowly. For example, one  section

of  Yio Chu Kang Road collapsed months ago, and in

the  process  it  "swallowed" a car.  Fortunately,

nobody was hurt. Up till today, I am sorry to say,

nothing has been done. The road has still not been

repaired  and  the  traffic has  to  be  re-routed

through   Seletar  Hills  estate,  and   all   the

residents  there are suffering the air  and  noise

pollution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Perhaps I should join in the chorus,

Sir.  The  poor  condition  of  road  surfaces  is

generally  due  to  the  following  factors.   The

frequent  opening up of roads for  the  laying  of

services   by  the  various  service  departments,

water,  gas, electricity, the Singapore  Telephone

Board  and  others, thus undermining the stability

of  the roads; spillage of fuel oil from vehicles,

especially    public    buses,    thus     causing

deterioration of the road surfaces; a high density

of  traffic nowadays subjecting the roads to  very

severe  stresses and abrasive actions. For heavily

used  roads  with  high  density  traffic,  it  is

necessary to resurface the roads with a  new  coat

of  bituminous premix once in every five years  to

maintain a good riding surface. The PWD itself has

a  yearly programme for the resurfacing of  roads.

However, owing to the limited funds allocated, the

amount of resurfacing work that can be done cannot

cover   all   the  roads  that  normally   require

resurfacing. Consequently, only the very bad roads

are given priority in the programme. But there are

certain  roads  under this priority  scheme  which

even  the PWD cannot resurface, because a  service

department  may have notified the PWD that  it  is

about  to  dig up that road in a few  months,  and

therefore it would be a waste of time and costs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask all Members of Parliament to help in

this  way?  They  represent 65 constituencies  and

they  can  help  by  telling me which  roads  have

defects and where. It is not possible for me to go

round  the  whole  of  Singapore.  But  I  do,  on

occasions, see holes on the road or part of a road

that has collapsed, and on my complaint these  are

attended  to  immediately. Members  of  Parliament

represent the whole of Singapore. I would  suggest

to them that whenever they travel, not necessarily

in  their own constituency, if they see a big pot-hole,  they can drop my Parliamentary Secretary  a

note  giving  the exact site and the name  of  the

road, and I assure them that their complaint  will

be attended to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has referred to a road

that   had  completely  collapsed.  It  is   being

attended  to,  and  it  will  take  some  time  to

complete it. I myself have passed that road and  1

was  a bit annoyed to have to be diverted. But  it

is  not  just roads in the rural areas  that  have

been neglected. I was astounded on one occasion by

the number of holes I saw along Jurong Road which,

in fact, constituted a danger to traffic. However,

we  seek  your assistance: tell us where  the  bad

defects  are  and I assure you that  repairs  will

immediately be done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I would just like to say a

few  words. In addition to being petition writers,

hon. Members of this House now got another job  as

Inspectors of Roads! I think the Minister has  not

replied   to   the  point  on  the   standard   of

supervision raised by the Member for Jurong, which

I  think is a good one. I have seen many stretches

of  roads newly repaired, but the condition was no

better than what it was before.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I just wish to mention that, as

against  the Member for Jalan Kayu, I welcome  the

suggestion of the Minister. I hope that the Member

for  Sembawang,  in particular,  will  react  very

intensely  to  the Minister's suggestion,  because

being a constituent in his constituency I am aware

of the vulnerable nature of many of the roads



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



in  that constituency, and I am rather discouraged

that there appears to be extreme passivity on  his

part.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am

certainly  aware  that  the Member  for  Serangoon

Gardens  is living in my constituency.  He  should

also appreciate that he lives in a private housing

estate  and  roads in private housing  estates,  I

think,  are the responsibility of the house-owners

themselves. Should there be any need for  repairs,

the    house-owners   should    collectively    be

responsible  for  the  cost of  such  repairs.  He

cannot  expect the Government to pay out of public

funds  to  repair  a  private road  in  a  private

housing estate, which is a luxurious one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I do not think it is a question

of supervision alone. Perhaps the Member for Jalan

Kayu  came to that conclusion when I asked Members

for  assistance. They live in different  parts  of

Singapore, and all I ask of them is their help.  I

agree that the surfaces of some of our roads  have

deteriorated, and in the case of the complaint  of

the  Member for Jalan Kayu, the culvert collapsed,

hence  the road collapsed. Whether it was a faulty

construction, I do not know. But I need their help

and  also  their help to get more money  from  the

Minister  for Finance. It is the Roads  Department

that  does not always get what it asks for. It  is

usually  $1 million short. So the Department  does

its  best with the money available. But I  am  not

putting the blame on the Minister for Finance. The

job  is ours. Frankly, we could do much more  with

more money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, I think the Minister has

totally  missed  my  point.  When  I  referred  to

supervision, I meant supervision at  the  time  of

construction of the road and not after it has been

completed.  More  often than not,  when  roads  in

rural  areas  are metalled, potholes would  appear

everywhere  one or two months later. This  is  the

point I want the Minister to look into.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I certainly will. Of course,

there  is  more supervision when a road  is  being

constructed  than  after it has been  constructed.

But not all roads in the rural areas are metalled.

And if big lorries go over them every day, and the

rain comes, there must be pot-holes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang suggested more gotong

royong.  Gotong royong more recently has improved.

I  remember  gotong  royong  in  one  constituency

where,  after  the first week-end, everybody  went

home  and  the  Public  Works  Department  had  to

complete the work and it cost more. Since then,  I

am glad to say, matters have improved, and we have

had  several  gotong royongs. But  it  means  that

Members  must work. It is up to them  to  get  the

national servicemen and their constituents to take

part.  We  will  provide  the  expertise  and  the

materials, but they must finish the job.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Sir, I would

like  to  ask the Minister whether he is satisfied

with  the general work of road-repairing or  road-making  done  by the contractors, and whether  the

quality  is satisfactory. In other words, can  the

contractor give a guarantee of the quality of  his

work  for at least six months, or a year,  failing

which the contractor has to make good the defects?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, it really depends on who the

contractor  is. Sometimes the work is  done  by  a

unit  within the Department itself. The  PWD  goes

around repairing roads too. But when new roads are

being   built,  sometimes  by  a  contractor   and

sometimes  by  a  housing developer,  there  is  a

guarantee that the road will last for at  least  a

year, not six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the case in Sixth Avenue. One-third of

the  road  was  built  by  the  private  developer

through a contractor, and the other two-thirds  by

the  PWD.  The  one-third  built  by  the  private

developer  was  always collapsing. It  is  strange

because  one-third of the road was always full  of

holes and the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



two-thirds  were  all right.  So  I  asked  for  a

reason, and the reply was that the PWD built  two-thirds   and   the  private  developer  one-third.

Finally  we  completed that road and  charged  the

private developer $54,000. So that was that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the   Minister  seems   to   express   some

dissatisfaction over gotong royong projects. I can

tell  him that in the Sembawang constituency there

are about 10 roads which have been repaired on the

basis  of  gotong royong. We have a lot of  people

participating  in  this  voluntary  gotong  royong

project. These gotong royong roads are of  a  much

higher  standard than those undertaken by  private

contractors. They last longer. I believe that  our

rural  MPs  also took part in this  gotong  royong

project.  As this project was carried  out  during

the  school days, students from the University  of

Singapore,  Nanyang University and  the  Singapore

Polytechnic  also took part in this gotong  royong

project,   although  they  do  not  live   in   my

constituency.   So  I  hope  the   Minister   will

encourage more gotong royong projects to  save  at

least half the cost.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, developing on

the  point raised by the Member for Sembawang, may

I just join in the chorus on our road works and so

forth?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> On the first point of road

signs, I think it is evident to all of us here  as

road  travellers that often-times we  come  across

road  signs  that  are inappropriately  placed  or

exhibited where they catch the least attention  of

pedestrians  or drivers. This is one aspect  which

the  Ministry can pay attention to. Frequently  we

drive into a "No Entry" road only to discover that

the  sign  was  exhibited in a very  inconspicuous

corner.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, do you know which subhead

we are on now?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Yes, Sir,I thought that since

we are discussing road works -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> But you are on road signs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Thank you for pointing that

out, Sir,I will come back to road works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is abundantly clear that we have come

across  so  many instances where the Public  Works

Department of the Ministry of National Development

goes about digging up roads or doing some repairs.

It seems to me important that where there are road

works,  the driver or the cyclist should be  given

ample  warning of the road works ahead. Frequently

we  find that all of a sudden we come right on  to

some  road  works and this causes the  unnecessary

problem of traffic control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which the Minister raised

regarding the digging and re-digging of  roads  is

well-known.  The  Public  Works  Department  comes

along to improve and to widen a certain road, next

comes  the Singapore Telephone Board to undo  what

the  PWD  has done, then PWD comes back to  repair

everything. Then the Public Utilities Board  comes

in  to  make some improvements. And then when  the

question  is  raised in Parliament,  the  Minister

gives   his   assurance.  And  all  the  different

departments  go back to their work,  oblivious  of

what the Minister has obviously assured. The point

I am trying to drive at really is, could there not

be   better   co-ordination  among   the   various

departments in this respect? Instead of having  to

dig  the road three times, could they not plan  it

together and finish it at one go?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, everyone is talking

about  roads. But I have an amendment to be  moved

under the subhead on PWD. May I have permission to

speak now?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are not on PWD yet, Mr

Govindaswamy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Everybody is speaking on

roads, and I am also going to speak on roads.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, but roads in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I was not referring to the

constituency of the Member for Sembawang.  I  said

"one  constituency" and it was  not  his.  But  he

seems  to have the answer to the bad condition  of

rural roads. All they have to do is to get the MPs

together,  headed by the Member for  Sembawang  as

Chairman, and some national servicemen,  and  they

will  improve  all  the  roads  in  Sembawang  and

Jurong. We certainly encourage gotong royong,  not

only  because it improves the roads, but  it  gets

people  together in the sense of community spirit.

Hence, the word gotong royong itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng raised the same old

question  about road digging which I have answered

before  in Parliament. `The departments  have  not

been  oblivious  to my comments in Parliament.  In

fact,  there  is  a Roads Action  Committee  which

meets  from time to time. This Committee is headed

by  the  Director of the Public Works  Department,

and  its  business is to co-ordinate road digging,

so that everybody concerned digs at the same time.

But sometimes it is not possible, and they come in

a  few months later. The position now is that once

a road has been dug and resurfaced, no one can dig

that  road  again  without the permission  of  the

Director  of  the  Public  Works  Department.  But

sometimes this happens and they ask. "What happens

if  a  water-main  bursts, or  an  electric  cable

bursts?"  I say, "Get permission." Unless  we  are

strict  with  them,  everybody  thinks  the   road

belongs  to them and they dig it as and when  they

please.  But there is this Roads Action  Committee

and  it  has done some good work, though we  still

have some trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another nuisance, of course, is that when a road

is dug and levelled again, there must obviously be

a  hump.  Otherwise it collapses and  there  is  a

little



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



trench, and this takes time to level up. Sometimes

the fill put in by the contractors is no good.  So

instead  of a slight depression, there  is  a  big

hole.  But  it  is  the duty of the  Public  Works

Department to only resurface the road after it has

been  levelled, with a hump if you  like,  by  the

contractor doing the job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  thank the Minister for his reply.  Now  I

would like to move on to another matter, not about

gotong  royong.  I  would like to  speak  on  this

digging and re-digging of roads. I suppose  I  can

offer some help. Perhaps the departments concerned

can  form a co-ordinating committee. But if  there

is  already such a co-ordinating committee, how is

it  that  it has not been fully effective? Perhaps

the  co-ordinating committee can draw up  a  time-table  for the several services to be done at  one

digging, so that re-digging is not necessary.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Ong Leong Boon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was with great pride that we

were able to claim to have the best roads in Asia.

That  was sometime ago. Now, sad to say,  we  have

acquired a reputation that is the reverse of  what

was said at that time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of some of the roads is deplorable and

disgraceful  to the tourist. Take,  for  instance,

Victoria Street and North Bridge Road. These roads

were  dug up by a contractor sometime ago for some

purpose,  god  knows what! With  so  much  digging

going  on, sometimes one wonders whether they  are

digging for oil! Anyway the condition of the roads

at  present is best seen to be believed. The  pot-holes  have  never been repaired.  The  patch-work

type of repairs carried out is so badly done, that

they  do  not last even a few days. Is  there  any

supervision of a road contractor's job? Is there a

time  limit given to the contractor before payment

is  made? Are there any penalties imposed for poor

workmanship?  These  are  two  examples   of   the

condition  of main roads, and there are  countless

others.  If  one drives along Upper Thomson  Road,

one will be bumping and bumping all along and will

soon  be  tired out. Upper Thomson Road  has  been

commonly called the shock absorber test road.  All

we  see nowadays is `tax up quality down'. This is

Parkinson's  law in reverse. The  more  taxes  are

imposed  on cars, the worse will be the roads  for

the motorists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Orchard Road, opposite Lido Cinema, a

beautiful pedestrian walk was constructed sometime

back   purposely   for   the  Commonwealth   Prime

Minister's Conference. The same walk has now  been

demolished  and  made into another  type  of  walk

called  a pedestrian mall. With the high  cost  of

materials and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>





workmanship, with inflation setting  in,  is  this

mall really necessary? Are we going into grandiose

schemes  at  great  cost,  just  to  serve  a  few

pedestrians,  who  are quite  comfortable  walking

along  the present pedestrian ways? Could not  the

money be used for more useful projects?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem to acquire land at great cost for road

widening  schemes.  We cut into  the  frontage  of

shops and houses, and what happens after that?  Of

late,  about  a  quarter o a road  lane  is  taken

either  for  pedestrian use or  tree  planting.  I

myself do not understand what it is all about. Now

in  Stamford Road small flat stone walls have been

put,  and  they are always being knocked  down  by

cars.  I do not know for what purpose these  small

flat stone walls have been put along the road.  In

Robinson   Road   trees  have  been   planted   on

pedestrian walks. They are not only an obstruction

but  can  also damage roads and buildings, besides

littering the road with dead leaves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus lanes have been introduced to ease traffic

congestion  in  the  central areas  of  the  City.

Rather  than  help, they cause traffic congestion,

stretching  for miles at a time. A  better  system

is, therefore, called for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain housing estates, after the Government

has  taken over the frontage and the surfacing has

been  done,  the  owners of the houses  have  been

asked to pay $1,000 each. As the work carried  out

was  simple and did not involve much material  and

manpower,  cannot the Government  lower  the  fees

chargeable?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At certain junctions, traffic lights are not

functioning  well. Can the Government do  anything

about  the  lights damaged in accidents which  are

not repaired for weeks at a time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again some roundabouts have been removed to be

replaced  by  traffic lights. Can  the  department

give reasons for this kind of spending?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to roads, if the Singapore Telephone

Board wants to lay the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



cables  or do some other work, they will  dig  and

put in the cables. After they have levelled up the

road,  the Electricity Department will come in  to

dig  it  up  again to lay their own cables.  After

they  have levelled up the road, then the Sewerage

Department will come iii to dig it up again.  What

is  all  this?  Why incur unnecessary expenditure?

This is a very bad way of expending money.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will come

back  to  the  topic of road signs. Earlier  on  I

emphasised  that there was a need for  improvement

in  the erection and placing of road signs at  the

proper   places   in   order  to   effect   better

observation of the road signs and so give the road

users  adequate notice. I have said that  the  "No

Entry"   signs  are  sometimes  placed  in  rather

inconspicuous   corners,   and   frequently   dual

carriageways have been turned into a dangerous two

separate-lane traffic where you have  cars  coming

straight  on when they should really be  going  in

the  other  direction. This is  particularly  true

with  the road junction at Havelock Road  and  Kim

Seng  Road  where  a  number of serious  accidents

occurred recently and to which ample publicity had

been given in the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I think deserves attention

is the safety of road workers and road users. Road

repairs can be seen going on all the time, and yet

insufficient  warning is given to road  users  and

that   road  workers  themselves  are  not   given

adequate   protection.   Here   I   would   stress

particular importance on the insistence  that  all

road  workers must wear luminous jackets. This  is

made  compulsory for road workers in many advanced

countries.  In  Singapore, particularly  for  road

workers at night, I think it would be advisable to

impose  this regulation. It is very dangerous  for

road workers to work at night. They pave roads  in

the face of constant danger from road traffic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier on I had

given answers to most of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



points  raised by the Member for Anson. Perhaps  I

should  confine my reply to some of  the  specific

points  which he raised but not dealt with  by  me

earlier.  As  I  have said earlier  on,  the  poor

condition of some of our roads is generally due to

the  digging up of these roads for the  laying  of

the    various   services   to   cater   for   our

requirements. This results in uneven road surfaces

which  can be properly resurfaced only after  time

is allowed for the soil to settle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resurfacing of North Bridge Road has now been

completed, and work on Victoria Street, which  the

Member  for Anson referred to, is now in progress.

Part of Thomson Road is being widened and improved

to  serve a dual carriageway. Other parts  of  the

road  have been dug up for the laying of  services

to  serve  the new housing estates in  that  area.

Once housing estates are built, the residents need

services and the roads have to be dug up.  Perhaps

the inconvenience to motorists using Upper Thomson

Road is, in fact, unavoidable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also referred to the

pedestrian  mall. Just before the meeting  of  the

Commonwealth   Prime  Ministers'   Conference   in

January,  1971,  work  was undertaken  to  improve

Orchard   Road   and  to  provide  footpaths   for

pedestrians,  as  this is an  important  and  busy

road.  At  that  time  there  were  no  plans   to

construct what the Member has referred to  as  the

pedestrian mall. However, this concept of the mall

was  initiated  in late 1971. It serves  the  dual

purpose  of  keeping the canal along Orchard  Road

and Stamford Road clean and pollution free as well

as  providing  ample  space  over  the  canal  for

pedestrians to walk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planting of trees and shrubs alongside walks

provides shade and greenery and follows the policy

of  making  Singapore a garden city. But sometimes

things  go  wrong.  The  Member  has  referred  to

Robinson  Road. Now there is a new bus lane  along

Robinson  Road  and we should  have  a  place  for

passengers or bus commuters to wait for  the  bus,

otherwise  they will all converge on to the  road.

So  we  have a little sidewalk between  the  shop-house in front



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



and   the   bus  lane.  This  sidewalk  does   not

necessarily  have the same width  all  along  that

road. It depends on the width of the road and what

is in front or adjacent to it. In order to provide

some shade along this road for people waiting  for

buses, pong pong trees were planted as they do not

grow  to great heights. Of course, with the  high-rise  buildings coming up, it is only  during  the

few hours around noon that the sun shines down. If

the Member is right that the trees prove to be  an

obstruction, they will be removed. But  the  trees

have already been planted, and I think it would be

a  waste  of time and money to pull them  out  and

replant them somewhere else. I would suggest  that

we leave them alone and see what the future holds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complains about the $1,000 cost

which  each  of his constituents had  to  pay  for

roads  along  their houses. This is  the  practice

when we build a road. The frontagers pay according

to  the length of the road along their boundaries.

Recently, of course, prices have gone up  and  the

cost of materials and labour has increased. May  I

point  out  that frontagers may pay in instalments

if  there  are  difficulties in  paying  the  full

amount outright.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member also complained about

roundabouts.  Roundabouts can only handle  traffic

up  to  a  certain limit. If the  traffic  is  too

heavy,  congestion  must  occur.  Some  of   these

roundabouts have been replaced by light-controlled

intersections  with  sufficient  approach   lanes,

which  not  only  permit a much larger  volume  of

traffic to flow but can be regulated to allow  for

pedestrian crossing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng complained about our

traffic  signs,  "No Entry" signs  in  particular,

found  in the wrong place or facing the wrong  way

and this causes accidents and confusion. There are

so  many signs all over Singapore. Sometimes  they

are  put  facing  the right direction  but  turned

around by some rascals. I am not saying that  this

is always the case, but this has happened.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



I  would  suggest to the Member that  whenever  he

sees  a  sign which is not satisfactory, he brings

it  to the attention of my Ministry. I myself have

had  occasion  to  redirect  certain  signs  along

Havelock Road which were not facing exactly in the

right  direction. When there are  more  than  four

lanes or four roads, Sometimes you might even have

six  or  seven  lanes, meeting  at  one  junction,

putting  up  signs  or lights  can  be  difficult.

Coming from one direction one might be looking  at

the  wrong  light and think one has the  right  of

way,   seeing  green  instead  of  red.  This   is

dangerous. But wherever this occurs we do our best

to redirect the traffic lights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the night work which the Member

referred  to,  I  agree with him  that  when  road

workers  work at night they should put on luminous

uniforms.  Most of them do, but not  all.  As  for

warning signs, every department that digs  a  road

has  to  have warning signs telling people who  is

digging it, whether it is the PUB, PWD, etc. But I

agree  with him that sometimes these warning signs

are  placed  too  near  the  site  where  work  is

progressing; so that if a motorist comes along  he

does  not  have sufficient warning  that  work  is

going  on.  I  agree  that sometimes  these  signs

should  be put up, say, 100 or 200 yards away  for

the  motorist  to  see  before  he  comes  to  the

particular obstruction, along the road.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for

his  reply. Before the Minister gave his reply,  I

had  a feeling that he would say those same words,

that is, he would pass the buck to us and hold  us

responsible   for  pointing  out  the  irregularly

placed signs and also for pointing out a finger at

some  rascal  for that dastardly work.  I  believe

there  are  too many signs inappropriately  placed

and   that   his  Ministry  should   hold   itself

responsible for making sure that these  signs  are

placed correctly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second point, I was asking

whether his Ministry would make it compulsory  for

all  road  workers  to  wear luminous  jackets  at

night.  I am aware that some road workers do  wear

these jackets, but they form a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



small number and certainly not most of the workers

as mentioned by the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am not passing the buck. All I

am asking the Member is for his assistance; and  I

did   mention  this  earlier  -  we  are   finally

responsible. But earlier on the Member  complained

of the holes in the roads. We are not aware surely

of  all the holes around Singapore. But 65  of  us

can  point  out where these holes are.  All  I  am

asking the Members is for their assistance. But  I

disagree with the Member that all the signs put up

in Singapore face the wrong direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not even in Kim Seng!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Not even in Kim Seng. Otherwise there

will be chaos. But there are a few cases. All I am

asking  the Member to do is not to turn  the  sign

but to tell me about it. This is not a question of

passing  the buck. It is a question of asking  the

Member  for his assistance and to point out  where

these  wrongly  placed  signs  are,  and  we  will

correct them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> (In Mandarin): Sir, trees

have   been  planted  along  certain  roads.   For

instance, in Robinson Road there is a reserved bus

lane  specially  for the buses.  And  there  is  a

sidewalk  which  is  about  five  feet  wide  with

circular  holes.  At first, I  thought  they  were

constructing a pedestrian walk for the  safety  of

pedestrians which should be very good. But soon  I

found  that  trees were planted in  the  plots  of

earth  that  were  encircled for  the  purpose  of

beautifying  the place. Even at Bras  Basah  Road,

trees  have  been  planted along the  roadside.  I

would   like   to  ask  the  Minister   how   many

pedestrians can appreciate these trees, when  they

are  so  busy  trying to leave their  offices  for

homes.  Nobody has the pleasure or time  to  enjoy

the scenery or the beauty of the trees. So I would

like   the   Minister  to  investigate  into   the

usefulness  of the trees planted by  the  roadside

because this would endanger the safety of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



pedestrians.  There  is  no  more  space  for  the

pedestrians  to walk as the trees  have  taken  up

much  space and buses are running along the  road.

We should have proper places to plant trees. We do

not plant trees in the kitchen!



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I can assure the Minister

that  I shall point out to him all the irregularly

placed  road  signs  in my constituency  and  also

those  in  his  constituency. With  regard  to  my

second  point, I think the Minister has not  given

me  an  answer  as  to whether he  would  make  it

compulsory  for all road workers to wear  luminous

jackets at night.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am sorry. We will certainly

consider  it  and  make it  compulsory  if  it  is

desirable. At the moment, it really depends on the

type of work and on which part of the road work is

being  done.  For instance, when white  or  yellow

lines in the middle or along the side of the  road

are  painted in the middle of the night, obviously

these  workers need luminous clothes, and this  is

the  position at present. But if the workers  pack

up,  say,  at  about  6 p.m.,  they  do  not  need

luminous  clothes. On the other hand, there  might

be  urgent work such as the breakdown of a pipe in

the middle of the road which has to be repaired at

night;  then  I would agree with the  Member  that

proper  clothes should be worn so that the workers

can be seen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not seen any signs in Tanglin pointing in

the wrong direction, and not even in Kim Seng. But

I  would be grateful if the Member can do some  of

my work for me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> (In Mandarin): Sir, the

Minister has not replied to my question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member for Sembawang has

raised  the same point as the Member for Anson.  I

do  not  think  I can take it much further.  Trees

have been planted on the side-walk. If they are  a

danger  to pedestrians or cause an obstruction,  I

have  said that we will remove them. That  is  the

position. One must be blind to walk into a tree.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Hwang Soo Jin.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last 10 years or so, the Ministry

of  National  Development has achieved outstanding

results  in  housing which has  won  acclaim  from

countries   all  over  the  world.  Although   the

Ministry  has speeded up the work of housing,  but

because  of the increase in our population,  there

are  more  and more applicants wanting to purchase

or  to rent flats, with the result that demand has

outstripped  supply in housing. We all  know  that

Rome  was not built in a day, and it is much  less

to  mention the rebuilding of the central district

and  the  task of improving the living environment

of the people. This task is more arduous and of  a

greater  magnitude  because we  are  not  able  to

provide  enough  flats or houses  for  the  people

either for purchase or for rent. Therefore, it  is

unavoidable   that   certain   sections   of   the

population have to live in the rural areas in  old

dilapidated attap houses made of plank  and  zinc.

It does not mean that they do not realise the fact

that dwellings in the rural areas are not hygienic

and can easily catch fire. But in order to have  a

roof over their heads, they are forced to live  in

such  attap or wooden houses in order to scrape  a

meagre  living. These attap or wooden  houses  are

old  and dilapidated. They are unauthorised houses

built long ago.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mean to say that these attap houses

should be allowed to exist.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



What  I  am  trying  to say is that  the  Building

Control  Division had erred in the  implementation

of  policy  in  respect  of  demolition  of  these

houses. We know that the Building Control Division

has  to carry out the work of demolition of  these

houses.  This  is understandable. What  is  to  be

questioned  is the manner and way this  demolition

squad  carried  out their duty. We are  not  happy

with the discourtesy, rudeness and the ferocity of

these enforcement officers. I would like the House

to note their undesirable attitude when they carry

out their work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the making of laws in any country must have

reference to the social custom of that country. In

other  words, justice must be tempered with humane

feeling. If everyone is law-abiding, there will be

universal  peace  and courts of law  will  not  be

needed. They could be moved into the museum. Human

nature being what it is, there are people who  are

prone to commit offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for offences of putting up unauthorised

structures,  even  a  very strict  judge  will  be

lenient  to the culprits. In other words, he  will

temper justice with humane feeling. In demolishing

an  unauthorised structure, the official must  all

the   more   be   lenient.  Due   to   extenuating

circumstances  they  were  forced  to  build   the

unauthorised  structures.  Maybe,  the  family  is

growing,  and so they have to enlarge their  home.

We  should  adopt  a sympathetic attitude  towards

them.  I  fully support the principle  that  these

unauthorised  structures should  be  pulled  down.

But,  Sir,  I  have  received  a  lot  of  unusual

complaints  from my constituents.  The  demolition

squad   officers  sent  by  the  Building  Control

Division  behaved as though they  were  gangsters.

They went and demolished an unauthorised house  in

my constituency. Of course, I am not voicing their

grievances,  but  I  would like  the  Minister  to

understand that these civil servants are wrong  in

adopting a rude attitude.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



Not  all the complaints are perfectly true, but  I

feel  there  must be some basis for lodging  them.

Sir, a person who puts up an unauthorised building

knows  that he is in the wrong. He can only  plead

with  the  authority.  He  dares  not  resist  the

authority.  He  is  not guilty of  murder,  theft,

robbery, or any such crime. On the other hand,  we

see  the enforcement officers going around pulling

down  the  houses. They go in a big  group,  armed

with  parangs and axes, and frighten the residents

in  the  whole village and cause resentment  among

them.  The  demolition squad sometimes go  to  the

extent of assaulting the residents. Whether or not

there  is any basis for the allegation, I hope  it

would  be  investigated into by the  Minister.  Of

course,  we have to uphold law and order.  On  the

other   hand,  we  should  see  to  it  that   the

enforcement officers should also abide by the law.

They  should not resort to assaulting the  people.

Sir, I hope the enforcement officers despatched by

the  Building Control Division could be reeducated

so  as  to  re-orientate  their  attitude  towards

residents who live in unauthorised houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, grouses have been made in

this  House time and again by Members representing

the  rural  constituencies concerning  the  rather

tedious and time-consuming procedures involved  in

getting  approval  to effect  urgent  repairs  and

minor  alterations  to attap  houses  and  similar

structures. I believe some attempts have been made

to  simplify the procedures, but as far as I know,

the  delay in granting permission still exists.  I

have  heard of recent cases involving a change  of

roofing   from  attap  to  corrugated  iron.   The

applicants were asked to engage the services of an

architect. Sir, this seems to me rather ridiculous

and  it also imposes unnecessary financial strains

on  these poor people. In any case, as most of our

architects  are  more  interested  in  big   fish,

perhaps there is a real difficulty in getting  the

services of an architect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 15th March, 1973, the Minister stated, and

I quote from Hansard, Vol. 32, col. 883:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.., the Building Control Division will shortly

be  issuing  a booklet on the do's and  don'ts  of

building  activity  to inform the  public  of  the

procedures  to be taken before any building  works

are carried out.'



It seems to me that the Department's definition of

"shortly" is one or two years. I quote again  from

the same paragraph, in which the Minister stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To provide on-the-spot service and advice to the

public, sub-offices have been established at Bukit

Panjang  District  Office (Rural West),  Serangoon

District Office (Rural Central) and at the  former

Midwives' Maternity Centre (Rural East)  in  Jalan

Eunos.'



As  far  as  I  know,  this so-called  on-the-spot

service does not really give much service at  all.

When  we go and talk to them, they do not seem  to

be  able  to  give  much  guidance.  This  is  the

complaint that I have received.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, perhaps I should deal with the

Member  for  Paya Lebar first, as he  quoted  more

serious allegations. All I want to reassure him is

that  we have a demolition squad whose duty is  to

demolish  houses,  not  human  beings.   The   one

particular case which the Member is harping on  is

this.  There was an incident, I think, it  was  on

the  17th  January  this year, when  a  demolition

squad  comprising some 15 labourers supervised  by

one  officer  went  to a house in  Lorong  Gambir.

There  was an altercation. It was alleged  by  the

complainant  that she, her husband and  her  niece

were assaulted. These allegations have been denied

by  the officer and the labourers concerned.  They

admitted there was a scuffle. I do not propose  to

go  into the facts here because, subsequent to the

incident,  a  complaint was lodged at  the  police

station.  Surprisingly  enough,  the  complainants

have not gone to court. They could have taken  the

case  by  way of a private summons, but they  have

chosen  not  to  do so. Instead,  the  Member  has

written  to me asking for an inquiry, and this  is

being done. As long as the inquiry is on, I do not

think  I  should  take  this  matter  further   in

Parliament  if  I  am to be fair  to  the  parties

involved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demolition is not a pleasant business and very

few  people like to work for the demolition  squad

because they have been assaulted many times.  That

is  the natural reaction. If the squad moves in to

demolish  somebody's home, he is there  to  defend

it,  whether authorised or unauthorised. Sometimes

we  have  the police to stand by. But  people  get

excited and one is liable to go off the rails,  as

it  were, if one's house is being demolished  even

by the Government. It is a very unpleasant matter.

Strict  instructions have gone out  to  demolition

squads to be as nice as is possible. But it is not

pleasant   or  enjoyable  to  demolish  somebody's

house.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu complains about the

promises  I  have made and never kept.  There  are

these  three centres. He himself admits that,  but

he says they are no good. Well, at least they have

been set up, and we can take it a step further  by

improving conditions in these centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure for application for repairs to

temporary  houses  is  quite  simple  really.  The

applicant  submits an application form  obtainable

from  the Building Control Division, together with

three  copies of the sketch plan and three  copies

of  the  site plan, which is obtainable  from  the

Planning  Department  at a fee  of  $2.  No  prior

planning  permission  for  the  repairs  need   be

obtained. An architect's plan for a change of roof-covering is not normally required, but is required

when the proposed change involves the roof trusses

of  a  permanent building. For example, the Member

referred  to the case of the roof changing  of  an

attap  house  to  corrugated  iron.  What   is   a

corrugated  roof  doing  on  an  attap   building?

Naturally  a  corrugated iron roof  must  have  an

architect's  plan, in case it falls on  somebody's

head.  This is the reason. It becomes a  structure

of  a permanent nature. It is not just a matter of

changing the roof, but what it comprises. Changing

from  attap to zinc or zinc to attap is all right.

But  the moment you have corrugated iron, that  is

another matter altogether.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> On the last point made by the

Minister,  there  does seem  to  be  inconsistency

between  the Minister and his department.  Because

in  one  case  after I had written  to  point  out

whether  there  was any real need to  call  for  a

plan,  they  agreed  to waive the  plan  from  the

architect. So where do we stand? And next is,  how

can we help these people to get an architect? As I

have  said, most architects are so busy that  they

are  only  interested in the big fish; they  could

not  care  less  with  these people  because  they

cannot make much out of them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, it shows that my department is

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember asking about this Feasibility and

Engineering  Study  for  Central  Area  Expressway

during  the Budget debate last year. According  to

the  Minister's reply, I believe Phase  I  of  the

wish to seek information



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>

invited  and short-listed for the Feasibility  and

successful consultant firm has yet to be selected.

But the firm must be selected in consultation with

the  Asian Development Bank. Pending the selection

of  this firm, the PWD is collecting the necessary

data  from  the various service departments.  Once

the  firm is appointed, negotiations will be  made

on  the  financial terms of the Study, and  it  is

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again I am only seeking information from the

Minister   regarding  the  Feasibility  Study   on

Computerised Traffic Control of the Central  Area.

I  wonder whether he could tell the House the aims

of  the  Study, who will be conducting it and  how

long will it take.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, that is a very interesting

question.  A computerised area of traffic  control

is  a  control system in which a central  computer

plays  a  major role in controlling  the  flow  of

vehicular traffic, especially in the busy areas of

the   City.   This  system  will  reduce   traffic

congestion  by  the creation of a  more  efficient

linking  of signals, having regard to the  traffic

situation  at  any given time,  and  also  by  the

diversion  of  traffic  where  space  capacity  is

available  on alternative routes. That, in  short,

is  the  system. The computerised area of  traffic

control  system  requires  a  very  large  capital

outlay,    probably   several   million   dollars.

Therefore,  we  need  to undertake  a  feasibility

study.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



A  specialist consultant firm will be engaged  for

the study. That is all I have for the moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again I only wish to seek information from

the  Minister  regarding the special projects  for

which a sum of $5 million has been allocated.  Can

the  Minister  inform the House of the  nature  of

this  project,  as  a  large amount  of  money  is

involved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, a lot has been said from both

sides  of  this  House about  our  road  transport

system,  our buses, our taxis, methods to  improve

the transport system and the bus system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision under this item is for road

transport   improvement  schemes  for   which   no

provision   has   been  made  elsewhere   in   the

Development  Estimates. Such  schemes  will  arise

from  recommendations of the Road Transport Action

Committee  which  the Minister for  Communications

has had occasion to refer to during the course  of

this  debate. Members may remember him  mentioning

the  construction of fringe area car parks and the

purchase  of  material  and better  equipment  for

traffic control. If I may just take one item,  the

fringe area car parks. This means the construction

of several car parks on the outskirts of the City,

where  owners  of cars can park their  cars,  jump

into  a bus or mini-bus and come to town, and also

go  back from work in the evening, take their cars

and  go off. This means that no cars can come into

town,  except with a special licence, and that  we

must  build car parks on the outskirts,  not  just

half a dozen but probably 15 or 16 car parks. Very

few  are  already in existence. For instance,  the

car  park at the National Stadium is ideal for the

purpose.  But  elsewhere we may  have  to  convert

fields into car



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



parks  such as the one at St. George's Road, along

Serangoon  Road, or the golf course  near  Tanglin

Circus  which will, of course, upset our  golfers.

Turning  a  green  area into a car  park,  a  hard

surface,  means  money, and this is  part  of  the

provision   which  has  not  been   budgeted   for

elsewhere. I do not think I need bother the Member

with   further   details,  as  the  Minister   for

Communications  has already said  that  before  we

implement  the  scheme,  public  suggestions   and

recommendations  will  be  invited.  We  are   not

rushing into the scheme. We are being very careful

about  it because it is quite, perhaps I can  call

it, a drastic measure. It will only be implemented

after  very, very careful consideration, and after

the  views of the public have been asked  for  and

given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1107.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some two years ago when the Ministry of

Health was responsible for the Hawkers Department,

it    requested   the   Planning   Department   to

requisition building developers, especially in the

Central   Business  District,   to   provide   for

sufficient  canteen  facilities  in  large  office

buildings. This is a right move. Sir, you  may  be

aware  that  in the Shenton Way area  and  in  the

other  parts  of the Central Business District,  a

number  of  mammoth  buildings are  springing  up.

During the lunch break thousands of office workers

can  be seen hunting for meals within their means,

as   the   canteens  required  by   the   Planning

Department  are not yet operating in  these  large

high-rise office blocks. There are, of course,  in

these  office blocks posh restaurants which  begin

operation as soon as possible. But office  workers

cannot afford to patronise these restaurants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is the Planning Department's requirements

for  canteen space for workers in high-rise office

buildings  adhered to by the developers?  If  they

are, then as soon as even partial occupation takes

place,   the  canteen  facilities  must  be   made

available.    If    the   Planning    Department's

requirement  is not adhered to, why not?  Sir,  in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



Shenton  Way  area  many of  these  buildings  are

partially  occupied, and if the planned facilities

for  reasonably priced food establishments are not

put  into  operation soon, then  it  is  going  to

create another social problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, as far as we are aware, all

restaurants now in operation in commercial  office

buildings  were  approved as  restaurants,  and  I

shall  be grateful if the Member can let  me  know

the  specific  cases where approved canteens  have

been  turned  into restaurants.  The  canteens  or

restaurants in large buildings are operated  on  a

commercial  basis.  Sometimes  the  ownership   or

management  of  the restaurant or canteen  changes

hands  several times because business  is  not  as

good as expected. It is difficult for us to compel

the  developers or owners of buildings to  operate

or  continue to operate and maintain a canteen  if

there  is  not  enough business for  the  canteen,

resulting in heavy financial losses.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I did not say that any

canteen has been turned into a restaurant. What  I

said was that there is a need for canteens in many

of  these  buildings. If he is not  careful,  then

with so many office blocks around Shenton Way, the

Minister's own National Development building  will

very  soon  be  invaded  by  office  workers  from

Shenton Way, and his own staff will have no  place

to eat in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, that is because the food in the

Ministry's canteen is really good. We do not  want

to keep other workers out.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, before I withdraw, I

think this is a serious problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> On a point of elucidation. Sir. At

the  present moment, food in the restaurants costs

more  than five times what one has to pay  for  in

the SILO canteen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, that is agreed. But it does not

mean that we are just

desires  to  put up a canteen for its workers,  it

will naturally have our blessing. In fact, we  are

encouraging  firms  to do so. This  is  the  point

which  the  Member for Telok Blangah wants  me  to

answer.  I  agree  with  him  entirely  that  more

canteens  should be provided, but we cannot  force

people to provide canteens. I think the duty of an

employer  is to provide a canteen for his workers.

Perhaps  the  Member  can persuade  the  employers

through his trade unions to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have introduced parks to serve as lungs

for the city, but have we considered our children?

What  is the use of a park if children cannot make

use  of  them?  The park in Seletar Reservoir  has

excellent facilities for children. Most parks  for

instance,   the  one  opposite  the  Istana,   the

MacRitchie  Reservoir, the Peirce  Reservoir,  the

park   at   Newton,  are  completely   devoid   of

facilities  for children. Where can  the  children

go?  We  must  attract  our  children  to  healthy

places,  like  parks, by providing facilities  for

them  to  play,  rather than discourage  them,  by

planting too many bushes everywhere. Further,  the

Housing  and Development Board should ensure  that

every  available  vacant  ground  in  the  housing

estates be made use for the children's benefit. It

is  an  ancient belief - give the children a place

to  play,  and you end up with healthy and  robust

citizens.  An  idle  mind in an  idle  body  is  a

devil's   workshop.  Housing   estates   with   no

playgrounds  can only be an ideal breeding  ground

for drug addicts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some parks stone benches have been provided.

What use are these if they have no back rests  and

arm  rests?  Must  the people  suffer  even  while

trying to relax?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planting trees along the road is no doubt good,

but  I wonder if any effort is being made to check

their growth. Some trees are allowed to grow  wild

along  roadsides and buses travelling by the  side

brush against them. This is a source of danger  to

passengers travelling in the buses. I quote Napier

Road! Holland Road as an example.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, some trees are so big that their

branches obstruct the street lights. This  becomes

a  source  of danger to pedestrians and  motorised

traffic along the road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Anson  was thinking of his grandchildren! But  let

me  assure  him  that  the  Parks  and  Recreation

Division  of  the  PWD is aware  of  the  need  to

provide amenities for children in our public parks

and  other open spaces. There are plans to develop

playgrounds  at the Central Park and Kampung  Java

Park,  and  other recreational activities  at  the

East  Coast Park to attract not only children  but

grandfathers  like the Member for Anson.  However,

it   is   not  always  possible  to  construct   a

playground,  specially set aside for children,  in

every  park or open space as this depends  on  the

site,    space,    location,    surrounding    and

environment.   For  instance,  the  Orchard   Park

opposite  the  Istana  is too  small  an  area  to

contain  a  children's playground. The  design  of

this  park  is  primarily  aesthetic  as  well  as

functional  for  the  benefit and  convenience  of

office  workers, shoppers and others, rather  than

children, who wish to take a rest from their daily

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board has also

provided  very extensive sporting and recreational

activities  in its housing estates.  I  have  said

before  that  when the Housing Board  first  built

flats  the emphasis was on housing. But today  the

picture  has changed. We have become more affluent

and demands have changed. Before anyone moves into a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



Housing Board flat, he wants to know which  school

his children are going to, where they are going to

play  or  swim, or what have you. In almost  every

neighbourhood  today there are  properly  equipped

children's  playground, and badminton,  basketball

and  sepak  raga  courts. In Queenstown  a  sports

complex costing $5 million was built and, in fact,

another swimming pool complex costing more than $3

million is now under construction, in addition  to

the  pool  which has already been  built.  In  Toa

Payoh more than $10 million had been spent on  the

development of a park, a swimming pool complex and

a  running track. Another swimming complex costing

more than $3 million is now under construction off

Mountbatten   Road  to  serve  the  residents   of

Mountbatten, Tanjong Rhu and Kallang.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benches are generally provided with back rests at

all  public places. In a few parks like  those  in

Bras  Basah  and Kampung Java, stone benches  have

been  provided. I am told that this is a variation

to  blend with the landscape design. I am inclined

to  believe that stone benches were built in order

that  they could last. Wooden benches do not  last

as  they  are easily broken. Anyway, benches  with

back  rests  are being constructed in the  Central

Park  and  Labrador Park. Many people, of  course,

visit the parks for a stroll and relaxation for  a

short duration and do not really sit there for too

long.  But  there  are others  who  sleep  on  the

benches. They are not bothered with the park. They

want  a  place to rest for several hours. This  is

what we want to discourage. If someone sleeps on a

bench  for several hours, he is depriving  someone

else of a seat. He is taking three or four places.

Hence,  some  benches  have  been  built  with  an

obstruction or hump jutting out in the  middle  so

that if a person sleeps on it, he is going to have

a crooked back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member will agree that the primary

purpose of planting trees on the roadside  and  in

other open spaces



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



is  to ensure their proper and healthy growth.  At

the  same time, trees require regular pruning  and

inspection, especially those which are  likely  to

cause  obstruction  to traffic or  street  lights.

From  time to time, a tree poses a hazard to  life

or  property. But when we are aware of this, these

trees are pruned, removed or replaced with smaller

ones.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, the more we hear and see

about  the  wonderful things being done,  such  as

recreational facilities being provided for the new

towns,  the more those of us from the rural  areas

feel  that we are being totally neglected. We feel

very  jealous.  While those  in  urban  areas  are

asking  for benches, parks or swimming  pools,  we

from  the rural areas have to come here year after

year  begging for a little bit more money to build

roads.  We  do not even have metalled  roads.  The

contrast is there I am afraid. This is one  aspect

we  should not really overlook at all because  the

population  in  the  rural areas  is  still  quite

large. And I cannot see why all the money is going

into  the  satellite and new towns,  when  in  the

meantime  we are not even getting enough to  build

roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, may I first reply to the Member

for  Jalan Kayu? The fault cannot really be placed

on  anybody.  This  is  part  of  the  history  of

Singapore.  When this town first came up,  it  was

the  central  area that was developed.  Hence  the

buildings,  and the roads. And slowly  development

has  spread  from the central area.  Some  of  the

housing estates which the Member referred to were,

in fact, rural areas before. Toa Payoh was one big

squattered  area.  But  now  Toa  Payoh  has  been

developed  and  people  are  living  there   quite

happily. We do our best to provide these amenities

like  parks, benches and schools. I do  not  think

the  rural  areas have been completely  left  out.

Under  the Urban and Rural Services, most  of  the

money goes to the rural areas because much more is

needed  there, and not much has to he done in  the

urban  areas because the urban areas have  already

been developed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



We  do  our  best  to  spread  around  the

affluence that we have.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member for Jalan Kayu

is  struggling against l1istory. This is almost as

old  as the Bible. The Bible says "To the rich  it

shall  be  given. From the poor it shall be  taken

away." The Chinese equivalent is Tze yu chin shang

tien huah nah yu shyer chung sung tang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, on the point made by the

Minister concerning the development of new  towns,

he said that Toa Payoh used to be a rural area. On

the  other  hand,  there are certain  rural  areas

which  are resettlement areas, e.g., areas in  the

Deputy   Speaker's  constituency.  I   think   the

resettlement areas are going to be permanent rural

areas.  For such permanent rural areas, surely  we

should   do  something  such  as  providing   some

recreational facilities since they are  not  going

to  be  bulldozed away within the next one or  two

years.  If  such  resettlement  areas  are  to  be

designated   on  a  fairly  permanent   basis   as

agricultural areas, then I think we ought to  give

them  a bit more recreational facilities. This  is

my point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, we are doing our best to give the

rural areas as much as we can. It does not mean to

say  that  Jalan  Kayu is going  to  remain  rural

forever.  To  give  him an instance,  the  Housing

Board  is now building in Woodlands. Why not Jalan

Kayu? Why not Lim Chu Kang? The day will come.  In

other  words, may I say that the rural areas  will

not be permanently rural.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now the

Minister  replied to the Member for Anson  on  the

planting  of  trees by the roadside which  entails

the employment of workers to look after the trees.

Since the Government has to spend so much money on

the  workers  to look after trees  and  shrubs,  I

would  like to ask the Minister whether  he  would

consider  using  the money to  plant  fruit  trees

instead  so  that  we  can  enjoy  the  additional

benefit of an income from the fruits. At the  same

time this income to our country will reduce



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



the  expenditure on foreign supplies of fruits.  I

hope the Minister would consider this suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I am just wondering

whether  the  Minister is aware that most  of  the

open  spaces at Toa Payoh New Town are,  in  fact,

badly  water-logged  due  to  very  poor  sub-soil

drainage.  Most of these open spaces remain  soggy

for days after a rainfall. This really defeats the

purpose  of  providing  open  spaces.  The  people

cannot  even run about on a proper turfed area.  I

was just wondering whether the Minister would look

into  this  because I have spoken to  the  Housing

Board  officer  many times and I have  written  in

too.  So  far nothing has been done, and I believe

the  condition  has  remained the  same  for  many

years. I hope some action could be taken soon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, may I deal with the Member for

Paya  Lebar first? The planting of fruit trees  on

roads  may  eventually be implemented.  But  as  a

first  step,  fruit  trees are  being  planted  in

enclosed   open   spaces,  school  grounds,   some

community  centres  and mainly  in  MINDEF  camps,

which means one cannot steal the fruits. The Parks

and Recreation Division has also plans to set up a

fruit orchard on an 8-acre site on reclaimed  land

at  the  East  Coast Park where various  types  of

popular local fruit trees will be grown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member for Kim Keat, yes, I am aware of

the  water-logged condition of some parks  at  Toa

Payoh.  In fact, when I visited the Games  Village

during the SEAP Games or around that period, I was

surprised  to find that after perhaps an  hour  or

two  of  rain some of the open spaces were flooded

and  it took some time before the water could seep

through. I have already asked the Housing Board to

look  into it, and I will chase them again on  the

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, nobody wants to go to

the Kampung Java Park because previously it was  a

cemetery. We have spent so much money on the  Park

but  nobody goes there because they are afraid  of

devils. The Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



should  find  out  why people do  not  go  to  the

Kampung Java Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, perhaps our people are

superstitious and are reluctant to go  to  a  park

which  was previously a graveyard. But then people

forget.  Some  people are occupying Housing  Board

flats which are sited on previous cemeteries.  The

park  itself  is in an area which is  not  heavily

populated and, moreover, Farrer Park is just  near

by.  The  Farrer Park field, I am glad to say,  is

packed everyday.
