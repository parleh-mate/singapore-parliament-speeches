<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, honourable

Members will recollect that seven trade unions  had

their  registration cancelled by the  Registrar  of

Trade Unions on 30th October, 1963. The ground  for

cancellation was that these unions were being  used

for  purposes inconsistent with their  objects  and

rules  and had taken part in Communist united front

activity prejudicial to the good order and security

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



State. Before cancellation, these seven unions were

given  two months' notice on 28th August, 1963,  to

show  cause  why their registration should  not  be

cancelled.  Shortly after serving notice,  official

information was received by the Registrar of  Trade

Unions  that leaders of three of the seven  unions,

namely, the Singapore General Employees' Union, the

Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union and  the

Singapore  Bus  Workers' Union, in  furtherance  of

their  plan  to  stir up political  unrest  and  to

further the Communist united front campaign against

merger and Malaysia, had met on the 1st and 3rd  of

September  and  decided to withdraw large  sums  of

money  from  the bank accounts of the  unions  they

controlled to implement their illegal plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will recall that on the 3rd of

September,   His  Excellency  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  proclaimed the dissolution of the  previous

Assembly  and  everybody  was  aware  that  general

elections  would  take  place  soon.  In  order  to

protect  the  funds  of the unions,  which  rightly

belong  to  the  workers, from being  misused,  the

Registrar immediately advised the banks to withhold

withdrawal of any funds from the accounts of  these

unions.  Despite this action by the Registrar,  two

unions,  namely,  the Singapore General  Employees'

Union  and the Singapore Business Houses Employees'

Union,  however, managed to withdraw from the  Bank

of  China  $30,000 from their accounts between  the

period  of  5th and 12th of October, 1963.  In  one

instance,  the  Singapore General Employees'  Union

withdrew  a  sum of $13,500 on 12th October,  1963.

When this information came to the knowledge of  the

Registrar,  he sent an urgent memorandum requesting

the acting President, the Secretary-General and the

Treasurer  of the union to see him on 14th  October

to explain why the withdrawals were made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14th of October, the three union officials

accompanied  by  their legal  adviser,  Mr  T.  T.

Rajah,  called  at  the  Registrar's  Office.  They

admitted they had withdrawn three sums of $4,500



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



from  the  union's bank account with  the  Bank  of

China  on  12th October, 1963. They explained  that

the money was handed over to Mr T. T. Rajah to pay

Messrs.  S.  T.  Bani, Fong Swee  Suan  and  Sandra

Woodhull,  the so-called champions of the  workers,

as a form of ex-gratia reward for services rendered

to  the unions in the past few years. According  to

them,  the payments were authorised by the  union's

Executive  Committee  at a  meeting  held  on  10th

October.  An  official note was then sent  on  16th

October  by  the  Registrar  to  the  three   union

officials and to Mr T. T. Rajah warning  them  not

to  make  the  payments  as they  would  be  acting

contrary to the objects and rules of the union  and

that  such payments are illegal under the  law.  In

his reply to the Registrar, on 17th October, Mr T.

T.  Rajah stated that as Messrs. Fong Swee Suan, S.

T.  Bani and S. Woodhull had never asked for a cent

from  the  union and as they were not consulted  on

the  payment  of  an  ex-gratia allowance,  he  had

advised the union to set aside the sum held by  him

for  disbursement for other purposes. In  the  same

reply,  however, Mr T. T. Rajah did  mention  that

Messrs.  Fong Swee Suan, S. T. Bani and S. Woodhull

were  given  an  allowance of $200  per  month  for

pocket  expenses.  They said they  fought  for  the

workers  and  in  the end we found that  they  were

given $200 a month plus $4,500 bonus for making the

life  of the workers miserable and unhappy and  for

making more than 1,000 workers unemployed. Say what

you  like  about  Devan  Nair  - workers'  thief  or

aristocrat  of the workers but - he has not  taken  a

single cent from any union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 4th of November, the Registrar again wrote

to  Mr  Rajah  directing him to  pay  the  sum  of

$13,500 into the union's bank account. In his reply

on  the  5th of November, Mr T. T. Rajah  informed

the  Registrar that he had handed the full  sum  of

$13,500 to the union between the period of 18th and

22nd  of October. The Registrar then wrote  on  the

8th of November directing the three union officials

to  put  back  the sum of $13,500 into the  union's

bank account. The three officials informed the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



Registrar on the 13th of November, through  Mr  T.

T. Rajah, that they had acted on his advice and had

distributed  the $13,500 to those  members  of  the

union who were unemployed. To satisfy himself  that

the  money  was properly and legally utilised,  the

Registrar wrote to the three union officials  again

on  the 27th of November asking them to call at his

office  on  29th  of  November  so  that  he  could

ascertain exactly how the money was used. The three

union  officials failed to turn up on the appointed

day.  The Registrar again wrote to them on 30th  of

November  fixing a further meeting on 3rd  December

to  give them another opportunity to explain  their

action.  The three union officials again failed  to

turn  up  and  the  Registrar  had,  therefore,  no

alternative but to report the matter to the  Police

on   the   4th   of  December,  1963.  The   police

immediately  commenced  their  investigations   and

discovered  that  the  General  Secretary  of   the

S.G.E.U. had absconded. Why? Is it because  he  has

got something to hide?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will see from what I have

recounted  that  here  is a clear  example  of  how

unions   under   the  control   of   a   group   of

unscrupulous, anti-national, pro-Communist elements

can sabotage genuine attempts by the Government  to

protect trade union funds in the interests  of  the

workers. From the various complaints received  from

members   of  this  union,  Government  has   ample

evidence which indicates that unions controlled  by

pro-Communist elements had utilised their funds  to

support the Communist united front campaign against

merger and Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the concern over the misuse of union

funds  and the disappearance of the union  official

connected therewith, the workers and the public  in

general  would  naturally like to know  the  actual

state of the financial affairs in these unions. The

Government therefore consider it essential  to  set

up  a  Commission  of Inquiry to inquire  into  the

mismanagement  of union funds by the  pro-Communist

leaders  of  these three unions. It is proposed  to

appoint  Mr Tann Wee Kian of the Legal Service  to

be  the  Commissioner with the following  terms  of

reference:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inquire into and examine the financial

transactions of the deregistered Singapore  General

Employees'  Union,  the Singapore  Business  Houses

Employees'  Union  and the Singapore  Bus  Workers'

Union  from  1st  of April, 1962, to  date  and  to

report thereon with particular reference to:







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Every payment which appears to be

unauthorised  by  the  rules  of  the  trade

union  or contrary to the provision  of  the

Trade Unions Ordinance, Chapter 154;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The amount of any deficiency or loss which

appears  to  have  been  incurred   by   the

negligence or misconduct of any person; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The amount of any sum which ought to have

been,  but is not brought to account by  any

person.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further safeguard the interests of the workers

from  being  exploited  by the  anti-national  pro-Communist elements in the trade unions, and in view

of  the  urgency  of  the  matter,  the  Government

proposes  to introduce a Bill to amend the existing

trade union legislation. This amending Bill will be

introduced  and  taken  through  all  stages  on  a

Certificate  of  Urgency on the 18th  of  December,

1963.  The  reason for bringing in the  Bill  on  a

Certificate  of  Urgency is obvious.  The  Assembly

will  be adjourning shortly and unless the Bill  is

brought in and passed on this basis, there will  be

no  effective  legislation to prevent  trade  union

funds   from   being   dissipated   illegally   and

dishonestly.   However,   to   give   Members    an

opportunity  to study and comment on  the  Bill,  I

propose, with your permission, Mr Speaker, Sir, to

circulate it to Members today. I will deal with the

provisions  of the proposed Bill when it  comes  up

for consideration by the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[28th  November, 1963], "That the Assembly approves

the financial policy of the Government for the year

1964.".-[The Minister for Finance].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to give my views on  the

Budget  statement of the Minister for  Finance.  We

note  that this year's Budget statement, like those

of  previous years, is yet another piece of  P.A.P.

propaganda.  Because of Malaysia  and  Indonesian

confrontation, there appears to be a more realistic

note  this  time. At least the P.A.P. admits  that

confrontation sets back Singapore's progress by two

years  and that trade severance will have important

and  far-reaching  effects on Singapore's  economy.

Nevertheless, the P.A.P. makes claims on  Singapore

being  in  a strong financial position and predicts

that  the  future,  notwithstanding  confrontation,

holds  great promise and opportunity for the people

and that achievements in the next four years should

exceed  those of the last four years. I  think  the

Finance  Minister  must be  saying  this  with  his

tongue  in  his cheek. He knows the serious  crisis

facing Singapore. Yet he tries to minimise the far-

reaching  effects  of confrontation  - I  quote  the

Finance  Minister's  own  words  - by  injecting  an

unjustifiable note of over-confidence in the Budget

statement. What are the P.A.P.'s reasons  for  this

apparent  confidence? Because, says  the  Minister,

the  gross domestic product for national income has

increased  by  26  per  cent  and  the  per  capita

national  income has increased by 15 per cent  from

1959  to 1962. He further claims that "most of  the

growth  occurred in the years 1961 and  1962  since

the implementation of the State's Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



Plan".  Let  us  ask:  how  has  this  increase  in

national  income  helped to raise the  standard  of

living  of  the  poor? And how has this  helped  to

solve  the  pressing unemployment  problem  in  the

State  of  Singapore?  The  P.A.P. boasts  of  its

achievements  in  housing and in industrialisation,

and  many people are given the impression  by  one-sided  P.A.P. propaganda that there is a phenomenal

economic  growth  and development in  the  country.

What  are the facts? Going by the figures given  by

the Minister, we can immediately see that there  is

gross   under-expenditure  in  land,   agricultural

development,  transport  and  communications,   and

social  development.  Indeed much  of  the  surplus

funds accumulated over the last few years have been

due  to gross under-expenditure, inefficiency,  and

incompetence of the P.A.P. Government. And  however

much the P.A.P. may like to crow over its so-called

achievements, it will not be able to hide the  fact

that  certain essential services in Singapore  have

been grossly neglected. I will come to them by  and

by.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first Budget under neo-colonialist

Malaysia,  and today all in Singapore can  see  the

great  inequalities and injustices that  have  been

done  to Singapore under the P.A.P.'s merger terms.

Originally  a  lump sum of $78 million  was  to  be

given  to  the Federation for Federal  services  in

Singapore.  Mr  Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime  Minister,

told  the  people that Singapore must have  control

over finance. Now control is firmly in the hands of

the Central Government and, in addition, we pay  40

per cent of our national revenue to the Federation.

This   40  per  cent  works  out  to  $117  million

according  to the 1964 Budget. We have to  pay  for

Federal development projects in Singapore, and  the

sum  amounts to $9.5 million. We also have  to  pay

for   the  running  of  the  departments  that  are

controlled  by  the Central Government,  viz.,  the

departments   of   Customs  and   Inland   Revenue,

Broadcasting,  etc.  The  amount  involved  is  not

easily worked out, but it is probably in the region

of  $15  million.  If we add $117 million  to  $9.5

million and $15 million, the total comes to  $141.5

million. If we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



further add to this total, the $30 million that  we

give, the so-called loan to the Federation for  the

so-called  development of the  Borneo  territories,

then  we  find that we are giving to the Federation

$171.5  million  next  year.  This  is  the   price

Singapore  has to pay as a result of  the  P.A.P.'s

merger  and Malaysia. Money which is today  vitally

needed  for  the  relief  of  the  sufferings   and

hardships  that have been brought to the people  of

Singapore by Malaysia, is all given away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What causes the Indonesian confrontation? However

the  Minister may care to interpret why  Indonesian

confrontation has come about, he will not  be  able

to  deny the fact that without Malaysia there would

not  have  been  Indonesian  confrontation.  It  is

clear,  therefore,  that it is  Malaysia  that  has

caused this confrontation. The Finance Minister has

given  an  account of the far-reaching  effects  of

confrontation on Singapore. According  to  him,  we

have  already lost the earnings of our  import  and

export   trade  with  Indonesia  which,  in   1962,

amounted to a total of $209 million and which works

out  to  about 8.7 per cent of our national  income

for that year. Some 8,200 workers are also directly

affected.  But the Minister is under-assessing  the

gravity  of  the situation. The situation  is  much

more   serious  than  that.  Malaya's  trade   with

Indonesia  amounted to $1,325 million in  1962.  Of

this  Singapore's share was $1,100  million,  viz.,

more  than  80  per cent. This $1,100 million  also

works  out to about 16 to 20 per cent of the  total

trade   of   Singapore.  Mr  Speaker,   the   mere

withdrawal  from  circulation  of  a  few   million

dollars following the pay-cuts imposed on the civil

servants  by  the  P.A.P  in  1959  had   a   great

depressing effect on the economy of Singapore.  Now

the  loss of $209 million earnings - and this is  an

under-assessment of the loss - will  most  certainly

affect  very severely the economy of Singapore.  We

can  say that practically every person in Singapore

will  be  affected  directly  or  indirectly.   For

instance, the textile business is 60 to 70 per cent

down, the general provisions business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



is  30  to  50 per cent down, and even banks  that

have  nothing to do with Indonesian trade  complain

of a 30 to 40 per cent drop in business. The import

and export business is at a standstill and trade in

general  is fast slowing down. Those most  directly

affected  as a result of Malaysia and confrontation

are, of course, industries connected with shipping,

rubber,  coconut oil, sago, coffee, rattan,  pepper

and  timber. Not only is it a loss of business  and

trade for Singapore, but what is more important  is

that there is a greater loss of jobs and livelihood

for   thousands   and  thousands  of   workers   in

Singapore.  The Minister mentioned  the  figure  of

10,800. Any man in the street will be able to  tell

the  Minister that the number is easily many  times

that.  Moreover, there is no estimate of the actual

number  of  those affected who are  in  partial  or

irregular  employment  and  who  are  on   contract

labour. Waterfront workers, boat transport,  taxis,

hawkers  and  small businessmen, all are  similarly

affected.  Ships lie idle in the harbour  and  even

now our fishermen cannot go out to sea with safety.

Mr   Speaker,   in  addition,  certain   essential

foodstuffs like sugar, coffee, fish have gone up in

price. This already means a small rise in the  cost

of  living,  which in turn means extra  burden  and

extra hardships for workers who are already finding

it difficult to make both ends meet. Confrontation,

therefore,   is   having  a  terrible   effect   on

Singapore. Even Singapore's trade with other  areas

like Hong Kong and Bangkok is indirectly affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are glad indeed that the Government has made

provision for economic defence to help the tens  of

thousands  who have been hard hit by  Malaysia  and

confrontation. The Government has suggested that  a

worker  who is laid off as a result of the  closure

of  his factory is to receive six months' income at

two-thirds   his  normal  earnings.   This   is   a

commendable  move. But we must warn the  Government

that  the  amount provided for economic defence  is

completely inadequate. Only $1 million per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



month  will  not  be  able  to  help  many  people.

Moreover,  there are many loopholes in  the  scheme

which  work  to  the disadvantage of  the  workers.

Certain  employers  have already  shown  that  they

merely  intend to give lip service support  to  the

scheme.   For   instance,  certain  categories   of

workers, like water transport workers and  the  so-called

temporary workers, are not included in  the

scheme.  And  certain employers and contractors  do

not  give  true  reports to  the  Government.  They

reduce  the workers' normal earnings to the  lowest

possible  average  for computation  of  relief.  We

would say that a period of six months for the grant

of  relief  is  too short. What happens  after  six

months? Or what happens when the employers say that

they  are  not  in  a  position  to  help  further?

Moreover, the proposal that all reliefs paid during

the  six months by the employers will be taken into

account  in  respect of obligations under  the  law

when  the  final  payment is made  to  workers  for

closure  of  business after six months  is  grossly

unfair  to  the workers, it amounts  to  no  relief

being given at all during the six-month period from

the Government and the employers. We would urge the

Government  to  study  the memoranda  submitted  by

workers and their unions carefully. Their hardships

are  real.  Whether Government gives a  subsidy  or

reduction  in  rent, light and  water  charges  for

workers  affected  as  a  result  of  Malaysia  and

confrontation  must be given serious consideration.

We   further   urge  the  Government   in   matters

concerning  the  workers' welfare  to  consult  all

workers' unions irrespective of whether or not they

support the P.A.P. and not only the National  Trade

Union  Congress. It is the duty and  responsibility

of   the  Government  to  help  all  workers.   The

direction of employment can be of help if there  is

much  alternative  employment to  go  to.  But  the

multiplier economic effect is such that  all  other

spheres of employment will be bound to be affected.

Confrontation affects mainly the local business. It

is  correct,  therefore, that local businessmen  be

given all assistance by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



the  Government. The giving of active encouragement

and assistance to the local businessmen is what, in

fact, the Government should have done long ago. The

industrialisation  programme  of  the  P.A.P. has

benefited   only   the  foreign   capitalists.   We

understand that about 70 per cent of the capital so

far  invested  in the pioneer industries  has  come

from  foreign  capital. Instead of wooing  British,

Japanese,  Australian  and  American  capital,  the

P.A.P. should  instead make strenuous  efforts  to

help   local   capital.   But   the   prospect   of

industrialisation  is not bright.  With  Indonesian

confrontation, a huge market of 100 million is lost

to  Singapore. Without the large Indonesian market,

no  big  industry can succeed in Singapore. Already

the  new flour mill, so I hear, is only working  at

one-quarter capacity because of confrontation.  How

is   industrialisation  to   succeed   under   such

circumstances? Moreover, Indonesia is opening  free

ports  and free zones in Sumatra to take  away  the

entrepot  trade  of  Singapore.  She  is  now  also

trading direct with Western countries. The P.A.P.'s

threat  to close our market to countries that  deal

direct  with Indonesia instead of through Singapore

will  only mean the deprivation of more workers  of

their livelihood. It is like cutting one's nose  to

spite one's face. [Laughter] Mr Speaker, Sir,  now

we   are  talking  about  the  hardships  and   the

difficulties   experienced   by   the   people   of

Singapore.  Yet the Ministers there  are  laughing.[Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): So all the

proposals  put forward by the Government  are  only

palliatives. Some can do more harm than  good.  The

only way to solve the present economic crisis is to

get  to  the  root  of  the  problem,  namely,   to

negotiate    immediately   with   the    Indonesian

Government  to  resolve  all existing  differences.

Calling  Indonesia "hungerland", "blunderland"  and

"plunderland"; shouting jingoism and the  expansion

of the armed forces and rousing the people with so-

called patriotic rallies and further increasing the

tension   in   the   area   by   registration   and

mobilisation -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



all  this will not resolve the basic problem facing

the  people of Malaya and Singapore and  Penang  in

particular   today.  The  only  way   is   friendly

negotiation  with  the Indonesian  Government,  and

that is why we moved the amendment to the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech two days ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1963 being the year in which feverish

preparations  were made by the P.A.P. for  a  snap

general  election, it is not surprising that  there

is  a steep rise in Government expenditure for  the

year. But in spite of the steep rise in expenditure

of  $60 million in 1963 as against 1962 largely  on

Police   and  television,  all  for  the   use   of

repression and P.A.P. propaganda, there is still  a

surplus  of  $47  million plus $9  million  to  the

Federation, amounting to $56 million.  If  we  take

away the $44 million of revenue collected in excess

of  estimates,  there is still an under-expenditure

of  $12 million for the year 1963. If there had not

been  special expenditure on the building of stand-pipes,  electric lights and roads  to  deceive  the

people  that  the P.A.P. was doing some  good  work

during  the Prime Minister's so-called constituency

visits,  which were in fact electioneering  by  the

P.A.P. and  using State funds for party  purposes,

there would have been greater under-expenditure  in

1963.  Year  after  year under-expenditure  by  the

P.A.P. has  contributed  to  an  accumulation   of

sizable  surpluses. We should now put this  surplus

to good use in Singapore. The Minister has budgeted

for  a surplus for 1964. Of course, the Budget  was

based on the normal year of 1963. However, 1963  is

not  a  normal year. The loss of trade in the  last

three and a half months of the year may well offset

the  major part of the profits and earning  already

made  in the first eight and a half months  of  the

year. Therefore, will the estimated revenue of 1964

come  up  to  expectations? I am sure  the  Finance

Minister knows that the estimated revenue  in  1963

will  fall  short of expectations. In view  of  the

need  for extra expenditure as a result of Malaysia

and  confrontation, it is very unlikely that  there

will   be   any  surplus  again  in  1964,   unless

Government underspends on development again. I have

already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



spoken of the large chunk of our revenue which will

be given away to the Federation in 1964 as a result

of  the  Malaysia  agreement. The  sum  given  away

amounts to nearly $171.5 million. The extent of the

financial sell-out of the P.A.P. can now be seen by

all.  We  can  see also how much the  40  per  cent

national  revenue means to Singapore. According  to

the  1964  Federal  estimates  for  Singapore,  the

amount to be spent on Federal services in Singapore

is estimated to be $78 million, but the 40 per cent

national  revenue which we give to  the  Federation

amounts  to  $117  million. The difference  between

percentage  payment and lump sum payment  amounting

to  $117  million minus $78 million equals  to  $39

million  - the  extra which the Prime  Minister  has

given  away  to the Federation! And for  what  - the

expansion  of the armed forces for the  suppression

of  the  people! This is what the perfidious P.A.P.

has  done  with the money earned by the  sweat  and

toil  of our people. This means cutting a big slice

of  funds  for expenditure in Singapore, especially

funds  for  the  use  of development  projects  and

social services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. repeatedly boasts of its Four-Year

Development  Plan. We might as well find  out  what

rates of performance the P.A.P. has really put  up.

In  the  matter  of housing, the Government  claims

that   it  has  broken  the  back  of  the  housing

shortage. I do not wish to repeat what has  already

been  said  on  the subject in the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's   speech.  The  so-called  119  per   cent

performance of the P.A.P. on housing is not 119 per

cent  on  low-cost housing that is badly needed  by

the  people of Singapore. If the rentals on housing

units  that are built are rentals which the  people

cannot  afford,  then they are of  no  use  to  the

people.  Take, for instance, the rehousing of  fire

victims.  It  is  true  that the  unfortunate  fire

victims  have  been  very  promptly  provided  with

housing  flats.  There are many  such  flats  lying

vacant because they are unsuitable and unwanted  by

many  people though such people really need  flats.

Now  these re-housed fire victims are wondering how

they  are to get the money to pay the high  rentals

charged. This is one of the many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



headaches of the re-housed fire victims.  How  does

the  Minister  intend  to  remedy  this  state   of

affairs?  The  only solution is in building  really

low-cost houses and not expensive flats. We ask the

Government to help the poor immediately by reducing

the  high rentals now charged by the Housing  Board

and to build only low-cost housing in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four-Year Plan on health states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The need for maintaining a high standard of

health services is not purely based on a humane and

civilized  recognition of the values of human  life

nor  is  it  purely  a  desire to  alleviate  human

sufferings.   It   is   also  based   on   economic

considerations.'



<br><br>This  is what the P.A.P. said. Where are the public

dispensaries,   the   new   hospitals,   the    new

specialised  departments  and  extensions  to   the

hospitals?    Why   is   the   Medical   Department

permanently under-staffed? And why has  there  been

this neglect in the public health of Singapore? The

P.A.P. will not be able to deny that development in

this  field has fallen far behind schedule, to  say

nothing of keeping pace with the population growth.

There  is  nothing for the P.A.P. to crow  over  in

this  sphere.  The cholera epidemic is  the  direct

result  of  P.A.P. incompetence and  inefficiency.

Page  77, section 7.81, 7.82 and 7.83 of the  Four-Year Development Plan envisaged the construction of

the Seletar dam and two service reservoirs together

with the tapping of water from the Johore River and

the  Scudai  River. Very regrettably much  of  this

field is still in the planning stage. Meanwhile the

people   of   Singapore   have   to   suffer    the

inconvenience of ten hours of water rationing every

day,  which started from April this year. We  doubt

if   the   Government  performance  rate  in   this

department  even  comes up  to  54.4  per  cent  as

claimed  by the Minister. We ask the Government  to

start crash programmes to get water from the Scudai

and  Johore  Rivers  as quickly  as  possible.  The

people   of  Singapore  have  put  up  with   water

rationing  long enough and their health is  already

dangerously  affected. It is  high  time  that  the

P.A.P. put in more work and play less politics.  It

is ridiculous that the people of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



should still be short of water supply when  we

are  in  the midst of torrential rains and  floods.

Yet  this  is  another instance of poverty  in  the

midst of plenty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the Development Plan on flood

alleviation. This is the time of monsoon  rains  in

Singapore  and  floods have already caused  serious

disruption to road communications especially  along

the main arterial roads in Singapore. After all the

years  of P.A.P. rule, what has been done in  flood

alleviation?   According  to  the   Minister,   the

Government  has so far put up only  18.8  per  cent

performance.  Therefore,  the  various  schemes  to

alleviate   floods  in  Bukit  Timah,   Queenstown,

Alexandra, Orchard Road, Geylang and Toa Payoh seem

to have been forgotten to all intents and purposes.

Is  this not another instance of P.A.P. neglect and

incompetence? The swamp reclamation scheme  is,  of

course,  far  behind schedule. Only nine  per  cent

performance  can be recorded. But what about  rural

development?  According to Table III given  by  the

Minister,  there  is  a record  of  97.5  per  cent

performance. However, that refers only to a sum  of

$1.64  million. The actual amount that should  have

been spent on rural development for the three years

1961  to 1963 according to Table 7.3 in page 66  of

the   Four-Year  Development  Plan  should  be  $20

million.  The P.A.P. has therefore put  up  only  a

rate   of  seven  per  cent  performance  in  rural

development. We urge the P.A.P. not to neglect the

poor  people in the rural areas. Promises were made

to  help raise the standard of living of the  rural

people,  but they have not been kept. We hope  more

effort  will  be  made  in this  direction  in  the

future, not just a few rural tracks and standpipes,

but complete electrification and extensions of pipe

water  supply to all the rural areas. In  addition,

genuine  efforts must be made to help rural workers

and farmers to fight poverty and exploitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of education, the Government is

again   far  behind  its  schedule  especially   in

vocational and technical education. I do not intend

to  say much on Nanyang University now, but  it  is

clear to all that the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



is playing too much politics on the question of aid

to  Nanyang  University. Singapore has  the  money.

Therefore, let aid be immediately given to  Nanyang

University  so  that  it  may  freely  develop   in

accordance  with  the wishes  of  the  people,  The

Government has, in fact, made promises to implement

free secondary education in 1964. The Minister says

that  this  has now to be postponed. Is  it  really

because  of  the  confrontation?  There  have  been

annual  surpluses over the last few  years  and  we

have now $400 million in the kitty. What is holding

the  P.A.P. back? Was it merely an  electioneering

stunt to be forgotten after the elections have been

won? Or could it be that the so-called postponement

is  again linked up with politics? Let the  Finance

Minister  inform  the House when  the  P.A.P. will

implement   its  promise  to  give  free  secondary

education to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have touched on but a few of the dismal

failures  and poor performances of the P.A.P.;  but

as  usual the P.A.P. blames the Communists for  all

its  failures.  Thus the failure to  implement  the

scheme   for   flood  alleviation   and   for   the

development   of  Toa  Payoh  is  blamed   on   the

obstruction  put  up  by squatters  who  have  been

specially   engineered  and  encouraged   by   pro-Communist  elements. How ridiculous can the  P.A.P.

get? This is, of course, part of the P.A.P. tactics

to pass the buck to other people whenever possible.

It  hopes  thus to create the impression  that  the

P.A.P. is all efficiency, all correctness and  all

competence.  But such name-calling and passing  the

buck  will  not  be  able to  deceive  the  people.

Similarly,  P.A.P. attempts to absolve itself  from

blame  and  to  pass  the buck  to  the  Federation

Government for all the sufferings and hardships  in

Singapore as a result of Malaysia and confrontation

will  not succeed. The people know that the  P.A.P.

has promoted Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has made provision for a so-called

Youth  Training Centre in the Budget for  1964.  We

tell  the  P.A.P. this: stop using State  funds  to

train  Party  cadres for the building of  a  P.A.P.

empire. The funds of the people must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



be put to use for the interests of the people as  a

whole.  State  funds must not  be  used  for  party

purposes. Enough money is already spent on the  so-called  People's Association and the  Work  Brigade

both of which are but State arms of the P.A.P.  Let

the   money  budgeted  for  this  Youth  Leadership

Training  Centre be used instead on the  relief  of

workers who have been deprived of jobs as a  result

of P.A.P.'s promotion of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has always boasted of its

industrialisation   programme.  But   unfortunately

until  today, there is still nothing much to  show.

Only  10  enterprises are in production  or  in  an

advanced stage of production, says the Minister. Is

not  this more or less the same as what the Finance

Minister has been saying all these years?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the employment opportunities for our

rapidly growing population? How many jobs have been

provided  so  far  by  all  the  P.A.P. industrial

enterprises? The number of unemployed has not  been

given  by the P.A.P. for quite some time.  What  is

the  actual unemployment figure in Singapore today?

Can  the  P.A.P. deny that the unemployment problem

is  becoming more acute with each passing  day?  In

1959,  the total of unemployed was 46,000.  If  the

under-employed  be also included, the  total  would

have  been  much higher. Let us put  the  total  of

unemployed   and  under-employed  at  approximately

70,000  in  1959. 30,000 to 40,000  young  men  and

women join the throng of job-seekers every year. In

four  years the total number of young men and women

job-seekers  must number at least  120,000.  If  we

should  take only the figure given in the Four-Year

Development  Plan  it is still 52,000.  Using  only

official figures the number of job-seekers will  be

70,000 plus 52,000 equal to 122,000. And this  does

not   include  the  migratory  increase  of  a  few

thousand  due to people moving into Singapore  from

the  Federation every year. How many jobs have been

provided  by  the 10 odd enterprises  the  Minister

crows  over? Has P.A.P. industrialisation scratched

the surface of the unemployment problem so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



far?  This  fact alone should show how  incompetent

the  P.A.P. is. The industrialisation of the P.A.P.

is only to allow foreign capitalists to exploit the

pioneer  industry  and  tax  holiday  laws  of  the

country  to extract bigger profits from the people.

Local capital has not been given its proper role in

the  P.A.P.'s  scheme  of  things.  Then  what   of

investments  of  surplus  funds  overseas?  In  the

previous  years,  the  P.A.P. has  been  increasing

investments  overseas. The amount of surplus  funds

invested  abroad amounted to $316 million in  1961.

The  1962  figures are not yet available.  Let  the

Minister  tell us. But we are pretty sure that  the

amount invested abroad must have again been further

increased.  We  ask the Government,  get  back  the

funds from abroad. We can put our own money to good

use in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot pass by without mention of the increase

in  petrol  duty  of 10 cents per gallon  that  has

already  been imposed on the people.  This  is  the

beginning of harmonisation of duties with  Malaysia

which  will  ultimately cover duties on  all  items

that  are  lightly taxed or free of  tax  today  in

Singapore.  This extra duty of 10 cents  on  petrol

will mean an increase of burden and hardship on the

people of Singapore, especially now that that  they

are  feeling more and more the effects of  Malaysia

and confrontation. It may be argued that the petrol

duty is easily borne by those most able to bear it.

But  Government must not forget that those who  run

non-diesel  taxis, lorries, fishing  boats,  motor-boats,  etc.,  are  also  affected.  Moreover,  the

amount  of  revenue obtainable by the tax  is  only

$3.2  million out of which $1.3 million has  to  be

given  away  to  the Federation.  The  small  extra

revenue  will  not  make  much  difference  to  the

estimates.  Is this extra tax absolutely  necessary

at  the present time? Is there not a budget surplus

already?



Mr  Speaker, Sir, today Singapore faces  a  grave economic  crisis.  All  the rosy  pictures  of  the P.A.P. will not hide the fact that more  and  more people are facing a bleak future as a result



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



of  Malaysia and the Indonesian confrontation.  The

propaganda  lie of the P.A.P. that Malaysia  brings

stability  and  peace, happiness and prosperity  is

completely exposed. All can see now that instead of

stability  and peace, there is strife, tension  and

threat of war. Instead of happiness and prosperity,

there is misery and sorrow. Extra burdens and extra

taxes, loss of business and loss of employment. The

P.A.P. may  have  high hopes of industrialisation,

but  until today P.A.P. industrialisation  has  not

succeeded   in  providing  jobs  for  the   people.

Nevertheless,  it  is  imperative  that  we  pursue

industrialisation   energetically.   But   a    new

difficulty  has arisen - the loss of trade  and  the

loss  of  a market of 100 million is bound to  have

adverse effects on industrialisation in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cushion the terrible effects of Malaysia and

confrontation, we urge the Government  to  increase

expenditure on public work projects and  on  public

assistance to the thousands and thousands who  have

been  deprived of their livelihood through no fault

of  their  own.  An expenditure of $1  million  per

month on assistance is definitely insufficient. The

amount must be substantially increased. Aid must be

given  to every person generally affected,  whether

directly  or indirectly, and not merely to  certain

categories of workers. The solution to our  present

economic crisis lies not in the wooing of  U.S. or

Australian  or Italian capital or in the palliative

measures  suggested by the Government. It  lies  in

persuading the Federation Government to get rid  of

all  foreign influence and interference,  stop  all

action  that  tends to increase  tension  and  even

provocation,  stop  all  warlike  preparations   of

registration and mobilisation, go to the conference

table  and negotiate with the Indonesian Government

and  resolve  all existing differences between  the

two  countries amicably and to our mutual  benefit.

Only  thus  will  tension be dissolved  and  peace,

happiness  and prosperity guaranteed in  South-East

Asia.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, the estimates

put  forward by the P.A.P. Government for the  year

1964  clearly  show that we will continue  to  give

priority  to  social services for the  welfare  and

interests  of the people of Singapore as  a  whole.

The   estimate  of  $204,301,070  which  has   been

allocated  in the Budget is the biggest sum,  which

is    two-thirds   of   the   whole   estimate   of

$326,779,000.  This proves that the  Government  is

constantly giving prior attention to the  interests

of the people and giving them many facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the estimates put up in this House have been put up after giving consideration to the effects of confrontation launched by Indonesia. I am confident that without confrontation the P.A.P. Government will definitely be able to allocate more sums of money for its

social  services in order to meet the needs of  the

people. Confrontation has been launched because  of

misunderstanding  on  the  part  of  our  neighbour

- Indonesia  - as  a result of the stupidity  of  the

anti-national  and the Communist  group,  like  the

Barisan,  which have spread false propaganda.  They

are  adament in claiming that the people  here  are

against Malaysia, whereas in point of fact  we  are

all aware that in the referendum, which was held in

a democratic manner, the people freely chose merger

and  Malaysia. Therefore, all the accusations  that

the  P.A.P.  Government was solely responsible  for

the  hardships  of the people and  the  workers  in

Singapore   as   a  result  of  confrontation   are

unfounded  and based on the stupidity and ignorance

of  the  Barisan Sosialis Members. The blame should

be  put squarely on the Barisan Sosialis. They  are

guilty  because  the people are  suffering  as  the

result  of confrontation. They claim that they  are

representing  the  people. In fact,  they  are  the

hirelings of the Communists and they have been used

for  subversive purposes to divide  and  split  the

people  so  that  we  will accept  a  new  kind  of

colonialism. Mr Deputy Speaker, although



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



we   are   faced  with  the   effects   of

confrontation,    we   are   not    shirking    our

responsibility and duty. On the contrary,  we  will

continue  to  strive to achieve our  objectives  to

implement  our  programmes for the benefit  of  the

people.  It  is  our  desire to  make  Singapore  a

peaceful  and prosperous country where  the  multi-racial population can live in peace and harmony. It

is  also  our objective to establish a  more  equal

society where everyone can live in peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, during the four years of P.A.P. Government, the social services have been intensified to cover all aspects. There are 17 creches where children between five and six years of age are given free education. These children come from poor families who cannot afford to send

them to kindergarten classes for which they have to

pay  fees.  In  addition, there are  creches  where

children  up to five years of age are looked  after

when  their  parents go to work. Along  with  these

services we have plans for the adoption of children

who  are  orphans  or who are faced  with  domestic

difficulties. The decision is made to have  adopted

mothers   and  expenses  will  be  borne   by   the

Government.  To  accommodate juvenile  delinquents,

the  Government  has  built  two  schools  and  two

welfare  homes. In addition, there is a  department

to   look  after  their  welfare  when  they   have

completed  their studies. The boys  from  5  to  19

years  of  age are given vocational education  like

auto-mechanics,  carpentry, and others,  to  enable

them  to  obtain  jobs. With  the  passing  of  the

Women's  Charter, efforts to look after  the  women

have  been carried out. Now there are four  welfare

homes  for  girls including one home specially  for

Muslim  women situated at Jalan Eunos. Just as  for

the boys, these girls are given similar training so

that  when they leave they can lead a new  life  in

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, our services are not only confined to youths and children but they also cover the aged. There are two homes for them. One is at Bushey Park for men and the other is at Woodstock for women. Every social welfare home is administered by the staff of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



Social Welfare. The inmates are given training, and

although  they  are  old they can  do  useful  work

during  their spare time. In addition, their health

is  well looked after. For their entertainment film

shows  are given every week. They are permitted  to

leave the home to visit their relatives. Television

and  radio  sets are also provided, in addition  to

the  services  I have mentioned, the Department  of

Social  Welfare  also  provides  general  services.

These   services  have  made  Singapore  the   most

advanced social State in South-East Asia. I believe

there  is no other country so realistic as to  give

aid  to the poor and the unemployed as what we  are

doing  in Singapore. Families of the poor  who  are

eligible for aid receive $90 per month. The sum  to

be  spent on relieving such families amounts to  an

average of $800,000 per month, or about $10 million

per  year.  For those who are suffering from  T.B.,

there  is  a special allowance totalling  $180  for

each  family.  Both these services over  the  years

have  confirmed the Government's policy to  achieve

its  aim of a more equal society where the poor can

live in peace and harmony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past four years our efforts to

consolidate  and  expand the social  services  have

been  implemented and in the next  five  years  the

task of the P.A.P. Government is to further improve

these social services. Now work on the construction

of a further home for the aged is in progress. This

home  when  completed next year will have  complete

equipment  to  accommodate 500 aged  males,  it  is

estimated   that  in  the  next  five   years   the

Government  must have homes to accommodate  between

5,000  and  8,000 aged, and plans to build  several

more   homes  for  these  people  are  still  under

consideration. For the children two further creches

are being built in the Tanjong Pagar area and Anson

Road.  Plans are also being prepared to have a  new

welfare  school for boys who, for the  time  being,

are  accommodated at Keppel Road Welfare Home. This

school  when  completed will have an administration

room,  dormitory,  classes, one  workshop  complete

with  equipment and quarters for the staff. Another

two   hostels   for  boys,  each  of   which   will

accommodate 50, will be built. In these hostels the

boys will be trained



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



in vocational education to prepare them for jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the social services for the poor,

the  P.A.P.  Government also provides services  for

all.  When we were in office in 1959 Singapore  had

only 24 community centres. Over the past four years

the  People's Association has built altogether  160

community centres, including those which were built

in   rural  areas.  These  community  centres,   in

addition to being places where the people can  meet

and  exchange  views and hold adult  classes,  also

serve as places for inoculation of poultry and  for

paying  licences. All these community  centres  are

provided  with  radio and television  sets,  sports

equipment,   adult   classes,   film   shows,   and

activities  for  the children. The latest  facility

provided in these centres are television sets where

electricity is available. Mr Deputy Speaker, these

community   centres,  in  fact,   provide   various

services  for  the entertainment of the  people  in

addition  to  their  acting  as  liaison  with  the

Government.    The    People's   Association,    in

conjunction  with  the Social  Welfare  Department,

proposes  to  hold  kindergarten classes  in  these

community  centres for children  according  to  the

proper methods, and not like those conducted by the

Barisan  Sosialis  for the purpose  of  inculcating

Communism   into  them.  These  community   centres

provide useful services to the people and will  not

be used for false propaganda as has been claimed by

the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am happy to say that under the P.A.P. Government development and rapid progress has been achieved in the field of social services. I would like to make a few brief remarks in connection with the fire services in Singapore. We have a Fire Brigade Department headed by a Chief

Fire Officer. Our fire services are at par with the

other fire services in South-East Asia. Our Central

Fire  Station is at Hill Street, with  branches  at

Alexandra,  Bukit  Timah  and  Geylang.  With   the

expansion  of these services, it is necessary  that

the   fire  services  be  expanded  to  look  after

property.  The  building of two more fire  stations

will  be planned at Toa Payoh and at the industrial

site  at Jurong. A difficult problem faces the fire

services in putting out fires



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



in  kampongs  where attap houses  are  built  close

together. A clear example was the fire which  broke

out  from Lorong 5 to Lorong 9 in Geylang recently.

The  fire  engines could not approach  these  areas

where  there  are crowded attap houses.  Therefore,

all efforts to extinguish the fire were blocked. As

a  temporary  measure to overcome this  difficulty,

the  Auxiliary  Fire Brigade has been  established,

There are now 70 voluntary fire units and they have

done excellent services in fighting fires. The Fire

Brigade   also   looks  after  the  ambulance   for

accidents.  There are 11 ambulances in  the  State.

For  this year, this service, which is looked after

by  more than 30 personnel, has answered more  than

18,000 calls. The services of the Fire Brigade will

be maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, just now a Member of the Barisan Sosialis claimed that the fire victims were not given proper treatment. He also claimed that the victims were neglected. I wish to say in this House that all fire victims have been offered Housing Board flats if they so desire. In order to

enable them to pay rentals, each family is given up

to  a  maximum of $35 per month or $7 per head  per

month.  This  is  one  of the  aids  given  by  the

Government  to  those  fire victims.  In  addition,

these  fire  victims are given aid in the  form  of

clothing  and food whilst they are temporarily  put

up  in relief centres before they accept the flats.

Many of the fire victims are given low-cost flats,

the  rental of which is $20 per month. There is  no

country in South-East Asia which has given  such  a

facility.  I  am happy to say that  when  the  fire

broke out in Lorongs 5 to 9, Geylang, we were  able

to  give  the fire victims housing flats  within  a

short space of 24 hours. The spirit of co-operation

can  be  clearly  seen whenever there  is  a  fire.

People  of  all races work together  and  give  all

kinds  of help and make contributions. This  spirit

of  gotong  royong will be maintained  so  that  in

future  the  people will not just be spectators  on

the projects which are meant for their benefit.  On

the  contrary, they will work hand in hand with the

Government. The Government looks after  the  people

from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



birth  until death. I wish to say that  under  the

P.A.P.  Government  the progress  which  has  been

achieved  in  the  field of  social  services  has

increased greatly. Our object, I reiterate, is for

the welfare and benefit of the people so that they

will  have more faith in our Government.  We  will

continue  to  pursue our efforts  to  achieve  our

social revolution. With these aims, it is easy for

us  to  eliminate and isolate the  Communists  who

claim  that they alone can look after the interest

of the people. As a socialist, democratic and non-Communist  Government,  it  is  our  aim  to  make

Singapore peaceful and prosperous and in which the

multi-racial   society  can   live   together   in

happiness.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance  has

spent  a  great  deal  of  time  to  deliver   his

financial  statement. I think everyone is  anxious

to   know   what   repercussions  this   financial

statement has on the people of Singapore. I am now

airing  some of the views of the people so  as  to

enable  the  public  to know  the  real  state  of

affairs. In the eyes of the great majority of  the

people, the state of affairs is somewhat different

from that as described by the P.A.P. Anyone who  has

made  a careful study of this financial statement,

if  he  is  not over-awed by the statistics,  will

realise  that  our  analysis of  the  question  of

Malaysia  and  the  economics  of  the  P.A.P.  is

correct. Therefore, it will be seen that those who

accuse us of lying are twisting the facts. On  the

whole, the Budget statement has enabled the people

to  see  that  Malaysia has brought about  greater

difficulties and hardships on them. Inevitably the

Budget  statement has received a certain  reaction

from  the  people. The P.A.P. Government has  also

realised the evil consequences. All will  be  able

to  know  that  the people are meeting  with  more

difficulties,  more  taxes  and  more   hardships.

Secondly,  this  Budget  statement  provides  good

material  for educating the people to enable  them

to  see through the P.A.P.'s Budget statement. The

P.A.P. has made use of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



Budget  statement to fish money out of the pockets

of  the  people  in  order  to  help  the  foreign

capitalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to go into this Budget statement and its significance in detail. According to the Minister for Finance, in the first few months of this year there has been an economic expansion in Singapore. This is only a superficial phenomenon. We will look behind it and

see  the  true  picture.  According  to  us,  this

superficial phenomenon does not really prove  that

the  standard  of  living of the people  has  been

raised.  This is because it only shows the  amount

of  money  spent and the figures of trade - nothing

else.  It  is also because all the money spent  is

derived  from the people themselves.  So  whatever

money  the  Government  wants  will  have  to   be

obtained  from  the people. This will  reduce  the

amount  of  money in the possession of the  people

and  cause  them further hardship.  This  kind  of

economic control by the P.A.P. is adverse  to  all

concerned.  From  the  long-term  view,  this   is

detrimental to Singapore. But because  the  P.A.P.

is  anti the people and anti-worker in nature,  it

is  engaged  in this kind of policy. The  national

income  has  only increased a little in  the  last

three  years,  in fact, by only 6  per  cent.  The

population growth, however, is up by 9  per  cent.

In  our society there are those who are very  rich

and  those  who  are very poor.  The  poor  people

cannot  have  anything to eat. Most  of  them  are

living  from  hand  to mouth.  There  is  a  great

distinction between the two classes. There  is  no

actual  improvement in the living standard in  our

society.  Everybody who is clear  minded  can  see

this.  There are many poor people who live in  the

Minister  for Finance's own constituency of  Kreta

Ayer  who are living in pigeon-hole huts.  We  can

also see this everywhere in Singapore. This is the

result  of  the Government's so-called  equal  and

fair  economic policy. This is because the  wealth

is  being shared by only a small minority  of  the

people. Only those who cannot see the realities of

the  situation  will  be fooled  by  the  P.A.P.'s

economic statement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the national income, we can judge

it from another angle. I am pleased to see that the

Finance  Minister has not forgotten  to  remind  us

that  from  1960 to 1961 the price  of  rubber  has

risen.  But  he has not told us that  our  national

income has increased proportionally. As a result of

the  economic situation, I would like to tell  the

House  about the structure of the national  income.

Singapore  is engaged in entrepot trade. Therefore,

it  is dependent on trade with other countries. Our

economy - our well-being and prosperity - is lined up

with   this.   If  other  countries  experience   a

prosperity   in  their  economy,   we   will   also

experience  the same thing. But when  they  have  a

depression,  we  will suffer as a  consequence.  We

will  have  to  bear the sufferings of  others  as

well.  From  this  we  can see  that  our  entrepot

economy  will  subject  our national  income  to  a

passive role and status. We should have a long-term

policy  on  the  national income  and  not  just  a

temporary one which will fluctuate according to the

economic  circumstances in other  countries.  Today

Malaysia,  which has been imposed on the people  of

Singapore, has brought great suffering on them.  It

is   because  of  Malaysia  that  the  economy   of

Singapore  has also suffered. We can see  all  this

from the Budget statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about this in detail. According

to   the  Malaysia  Agreement,  there  are  certain

provisions  regarding  harmonisation  in   tariffs.

Singapore will have to raise its taxes to the level

prevailing in Malaya. This means that there will he

higher  taxes in Singapore. This will in turn  mean

that  the  cost  of  living in  Singapore  will  be

accordingly raised. For instance, when today $2 may

be able to feed a family for one day, in future the

$2  will not be enough to feed it for a whole  day,

because the prices of all essential goods will have

risen.  Whatever  statistics you may  produce,  you

cannot  explain this away to the people.  They  can

make  their  own calculations. They  can  also  see

clearly that this suffering has been brought  about

by  the  P.A.P. Government. In the Budget statement

there is mention of an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



increase  of  petrol  tax. But  in  future  we  can

foresee more taxes on other things. The P.A.P.,  on

the  one hand, increases the petrol tax and, on the

other  hand,  reduces the tax on  entertainment  in

order to give the facade that the people have  more

benefits  than  taxes.  The concessions  in  owner-occupied  attap houses only affect  a  few  people.

Many people living in houses with zinc roofs in the

rural areas will not be benefited. In the end, when

there  is a general increase in taxes and the  cost

of  living goes up, the poor people will suffer. We

agree  with  any  policy that will  bring  about  a

better  economic situation to benefit the majority.

But  the  P.A.P.,  on  the one hand,  exercises  an

economic  squeeze, and on the other hand, they  ask

people not to spend so much on certain things. They

give  the  people something with one hand but  they

take away more from them with the other hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia has brought about difficulties to

Singapore's entrepot trade. Singapore has all along

been depending on entrepot trade with Indonesia. As

a  result,  this trade now suffers. The losses  are

great.  The  effects of economic  fluctuations  are

seen  in  a  chain  reaction, and other  multiplyer

effects  will  arise. The severance of  trade  will

bring  about  long-term  effects  which  are   more

serious  than the P.A.P. have made out to  be.  But

worse  days brought about by Malaysia are to  come.

At  present the losses are not too extensive but we

can  see that they are mounting. We can see  a  few

things.   Because  of  the  severance   of   trade,

Singapore has suffered a loss of $9 million,  about

8.7  per cent according to the calculations by  the

Minister. About 8,200 workers will lose their  jobs

because of the loss of imports of agricultural  and

other products. The loss of about $209 million will

mean  that  our  loss of annual Budget  expenditure

will  be  about two-thirds per year. It will  bring

about  a worse economic situation in Singapore  and

more people will be jobless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister's calculations, there

are  8,200  who are out of job as a consequence  of

confrontation. But this is under-assessment.  There

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



more  workers  who  find it difficult  to  maintain

their   livelihood.   These  workers   are   mainly

connected  with processing in factories  and  other

related  trades. There are about tens of  thousands

including their families - very many more  than  the

Minister's calculations. There are hawkers, workers

and others indirectly affected. So the significance

is  more than what the Minister has made it out  to

be.  There  are  tens of thousands of  people  thus

affected by this chain reaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody is concerned about the way the P.A.P.

is resolving the present difficulties. Whenever the

Government faces any economic difficulty,  it  will

possibly adopt one of two methods, as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To sacrifice the interests of the majority in

order to tide over the difficulties temporarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To look after the interests of the majority

in order to tide over the temporary difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, these two lines will clearly show which

Government  will be pro-people and which Government

will be anti-people. Fundamentally the P.A.P. adopt

the first method. The measures that they adopt will

he only a palliative to alleviate the difficulties.

The  measures adopted by the P.A.P. Government have

one  characteristic.  That  is,  they  neglect  the

interests  of  the  people.  Firstly,  the   P.A.P.

Government  is  an  active  promoter  of  Malaysia.

Inevitably  it  will  adopt  a  policy  which  will

sacrifice the interests of the people; secondly, it

is  neglecting the interests of the taxpayers.  The

working class pay most of the taxes but they derive

less benefits. They are the most neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Economic Defence Board, I

want  to point out that not very many workers  will

he protected by this Economic Defence Board and the

protection they get will be very limited indeed and

the  period  is very short. Those workers  who  are

indirectly  affected by the trade  suspension  will

not   be   covered  by  this  measure.  The  P.A.P.

Government  is like a stingy moneylender.  When  it

gives out the dole, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



will  count the money by the cent, and it will  not

be able to give ample protection to the workers who

become jobless. The P.A.P. Government seems  to  be

generous to the small merchants - as though  it  has

become a very generous and charitable ---

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The Member for Tampines, I

he may proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr

Deputy  Speaker. We are a Party which will  protect

the national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



capitalists from the oppression of  foreign

monopoly capitalists. Therefore, only a Party which

is  opposed  to  foreign monopoly  capitalists  can

protect the interests of local capitalists. In  our

present  economic situation we demand that adequate

protection   be   given  to  the   local   national

capitalists. At the same time, we demand  that  the

interests  of the working class should be protected

and  looked  after because they are the people  who

are  the source of our national wealth. It is their

labour and effort which fills our coffers. Any good

government  will have to make use  of  the  revenue

from  the people on the people themselves.  We  are

opposed  to  the P.A.P. attitude which  is  one  of

negligence towards the majority of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not objecting to the transformation of

commercial capital into industrial capital. On  the

contrary,   we   have  many  times   stressed   the

importance  of channelling our trade  capital  into

industrial capital. And we have boldly pointed  out

that   colonialism  is  the  only  obstacle   which

prevents   our   local  commercial   capital   from

investing  in our industrialisation. But our  local

capitalists  will  have  to face  competition  from

foreign capitalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister spoke at great length on our

Four-Year  Development Plan. He boasted  about  the

achievements of the P.A.P. He tried to accuse us by

saying that what we have analysed was wrong.  Today

the  P.A.P. are  in a very difficult  predicament.

They  are  trying to make use of all the  beautiful

phrases  to  fool the people so as to disguise  the

fact that it is the P.A.P. that have brought misery

and  difficulty to the people and so that they will

have some hope in the P.A.P.'s economic policy. But

they will not succeed in their deception.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the gravest problem is still the

unemployment problem. The people will know  whether

the P.A.P.'s policy will help them or not. The Four-Year   Development  Plan  is  not  a  comprehensive

development  plan. It only lays stress  on  capital

build-up and the inducement of foreign capital  for

investment  in Singapore. The Finance  Minister  is

only interested in pleasing foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



capitalists and giving them ample protection at the

expense   of   local   capitalists.   Under    such

circumstances the Four-Year Development  Plan  will

not  be beneficial to the people of Singapore. This

Plan is designed to help foreign capitalists and to

exploit  our  people with public  funds.  The  real

obstacle  to  economic expansion  in  Singapore  is

colonialism.

refrain  as  much as possible from looking  at  his

notes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not find it

necessary to argue with the Member opposite. Let me

now  continue with my speech. It is an  example  of

their   controlling  the  Press   and   suppressing

publications. As long as colonial forces are in our

land,   we  will  not  be  able  to  build  up   an

independent  national economy. We  must  strive  to

build up an independent, free national economy.  If

a  Party  is not anti-colonialist, it will  not  be

able to get rid of foreign economic influence.  But

now  that the Malaysia Plan has been imposed on the

people,  it  is  another phase of  neo-colonialism.

British  capitalists are in control of our economy,

which  under  the  P.A.P. is  one  that  will  only

benefit  foreign  capitalists.  We  should  have  a

national economy. The economic plans of the  P.A.P.

are  in league with foreign capitalists. The  local

merchants  are not being encouraged to be  national

capitalists  but  encouraged to be compradores  and

collaborators   of  foreign  capitalists.   Foreign

capitalists and monopolists have intruded into  our

market,  and  our  market has been dwindling,  thus

affecting  our  national  income  and  the   living

standards of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



people.  The  so-called success  of  the  Four-Year

Development Plan is nothing to be proud of.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only see foreign capital in our land.

There   are  many  who,  connected  with  it,   are

delighted    with    this.   They    shout    about

industrialisation,  never  realising  that  foreign

investment  has  swallowed up local investment  and

local  income.  We  should sigh  at  this  type  of

economic  plans  of  the  Government.  The  present

economic situation in Singapore and its effects  on

the  people are just as one great poet in the  Tang

Dynasty had described - that there are foodstuffs in

the  granary of the rich but they rot due to  over-storage;  while,  on  the  other  hand,  there  are

thousands  dead  on  the  road.  Now,  we  are  the

representatives of the people. We should do  things

in  the  interests of the people and  our  economic

plans  should be those that will meet the  majority

of  the  people and our views should also  be  from

this  angle.  I  would like to  remind  the  P.A.P.

Government that every cent the P.A.P. get  is  from

the  pockets of the people. Take, for instance, our

development  plan.  British  investment  forms  the

capital.  British loans amount to $8.6 million  and

immovable assets amount to $15.3 million,  and  the

surplus   comes  from  the  pockets  of  taxpayers.

Everywhere in the world the situation is like this.

The  P.A.P.  Government gets  the  money  from  the

people and it is spent in the form of public loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his statement told us that the Four-Year Development Plan is almost completed, and it amounts to 79 per cent success. If we include all those plans abandoned and increased, then we can see that the success only amounts to 30 per cent. Let us see the actual

situation.  In the Four-Year Development  Plan  the

provisions  are  for economic development,  $506.08

million,  whereas  actual  expenditure  is  $306.43

million.  It is only 60.5 per cent. Next is  social

development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



amounting  to $351.75 million, whereas  the  actual

expenditure  is $200.4 million, which is  56.9  per

cent. The third is public administration. The  Plan

provides   $13.19   million,   while   the   actual

expenditure is $8.72 million, amounting to 66.1 per

cent. The Finance Minister's success of 79 per cent

is  only  a  hope. The actual success is  60.5  per

cent.  If we want to examine the work of the  Four-Year  Development Plan, then we should compare  the

actual  work  accomplished and the money  spent  in

relation  to  the  provisions  made  therein.   The

Minister   is  trying  to  give  the   people   the

impression  that almost the whole of the  Four-Year

Development Plan has been realised. In actual fact,

the  time  limit  has already  passed  and  yet  in

certain   projects  only  2  per  cent   has   been

accomplished in relation to the Plan. Now  what  is

there   to  brag  about?  The  P.A.P.  Government's

intention  is  that after the end of the  Four-Year

Development Plan, it will be able to provide 40,000

jobs.  But  up  till now how many  jobs  have  been

offered? Not a word was mentioned in the speech  of

the Minister about how many jobs are available. And

yet  he  brags  about the success of the  Four-Year

Development  Plan! Why does he  not  want  to  talk

about  the  percentage of the jobs available  as  a

result  of  this  Four-Year Development  Plan?  The

P.A.P. Government blames the Communist bogey on the

inability  of  the  Four-Year Development  Plan  to

materialise.  Their intention is to  sacrifice  the

interest of the majority of the people in order  to

benefit  the  foreign  monopolists.  That  is   why

whatever  they  do is against the interest  of  the

majority of the people. And it is only natural that

they meet with opposition and criticism everywhere.

out  a  new line. They are good Marxists. They  are

good  Communists. Sir, I have just been  reading  a

book  giving advice to good Communists. "Communists

should learn from their mistakes." They have made a

mistake  which cost them seats, and even  those  of

their  leaders.  In  view of  that,  I  would  have

thought that - three months have passed since the pro-Communist  Barisan Sosialis suffered  a  disastrous

defeat - they would have used these three months  to

adopt  an intelligent policy. In fact, Sir, I  have

people.  It  is  not  Malaysia  which  has  brought

misery.  It  is  confrontation. We  did  not  start

confrontation, but their masters ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Minister  opposite  is  not

respecting the Standing Orders of this House. He is

shouting like a woman, and scolding and pointing to

the  Members  on  this side. He  is  like  a  woman

abusing other people.

detailed study of the financial statement. That  is

why he is talking rubbish.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for four hours

they   have   talked  about  confrontation;   every

argument    comes   back   to   the   success    of

confrontation.  It is interesting,  Sir,  that  the

only  time they have made a speech without a script

is  when the brutal truth is driven home, that they

are spokesmen for foreigners. Therefore, let us not

be   finicky  about  what  these  eight   gentlemen

represent.  Whose  interest are they  representing?

And when they talk about the Budget ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister is now repeating

himself. Can we get on to the Budget?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with due

respect,  though  I have repeated myself  for  five

minutes,  these gentlemen have repeated  themselves

for  the last three days on the same topics  - sell-out  merger,  enforced merger. Now  what  is  their

thesis?  I  think  the Member for Paya  Lebar  - the

Member  for  Sourabaya - said that  the  P.A.P. has

made ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

whether it is in order for me to recapitulate  what

I  have said earlier. I have a feeling that I would

be ruled out of order. Nevertheless, it will not be

out  of order for me to bring the attention of this

House to what the Barisan Sosialis Members - Barisan

Communists  - were saying in regard  to  the  Budget

yesterday and today and what has already been  said

over  Radio  Jakarta a week ago. I  would  like  to

quote to you that these people are echoing the line

laid down by their foreign masters. I refer to  the

Monitoring  Digest  which is  a  publication  which

monitors  radio  stations from many  parts  of  the

world,  including  the country of  their  adoption,

Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far back - but I will not go too far back, Sir

- as  1st  November  of  this year  (it  is  already

December  now),  the  North Kalimantan  (Kalimantan

Utara)  Voice of Freedom Fighters have taken  great

pains  to  convince its listeners that  Indonesia's

confrontation  policy  is having  adverse  economic

effects  on  Singapore, but it said so  with  great

glee. October 21st:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The entrepot trade in Singapore and Penang has

suffered serious setbacks. Godowns have been empty

and  many ships are at present lying idle.  Exports

of   produce  like  copra  and  rattan  have   been

curtailed. Singapore has suffered heavy losses.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what they have been saying for the last

two  or  three days. What has been said over  Radio

Kalimantan Utara over a month ago is being repeated

here  by the Barisan Sosialis Members who claim  to

represent  Singapore. Who gives whom  instructions?

Who  lays  down  the line for their  speeches?  The

electors of Singapore or Kalimantan Utara? It  goes

on to say ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must remind the Minister

that he may make passing references to the speeches

made by Members of the Opposition. In my view,  the

Minister  has  made  sufficient references,  and  I

would  suggest that if he has anything else to  say

he should proceed with the Budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, with due respect, I cannot

make passing references to something which has been

repeated  for  four  hours! The  essence  of  their

argument  is  that  confrontation  is  doing  great

damage  and that therefore Singapore should  go  on

its bended knees to Indonesia to solve the economic

problems. That is the gist of their arguments, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister has already

alleged  that  the  Opposition Members  take  their

orders  from  Jakarta. He has made  that  statement

once, and I think once is more than enough.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must adduce

evidence  that they are repeating a line which  has

been  laid  for  them  and I am  quoting  from  the

broadcasts  of Kalimantan Utara. They  cannot  deny

the validity of this evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report goes on to say,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Singapore Minister for Finance, Dr Goh Keng

Swee, said that because of the trade severance with

Indonesia,  many  factories  using  Indonesian  raw

materials will have to close down. Half the workers

and so on...'



<br><br>Then  again, even earlier on, that is, in November,

Radio Keman Kesatuan Malaya Merdeka again came back

with  a  story entitled "Singapore Suffering  Under

Confrontation".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thesis that has been developed in regard to

the  Budget, the essence of their argument is  that

- I  have been taking down extensive notes - the only

way Singapore can solve its economic problems is by

coming to terms with Indonesia. They do not say  on

what  terms, whether we go down on our bended knees

in  coming  to terms with Indonesia, and  therefore

taking  advantage of the 100 million customers  who

are  waiting  for  us.  In  fact,  the  Member  for

Tampines     suggested    that    prospects     for

industrialisation  are  not  bright,  because  with

confrontation,  the 100 million  Indonesian  market

would  be  lost.  And the whole  essence  of  their

speeches  on  the Budget is to ask that  we  should

abandon  Malaysia and come to terms with  Indonesia

- on any terms - and assure ourselves of a market  of

100 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With due respect to you, Sir, I stress this point

to  show  that we should treat the Barisan Sosialis

for what they are. Their comments on the Budget  or

on any matter are suspect. They are not doing so in

the  interest of the people of Singapore but in the

interest  of their foreign masters, whom they  dare

not  criticise. They criticise the Government which

pays them $500 a month, but they have not said  one

word   against  their  foreign  masters.  Did  they

criticise them, Sir? They say that confrontation is

responsible for all our economic difficulties. Will

they  be responsible for the failure of the  Budget

that our Minister for Finance has drawn up? But did

they   even   once  indicate  whether   they   want

confrontation  to succeed or fail?  They  have  not

answered  that and I hope they will answer  it.  Do

you  want confrontation to succeed or fail?  Please

answer that. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is the crux of the matter,

Sir. All these arguments, these crocodile tears for

the  sufferings  of the workers! Let  them  say  it

here.  If  they have got speeches ready  for  them,

they  can  go and get them corrected. Do they  want

confrontation to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



succeed or fail? We did not start confrontation. We

are  willing to treat and negotiate with  Indonesia

on  reasonable  terms - with any  other  country  on

reasonable   terms  - but  we  as   Malaysians   are

determined  that confrontation or no confrontation,

our  economic policies will succeed. Do the Barisan

Sosialis  want  confrontation to succeed  or  fail?

Answer yes or no. It is simple: yes or no?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister for Culture has

repeated  the  same question three times.  I  think

thrice is more than enough. Can we proceed? I  must

ask  him again to proceed with the Budget statement

and  leave references to the debate coming from the

Opposition alone.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these are

replies to points that have been made by Opposition

Members and I intend to make them because even if I

repeat  it  five  times, I know there  will  be  no

answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must remind the Minister that I

have  made my ruling. Unless the Minister  proceeds

with  further arguments on the Budget, I will  have

no alternative but to ask him to resume his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, I was talking about

the  Budget  and it is within the province  of  any

Assemblymen to reply to points made on  the  Budget

by Opposition Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been talking for four hours on

confrontation - an essential point with  which  they

have  been trying to confuse the people - and it  is

necessary  for me in the interests of  the  country

and  of this Assembly to expose their arguments and

to  indicate  the  purpose behind the  long  dreary

rubbish  that has been propounded in this  Assembly

for the last four days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has in his Budget

speech sketched out the main features of this fifth

Budget presented by the P.A.P. Government. Before I

make further comments on the observations that  the

so-called   representatives  of   the   people   of

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



opposite  have been making on the Budget,  I  would

like  to say something about the basic beliefs  and

outlook of the Government which has presented  this

Budget.  After  all,  a  Budget  and  the  economic

policies must reflect the character and aspirations

of  the Government and the Party which shapes  that

Budget. A government of crooks will shape a  Budget

to  promote the interest of crooks. A government of

capitalists  will  naturally  devise  a  Budget  to

protect and advance the interests of capitalists. A

government  consisting of men  out  for  loot  will

shape a Budget to make such things possible. And  a

government  composed of eminent  Members  like  the

Barisan Sosialis will definitely shape a Budget  to

sell out the country to their masters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government consists of men who believe

in  a  socialist  ideology. Sir, when  we  talk  of

socialism,  we  do not put inverted commas  as  the

Barisan  Sosialis  opposite do.  When  we  talk  of

socialism, we mean non-Communist socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the last few days they have been talking about the Communist bogey. I will not venture into a new line of argument - I will reserve that for Monday - about the so-called Communist bogey. But we are a socialist Government and both as individuals and as members of a

political Party we are therefore neither creatures,

spokesmen  or  servile nominees of  big  capitalist

concerns nor, at the other extreme like the Barisan

Sosialis,  puppets  of  Communist  manipulators  or

political pimps for Indonesian confrontationists.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister is now using

unparliamentary language.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, but "political pimps" has a

different connotation.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In my opinion, the word "pimps" in

any context would be unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> May I use the words "political

purveyors of flesh"?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, we are a political Party

whose  loyalty is to the people of this country  - a

country  which  we  took  a  solemn  oath  at   the

beginning of this Session together with the Barisan

Sosialis  Assemblymen to defend. We took  a  solemn

oath and we pay great regard to any oath we take. I

cannot  say the same thing for the Barisan Sosialis

Assemblymen. Therefore, the strength and welfare of

our  Party  lies in our being able  to  ensure  the

maximum  happiness for the maximum  number  of  our

people.  We  are not, as I have said, tied  to  any

capitalist or reactionary group. We do not have  to

serve their interest at the expense of the majority

of  the people. Moreover, we are not bound, as  the

Communists are - as the Barisan are - to deliberately

spread  poverty, discontent and economic  chaos  in

order to pave the way for a Communist revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the P.A.P. is a patriotic Malaysian Party

tied   to  no  privileged  minority  interest,   or

predatory alien forces, or enemies of our  country,

we  can  therefore afford to devise a Budget  which

will  not only make the country prosperous but will

ensure  at  the  same time that this prosperity  is

fairly and justly distributed among all classes  of

people.  We can afford to ensure that our  economic

and  financial policies are such that  inequalities

of  wealth  are  evened  out without  throwing  our

economy into chaos.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1959 when the P.A.P. Government assumed

power,  its  economic policy, as  revealed  in  its

Budgets,  has been directed towards two objectives.

And in this connection, Sir, may I say to the eight

representatives ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Seven.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Seven. Yes, Sir, there is some

mystery  about the eighth man just like  The  Third

Man.  Probably,  Sir, he is a wiser  man  than  the

seven men who hold the fort here. But anyway before

they come out with further badly-written scripts, I

would  suggest that they refer to the  speeches  of

their  Chairman, the present Chairman, in the first

Budget Session of this Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



And   some   of  their  present  Barisan   Sosialis

colleagues,  whether above ground  or  underground,

whether   in  this  country  or  in  their  adopted

homeland,  had  different  ideas  then  about   our

Budget.  At  that  time in 1959, they  praised  our

economic  policy,  the policy of the  Minister  for

Finance,  whom  they now regard as reactionary.  At

that  time, they said that it was a good  socialist

Budget,  good  for the people and the  best  Budget

that  we ever had. That was in 1959, the Budget  of

the  same Finance Minister. Only those who said  it

then  do not now belong to the same Party,  do  not

hold  office and they are not in this Chamber. They

said  that  because at that time the speeches  were

written from this side of the House. At that  time,

Sir, some of the Barisan Assemblymen knew that this

Government  in  fashioning  the  Budget   was   not

identified with any capitalist or foreign interest,

but  with  the interest of the people,  because  we

have  no  other affiliations. So in fashioning  our

Budget  we have two objectives, and that  is  quite

clear even in the present Budget speech made by the

Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of this is to plan for our future needs

to   meet   not  only  the  demands  of  a  rapidly

increasing population for jobs but also  to  change

the  character  of  an  economy  from  a  primarily

trading  one to an industrial one. I do  not  think

even  the Barisan Communists can complain that that

is  a  bad  objective. However, to do  this,  means

spending  some of our resources not by  doling  out

free  gifts  and thus enjoying temporary popularity

but in investing them in development projects which

would  ensure  that in the future our children  and

our population will be able to enjoy a decent life.

Were  the  P.A.P. a Government of opportunists,  a

Government  of  men  concerned  with  only  keeping

themselves in power for the next few years, then it

could  have  bought popularity by doling  out  such

money  and reserves as we have in free gifts.  Just

as the Member for Tampines said, "Oh, why not give

free  houses? Increase this and increase that."  We

could  do that. It is not our money. We could  have

an election immediately



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



after  that to ensure that not one Barisan Sosialis

is returned. We could even double everybody's wages

and possibly even increase the ration allowance  in

Changi. We could do that to be popular. It  is  not

our  money. We have plenty of money in reserve.  We

could  even  give  every married couple  a  scooter

free.  That  is what many of their speeches  amount

to.  "Oh, why do you not give more of this? Why not

more  of  that?"  We  can  do  it  if  we  are   an

irresponsible and a stupid government. But  we  are

not  an irresponsible or a stupid government.  Some

of   the   suggestions   put   forward   - so-called

constructive criticisms of the Budget - by  some  of

the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen amount to, "Have a

big  carnival  for  two years.  Free  booze.  Enjoy

yourselves. Lots of money in the kitty."  But  what

happens after that when the party is over? But as I

have  said, this is a deliberate policy. Let us  be

frank  about  it. The Barisan Sosialis for  obvious

reasons   are   not  interested   in   ensuring   a

prosperous, peaceful and happy Malaysia because  if

there is a prosperous, peaceful and happy Malaysia,

then  they are out. They have a vested interest  in

poverty  and disease - as the instruments  of  alien

powers  out  to destroy Singapore. It  is  logical,

Sir, as I shall show you later on. But for the time

being,  let  us  return  to  this.  We  could  have

followed  the  course  followed  in  certain  Asian

countries  which the Gentlemen opposite admire  and

on whose behalf they are fighting in this Assembly.

Fortunately, we have not got a Minister for Finance

of that calibre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in the Monitoring Digest of 7th December.

The  country which they admire and on whose  behalf

they  are  working - here is their economic  policy:

Subandrio  purposely  neglected  economy  to   gain

national identity. Is that the policy they want  to

follow?  Have you to impoverish your own population

so  that  you  can claim national identity?  He  is

their  pinup  boy, their hero. Is that  the  policy

they  want us to follow? Is that the policy of  the

Barisan  Sosialis which they want us to follow?  Is

that  what they are working for - to ensure that  it

will come about in Singapore?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



The   Foreign  Minister  said  that  in  the   past

Indonesia had to neglect her economy purposely - not

accidentally,  not by ignorance, not by  stupidity,

but purposely, because she wanted to regain her own

identity first for further development. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Some people might find it ridiculous that

Indonesia  gave  priority to  the  revival  of  her

identity and not to economic development. But after

we  have managed to revive our own identity,  after

the  iron spirit of the Indonesian people has  been

revived,  we can then establish in full  swing  the

economic  rehabilitation and  exploitation  of  our

wealth and resources.'



<br><br>Sir,  we are not interested in the kind of economic

policies followed in the country of their adoption.

In  Singapore,  we  do it differently.  We  do  not

believe  that  it is necessary to revive  the  iron

spirit  of  our people by depriving them  of  their

necessities  of  life. And in this  Budget  we  - at

least  the  P.A.P. Government; I do not know  about

the  Barisan  Sosialis  - prefer  to  stick  to  the

somewhat  old-fashioned thesis that it is the  duty

of  a  democratic socialist government to  increase

the  living standard of the people first, not  only

for  the  people today but also for those who  come

after us. Therefore, investing for the future means

not  consuming  and frittering away all  our  money

today. We have to balance between improving the lot

of  the  people  today  as well  as  investing  and

building  for the future. With due modesty,  I  can

say  that  we have managed since 1959 to  hold  the

balance   between  what  is  necessary   to   spend

immediately and what is necessary to invest for the

future. We have avoided falling into either extreme

in  this respect. We could follow the Communist and

other  totalitarian methods of developing a country

quickly.  We  could  force  savings  by  compelling

people to make do with the barest minimum necessary

to  keep body and soul together. That is one way of

doing  it, at least for the mass of the people.  We

could,   if   we   adopted  Communist  totalitarian

methods,  even  kill off a few  million  people  by

providing them with a starvation living standard. I

think  the  Barisan Sosialis Members opposite  know

what I am referring to. Many of them,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



I  am  quite  sure,  would  consider  it  barbaric,

inhuman and undemocratic if they were forced to  go

to countries which they otherwise proclaim to be  a

workers'   paradise.  I  had   the   privilege   of

occasionally  listening to other  Barisan  Sosialis

Members - stalwarts - "great supporters of socialism"

extolling  and  praising  with  delight  the  great

things  that  are  being achieved in  the  workers'

paradise.  But  these discussions  invariably  took

place  in  the most fashionable and expensive  bars

and  restaurants in Singapore where they give  tips

which can feed a family in a workers' paradise  for

at least a week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we the P.A.P. Government - a socialist

Government, without inverted commas - have  in  this

and  other  Budgets provided for future development

without  at  the  same  time  reducing  the  living

standards of our people. On the contrary, Sir,  the

Finance Minister provided statistics in his  Budget

speech  to  show that, despite the efforts  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis Communists to wreck  our  economy

through     politically    motivated     industrial

intimidation and unrest and despite the hundreds of

millions  of dollars that the Government has  spent

on  development  projects, there  has  nevertheless

been  at the same time since 1959 - and particularly

during   the   last  three  years  - an  appreciable

increase  in  the overall living standards  of  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, lest they may think that this is a partisan

claim  -  a Government Minister boasting about  his

own  Government  - may  I therefore  quote  from  an

impartial observer? Sir, this is an extract from an

article  published  by  the  Far  Eastern  Economic

Review of 18th July, 1963, and before they jump  to

the  conclusion that it is a neo-colonial magazine,

let  me  say  that  this is a Hong  Kong  magazine,

published  in Hong Kong and edited by  Asians.  And

this  is  what they have to say after referring  to

the  P.A.P. as  one  of  the  most  efficient  and

energetic governments in the world today. They  say

that  after  all the money that we  have  spent  on

housing  development and so on, the rice bowls  and

restaurants and coffee-shops



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



are  full,  cinemas  are packed,  taxi-drivers  and

hawkers  are  kept  busy and hair-dressing  saloons

report  record business. Sir, these are not  to  be

found  in  a  workers' paradise where I  understand

hair-dressers are not even in business,  let  alone

report record business. Last year's statistics show

that  the  number of people who can afford  to  buy

luxuries - luxuries, not necessities - grew steadily.

80  per  cent more motor-cars were sold in 1962;  6

per  cent  more  refrigerators,  8  per  cent  more

radios,  27  per cent more cameras and 7  per  cent

more  liquor.  Private builders after  three  timid

years   now  have  about  4,000  apartments   under

construction.   Dealers   have   been    pleasantly

surprised  at the great demand for T.V. sets  since

the  introduction of T.V. broadcasting a few months

ago;  and  they are quite clear as to the cause  of

this  affluence. Government expenditure in planning

is  directly and indirectly responsible for many of

these   signs  of  modest  prosperity  and  growing

economic confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a far cry from their pinup boy who

says that one good sign of a progressive society is

to  ensure  deliberately that no development  takes

place. And it is on behalf of people with that idea

that they are working for. Sir, we in Singapore, as

I  have said, believe otherwise. The Government has

spent more than $500 million on projects during the

past   three  years  without,  at  the  same  time,

reducing  our living standard to poverty level  but

instead  increasing it. This was achieved, and  the

well-fed  Barisan  Sosialis Members  opposite  know

this  despite  the increase of our population  from

1.58  million to 1.73 million during the past three

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not for one moment suggesting that we

have created during the last three or four years  a

society  where there is no poverty or  unemployment

or  gross inequalities. These evils exist, but what

we  claim is that during the past few years we have

not   only   prevented  poverty  and  misery   from

extending,  as  it  has  in the  country  of  their

adoption,  but we have succeeded to an  appreciable

extent in ironing out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



gross inequalities and economic injustices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis Communists may complain

that  the P.A.P. Government has failed to create  a

Utopia  in the short space of three or four  years,

but  what  should  be obvious to everyone  is  that

notwithstanding       economic       confrontation,

notwithstanding      the     Barisan      Sosialis,

notwithstanding Communist attempts to  disrupt  our

economy during the past three years, the P.A.P. has

laid  the  foundation  for an  economy  which  will

ensure better prospects and rising living standards

not  only  for our present population but also  for

future generations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Sir, and even the Barisan

Sosialis  cannot  help  but  notice,  that  in  the

present   Budget  something  like   two-thirds   of

Government revenue will be spent on social services

like schools, clinics, and hospitals to provide for

the  immediate  needs of the people.  There  is  no

other  country  in Asia - workers' paradise  or  not

- and  certainly  in  South-East Asia,  where  every

child  can  find a place in school, where  ordinary

people  can get cheap and healthy homes  and  where

the  sick  get  free  treatment  in  Government-run

hospitals.  And the P.A.P. can afford to  follow  a

progressive economic policy, because unlike certain

Right-wing  Parties which are  no  longer  in  this

Assembly, and unlike the Barisan Sosialis which  is

represented by a rump in this Assembly, we are  not

the  creatures  of a privileged minority  or  alien

forces  dedicated to the destruction of our country

and  our  people. And this brings me to the various

observations made by the Barisan Sosialis  speakers

like, "Oh, this Budget is not doing enough for  the

poor people and for the suffering workers." That is

the  theme  of their speeches. They shed  crocodile

tears.  Suffering  people! The  workers!  The  same

Party which threw 1,700 people out of job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 1,800!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> 1,800 out of job. The same people

come here to moan and groan about the sufferings of

the  workers and the unemployed. It is their  union

leaders,  Mr  Woodhull has already confessed,  who

mucked things.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



Now  they come here and say. "We shed tears for the

sufferings of the people and the workers."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask the Barisan Sosialis a very simple but

a   very  important  question.  We  have  a  vested

interest  for  the  reasons I  have  explained  - to

ensure  that we run our government in  such  a  way

that  people are prosperous and get more jobs,  and

our economy succeeds. But have the Barisan Sosialis

a  vested  interest,  a real genuine  interest,  in

ensuring a prosperous and happy people? That  is  a

very  important question, Sir. Have they  a  vested

interest in ensuring a prosperous Malaysia?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my submission, Sir, that the Barisan

Sosialis,  by  the  very nature  of  its  political

character  and its political objective, which  they

have  openly  proclaimed,  must  fight  not  for  a

prosperous  Malaysia but for a  bankrupt  Malaysia,

because  they  must  destroy  Malaysia.  They   are

committed to destroying Malaysia. They say they are

against  Malaysia. Do they expect us  seriously  to

believe  that they are going to work very  hard  to

ensure  a  prosperous and happy Malaysia? Are  they

going  to work for a prosperous and happy Malaysia?

If  they do, they cannot destroy Malaysia. It  will

survive,  and  become stronger. So,  how  can  they

genuinely  work  for the prosperity  of  Singapore,

because  to  do  that is to destroy themselves,  to

destroy their own objective, which is to finish off

Malaysia on behalf of foreign powers. That is  what

they  have already proclaimed openly. That is their

objective. So how can they then really work to make

the  workers  happier? Because if the  workers  are

happier,   they  will  not  support   the   Barisan

Sosialis, they will support the P.A.P. If  Malaysia

prospers, they will not listen to the anti-Malaysia

line, they will support Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, the fact that the Barisan Sosialis

are really out to destroy Malaysia is indicated  by

a  remark  that  one of the hon.  Members  opposite

made.  He said, in connection with the $118 million

that we pay for Federal services in Singapore,  $78

million  is for local services and $40 million  for

defence  which, he said, is to oppress the  people.

Oppress the people!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



It  is  quite  clear that they  do  not  want

Malaysia to be defended against their masters. They

take great objection to our spending $40 million to

protect  our own country when the country of  their

adoption  boasts of 400,000 men - more money  spent

on  their  army than on their people. And  here  we

spend  a  modest sum of $40 million to protect  our

fishermen who get robbed by their friends - not  our

friends!  They  steal  watches  and  we  spend  $40

million  to  ensure  that our poor  fishermen,  our

people,  can  keep  their  fish,  can  keep   their

vessels.  But  they  do not want  that.  They  say,

"Scrap this $40 million. Leave it open." Then there

can  be piracy in Singapore itself. A chap can come

right up to this Chamber, Sir, and our watches  are

gone!  That  is what they want. That  is  why  they

object  to defence. That is why they ask  that  the

Naval  Base be scrapped. Are they going  to  defend

Singapore for us? Are these gentlemen going to take

out rifles and stop 400,000 men? Did they volunteer

even for West Irian? Probably some of the gentlemen

did.  The  only country which they are prepared  to

defend is West Irian. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have warned the Minister

previously  not  to make references  to  individual

Members  of this Assembly. I hope I do not have  to

remind him again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I made no references to any

of the Members here individually or collectively. I

was  referring to the Barisan Sosialis which is  an

amorphous body, whose antecedents we are not  quite

sure  of,  but  which we intend to  expose  in  the

course of these Assembly proceedings.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister previously spoke of the

Barisan. I am quite prepared to allow him  to  talk

of  a  Party. I am quite prepared to allow him  to

make  references to some of the Opposition Members.

But  I am not prepared to allow him to refer to all

the  Opposition Members. When he refers to all,  he

is  referring to each and every one.  There  is  no

distinction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, thank you for your

very  pertinent ruling, because there is  only  one

other  Opposition Member whom I might exclude  from

my  reference  to Opposition Members.  Sir,  it  is

necessary,  as  I have said, to ask this  question:

"Have  the  Barisan Sosialis in their own interests

as a Party a vested interest in seeing a prosperous

Malaysia,  a  prosperous  Singapore?  A  prosperous

working class, everybody happy?" Do they know  that

if  they  do  that, they will commit  suicide?  And

therefore  they must actively work to  ensure  more

poverty, more disease, more fruitful soil for their

way of life, for Communism, for confrontation. They

are  praying and hoping - they never deny  it  - that

confrontation  succeeds. Why? I  understand  a  few

days  ago  they  even  claimed  credit  for  having

initiated  the confrontation policy, and  that  the

100 million people in Indonesia just followed them.

Well,  that  is a good admission. It  is  in  their

Party  paper.  They are proud of it. They  have  to

publish   in  their  Party  paper  that  they   are

responsible  for confrontation, which  is  throwing

our people out of job. And yet earlier - I think  it

was  the Member for Tampines - he was shedding tears

about  the sufferings of the tongkang men,  of  the

national capitalists whom he has helped to ruin. He

and  his Party. They claimed that they started this

confrontation. They said so. They had the  idea  of

confrontation,  and  the  100  million  people   of

Indonesia  said,  "Dr Lee  Siew  Choh  and  the  8

Barisan    Sosialis    Assemblymen    have     said

confrontation  is a good thing. So we  will  follow

them.   We   will  support  them."   So   it   only

substantiates our thesis that the Barisan  Sosialis

is  dedicated to destroying our economy, our  plans

to  improve the welfare of the people, because they

want  poverty and chaos in Singapore, so that their

confrontation  friends can move in.  They  are  not

representatives   of  the  various  constituencies.

Maybe  they come from - I am told. Sir, there  is  a

place  called  `Suka Boomi', where the  Chinese  in

Indonesia   were   slaughtered.  Maybe   they   are

representatives of that constituency. Suka Boomi!



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister is not only

making personal remarks again.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



but  he  is becoming more and more repetitious.  He

has  on  several occasions referred to hon. Members

taking orders from a foreign country. That has been

repeated time and time again by him. Can I ask  him

to get on to something new?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, there is another reason why

they  must  ensure  an  economically  crippled,  an

economically   bankrupt   Singapore.   Those    who

manipulate  the  Barisan  Sosialis  we   know   are

Communists. Mr Woodhull has said so, Mr Lim  Shee

Ping  has  admitted it. Mr James  Puthucheary  has

admitted  it.  They do not talk about bogeys.  They

have  written  down in their statements  that  they

- the  Barisan  Sosialis  - are  manipulated  by  the

Communists. And the Communists cannot help the P.A.P.

or  any other non-Communist Government to establish

a  prosperous  and  happy  Malaysia  or  Singapore.

Because   then   nobody  would  follow   Communism.

Therefore, they must bring about poverty and  chaos

to  prepare the way for their revolutionary scheme,

for  the  triumph of Communism. For these  reasons,

Sir,  all  this talk about the Budget not  being  a

good  Budget, not a Budget that will help Singapore

to be prosperous. I say, is all a lot of hypocrisy.

It is not what they have in their hearts. What they

want  is  a  Budget  which  will  help  to  destroy

Singapore economically so that there will  be  mass

unemployment. Then they can tell the people. "There

you are. Only the Communist way can offer you a way

out.  Not  the non-Communist way, not the socialist

way."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I would like to say that

the  Barisan  Sosialis  is not  interested  in  the

Budget. They are not interested in a good Budget, a

Budget  that helps the people. They want to  ensure

how  to  help  frustrate us  realise  our  economic

ambition.  And secondly, as a Communist Party,  and

on  admission  of  the Communist  thesis  - treason,

betraying their own country, is a necessary part of

their strategy, and I quote from a Communist tract:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is necessary, in the class struggle, for one

to deal a blow against one's own government.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



A  blow  to  one's own government in wartime  means

high  treason, it means facilitating the defeat  of

one's  own  country. And that is what  the  Barisan

Sosialis,   manipulated  by  the  Communists,   are

dedicated  to - the  defeat  of  their  own  country

economically  and  politically.  And  in  all  this

criticism  of  the  Budget  they  are  a  party  of

treason,   as  good  Communists  should  be.   Good

Communists must betray their country.

the betrayal of their own country - not of their own

accord,   but   by   those  who  manipulate   them.

Therefore,  Sir, let us not be under  any  delusion

that the Barisan Sosialis is a Party of Malaysia or

a Party of the workers of Singapore or Malaysia. It

is a Party of treason.

radio and the Press. He should not suppress what we

have  said.  He has said just now that in  all  our

speeches during the Budget debate we have taken the

cue from the broadcasts from North Kalimantan Radio -

since  the  radio has announced that  confrontation

has  brought about suffering to Singapore and since

North  Kalimantan  Radio has been broadcasting  the

same  thing as we have said here, therefore we have

taken the cue from it and have echoed its opinions.

Since the Minister for Culture has just returned to

Singapore  by  plane, he has perhaps  neglected  to

read the speech of his colleague, the Minister  for

Finance,  in  which  the  Minister  has  said  that

Indonesian  confrontation  will  bring  about  very

serious  consequences and far-reaching  effects  on

Singapore's economy. Does he say that the  Minister

is  also  echoing  the  views of  North  Kalimantan

Radio?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of who has brought about these

sufferings,  the P.A.P. has been accusing  us.  But

who  are  the  real traitors, and who have  brought

about  these sufferings? It is the P.A.P. who  have

sold  out the interests of the people, and who have

forced  through the phoney merger resulting in  the

people  of Singapore suffering all this. As to  who

are  patriotic to the country, we ask: by  whom  is

the  nation formed? By the oligarchy of the  P.A.P.

or by the people as a whole? If a country is formed

by  the people generally, then the interests of the

people should be held above almost everything else.

The  people  are now suffering because  the  P.A.P.

have  sold out the interests of the people  to  the

British imperialists. All along we have been on the

side  of  the  people. We have been suppressed  and

interfered  with, but we are not  afraid  of  these

actions taken by them. We are willing to be gaoled.

Now,  the  facts are clear showing who are speaking

on behalf of the people and taking their stand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, in this House, on the question of

confrontation which has brought economic  suffering

to   the   people,  we  suggest  that  the   P.A.P.

Government should be responsible for initiating and

persuading  Indonesia to negotiate.  We  are  fully

aware  that  without our advancing this suggestion,

the   P.A.P.,  since  they  are  with  the  British

imperialists, will be donning Communist caps on us ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> remained standing.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, the Member will not allow you,

Mr Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We are fully

aware  that when we make this suggestion on  behalf

of  the people, we know that the P.A.P. who are  on

the  side of the imperialists and who have sold out

the   interests  of  the  people   will   call   us

Communists, but we are not afraid of them or  their

accusations  and smears, because we  do  all  these

things sincerely and faithfully on the side of  the

people.  We are not out to create trouble from  any

evil  source.  Since we want peace and  prosperity,

that is why we have made such a proposition to  the

P.A.P. Government. We are not so belligerent as the

P.A.P.,  saying that only by arming  can  we  bring

about  prosperity.  We  do  not  believe  that  the

P.A.P.'s   belligerence  will   bring   peace   and

prosperity.  We  have already declared  our  policy

very clearly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the financial speech of the Minister for

Finance  on  the Four-Year Development Plan  during

these  four  years, the Minister quoted  a  lot  of

figures.  He  said  that economic  development  has

accomplished 79 per cent, social development 76 per

cent, and administrative projects about 79 per cent

and  so  on and so forth, as though it would appear

that  there are really great achievements. But what

are  the facts? Whenever we do a thing, we must see

that  it  produces results. We should not just  say

that we have spent so much without any result.  The

Government,  like  one who is responsible  for  the

expenditure of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



household,  should be aware of this. It should  see

that  when it spends one hundred dollars, it should

get   the  value  of  what  it  has  spent.  If   a

housekeeper spends about 80 per cent, it  does  not

mean  that  he  is  good.  He  must  see  that  the

livelihood  of the members of the family  could  be

maintained  by the worth of 80 per cent spent.  If,

on  the contrary, the result is different, then the

householder should be condemned for the foolish act

of  spending  money without getting its  worth.  Of

course,   the  P.A.P. have  always  been  praising

themselves.  The P.A.P. have always  been  praising

the P.A.P. That is why the Minister for Culture has

praised  the  Minister for Finance. Of course,  the

Minister  for Finance can claim himself  to  be  an

economist, as though to make people believe that he

is   a  far-sighted  economist  and  a  far-sighted

Minister  for Finance. But we would ask,  what  are

the  results of the Four-Year Development Plan? Has

it  brought  good  results to the people?  Has  the

livelihood  of  the people been improved?  To  what

extent   has   the   unemployment  situation   been

improved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1961 the Government put up the Four-Year Development Plan. At that time they said that the main purpose of the Plan was to encourage private investment to create more employment opportunities. If there were a high rate of industrialisation, then you would be able to

absorb  $600  million  worth  of  investment,  they

claimed.  Thus  you would be able  to  provide  new

employment opportunities for about 30,000 to 40,000

people.  I  would  like  to ask  the  Minister  for

Finance this: how much private investment up to now

have  the  Government attracted? What  is  the  sum

total? How many jobs have the Government been  able

to  afford  to  those unemployed youths?  A  little

while  ago  the  Minister for Culture  has  himself

admitted  that  there is poverty, unemployment  and

economic  depression in, Singapore. We  would  ask,

during the P.A.P. four-year rule whether the number

of  unemployed  people has increased or  decreased.

The   P.A.P. has  all  along  been  putting   out

propaganda.  Now,  if  the Government  have  really

achieved any results in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



field,  how  is it that they dare not  publish  the

figures?  In this Budget statement we can only  see

the number of buildings, factories and houses built

- how  many acres of land have been allotted and  so

on. During these four years we can only see figures

relating to these few things. Since we see  in  the

newspapers that certain factories have already been

in  operation for such a long time, now,  how  many

people  have  been employed in these factories  and

how  good  is  our economy? Since my colleague  has

spoken on many other things, I would not like to go

further  into  them. The facts are  before  us.  No

matter  how the P.A.P. try to claim that they  want

to  attract  foreign investment,  in  actual  fact,

there  is no such result as claimed by them. It  is

not their so-called 80 per cent performance; it  is

not  their  so-called 80 per cent figure  that  can

cover the truth of the matter. If we compare actual

results, we know that the Government have in  three

years completed only a superficial 59 per cent, and

three-quarters of the time has been spent. Yet  the

achievement is only 59 per cent. Then how can  they

claim this to be a success? The Government not only

have  not  resolved the unemployment situation  but

they, on the other hand, have been unable to fulfil

their  responsibilities and duties  in  respect  of

rural  development,  building of  roads  and  other

necessary work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have talked about helping farmers

and  fishermen in the rural areas to increase their

production   and   teaching  them   techniques   in

agriculture and fishing and reducing their costs of

production.   I  would  like  to  ask,   how   much

productivity have the Government increased  and  to

what extent has the cost been reduced? There are no

concrete figures to show all this. I would like  to

ask  the Government to give the actual figures. The

livelihood of the fishermen and the farmers is  day

by  day  going  down the drain. Some of  them  have

advanced  requests which are very  reasonable,  but

the  Government are not only not willing to  accept

their  suggestions and views but they  also  ignore

them  totally. For instance, fishermen and  farmers

in Jurong have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



advanced certain suggestions to the Government with

a  view  to helping them out of their difficulties.

But  have the Government done anything? Again  some

villagers  in  the  rural  areas  live  on  poultry

farming  and vegetable gardening. In these  places,

due  to  the long period of drought, the  villagers

cannot  get  enough water to wash the  poultry  and

animals and there is not enough water to water  the

vegetable  farms.  As a result, they  suffer  great

losses.  But  have  the  Government  so  far   done

anything  to provide water to these farmers?  There

has  not  been  an  increase in the  standpipes  to

benefit the farmers. Can the Government boast about

their   achievements  in  this  aspect   of   rural

development? The Ministers in the P.A.P. can  only

stay  in  their  air-conditioned  rooms.  They  are

unable to appreciate the difficulties and hardships

of  the  farmers  outside.  That  is  why  in  this

statement they can only boast about 7 per  cent  of

performance,  and  no  more  than  that,  in  rural

development.   Insofar  as  rural  development   is

concerned,  the Government have therefore  achieved

practically nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Government have been giving a great

deal  of  publicity  in the fields  of  health  and

education  to  the extent of 20  and  40  per  cent

respectively, what have they done in respect of the

Singapore River? They have done up to only 2.9  per

cent  according to them. In the building of bridges

and  construction of roads, they have only achieved

a  20  per cent performance. That is all they  have

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing they can boast about is housing

development.   They   say   that   their    housing

development is the best and the highest  in  South-East  Asia. They have done 119 per cent. We do  not

go  against the building of houses but our point is

- you may have a lot of houses built, but there  are

a  lot of poor people who cannot afford to pay  the

rent. The houses should be for the poor people.  As

a  matter  of  fact, it is the Government  who  are

reaping  a big harvest from the building of  houses

instead of the people enjoying the benefit of  more

housing.  So the Government instead of going  ahead

with full force with the building of houses, should

spend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



money  in  other respects to improve the livelihood

of  the people in general. All that they can  boast

about now is housing and nothing more; but even  in

this respect they have not benefited the people  in

fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also see that their Development Budget for

next year has only been allocated $16 million,  but

in   1963  the  Development  Estimates  were   $230

million.  Now,  how is it that  there  is  a  great

difference  between  1963  and  1964?   Well,   the

Government's  explanation  perhaps  is  that   some

departments  in Singapore have been taken  over  by

the  Central Government and the rest of it. But  in

spite of the transfer of certain departments to the

Central  Government,  in  any  event,  they  cannot

explain  the fact that the estimate for  next  year

constitutes one-fifteenth of the estimate for  this

year.  From  this, we can see that  in  future  the

people of Singapore will only be able to enjoy very

much  less rights and privileges than they  did  in

the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the total of $310 million in our

Estimates for next year, the figure of $30  million

for expenditure for Federal departments and the sum

of  $16 million for Development Estimates, then all

that  the people of Singapore will enjoy next  year

in  respect  of services and rights  will  only  be

about  $360  million. If the Development  Estimates

for this year are properly and fully utilised, then

in the course of this year, the people of Singapore

would  have been able to enjoy rights and  services

amounting to $600 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we compare the enjoyment of rights and

services this year with that of next year, what  is

the  difference? It is more than $240 million.  But

what  about  the burden to be borne by the  people?

Next  year,  the total burden to be  borne  by  the

taxpayers in Singapore will amount to $440 million.

That  is to say, if we find the sum of $150 million

in  respect  of State revenue, 60 per cent  of  the

national  revenue (i.e., $170 million) and  40  per

cent of the national revenue, we will get the total

of $440



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



million. This will be the total burden to be  borne

by  the  taxpayers in Singapore next year. What  is

their  burden this year? Well, it is $450  million.

So  there  is  not  much difference  between  those

figures.  But  what  a  great difference  there  is

between what we have enjoyed this year and what  we

shall  enjoy next year! Why? I believe the Minister

for  Finance  himself only knows it too  well!  And

this is the so-called prosperity that Malaysia  has

brought about!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from having to contribute $170 million per

year  to the Federation and Sarawak, the people  of

Singapore have to endure hardship brought about  by

the  economic  confrontation. The trade  depression

has  resulted in further unemployment. The  vicious

circle  goes  on. And, as admitted by the  Minister

for   Finance   himself,   the   repercussions   of

confrontation  are wide and far-reaching.  But  our

present  Government  dare  not  face  up  to  their

responsibility. Instead, they shift the blame on to

the  Barisan Sosialis. On the other hand, they shed

crocodile  tears as if they really care  for  those

workers and merchants affected by confrontation. We

have said before that what we have done in the past

can bear examination by the people. We have a clear

conscience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. must not hope that the failure of the

M.C.A. will help them in the future. They must face

realities  and try to solve our economic  problems.

The Minister for Finance says that the only way  to

get  out  of our present economic depression  as  a

result of Indonesia's confrontation is to give  the

workers  affected  some sort  of  training  and  to

channel  the  trade capital into industrialisation.

These  are  only make-shift measures.  They  cannot

fundamentally solve our problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see how the Government are going to help

those   workers  who  are  affected  by  the  trade

suspension.  How  much money  have  the  Government

provided  to  the Economic Defence Board,  and  how

much  money have they provided for the building  of

community centres? Which one is more important  - to

protect the interests of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



the P.A.P. or to protect the so-called training  of

workers  who  are affected by the trade suspension?

The  present unemployment problem is serious enough

and  many more people will be retrenched.  How  are

the  Government to find alternative employment  for

those  people  who are going to be retrenched?  The

Government say that they want to help the merchants

to channel their capital into other industries, but

we  must remind them that during the course of this

channelling  and transformation the merchants  will

incur  losses, and even after they have  channelled

their capital into industries, will they be able to

maintain their industries? The Government hope  for

success  in  industrialisation because  they  place

high  hopes on the Common Market. Well, success  in

industrialisation is still very remote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what will become of the Common Market? It is

a  big  question.  Under the  Malaysia  Agreement,

Singapore's fiscal and financial control  has  been

taken  over  by  the  Central Government  and  many

things  will  have to be approved  by  the  Central

Government,   such   as  the   issue   of   Pioneer

Certificates; and the Central Government will  have

the  right to unify and control taxes and  tariffs.

One  of  our  colleagues has just now talked  about

this and about competition in the same market; that

is another problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter if they say that the market is very

much related to the power of consumption. Just look

at  the  market of Indonesia's one hundred  million

people!  What  will  be the future  of  Singapore's

market  of ten million people? The outlook is  very

bleak  indeed.  Blakang  Mati  perhaps  alone  will

become the so-called free trade zone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget should have been drafted six months ago - perhaps it was drafted at that time. At that time, there was no confrontation, but now there is confrontation. How can the situation be as what is described in the Budget? If the future income is less than what is

stated  in the Budget, what will the Government  do

then? If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



the  future  revenue and expenditure are  different

from  what  the Budget envisages, what will  happen

then?  The Government should try to negotiate  with

Indonesia in order to resolve this problem. We hope

that  the  P.A.P. will not act as  agents  for  the

British   imperialists.  They  should   truly   and

faithfully,  on behalf of the people of  Singapore,

try to resolve the existing difficulties.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr Speaker, at today's sitting we are debating the

Budget statement for the year 1964. In debating the 1964 Budget, we as Members of this Assembly and elected by the people ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Standing Orders require that there should

be at least one-third of the Members present before

we proceed. It appears that there is no quorum now.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang:</b> Thirteen.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think there are 13. Do you want me

to  count?  There  are exactly 13  Members  at  the

moment. Please proceed, Inche Awang.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): It is always the

case  with the Opposition - just as I want to  speak

on the Budget, there is an interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said just now, the people of Singapore

who   have  elected  51  representatives  to   this

Assembly  require guidance and the  Members  should

carry  out  the  responsibility of  bringing  about

benefits to the people. As we have heard just  now,

the Opposition Members spoke on the 1964 Budget  in

a  loud  voice, but without using their brains.  In

the 1964 Budget, the figures for 1963 Estimates are

clearly  shown along with the Estimates  for  1964.

They   show  the  expenditure  for  the  State   of

Singapore.  There  is  a  vote  in  excess  of  the

provision for 1964 which can be spent, which  means

that  the Singapore Government can spend more  than

what   is  provided  in  the  Estimates  for  1963.

Therefore,  I  am  surprised  at  the  Opposition's

charge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



that the State of Singapore is bankrupt, and is not

progressing  well  in  the  administration  of  the

State.  I  would much prefer it if the  newspapers,

radio  or  television could inform  the  people  of

Singapore   of  the  speeches  made  by  Opposition

Members  in this Assembly as well as of those  made

by  Government Members. They say that  unemployment

is  on  the  increase, that rentals  of  flats  are

exorbitant, that workers have been suppressed,  and

so  on and so forth. I believe the Barisan Sosialis

Opposition Members themselves are unemployed.  They

are not working for the benefit of the workers; nor

are   they   doing  anything  for  the  people   of

Singapore. The fact is that we are able to  provide

sufficient  housing  in Singapore  Flats  built  in

Queenstown   should  be  tangible  proof   of   our

achievements. The construction of such  flats  will

mean  employment  for thousands  and  thousands  of

workers,  and  that  means more  opportunities  for

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The erection of community centres actually means

more  jobs  for  the people. The building  of  more

schools, as has been explained by the Minister  for

Education,  means  that  more  teachers   will   be

recruited  and more workers will be in  employment.

Similarly,  the  more clinics we  build,  the  more

workers  we will be able to employ. For cars  which

park along the roads, we have a car-parking system,

and  this means employment for the workers who  are

called  "Car Parking Attendants". All these  things

should  be  enough proof that Singapore is  on  the

road  to progress. Nevertheless, for those who  are

still  unemployed, means will be found to get  them

employment.   Whilst  they  are   unemployed,   the

Department  of Social Welfare gives them  financial

assistance. This aspect has been dealt with by  the

Minister for Social Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the people of Singapore, as well as the

people  of  Malaysia,  know  full  well  that   the

Singapore  Government has a definite programme  for

the Jurong project. This must necessarily mean that

more and more workers will be employed

to ensure the success of the project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will build railway lines and the number of

workers employed on this job will be by the tens of

hundreds.  The  project  there  is  making   steady

progress. We will improve and widen the roads  from

the city up to Jurong. This will also mean that  we

will   require   more  workers  for  the   project.

Factories  which will be built at the  Jurong  site

will  have  to  employ workers.  Machines  will  be

installed and operated by workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are building a harbour in Jurong which requires workers, and it will be used for ships, sampans and motor-boats. This is a programme which we cannot forget even in our sleep - a programme which no doubt will bring benefit to the people of Singapore. I understand that the Barisan

Sosialis Members in the Opposition wish to  act  on

the  orders of others. They have no brains  and  no

ideas  of how to improve the State as well  as  the

lot of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what we have achieved during the five

years since the P.A.P. came to power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Code can be used for the benefit of

the  workers. It is there to prevent employers from

exploiting the workers. During the last four years,

we  have  established  the  Industrial  Arbitration

Court. Originally we had only one Arbitration Court

but  we  now have two Industrial Arbitration Courts

to  safeguard  and  protect the  interests  of  the

workers from being exploited by the employers,  and

at  the  same  time  keep a  watchful  eye  on  the

employers and the Barisan Sosialis from using  the

workers in the interest of their foreign masters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of our government, we have

established  a  Labour Research  Unit  which  is  a

section dealing with labour research. In the Labour

Research Unit, we have staff to assist workers  who

need information, data and advice on the nomination

of  workers'  representatives to put forward  their

demands for consideration by the Arbitration  Court

for the benefit of the workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Trade Union House is under

construction.  It is being built by our  Government

not  for  the purpose of housing the Ministers.  It

will be completely equipped so that the workers can

make  full  use  of the facilities provided  there.

Long   before   the  Barisan  Sosialis   Opposition

identified  themselves with  the  workers,  we  had

already  identified ourselves with and  worked  for

the  workers. The Barisan Sosialis help the workers

only in theory but we help them by practical means.

Because we help the workers by practical means,  we

are  now  faced with confrontation with  which  the

Barisan Sosialis are associated. We are helping the

workers  who are affected by the confrontation.  We

have  a  scheme  whereby we pay them  one-third  of

their  income. In other words, workers affected  by

confrontation,  which is supported by  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  will  receive from their employers  one-third  of their income and the Government on  their

part will pay one-third to the workers affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have said just now that the Opposition Members of the Barisan Sosialis only know the workers in theory or in their day-dreams only. However, we know the workers in practice. For that reason, we are able to form the organisation called the N.T.U.C. Workers employed in the

N.T.U.C. will fight for the national interest.  For

that  reason  we call ourselves "employees  of  the

N.T.U.C."  We are fighting for the benefit  of  the

State  of  Singapore and for the national interest,

unlike the Barisan Sosialis who style themselves by

other   names  and  who  fight  for  their  foreign

masters,  as  has been explained by  my  colleagues

just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me end my speech in this Assembly by giving an object lesson to the numbskull Barisan Sosialis Members. As a result of their misdeeds, the workers have suffered. The Barisan Sosialis are working for the interests of foreign countries.



Mr  Speaker, I wish to remind the Barisan Members of  this  point. Do they wish the confrontation  to end,  or  do  they  wish it to go on  indefinitely, which will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



no  doubt affect many workers? I wish to know their

stand on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, I just require at the most ten minutes. Or

five minutes. Is it all right?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think five minutes is all right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister  for Culture has just  now  raised  a

question  for  answer. He has asked us  whether  we

want  confrontation to succeed or fail. To my mind,

if  we really want to solve this problem, there  is

no question of whether you want it to succeed or to

fail.  The  point is whether we want to  solve  the

differences between Malaysia and Indonesia.  If  we

want,  then  what steps are we taking towards  this

end?   Do  we  want  to  have  peaceful  means   or

belligerent means? Do we want to do it by peace  or

by  force? We want a reply to this from the  P.A.P.

If  they  want  to solve this problem  by  peaceful

means, then perhaps it will be solved. Now if  they

want  to resort to jingoistic means, then we cannot

support them.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The question posed

by  the Minister was, "Do the Barisan Sosialis want

confrontation to succeed or to fail?" That question

has not been --- [interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have given the hon. Member

only five minutes. If Members of the Government are

going to interrupt continually, I will have to give

him more time. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In the meantime,

Members of our Party also wish to know whether  the

P.A.P. are prepared to depend on the 7,000 British

soldiers  to  defeat the Indonesian  confrontation.

These  7,000  British soldiers  are  now  stationed

along  the  border of Sarawak and Borneo.  If  they

were  to  rely  on military means  to  resolve  the

problems  and differences between nations then,  of

course,  they could resort to war or other military

measures. So the main question that remains  to  be

answered now is whether the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



want  to resolve the problems by peaceful means  or

by jingoistic means.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this has not been a

particularly illuminating Budget Session. I  think,

in my memory, this is about the worst, the most ill-informed debate on the Budget that has ever gone on

in  the five Budgets that we have gone through. And

the  reason is simple. In the first place, when the

Barisan   Sosialis  want  to  have  an  intelligent

discussion on financial and economic matters,  they

must have their facts right. When they make utterly

stupid  and  elementary mistakes, then  it  is  not

possible  for  me to track through  their  numerous

idiotic  statements. I will give you  one  example,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, a small matter of tax concession

on  attap  houses. The Member for Paya Lebar  said,

well  that is no good because it means huts  roofed

with  attap  will get a concession,  but  not  huts

roofed  with  zinc.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  for   the

purposes of taxation, huts whether they are  roofed

with  attap  or  zinc,  provided  they  are  of   a

temporary  nature,  are considered  alike.  So  why

should  this  misrepresentation,  misunderstanding,

lack  of  knowledge on numerous matters of fact  be

perpetrated  by  elected  representatives  of   the

people?  I cannot understand. These are people  who

are  supposed  to  study  the  law,  administrative

processes  and  not  to make childish  errors  like

this.  Now  when  they  come  to  the  question  of

figures,  the Budget deals with figures,  how  much

money is spent here and what it represents, but  as

a  socialist the Member does not understand what it

is all about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Member for

Paya  Lebar says, "Well, look, this whole  business

of  how much money we give to the Federation is all

bad for the Government." 40 per cent of the revenue

- $1l8  million  - correct.  Capital  expenditure  of

Singapore,   $9.5  million,  correct.   Loan,   $30

million, correct. Then he says, add it all  up  and

you  come  to a figure of $171.5 million.  He  says

that we give all this away to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a loan is a loan. When you lend money, you

expect it to be repaid. And I am quite certain that

when  we  lend $30 million each year to the  Borneo

territories  we will get it back. How can  you  add

all  these  things? Only people with a kindergarten

type of mentality perpetrate this childish error.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the subject of loans, Sir, the Member

for  Jalan Kayu said that I told a lie when I  said

that  Sabah  will take workers from  Singapore.  He

quotes  a  statement  saying that  Sabah  will  not

allow, under their immigration laws, anybody coming

in  unless they get a job of $1,000 a month. So,  I

am called a liar because of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a lawyer, you will know that under the Immigration Ordinance there are income limits to any person wanting to go in, but the Minister has powers to exempt entry into the country on certain special grounds, and so far as the $30 million loan is concerned, it is written

into  the Constitution that Singapore will  provide

half  the  labour  force employed on  projects  for

which this $30 million is paid out of Singapore. If

they want our money, they like our money, then they

get  our  workmen. If they do not want  our  money,

they do not like our workmen, then they do not  get

our  money.  It  is  as simple as  that,  a  simple

process of logic. The Member for Jalan Kayu, who is

the  representative of 30,000 people, cannot follow

it. So I am not going to go into the details of the

various matters that they have raised because to do

so would reveal monumental ignorance and ineptitude

of  the  so-called representatives of Singapore  on

the Barisan side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, confrontation, as you know, Mr Speaker, is

an  important problem here. Here as we are building

up, going from strength to strength, suddenly there

is  confrontation.  We  frame  our  Budget  on  our

policies  to  meet this particular problem,  and  I

have  given  a  fair estimate of how much  national

income we lose and how much unemployment there will

be.   This   is  based  on  practical  studies   of

individual industries of individual factories which

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



be  affected  and how they will be affected.  These

people say that my Estimates are too low. Yet,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, when my colleague, the Minister  for

Culture, pressed them to it, the Member for  Jurong

says,  "Kalimantan  Utara  says  this.  What  about

impeaching the Minister for Finance for saying that

the  position is serious?" Now they cannot have  it

both  ways.  The  Member has to  fall  back  on  my

estimate  to  prove that an adverse  situation  has

arisen  and  in  my  analysis  of  the  effects  of

confrontation, I have been completely objective.  I

have  never  tried  to  minimise  the  effects   of

confrontation nor, on the other hand, to exaggerate

them.  I  have  been working on figures,  the  best

available  statistics, with a completely  impartial

mind, because the moment we deceive ourselves, then

our policy fails.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is with the progress of the Development

Plan.  I  have listened with interest to  what  all

these people said where the Plan has fallen behind.

All  they  could do is to get figures  and  amounts

from my own Budget statement where I have said,  in

this  sector, we have not done well.  There  is  no

point  in  hiding this fact, Mr Speaker,  Sir.  We

have  to  report to the people. Where we  have  not

done well, we say so and we do not need the Barisan

Sosialis to add to that. My view is that there  are

minor  sectors and projects which they  could  have

picked out if they had been well informed and taken

the  trouble to find out the facts. But, of course,

finding  what  the facts are in this  situation  is

completely beyond their capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the effects of Indonesian confrontation, we

have  heard the most fantastic utterances from  the

Barisan  Sosialis. The Member for Paya  Lebar  says

the  textile  trade will go down by 60  to  70  per

cent;  banks are suffering at the rate of 30 to  40

per cent, and so on and so forth. What facts has he

got?  What research has he done to establish  these

percentages? How many of the textile firms  has  he

visited?  Has  he inquired how much you  export  to

Indonesia and how much you sell to Malaysia? Banks?

Has he gone round to study the amount of bank loans

that have been extended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



to  Indonesian trade? Obviously this is all bunkum,

rubbish,  a typical Barisan way of getting  to  the

truth.  Any  figure  is good enough  - 60  per  cent

textiles,  in spite of the fact that of  our  total

textile  trade no more than 12 per cent is exported

to  Indonesia, and he says 60 to 70 per cent; banks

30  to  40 per cent. Unemployment, he says  30,000,

and he says 50,000. All rubbish and idiocy. Be that

as  it  may, they are entitled to their opinion  if

they  say  50,000  people are  unemployed  now  and

begging   in   the   streets   as   a   result   of

confrontation. From the Singapore point of view, it

does  not  matter. The people are intelligent,  Mr

Speaker, Sir. As the Chinese saying goes, "People's

eyes  are as clear as snow" and they can see  them,

even  though these half-baked politicians,  running

dogs  of the Communist Party, I mean, have not  got

their facts right --- [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister is now doing

what I have stopped the Opposition from doing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir. Only

seven  of them; the eighth man is exempted. May  I,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  when  I  used  the  expression

"running  dog", in Chinese it is "chou kou",  which

is in fact what they are ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We have only got 25 minutes left.

Make full use of it if you want to.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, certainly. "Kung Ch'an

Tang  Ti  Chou  Kou".  There  is  one  danger,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  When  they say  50,000  unemployed,

people  starving in Singapore, do they not  realise

the amount of damage that they can do to the people

of Singapore and to the people of Malaysia? Ours is

an  open society, Mr Speaker, Sir. What is said in

the  Assembly is recorded in Hansard and  published

in the newspapers. Supposing, as will happen, Radio

Indonesia  gets  hold of these records.  They  will

broadcast this - representatives of the people,  the

great  patriots, the people's heroes in the Barisan

say  starvation, 50,000 unemployed.  This  will  be

broadcast by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



enemy.  The Indonesian Government will believe  it.

What  is  the result? The result is they say,  "All

right,  we  continue confrontation.  We  beat  them

down."  These are the people who say they  are  for

the  people. My colleague, the Minister for Labour,

has  already  quoted from their own Party  journal.

They  say, "We don't take orders from Indonesia  in

opposing  Malaysia. We did it first, and  then  the

Indonesian  Government accepted our policy  as  the

correct one."



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Followed them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Followed them. Published in

their own Party journal. What have they got to  say

to all this? These are the people who say, "We weep

for  the  unemployed. How wicked the P.A.P. is  in

bringing  about confrontation." Here they tell  us.

In  their own journal, they boast of the fact  that

they  are  the  people who opposed Malaysia.  As  a

result  of  their opposition, the Indonesians  were

convinced  that Indonesia could break  Malaysia  by

opposing it with the assistance of renegades inside

the country. That is what has happened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, further evidence of disloyalty, Mr Speaker.

Further   evidence  of  treason.  When  they   were

discussing  the impact of Indonesian  confrontation

on  Singapore, the Member for Paya Lebar took great

delight  at  the establishment of three free  trade

zones  in  Indonesia; north in Sabang, Sumatra,  in

Belawan - four actually; one in Sulawesi and one  in

Jakarta. He took great delight - "There you are, the

Indonesians have established free trade zones. What

is  Singapore  going to do? We will die  unless  we

come to terms with them." We will die. Does he know

that this is a great myth that when you establish a

free  port there are certain things that  you  must

create  and  what it costs? If in Sabang  in  North

Sumatra, the Indonesians were really to want a free

port  in  fact as against a propaganda  free  port,

they would have to spend at least $500 million. And

they have not got that money. So the representative

from Paya



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



Lebar  is hoping that Indonesia can break Singapore

by  establishing four free ports. Then he said  and

Members    heard   him,   "Your   industrialisation

programme  depends  on the market  of  100  million

Indonesians, otherwise there is no hope. What is 10

million  Malaysians? 100 million Indonesians.  When

you  can  sell to them, then you succeed." This  is

mad  talk.  He never took the trouble to  find  out

what  the  facts are. In 1962 - the  best  year  - we

exported   something   like   $390   million   from

Singapore.  What goods did we export, Mr  Speaker,

Sir? Manufactures? What we produced? Nothing doing.

It  was  food. The ports of Sumatra and  Kalimantan

depend  on food supplies from Singapore.  The  vast

majority  of that is just to feed them. So  far  as

the  industrial market is concerned, Indonesia with

100  million people to buy goods we produce?  I  do

not give them more than $20 million a year. Our own

market  in  Malaysia is 100 times larger than  this

$20 million. Why does he bring up this point,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir?  No foundation in fact,  but  behind

this   is  the  wishful  thinking  that  Indonesian

confrontation  is going to succeed, to  bring  down

Malaysia,  to  destroy the P.A.P. My colleague  the

Minister  for  Culture asked them a straightforward

question: "Do you want confrontation to succeed, or

do  you  want confrontation to fail?" What  is  the

answer,  Mr Speaker, Sir? The Member for Thomson,

for  whom until now I had respect, fell right  into

our trap. Stupid man --- [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please do not make personal

allegations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr

Speaker, Sir, I never expect this co-operation from

the Opposition. He said, "Do we want peace or war'?

Please answer that'?" Well, I answer. I want peace;

the  P.A.P. wants  peace; Singapore  wants  peace:

Malaysia wants to settle it by peace. And he  still

has  not  answered.  Do you want  confrontation  to

succeed or to fail?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker. Sir, I put it to the House that

the  position  of the Barisan Sosialis  is  a  very

simple  one. They want Singapore to fail,  Malaysia

to be ruined



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



by  confrontation.  They want  the  Indonesians  to

succeed  in their policy of confrontation to  break

up  Malaysia. It is obvious. If that is  not  their

policy, why do they not say so? A simple answer  to

a simple question. Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason is

self-evident  other  than  to  their  own   wicked,

violent, perverted minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when we say we want to settle it in peace,

we are honest about it. We know that, as a military

power,  Indonesia cannot be laughed at. They  spend

75  per cent of their budget on the Army, Navy  and

the  Air Force. They have more than 450,000  people

under arms. They have more than 30 jet bombers  and

more  than 90 MIG.21s. This is a formidable  force.

Luckily their Navy is no good, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

mean,  if  their  fleet breaks  down,  they  cannot

repair  it.  Apart from that, this is  no  laughing

matter.  This is a country with a tremendous  punch

if  it  comes  to  war. We do  not  want  war,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir. Why should we want war? We  want  to

settle  it peacefully. But we are not going  to  be

bullied  and  pushed around into  a  dishonourable

settlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Indonesian Government and their leaders

realise   and  accept  Malaysia  as   a   fact   of

international life and that they cannot, either by

peace or by war, destroy Malaysia, then that is the

time  they will talk reason. And they are not going

to talk reason, Mr Speaker, Sir, when they believe

they have traitors in our country who can help them

to  destroy the State, to terrorise the people, and

to bring this country under their sovereignty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here these people talk about neo-colonialism.

What  do  they mean by neo-colonialism? This  is  a

subject which they have discussed for a long  time,

repeatedly   saying  that  Malaysia   is   a   neo-colonialist plot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the Budget debate, when my

colleague,  the Minister for Culture,  embarked  on

the  political issues behind the Budget, you called

him up repeatedly and said that he should come down

to  the  financial aspects. And, if I may say  with

respect,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  gentlemen

opposite   repeatedly  called   Malaysia   a   neo-colonialist plot,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



an  imperialist instigation, you did not call  them

to  task. I can understand, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that

you  are trying to be fair. You are a member of the

P.A.P. and  therefore  since  we  elected  you  as

Speaker  you  consider that you must be  more  than

fair  to the Opposition. And I think you have  been

more than fair to the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the people who say, "Malaysia is a neo-colonialist plot." Why do they say "Malaysia is a

neo-colonialist plot"? What evidence have they got?

What  arguments have they got? Is it  the  British

base  here? These people want the British  base  to

close  down.  But their predecessors, Mr  Woodhull

and  Mr  James  Puthucheary, were  on  wining  and

dining  terms with Lord Selkirk. They assured  Lord

Selkirk  at  that  eventful  tea-party,  "We   will

protect your bases so long as you allow us to bring

down  the  P.A.P.". These are the  people.  British

bases?  Who want the British bases here?  They  are

here by agreement between the elected Government of

Malaya and the elected Government of Britain.  Both

Governments   see  an  identity  of  interests   in

preserving British military power here. I  make  no

apologies  for that. As my colleague, the  Minister

for Labour, has said, "Close down British bases and

you  are  faced with 450,000 Indonesian troops,  30

jet  bombers,  90 jet fighters." And the  Navy,  of

course. Their navy can still move, although  it  is

not very efficient. Now, how do you beat them? Will

the  Barisan  join up and register? Will  they  say

now,  "I  sacrifice  my life to  defend  Malaysia's

integrity  against  an imperialist  power  that  is

trying  to capture Malaysia by force of arms"?  Or

do  they  think  the Indonesians are so  reasonable

that nothing will happen? When the power vacuum  is

withdrawn, then Dr Subandrio says, "Yes,  you  are

my friends. I will help you." This is mad talk, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, utterly mad talk! And they know  it;

they deliberately want a power vacuum to be created

in  this  territory. I can tell them: any time  the

elected  Government of Malaysia says,  "Close  down

the British bases", then at that moment the British

bases are closed down. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



Government  of  Malaysia,  as  the  Government   of

Singapore,  is  elected  by  the  people.  If  they

campaign  on  the platform of closing down  British

bases,  and  they form the government in Singapore,

and  most  important  in  Kuala  Lumpur,  then  the

British  bases must close down. That  has  happened

before.  So  long as you close down British  bases,

there  will  be no jobs. They go out. There  is  no

question  of  the British imposing their  bases  on

this  country. It is a simple fact of international

politics. We find these bases necessary and  useful

to  us  at  the present moment. In the future  they

must  go.  Everyone  agrees  with  that.  And,  Mr

Speaker, when the bases go, then you have to  build

a big Army, a big Navy and a big Air Force, costing

not  hundreds of millions of dollars but  thousands

of  millions of dollars. Here in this Budget we are

devoting   something  like  $40  million   as   our

contribution  to the Malaysian defence  forces,  to

the  Malaysian  Parliament, to  Malaysian  external

affairs. And the Member says that is to oppress the

people!  The trouble with the Barisan is that  they

think  they  are  the people. The soldiers  are  to

oppress the people; the soldiers are to oppress the

Barisan. That is what they think. The police are to

oppress  the people; the police are to oppress  the

Barisan. The prisons are there for the people;  the

prisons are there for the Barisan. If that is their

definition of "people", I accept that definition in

this context. But how on earth can the Barisan,  in

heaven's  name, claim to speak for the  people?  We

had a referendum, and they lost out miserably. They

were  not  satisfied;  we had a  general  election.

Their   Party  Chairman  said,  "All   the   P.A.P.

Ministers will lose their deposits. The P.A.P. will

be out, and the Barisan will be in. We will have an

overwhelming  landslide victory.  The  people  want

us." What happened? The people rejected them and we

now  have a miserable crowd in front! How can  they

presume to speak for the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, another thing before I

leave  the  question  of confrontation.  All  these

people have said that it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



was  very  wrong for the Tunku, Tun Razak  and  the

people  in  Kuala  Lumpur  to  scold  Soekarno  and

Subandrio and that it was wrong to call them  names

and  burn their images. They said, "How can we have

a  peaceful settlement if these things happen?"  So

they  criticised the Tunku and Tun Razak. But worse

things  are happening in Jakarta. Why do  they  not

say  something about them? Why do they not say that

Soekarno   must  also  not  insult  us,  that   the

Indonesians must not have anti-Malaysia  riots  and

burn  the property of the Malaysian Embassy there?

Why  do  they not say that? No, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

Whatever Indonesia says is right; whatever Malaysia

says  is wrong. Champions of the people! They  call

themselves genuine Malaysian patriots! Mr Speaker,

Sir,  if this sort of thing happens, say, in a well

ordered  society, these characters could be charged

with  treason and put into gaol under the law.  And

then   when  we  tell  them  that  they  are  anti-nationals,  they  say, "How can  that  be?  We  are

patriots." Utter madness! They are out not only  to

sell  out  the  country, but they  are  not  clever

enough to disguise their evil design.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the effects of confrontation. The

Barisan  Sosialis  said that our  economic  defence

programme  to  give two-thirds pay to  the  workers

later  on  is very good. The Member for Paya  Lebar

said  it. But he said that we must consult the non-P.A.P. unions  and  that  after  all  it  is  only

democratic that we should consult all unions.  Now,

Sir,  if I were a child of six I would believe that

sort  of nonsense, but I have had enough experience

in  dealing with the Communist unions.  And  I  say

that   if  I  were  mad  enough  to  invite   these

characters  and  ask  them, "How  do  we  run  this

defence scheme?" I deserve - if I am mad enough  - to

be  locked up in Woodbridge. I know that they would

be  ganging  up, that they would ask for impossible

conditions and that they would agitate against  the

scheme.  I know it. I have had experience  of  this

thing. In our long political struggle, we know what

the  Communists  are. They are  double-talkers.  No

reliance at all can be placed on their good  faith.

We  have  had  clear examples, Mr  Speaker.  These

chaps always say that workers are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



suffering, unemployment is mounting, and so on  and

so forth. We knew it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960 I asked Messrs. Lim Ching Siong, S. T.

Bani,  Sandra  Woodhull and Fong  Swee  Suan  about

unemployment  insurance. I  said,  "Gentlemen,  the

unemployment  problem is very serious.  Let  us  do

something  about it." A practical way  of  reducing

the effect of unemployment is to introduce a system

of unemployment insurance, so that when the workers

are  unemployed,  they  get  some  income,  not  by

courtesy  or by charity, but as of right. You  have

unemployment   insurance  in  all   countries,   in

developed  countries of the West and  in  countries

belonging  to the Communist bloc. You  have  it  in

Hungary,   Russia,  Germany,  Europe,  Scandinavia,

America  - anywhere.  First, when  the  workers  are

unemployed, quite often, it is due to no  fault  of

their  own. Unlike the Barisan when they instigated

people  to  go on strike, 1,800 workers lost  their

jobs.  The Barisan union called a strike  and  they

failed.  [Laughter]  The Member for Jurong  laughed,

Mr  Speaker.  He  has asked a question -  how  many

people were employed in the pioneer industries?  He

is  going to get the answer on Saturday. We do  not

run  away  from  facts. And when  I  say  that  the

S.A.T.U. - unions  Communist unions  - have  deprived

1,800  workers  of their jobs, I am going  to  give

them  a  list  showing the names of factories,  the

number of workers, when the strikes took place  and

what  happened. I think when he is confronted  with

the  facts  he  will  be less  sceptical  and  less

cheerful  than he is now. They want us  to  consult

them  on  how  to  save the country  from  economic

confrontation when it is their desire  to  see  the

country  go  down  and  ruined  by  enemy  economic

action. Yes, Sir, Lim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



Ching Siong - I have just started and I must end  up -  they would not agree. We said that we would  get

the  employers to make a contribution and that  the

Government  would  also  make  a  contribution.  We

asked,  "Would  the  trade unions  co-operate?"  We

received  no  co-operation. They did  not  want  an

unemployment  insurance scheme in  Singapore.  Mind

you, we have had several experts who came here  and

said,  "Do not have unemployment insurance.  It  is

too   expensive."  But  we  said,  never  mind  the

expense, although I am the Finance Minister. But on

this  score,  I  said, "We have a real  problem  to

meet.  We  will have unemployment insurance.  Never

mind  the  expense.  Never mind the  priority."  We

asked,  "Are  you willing to co-operate?"  Nothing,

Mr  Speaker, Sir. They do not want to relieve  the

distress  of  the  working  class  because,  as  my

colleague said, the more the distress the  stronger

their political influence. So for them to say  that

we  should take them into their confidence and  get

the  so-called pro-Communist unions  to  work  this

economic  defence scheme is a proposal so ludicrous

that  I  would not even waste one second to  decide

what I should do.
