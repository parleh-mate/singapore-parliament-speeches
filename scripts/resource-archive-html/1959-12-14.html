<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Development Estimates-for the

convenience  of  hon. Members I intend  taking  the

totals  for each head as they appear in the  fourth

column of the summary of expenditure on page 468 of

Paper Cmd. (New Series) 32 of 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D9 -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D9 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (2) of sub-head

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (2) of sub-head 1, "Singapore River Project

$2,000,000; Subject to Treasury sanction."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember some years ago, a

working  committee was appointed by the  Government

to  go  into  the whole question of  the  Singapore

River  and  what should be done with it,  not  only

from the point of view of the river traffic on  it,

but  also  from  the sanitary point  of  view.  The

Singapore  River, as you know, Mr Speaker,  passes

through the densely populated area of the City  and

the  sanitary exits to most of the premises in this

area are into the Singapore River. As far as I  can

make out, the Singapore River is not only an artery

of  trade  but  it also provides an  exit  for  the

sanitary  facilities of the City. Because of  this,

the  City health authorities were worried about the

state of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  River. Several approaches had been  made

to  Government  from  time  to  time  to  see  that

something  should  be done to the Singapore  River.

Therefore, I am very glad, Mr Speaker, Sir, to see

that  some  provision has been made in next  year's

estimates,  although I regret  to  find  under  the

remarks column "Subject to Treasury sanction". This

very  often  means  that the scheme  might  not  be

carried  out.  I  would like the assurance  of  the

Finance  Minister that the scheme  is  sufficiently

well  in hand for it to be commenced next year and,

should  that  be the position, that  he  will  give

sympathetic approval to this scheme.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Government's main  interest  in

this river project is, of course, from the point of

view  of  trade. As the Member for Farrer Park  has

said,  this proposal was first examined quite  some

time  ago. In fact, a Committee was formed in  1954

to  investigate the condition of the river  and  to

make  recommendations  for  its  improvement.  That

Committee  went into some detail in the engineering

aspects  of  river improvement. Perhaps  I  may  be

permitted   to   explain  briefly  what   are   the

improvements   envisaged,   and   what    is    the

Government's attitude towards these improvements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river is important because it is one of the

principal  arteries  of our  entrepot  trade.  Many

people may not be aware of the fact that more cargo

is  discharged through the river than  through  the

wharves of the Singapore Harbour Board, that is  if

we  exclude bunker oil. The traffic up and down the

river  is impeded in two ways. First, part  of  the

river has been rather heavily silted up, so that at

low tide movement of lighters is not possible. Then

again  at high tide there is not sufficient headway

under the bridges, so that again lighter traffic is

held up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee proposed certain types of

alteration. First, to repair or to reconstruct  the

bridges so that there is sufficient headway at high

tide.  Then  it  would  be necessary  to  dredge  a

channel  along the Singapore River so that  traffic

can proceed at low tide. Once dredging



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



operations  are  commenced, there is  every  danger

that   the   quays  of  the  river  may   collapse.

Therefore,  before  the channel  of  the  river  is

deepened,  it  will be necessary to strengthen  the

quays by means of sheet piling. This will be a most

costly  operation.  The  original  cost  is   $7�

million  and  the latest estimate is that  it  will

probably  be nearer the region of $14 million.  The

estimated original cost of $14 million has now been

increased  to some $23 million. Now, it is  obvious

that  there  are independent aspects of this  work,

for  instance,  the reconstruction of  bridges  can

proceed   quite  independently  of  the   work   of

deepening the channel of the river, while repair to

the  quay  side  (for instance,  attending  to  the

deplorable state of some of the private  quays)  is

again  quite  independent of any deepening  of  the

channel.  But  no attempt has so far been  made  to

assess  the  benefit from each item of  this  total

programme  against possible benefits; for instance,

if  you  are to reconstruct the bridges,  how  many

more hours' traffic will that permit? What will  be

the gain to traders and shippers? And if you are to

undertake  this  extremely  expensive  business  of

deepening  the  channel, how  much  more  will  the

Singapore River be open to trade, and how fast will

ships be able to turn over the cargo and so on  and

so forth?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government is now engaged in weighing the

benefits to be gained against the items of separate

cost  so that we can be sure that, if we do  embark

on  this  most expensive project, we will get  good

value  for  money. Now, if the channel were  to  be

deepened, the advice of the engineers is  that  the

waters of the Singapore River would flow at such  a

rate that it would eliminate the present malodorous

state  of the river of which the Member for  Farrer

Park has complained.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation by the

Hon. the Minister for Finance, may I be given leave

to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,028,070 for Head D9 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D12 -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Dl2 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this particular provision is a token vote

for  equipment for new post offices. But I  do  not

see  anywhere under this head any provision, be  it

token  or  actual,  for the building  of  new  post

offices.  If  there are no new post offices  to  be

built,  is  there  any necessity to  have  a  token

provision  for the equipment for new  post  offices

which are not to be built at all?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, the Postal Department has a programme  for

the   building  of  nine  new  post  offices.  This

programme  is divided into three phases. Phase  (a)

was  the  building of post offices at Thomson  Road

and   Serangoon  Garden  Estate.  This  phase   was

completed in 1958, at the cost of $246,500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase (b) involves the building of five further

post  offices at Paya Lebar, the Singapore  Harbour

Board,  Macpherson Road, Kampong Kapor and Killiney

Road.  Work on the Paya Lebar office was  begun  in

1958,  and provision was made in the 1959 estimates

for  the  work to be completed. Because of  limited

finances  at that time, work on the remaining  four

items  of phase (b) was deferred. No provision  for

these  items was entered in the 1959 estimates  and

in  those  estimates, the four items were relegated

to  a schedule of Public Work projects deferred for

consideration  in  connection  with   future   loan

programmes and the general availability of finance.

So  the  new  P.A.P. Government has inherited  this

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase (c) involves the building of two post

offices  at  Simpang  Bedok  and  Farrer  Road.  In

preparing  the 1960 estimates, the postal  services

hope that money could be found for the construction

of  some,  if  not  all, of the four  post  offices

remaining in phase (b). An application was made for

provision   to   be  entered  in  the   Development

Estimates. Simultaneously, a proposal was made  for

$3,400  to purchase equipment necessary to  furnish

the post offices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view, however, of the uncertainty as to

whether  funds  would be provided and  whether  the

work could in fact be completed in 1960, only token

provision   for  the  purchase  of  equipment   was

entered.  If  necessary and when the  need  arises,

Members  of  the  House will  be  assured  that  an

application  for  supplementary provision  will  be

made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add, Mr Speaker, that we in Singapore

are  fortunate  that  we have an  excellent  postal

service  which can guarantee us that when a  letter

is despatched it will be delivered, and when a man

goes to the post office to send a cable it will  be

promptly transmitted. And if the Member for  Farrer

Park had gone-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Member for Cairnhill!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am sorry, Sit. It is the

Member for Cairnhill. I have got Farrer Park on  my

mind!



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah:</b> Naturally. It is a fine open

space.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> If the Member for Cairnhill

had  visited the exhibition - "Government at Work" - at

the  Victoria Memorial Hall, he would have found  a

map  giving  the  distribution of  postal  services

throughout the whole of Singapore. It is a  service

which, I again repeat, all of us can be proud of.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I brought

this  up  because there does not  appear  to  be  a

similar  token  provision for new post  offices  in

this  vote.  It  would appear, from the  Minister's

reply,  that  this  matter  is  in  hand  and,   if

necessary,  a supplementary application  for  funds

will  come  before the Assembly in due  course.  I,

therefore, beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It appears to me that other hon.

Members  would like to take part in  this  type  of

he  pauses before asking leave to  withdraw,

waiting  to see whether any other Member wishes  to

speak. Otherwise it is a question of having to  put

the  amendment to the vote, when it is  really  not

necessary  to  do so. But I have  now  to  put  the

request  that the amendment be withdrawn. No  doubt

the Member for the Southern Islands will say "No"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the pleasure of hon. Members that the

amendment be withdrawn?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Ahmad Jabri?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on the

sub-head concerning postal services, we have  heard

the  explanation given by the Deputy Prime Minister

and   the  Government's  intentions  regarding  the

postal services. As has been narrated by the Deputy

Prime Minister, there are three types of programmes

and  they all cover only the City area. No  mention

was   made  of  programmes  covering  the  Southern

Islands.   It  is  evident  that  I  have   already

mentioned  many  matters  concerning  the  Southern

Islands,  Mr Speaker, because I am of the  opinion

that  there  is room for improvement in the  postal

services in certain areas there. I find that one of

these  places  is Palau Bukom. On  the  main  Bukom

Island  there  are  no  postal  services.  I   feel

concerned  about  what has happened  previously.  I

have  received complaints and appeals to the effect

that the oil company at Pulau Bukom is prepared  to

provide  a building for a post office at the  place

where  the  postal  staff  now  only  sell  stamps.

Unfortunately,  however, until  today  I  have  not

heard  of  any development regarding the  company's

offer.   Therefore,  I  would  like  to  draw   the

attention of the Government that it is only  proper

that a branch or a sub-post office be opened there,

which  can  be of benefit to the residents  of  the

Southern Islands, the majority of whom are found on

Bukom   Island  and  to  provide  them  with   easy

communication   with   the   Singapore    mainland.

Otherwise,  in  the absence of such facilities,  it

will  be very difficult for them when they  are  in

need of urgent communication.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I will certainly

pay  attention to what the Member for the  Southern

Islands  has  brought  up  about  Pulau  Bukom.  Of

course,  he  will agree that it is not possible  to

set  up a sub-post office on an island where  there

are,  say,  50 or 100 inhabitants who do not  write

letters every day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $100,730 for Head D12 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Head D13, Sir, 17 sub-heads have been

itemised  except sub-head 3. Under  this  sub-head,

what  is  stated  is  just  "General".  Would   the

Minister  be good enough to inform this House  what

kind of expenditure comes under "General"?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I can very well

understand the anxiety of the Member for  Cairnhill

about having every item inserted in the Development

Estimates.  In the 1959 estimates, under "General",

the  items  were  a  power supply  unit,  telegraph

filters,  test equipment, all amounting to $24,550.

This  year  there are several trifling items  which

the Telecommunications Department wish to purchase,

and  if  you want to insert each and every  one  of

them in the estimates I am afraid it will take up a

considerable  amount of space. But  to  assure  the

Member  for Cairnhill, the type of equipment  which

the  Department of Telecommunications will need are

aerial multi-couplets to cover maintenance and  fog

periods on 36 working units, air conditioning plant

for  expansion  of  air-conditioning  room  at  the

transmitting station, amplifier panels  to  provide

stand-by  for  18  v.m. channels,  auto  alarm  for

detecting   automatically  distress  signals   from

ships,   D.C. rectifying  unit,   diesel-electric

generating sets, switch-board three-phase telegraph

filters. Personally, I have great trust that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



the Acting Director for Telecommunications will use

this  sum  of money to improve the running  of  his

department.  I can assure the Member for  Cairnhill

that  there  is  no other underlying motive  behind

"General".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1959 estimates, there is a similar

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, it is part of the

revote. The reason why the full amount has not been

entered  is because the Ministry of Finance intends

to  set  up  a  committee of supply, consisting  of

experts,  to  investigate into the claims  made  by

other  Ministries.  It  is  important  that  laymen

should  at  least be fully satisfied that technical

claims  made  by  technical departments  are  fully

justified.  The  Civil Aviation  Department  relies

heavily   on  Telecommunications  for  its   proper

operations.  These  services are  provided  by  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister for National

Development to inform us when the Housing Authority

will  be created and what plans he has to use  this

$25  million  for the building of low-cost  housing

which  we  have read about so much; how many  units

there will be; and where they will be situated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some few months ago

the Minister for National Development announced  in

the Press that he had a comprehensive programme for

housing over the next five years which would  total

about  $415  million, and that  this  $415  million

would  be spread over the five years of the  P.A.P.

being  in  power. Assuming that the report  in  the

Press is correct, Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that  the

provision  for  next  year's housing  is  only  $25

million - not even a fifth of the $415 million  which

the  Minister said would be expended over the  five

years. I further find that this $25 million is also

subject  to Treasury sanction. It rather  gives  me

the  impression that plans have not been  finalised

to  the  extent that the Treasury has  approved  of

them.  Could  the Minister for National Development

also  inform  the  House whether this  $25  million

includes  the  cost of sites or whether  it  merely

includes  the  cost of buildings themselves?  Could

the  Minister also tell the House how many  housing

units  it  is  intended to build out  of  this  $25

million, and how much the cost per unit would be?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I presume

that  most  of  the money allocated for  next  year

would  be  spent on providing low-cost housing  for

the  poorer sections of the population. At the same

time,  we know that the rate of population increase

is  such  that,  in order to cope with  the  annual

increase, about 10,000 housing units a year  should

be  provided.  Together with the  back-log  and  in

order   to  cope  with  the  situation,  we  should

provide, say, 15,000 housing units yearly  for  the

next  five years. We know that the maximum building

capacity so far achieved by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



S.I.T. is about 4,000 to 5,000 housing units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the best will and intention in the

world,  the  S.I.T. or the new  Housing  Authority

might  be able to provide, say, 8,000 units.  I  am

speaking  on  behalf  of  those  families   wanting

accommodation, who are not provided by  the  S.I.T.

We  know  there are thousands of families who  have

been  queueing up and have not been able to  become

eligible  because  of the points system.  Unless  a

family  has  at  least  five  points,  it  is   not

eligible.  So only large families are  eligible.  A

newly-married couple or a couple with one child  or

two  children cannot apply for an S.I.T. house.  If

the  S.I.T. cannot provide houses for such  people,

then  they  have  to  turn to  private  enterprise.

Therefore,  Sir,  I hope that the  Government  will

give  every encouragement to private enterprise  to

provide  housing for those who are not provided  by

the Housing Authority. I hope an assurance will  be

given by the Government at this time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, when the P.A.P. became the

Government, we were faced with problems which would

take some time to resolve. We found, when we opened

the  cash  till, that most of the money  which  the

people  had given to the care of the old Government

had  disappeared. As the Deputy Prime Minister said

one  day,  Christmas Island was sold;  luckily  the

people  opened their eyes, or otherwise this Island

of Singapore would also be sold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many problems to be solved by the new

Government. Not only was there a shortage of money,

not  only  were  our reserves spent in  a  carefree

manner,  but  there were also other problems  which

the  other governments - the colonial government  and

the  Lim Yew Hock Government - had left to the P.A.P.

Government  to solve: for instance, as  the  Member

for Tanglin has said just now, a back-log of houses

to  be built, a shortage of accommodation which for

the  past ten years the colonial administration had

never  tried to solve, and which had been entrusted

to   us.   In  a  word,  Mr  Speaker,  the  P.A.P.

Government has had to carry the baby.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do agree with the Member for Tanglin that, in

order  to cope with the back-log which the colonial

government had left us to solve, we need  to  build

an  average  of 17,500 units a year. We  understand

that   fact.  But,  Mr  Speaker,  in  the  present

economic position in Singapore, we cannot  do  much

better than what our Minister for Finance has done,

to allocate $25 million for housing. There are many

competing   demands  on  the  restricted  financial

resources   available  to  the  P.A.P.  Government.

Schools  have not been adequately supplied and,  as

the  Minister  for  Education mentioned  yesterday,

delinquency is high and many children have not been

able  to  go  to  schools. There is a  shortage  of

hospitals  for  the  needy; a  shortage  of  social

services  for  the sick and the needy.  Because  of

these  competing demands, the Government  has  done

its  very best by allocating the sum of $25 million

to one requirement alone, that is housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is the first year of the P.A.P. Government. In the first year of the Tun Lim Yew

Hock Government, they only allocated $9 million for

housing. $9 million versus $25 million! Of  course,

every  sector of economic activity in  this  Island

wants  more money. We want $50 million for schools,

$50  million for hospitals, $50 million for  social

service,  etc, etc. But it is not possible  to  get

all  the money and it is the task of the Government

to  allocate  the money judiciously and  wisely  so

that we will do our best with the limited funds  at

our disposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are doing our very best as far as housing is concerned, with our limited funds. We

have  reorganised the S.I.T. almost completely.  We

have sacked or ousted the expatriate architects who

had  been guilty of irregularities. We forced  them

to quit or else action would be taken against them.

We  did  not want to waste time by sending them  to

the  Court because, in some cases, it would be just

a waste of time. For instance, in the course of two

weeks,  we found that more than 20 to 30  items  of

irregularities   had  been  charged   against   one

architect. And to most of these items, he could not

give a satisfactory answer. There were six



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



expatriate architects and we took action to replace

them with six local architects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are some people still at large in this country who have no confidence in the

ability  of our people to put up plans for housing,

hospitals,  and  to  run  this  country.  But,  Mr

Speaker,  we have confidence in our own people  and

in   our  own  professional  men.  As  soon  as  we

reorganised the S.I.T. from August onwards and took

over  full control, within the course of one month,

we terminated the services of 30 expatriates out of

35, leaving a few engineers who have experience and

who  at  the moment are a bit difficult to replace.

But  for the other sectors - the administration,  the

management and the architects - we have replaced them

completely   with  local  professional   men.   Mr

Speaker,  we  have 100 per cent confidence  in  our

local people.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with housing, we need to have a

good  Planning Committee in the S.I.T. because  the

two    are   joined   up - housing   requires    good

planning - and it is important that there  should  be

an  honest and efficient Planning Department in the

S.I.T. both for public housing and, as the  Member

for   Tanglin   says,  for  private  housing.   The

corruption and filth in the Planning Department  in

the  old  S.I.T. has been mentioned many  times  in

this  House.  As  soon as we took over  control  in

August   and  as  soon  as  action  was  taken   to

investigate  the  Planning  Committee,   the   most

important person against whom many allegations  had

been made, scooted. As soon as he left the country,

he  submitted a letter of resignation. We have  now

thoroughly   reorganised  the   Planning   Section.

Previously - and this is for the information of  the

Member for Tanglin - local architectural firms  found

it   very,  very  difficult  to  get  their   plans

expedited.  But European architectural firms  could

build installations worth $10 million or even small

installations, first, and then after  a  few  years

submit  their plans for confirmation. Mr  Speaker,

we    have   rectified   all   these   abuses   and

irregularities of the past. In the  case  of  local

firms,  we  now treat them fairly and on  an  equal

footing with foreign firms. We have even gone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



one  step  further.  And this is  for  the  further

information  of the Member for Tanglin - one  of  the

abuses  of the past was that the Planning Committee

could just reject a plan without giving reasons. In

the  new Planning Committee, what we have tried  to

do  is  that, if we feel that reasons can be given,

we ask the planners to call the architects and give

them the reasons and ask them to make the necessary

slight adjustments, so that their plans can come in

and  can be passed. Previously, what they tried  to

do was they just rejected and the architects or the

contractors  or the builders had to go and  contact

the  right  persons  in order to  get  their  plans

passed. It is a pity though, Mr Speaker, that  the

persons  who have scooted are not the real  persons

who  are  responsible  for the  corruption  in  the

Planning Section of the S.I.T. The persons who  are

really corrupted in the Planning Section are  still

at  large,  and it will take some time  before  the

people  of Singapore can lay their hands  on  them.

The  Member for Farrer Park has sat on the Planning

Committee,  and  I  am sure he knows  that  if  the

members  and the trustees who sat on the  Committee

did  not  agree  with  the  planning  experts,  the

planning experts could not just pass the plans.  It

was  the planning experts who suggested passing  or

approving  the  plans,  but  it  was  left  to  the

Planning Committee composed previously of  a  group

of  trustees who said "yes" or "no" to  the  plans,

and  they  had  been given powers to say  "yes"  or

"no".  Perhaps  a  Commission of Inquiry  into  the

previous  Planning  Committee  might  reveal   many

matters of interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when we started reorganising the S.I.T. in August this year, we sacked the corrupt

expatriate officials, but at the same time we  went

one  step  further  and replaced  them  with  local

architects  and  engineers. We have  long-term  and

short-term  plans: the long-term plans are  not  in

detail but the short-term plans are. We have short-term  plans  to  build low-cost  housing.  The  old

government only talked about low-cost housing. They

had  been  talking about low-cost housing for  four

years.  But, Mr Speaker, Sir, to pay  $89  or  $99

rent per month for a house is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



low-cost  housing. Neither is a one-room flat,  the

rental  of  which is $25 per month  and  which  was

subsidised on the eve of the elections just to  get

votes-low-cost housing. The old Government built  a

few  thousand units in Kallang Estate just  on  the

eve   of  the  elections;  but  they,  knowing  the

elections  were coming, said, "O.K.,  we  subsidise

these  flats. The rent is $60 each per month. Never

mind, we subsidise $20." The total electorate  will

have  to  pay out the money eventually to subsidise

these  flats. We believe in building real  low-cost

housing without any hypocritical measures in hidden

subsidies.   Even  about  the  so-called   low-cost

housing  in  Kallang  Estate,  when  I  went  there

yesterday, I received so many complaints in respect

of  the  construction; the rain  coming  in  during

rainy  days;  the  rent which  the  tenants  cannot

afford  to  pay.... When we say low-cost  housing,  we

really mean low-cost housing - a one-room flat  which

we have started, and which we will rent out at less

than  $20 a month. We will not announce the details

of the rentals until the houses are completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present there are 1,364 units of S.I.T. flats

under  construction. There are sites  available  on

which  we  can build another 5,000 to  6,000  units

straightaway.  The  plans are ready,  most  of  the

specifications  are  ready,  and  as  soon  as  the

Treasury are consulted, we will announce the  plans

publicly,  and  for these units, construction  will

start straightaway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill asked just now when the

Housing  Authority  is going  to  be  created.  Mr

Speaker, the new Government not only works on form,

but  it  also  works on content. Not  only  are  we

proceeding with our plans to build low-cost housing

for the poor and for those who cannot afford higher

rent, but we are also proceeding very fast with the

creation of a new Housing Authority which  we  hope

in January next year will be accomplished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park asked about the

building  cost  at  present. The  present  cost  of

building a one-room flat on the Kampong Tiong Bahru

fire site, which does not include the price of land

and roads, is $1,344.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comparative figure in respect of a one-room

flat  at  the  old Kallang Airport is  $2,986 - about

double  the price. The cost of building a  two-room

unit in Kampong Tiong Bahru is $2,206, and that  in

the  Kallang  Estate is $4,159. Mr  Speaker,  some

people  might query - perhaps the house  will  break

down; it might have a beam without a ceiling; or it

might   have  a  ceiling  without  piling  in   the

construction.  But that is not the  case.  We  have

been  able to get these low-cost houses because  of

many   factors.  One  is  that  from  now  onwards,

building contractors will not have to pay the usual

percentage  in  order to get the housing  contracts

which may mean perhaps a saving of 20 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor is that our local architects

have   experience  in  building  houses  for  local

people.  When I was in Kallang Estate yesterday,  a

woman  complainant  came  to  me  and  said,   "The

lavatory  is  broken."  I  asked  her  whether  her

husband was fat and she said that, on the contrary,

he  was as lean as myself. Then I said, "It must be

that  your husband squatted on the lavatory instead

of  sitting on it." Then she said, "Mr Ong,  I  am

sorry.  I am an Asian and I am not used to sitting.

I  am  used  to  squatting on  the  lavatory."  Mr

Speaker,  that  is  a  clear  example  of  European

architects  trying  to build low-cost  housing  for

local  people;  they  do  not  understand  low-cost

housing.  They  cannot get out of their  minds  the

conveniences  to  which  they  are  accustomed   in

England.  They do not have a system of urinals  and

lavatories  where people squat and do not  sit.  In

other  words, the difference is between  the  Asian

type  of  urinals and the English type of  urinals.

And  this  is  a common complaint from  all  S.I.T.

tenants - most of the lavatories have cracked. There

are  also complaints about cracks not only  in  one

part  of the room but in most parts. There is  also

not  enough  ventilation,  because  the  expatriate

architects who plan the S.I.T. units do not have to

live  there. Albert House in Rochore Road - there  is

no   cross   ventilation  and  when   the   tenants

cook - chillies   and   blachan   and   brinjal   and

onions - then the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



occupants  of  the  whole  flat  will  have  to  be

suffocated for many hours. They have complained but

we cannot do very much. The only thing we can do is

to  take down the whole house. A few months  ago  I

went  to  the Brickworks Estate where I heard  the

story  of a flying saucer - the whole roof of a  flat

had  flown away during a small thunderstorm! I  was

shocked   to  see  the  construction - no   ceilings,

because  the  architects  thought  that  our  local

people can live in those places just like cats  and

dogs.  The Sembawang Research Station for pigs  and

chicken  is better constructed - $1 million has  been

spent on less than 50 pigs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the third factor whereby we have been able to reduce construction costs is that we

choose suitable sites where piling is not necessary

or  less  necessary. We have better layout so  that

one  road can serve as many houses as possible.  We

have  better  layout  for the houses  so  that  one

building  can support as many square feet of  floor

space  as possible. We have better layout for water

and electricity service so that we have to pay less

capital  costs. We even have better layout for  the

roads.  Mr Speaker, because of all these  factors,

we  have  now  been able to reduce the construction

costs to a very low figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in Singapore, the people are

going  to have really low-cost housing. Some people

might  ask,  "Why did the previous  Government  not

build  low-cost housing?" In the first place,  they

did  not  have  the  architects to  build  low-cost

housing.   They  believed  in  engaging  expatriate

architects because they were not confident of their

own  local architects. Local architects - one or  two

of   them  in  the  S.I.T. - were  allowed  to   swat

mosquitoes  in  their  rooms.  Secondly,   low-cost

housing  means less corruption. If a flat is  going

to  be rented out at about $15 a month, the trishaw

rider, the hawker, the poor worker who would be the

tenants  would not be able to pay $200 as tea-money

to  get  it. But with a 3-room flat, a little  more

lavishly decorated and constructed, and rented  out

at  $99  or  $89  per  month,  then,  Mr  Speaker,

directors  of firms, managers of trading companies,

professional men doctors and engineers-could afford

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>



pay  $1,000 or $750 tea-money and rent these S.I.T.

flats,  subsidised by the public. We have rectified

all  these.  We have allocated fiats on the  points

system fairly and equitably. We have even gone  one

step  further by going down to the S.I.T.  Estates,

and  listening  to the public complaints.  We  have

sacked  those housing investigators who  were  paid

$600 to $700 a month, and who did not really go  to

work, and if they really did, complaints inevitably

came, of rudeness and corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a word, Mr Speaker, we have reorganised the

whole  of the S.I.T. and we are embarking  on  real

low-cost  housing.  We  are also  taking  steps  to

ensure that private development programmes will  be

expedited so that the problems of housing  in  this

island  can be mitigated, if not solved.  For  this

matter,  we  wish  to compliment the  Minister  for

Finance  on  his  ability to get  $25  million  for

housing in comparison with the $9 million which the

Tun  Lim Yew Hock Government had allocated  to  the

S.I.T. in his first year of office.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

debate  on  this budget has been going on  for  the

past  few  days, the Opposition has come to  expect

such  tirades from the Government benchers whenever

a  question  is asked in plain and simple  language

just  for information. They seem to think that  the

best  way  to  show that they are  good  people  or

clever  people is to try to say what  the  previous

Government  had done or had failed to  do.  Surely,

Sir,  they are not going to be judged by  what  the

previous  Government did or failed to do? But  they

are  going to be judged by what they are doing  and

will  continue to do. The Hon. Minister  said  that

during my time of office we only gave $9 million to

the  S.I.T.  I am afraid he is wrong in his  facts.

Even  this book produced by their own Minister  for

Finance  disclosed that $9� million was  lent  to

the  S.I.T. in 1954, whereas in 1957  it  was  $30

million. That is just to answer him, Sir. He  seems

to think that in 1954 the Rendel Constitution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



came  into being. It was not so.  It  was  in

April  1955. Therefore, Sir, if he wants to  attack

the  previous Government, may I ask him to be  more

sure of his facts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister, Sir, also touched upon

Christmas Island. I do not know what that  has  got

to  do with this question. But since this has  also

been brought up by the Deputy Prime Minister, may I

say  that  Christmas Island was never  Singapore's?

The  Singapore Government was only responsible  for

the   administration  of  Christmas   Island.   For

administering it, the Singapore Government was paid

a  fee, and also the royalty on the phosphates. The

Government  benchers said that  we  sold  Christmas

Island. It was not ours to sell or not to sell.  In

fact,  when  I  was  informed in  London  that  the

Colonial  Office  intended  to  transfer  Christmas

Island to Australia, I said, "Now, it means a  loss

of  $1�  million to Singapore." They  said,  "All

right,  we will try to get for you $20 million.  If

judiciously  invested,  it  will  bring  you   that

amount."   So   if  $20  million  was   judiciously

invested, it would bring that amount for years  and

years  to  come,  and  not,  as  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  would have us believe, that for 38  years

we will be getting $1� million. But I say that we

have already got $20 million in hand and with $1�

million  every year to come for many years if  that

money is properly invested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Was it?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Even their own Hon. Minister

for  Finance  in  his  budget speech  called  it  a

windfall - a  windfall,  not a  sell-out.  It  was  a

windfall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask just a simple question. When will the

Housing Authority be constituted and how many units

will  be  built  with the $25 million?  I  did  not

criticise  that the $25 million was not enough.  It

is  too small - not like we who gave $30 million, and

why  did  you give only $25 million? I  never  said

that.  I  asked  how many housing  units  would  be

built. I had to sit and listen for about 25 minutes

before  I got the answer - that it is about 5,000  or

6,000  units.  I do not know also why the  Minister

should  go to the extent of saying that it was  the

Lim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



Yew Hock Government which liked expatriate officers

and  wanted them to remain and had no trust in  the

local  officers. But it was the previous Government

that  introduced Malayanisation and gave the  local

boys a real chance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is really very difficult to get a

simple answer, Mr Speaker, to a simple question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> A complicated lie.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If you want a complicated lie, says

the   Deputy  Prime  Minister,  put  a  complicated

question.  But  apparently the Government  Benches,

particularly  the  front  row,  are  incapable   of

answering a simple question. They try to  cloak  it

in words hoping that the point of the question will

be  lost. But we do not intend to lose the point of

the  question. We will come back to it and  try  to

get reasonable answers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the first point I made was that the Minister

for  National Development, when the Prime  Minister

visited  his  Ministry - I believe  it  was  on  that

auspicious  occasion - came out  with  his  grandiose

plans for housing. He announced most bravely to the

Press that he was going to build over the next four

and  a  half years, as the case may be, housing  to

the  value  of $415 million. That was a  very  good

thing. Nobody can deny that. Housing is one of  the

most important factors in Singapore, and the people

of  Singapore  were very pleased to hear  that  the

Government was going to provide $415 million  worth

of housing. Naturally when the Budget was placed in

my  hands, I was hoping there would possibly be  an

allocation of at least $80 million for housing. But

imagine  my  surprise when it was only $25  million

worth of housing. However, I make bold to say  here

and  now  to  the Minister for National Development

that he will not achieve even this target, in spite

of  his brave words. So I am not suggesting that it

should  be  $80  million. But  when  a  responsible

Minister  says  that  he is  going  to  build  $415

million worth of houses, he must mean what he says.

He is a Minister and not a back-bencher.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what the Planning Committee has got to do

with  the Housing Authority, Mr Speaker, I do  not

know. But the Minister must necessarily drag in the

Planning Committee in the hope that he will drag me

into  it.  Certainly I was a member of the Planning

Committee  for  a number of years. While  I  was  a

member of the Singapore Improvement Trust, I was  a

member  of the Planning Committee. If the  Minister

is  suggesting that there was corruption so far  as

the   Trustees  of  the  Planning  Committee   were

concerned, I would certainly ask him to  appoint  a

Commission.  He  should appoint his Commission  and

let  us,  once and for all, put to rest  all  these

unnecessary aspersions about corruption, this, that

and  the  other,  when there is no proof.  For  the

first two or three months of the Government, it  is

all  right  for Members to say this,  that  or  the

other.  But  let us get away from all these  stunts

and  proceed with the work of Government,  and  not

with  the work of accusing people when there is  no

substantial  proof.  If the Minister  for  National

Development must speak about the Planning Committee

to  this  House, I think he should give a  truthful

picture and not a distorted view.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have been listening very

carefully  to  the words of the Member  for  Farrer

Park. I know that he is perhaps aroused by what has

been said by the Minister for National Development,

but  when  he  alleges that the Minister  has  said

something  which does not give a truthful  picture,

that  seems  to  imply that there has  been  a  lie

stated. Therefore, I must ask the Member for Farrer

Park  to  indicate whether he meant a lie has  been

stated  in this House, or whether what the Minister

has said is not true. There is a difference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, if I have given the

impression that the Minister was telling a  lie,  I

withdraw  it. But what I intended to say  was  that

the  Minister had not given a clear picture of  how

the Planning Committee worked. It is not correct to

say   that  the  Planning  Committee  had  complete

delegated  authority to say "Yea" or "Nay"  to  any

plan. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



could  say  "yes", Mr Speaker, and if it  did  say

"yes"   then   the   plan  would   be   implemented

straightaway. But if it did say "no", that was  not

the  end  of the matter, because any "no" from  the

Planning  Committee  went  to  the  full  Board  of

Trustees. It was the Board of Trustees who  decided

whether  it should be "no" or "yes". In any  event,

the   Minister  said  that  the  previous  Planning

Committee did not assist those people who wanted to

develop.  The true position is this: in respect  of

every  application which was to be rejected  or  on

which  the  Planning Committee were not quite  sure

about  giving approval, the developer  was  invited

into  the  Committee  room. He  came  in  with  his

architect,  and the reasons against  approval  were

given to the person concerned. Where the answer was

"no"  he  was  told  that if he and  his  architect

amended  their plan in a certain way, if  they  did

this  or  if  they  did  not  do  that,  then   the

possibility  was that they would be given  planning

approval. But, of course, where the plan inherently

was such that it could not be approved, then it was

turned  down  and the developer was  told  that  no

amount  of trying would help; and he was told  that

in  no  uncertain terms. Where it was  possible  to

alter   the   plan  to  bring  about  an  approval,

certainly  the  developer and  his  architect  were

given an indication of that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister talked about low-cost Housing. He talked about the one-room flat. Does he mean, by a

one-room  flat,  Mr Speaker, that there  would  be

cooking  facilities?  Was it an  entirely  separate

domestic unit? In other words, was it just  a  one-room dormitory which he thinks is low-cost housing,

or  does he mean, by one-room flat, a one-room bed-room, a sitting room, a kitchen, a bath-room and  a

lavatory? He did not make that quite clear.  If  it

was  just  one-room in a tenament house, where  the

tenants  have to have common facilities for cooking

and  bathing,  then  his $20 rental  per  month  is

exorbitant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not told the House how many units he hopes

to  build for the year; and how many units of  one-room flats and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



how  many units of two-room flats he hopes to build

with this money. So, if we could have these answers

plainly  and simply without embarking on a  tirade,

the  Opposition  Members would be grateful  to  the

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this present Budget debate has been a field day for

the  Opposition Members. Never have  they  been  so

vociferous  and  demanding in their  questions  and

queries. Of course, it is only part of the game.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I must from now on

stop  all irrelevancies. I think hon. Members  must

realise that Budget time in Committee of Supply  is

really  Opposition time. It is in  fact  Opposition

time in every parliament in the world. This is  the

only opportunity that the Opposition has of shining

a searchlight on Government work.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Excuse me, Sir, I was going to

say  that they have been trying to show the  people

of   Singapore  that  they  are  the  watchdogs  of

Government  expenditure. I do  not  think  that  is

irrelevant. I would like to tell them that  we,  on

this   side  of  the  House,  have  more   vigilant

watchdogs  than  all  the  Opposition  Members  put

together. There is no denying the fact that all the

pressing claims of the various Ministries have been

assiduously checked and re-checked and  trimmed  so

that  we have now a budget which has been acclaimed

by  all  the  people of Singapore, which  has  been

called an expansion budget, and which has even been

called  a Christmas present. If that is not a  good

budget



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are now on loans to a

Housing  Authority. Perhaps the  hon.  Member  will

talk  about  the  Housing  Authority,  loans,   and

housing  and  not about the budget in  general.  We

have dealt with that already.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Excuse me, Sir, those were all

just  prefacing remarks. As we know, the Opposition

Members  did  say something about $400 million  for

housing. But, Sir, the whole budget next year  only

amounts to about $260 million. Therefore we  should

look at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>



things  in their proper perspective. Since  housing

is  only one part of Government expenditure, it  is

not  expected  that  all the  money  should  go  to

housing. It is through the diligent working of  our

Ministers that we have, as the Minister for Finance

has  previously  said,  a budget  that  is  equally

proportioned in all ways and in every direction, so

that  Singapore can really be proud of  her  budget

which can be called a Christmas present.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards housing, they have been belabouring

the point, and that is that, at the present moment,

the  Singapore Government has not the staff and the

technical  skill  to carry out  its  programme.  We

would  like  to  remind them that  with  all  their

technical skill and all their staff in the previous

years,  the  previous Government  managed  only  to

produce   reservoirs  that  cracked,  houses   with

foundations  that  were  loose  and  which  finally

tilted - I come from Queenstown and I happen to  know

a little about what happened to those houses there.

In  other  words,  something must have  gone  wrong

between  the drawing board and the actual building.

And   for   that,   I   think,  true   and   honest

administrative skill will have to be required. That

the  P.A.P.  Government has not as yet demonstrated

to the Opposition as regards housing. But it is not

too  late for the Opposition to criticise after  we

have  been  shown  that we are  also  not  as  good

workers as the previous Government were.



<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, the Member for Cairnhill wants to know how

we  are  going  to  carry out an efficient  housing

programme.  Before we talk about the  1960  housing

programmes  in  the S.I.T., we must tell  the  hon.

Member  what we have done for the past four months.

First of all, however, the Member says he wants  to

know  how we are going to use part of the money  in

the  Estimate.  He warns us not to talk  about  the

previous  Government. But if we do not compare  the

present  Government  with the past  Government,  we

cannot show the Opposition Members the good or the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



bad; without comparison, we do not know the good or

the bad points of a thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the P.A.P. has taken office as the

people's  Government, we want to build  houses  for

the  poor  people. We must know the wishes  of  the

people,  and  we  must  satisfy  them.  Since   our

Government  took  office,  corruption  in  the  old

S.I.T. has  been eradicated. We started  our  true

work  from  August this year. At the Kampong  Tiong

Bahru  fire  site, the Kampong Koo Chye fire  site,

and  the  Jalan  Eunos  Malay Settlement,  we  have

completed   1,364   units   of   low-cost   houses.

Furthermore,  at  Macpherson Road there  are  2,368

units  of  houses.  We have done piling  for  these

houses.  By  the  end of this year,  we  expect  to

complete  3,732  low-cost houses. We  are  able  to

complete, within this period of 4 months, more than

3,000  units of houses. This can be said  to  be  a

very noteworthy effort. The old Government was  far

behind this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to tell Members of this House that in 1955

the  S.I.T. planned to build houses for  the  poor

people  in  Jalan Eunos. But from 1955 to  1958  we

still saw that the place was as bald as the head of

a  Buddhist monk! But during the past few months of

our  office,  the S.I.T. under the new  Government,

together  with the local engineers and  architects,

have  started to build 100 detached houses together

with  50  two-room and a hail houses and 50  three-room  and  a  hall houses on the two  sites - Kampong

Tiong Bahru and Kampong Koo Chye. These houses will

be  completed in January next year and we will then

let  the Opposition Members see them. We hope  they

will  go  there  and see and appreciate  our  great

effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, everyone has heard that the Lim Yew

Hock  Government  at that time expressed  beautiful

sentiments  in  the Press, that it was  unfortunate

for  the  poor  people to suffer from these  fires.

They  promised to complete the building  of  houses

within  a  period of three months for the  victims.

But  after  three  months had elapsed,  the  people

still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>



could  not have the houses until the present  time,

when  the P.A.P. took over the Government.  We  are

truly  and honestly building houses for these  poor

people. The old Government said something but  they

did  not  do  it. Because of these empty  promises,

they  failed in the last elections. I can tell  the

Opposition  Members,  especially  the  Member   for

Farrer Park and the Member for Cairnhill, this: if

you  are  free, please drive your car from East  to

West,   and  from  South  to  North  and  see   for

yourselves. For example, Kampong Eunos, please  see

for  yourselves  that houses have been  built,  one

block  after another. The victims of the fires  can

therefore  go  back  there  and  stay  with   their

families.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Lady must remember

that  she  is addressing the Chair. She should  not

address  the  Members direct. If the interpretation

is correct, I think she is using the second person.



<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am sorry,

Mr Speaker. Because I see they are very interested

in  this subject, I therefore address them.  Excuse

me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this short period of a few months, we have completed many houses. We did not

have a lot of money to have this reorganised S.I.T.

authority. We know that for 1959 the old Government

appropriated  a sum of $7 million for  the  S.I.T.,

but  in  1958 the money was more than $21  million.

There  was therefore a great difference. From this,

we  know that the old Government did not take  care

of  the housing problem of the people of Singapore.

They  simply  played their tactics  to  gain  their

political positions. They understood that when  the

new Government took office the new Government would

be  faced with difficulties in tackling the housing

problem  with the sum of $7 million for the  S.I.T.

In  this short period we have made use of only one-fourth  of  this amount. The Minister for  National

Development said that this time we are catering for

the majority of the poor people in respect of their

housing problems. Therefore we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



build  houses at a low cost in order to  cater  for

the majority of the poor people. We have confidence

in  the ability of our local engineers and are able

to  utilise their talents. At present, we  have  in

mind many sites suitable for building purposes.  We

are  now waiting for the consultations between  the

Minister  for National Development and the Minister

for  Finance to take place. After this,  I  believe

that   in   1960  we  will  have  more   surprising

achievements, and I hope, at that time,  every  one

of  the  Opposition Members will admire  our  great

achievements, which are a reflection of the ability

of this Government.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I have heard at length the

speeches  from  the Government, from  the  Minister

right   down   to   the  Government  back-benchers.

Originally  the  debate arose from  two  questions.

First, how many houses can be built? Secondly where

are  the  houses  to be built? Only two  questions.

Unfortunately, the debate has gone astray,  to  the

extent  that I myself am confused as to whether  we

are  today discussing matters concerning the budget

generally,  or matters concerning the  policies  of

the  past  Government. However,  since  I  was  the

Minister for Housing in the past Government, it  is

appropriate  for me to clarify one or  two  matters

which  I  think otherwise might lead to  confusion.

Just  now  - the  Minister for National  Development

told  us  that  in  the Tiong Bahru  area  low-cost

houses have been built, at $1,544 per unit, whereas

under  the previous Government, such a house  would

cost $2,260. This may be so, but we must not forget

that  the  house costing $2,260, unlike that  which

was  built  at  Tiong  Bahru, required  piling  or

foundation. Therefore the cost naturally was higher

compared  with the houses mentioned by the Minister

just  now.  Similarly the houses at  Kallang - $4,159

for  a  two-room house. The present Government  say

they  could  build a similar type of house  costing

only $2,986.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, here again, in Kallang as you know, the houses which were built



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>



required   piling  and  therefore  the  cost   was

sometimes one-third or one-fourth or so more  than

that of the present houses. So there is no need to

compare   the  houses  erected  by  the   previous

Government  at a higher cost and those erected  by

the  present Government at a lower cost.  In  this

connection, the Minister surely can see the houses

at  Bukit  Panjang  where there was  a  Government

programme  for  erecting 2,500 units  of  two-room

houses complete with modern sanitation. Their cost

was  low. The reason why it was possible to  build

such  houses at a low cost was that there  was  no

necessity for piling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which he referred to just now is

about the so-called `flying saucer' type of house.

The  house  was built in 1954 before Tun  Lim  Yew

Hock's  government came into power. It  was  built

during  the  Colonial  government.  Therefore  the

blame  cannot be shifted on to us. Another  point;

one of the Government Members said that the P.A.P.

Government,  during  a space of  six  months,  has

managed to build 1,664 houses. If that is true,  I

congratulate  the Government. But in  my  opinion,

programmes  to build these houses were  formulated

by  the previous Government, in the same way as in

April  1955, when the Coalition Government assumed

office, we carried on with the work of the  former

Government.  Therefore, since 1955,  houses  which

were  erected then were not as a result  of  plans

formulated by the Government of Mr David Marshall

or Tun Lim Yew Hock. They were merely carried over

from the previous Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which was raised in the debate

concerned housing in the Malay Settlement at Jalan

Eunos.  This scheme, Mr Speaker, was from my  own

plan.  The previous Government originally did  not

agree to this scheme but because I pressed on with

it,  not as a Minister but as a representative  of

the electorate there, the Government then accepted

the  scheme. Agreement was reached only  in  1958,

not  in  the early part of 1958, but in the latter

part.  The site is on Crown land but we have  made

provision whereby we would put aside



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



money to the amount of $384,000 for the purpose of

building  120  houses  to be  sold  to  successful

applicants for Crown land in the Malay Settlement.

So  it  cannot be said that this matter  has  been

delayed.  We  have already prepared a  scheme  and

money  has  been  allocated.  At  that  time   the

Government  was in negotiation with the applicants

for  land  in  the Malay Settlement.  But  because

these   approved  applicants  were  the   would-be

purchasers of the houses, the negotiations between

the  Land Office and the applicants for land  were

necessarily  protracted for  some  time,  until  a

Malay-house   type  of  plan  was   agreed   upon.

Agreement  was  reached early this  year.  In  the

meantime,  the  elections  came  and  the  present

Government was obliged to proceed with the scheme.

But from what I hear it seems that the Govvernment

has  altered slightly the original scheme  from  a

Malay-type of house to another type of house. This

is the responsibility of this Government. I do not

intend  to dwell at length on this subject  except

to  say  that  the  housing scheme  in  the  Malay

Settlement  was  originally  a  scheme  which   we

formulated.  Mr Speaker, that briefly  is  all  I

wish to comment on.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on the query from the

Opposition  Member for Cairnhill, the  Member  for

Farrer  Park, and the Member for Tanglin and  also

from  the  Member for Geylang Serai, I am  of  the

opinion  that  this is a small and simple  matter.

Our  Government  proposes to formulate  a  housing

scheme with that $25 million, and we are sure that

we  can  carry  out  the programme.  Answers  have

already  been  given but I wish to talk  a  little

about  the Malay Settlement, mention of which  was

made  by the Member for Geylang Serai. The  Member

said that the plan was delayed. In actual fact, we

can  say that the Member has been going round  and

round  the  mulberry bush. The object of  building

low-cost  houses  in the Malay  Settlement  is  to

provide  houses for the lower income  group,  say,

for those drawing less than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



$400  a month. But if we examine carefully the list

of successful applicants who received allocation of

Crown  land  in the Malay Settlement we  will  find

that they were not the hawkers or taxi-drivers, but

they  were,  shall we say, people from the  middle-class group. There was no opportunity for the lower

income group. When this Government assumed office I

discovered   that  the  previous   Government   had

allocated  not $380,000 but $340,000 to build  low-cost  houses.  Among the applicants, I  found  some

who,  when the allocation for land was approved  in

June, had hurriedly built their houses without,  in

the  first place, submitting their plans or waiting

for  approval from the Land Office, as though  they

wanted  to  avail themselves of the opportunity  to

build  these houses before the old Government  went

out  of  office.  We found that houses  were  built

before   plans   were  submitted  to   the   proper

authorities.   Hence   there   was   a   delay   in

implementing the low-cost housing scheme. This  was

to  ensure that the allocation of Crown land in the

Malay  Settlement  was  not abused.  Now,  we  have

altered  slightly  the  type  of  house  from   the

original  type. If we adhere to the original  plan,

with  that  little amount of money  only  very  few

houses  could be erected. Therefore, with a  slight

amendment  to the former Malay-type of  house,  and

with the same amount of money, more houses could be

built,  which  means that more poor people  can  be

housed  in  the  Malay Settlement. On  this  scheme

tenders  have been invited and accepted,  and  work

has already commenced, and I think, within the next

two or three months, we will be able to see some of

the   down-trodden   masses  live   in   a   better

atmosphere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, I feel very strange to see  that  the

Opposition  Members  are nervous,  perhaps  because

they think they were accused by us, but they do not

know   that  our  Ministers  and  colleagues   have

answered them very correctly and fully. One of them

has asked where the places will be for building low-cost houses next year. But the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



Minister has already explained it. They will be  in

Tiong  Bahru,  Geylang, Aljunied.  Furthermore,  we

have said that the cost of a one-room flat, if I am

not  wrong, is $13,400, and of a two-room flat,  it

is  $22,060.  Did the Opposition Members  not  hear

these  words,  or were they sleeping? Mr  Speaker,

just now our colleagues have said that we cater for

the  needs of the poorer people in respect of their

housing  problems. Our Government have tried  their

best  to give the poorer people housing facilities.

We  hope next year we will build many more low-cost

houses for the Opposition Members to see.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

I  do  not wish to speak at length on this  debate,

because  I  see  that  it has  been  centred  round

Singapore - from the $25 million loan to the Housing

Authority   under   the   Ministry   of    National

Development.  As  my  colleague,  the  Member   for

Geylang  Serai, has said, the question of  erecting

Malay-type houses in the Malay Settlement was under

his   charge.  For  my  part,  I  congratulate  the

Government  today for looking after my constituency

and  building houses; this matter is now well taken

care of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two points which I wish to

direct  to the Member for Bukit Timah, who is  also

the  Chairman  of  the  Malay Settlement  at  Jalan

Eunos, whether



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Bukit Timah is the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

National Development, so he ought to be referred to

as the Parliamentary Secretary of that Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Thank you, Mr

Speaker.   So   I   direct  my   comment   to   the

Parliamentary  Secretary.  To  the   best   of   my

knowledge,  I know that many people have registered

for  building  sites  for the purpose  of  building

houses,  with  Government help or  with  their  own

money. Are these selections made in accordance with

the  plans carried out by a committee which was set

up previously, or how are the selections



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



made?  Another point - as far as I know, most of  the

people,  whether Malays, Chinese or  Indians,  need

low-cost houses so that they may be able to get the

help  of  the Government, and at the same time  pay

monthly  instalments. Will the Government  increase

the number of houses which are being built in Jalan

Eunos, or will they go for a new type of house,  or

is  the  Government scheme as cheap as  the  scheme

which is carried out now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, can the Government clarify

whether   the   successful  applicants   can   make

application with a view to getting Government help?

Are   such   applications  entertained?  Are   such

applications  included  in  this  budget   of   $25

million? I ask these questions because I know  many

of the applicants coming from that constituency and

I  know  their troubles. There are people who  made

applications many years back, but owing to lack  of

funds  they  were forced to borrow  or  pawn  their

belongings. It is entirely up to them  now.  So  in

order  to avoid the hardships they have experienced

and  to  save them from getting into debt  in  that

manner,  can the Government be generous  enough  to

loan them money?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I understand the hon. Member

is suggesting that the Government should lend money

for  the  purchase  of land. I  am  just  wondering

whether that topic in fact comes under the Head  we

are   discussing.  Perhaps  the  Minister  can  say

whether that topic comes under loans to the Housing

Authority?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The answer is no and, therefore, I

must  rule  that  it is outside the  scope  of  the

particular item.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I do not

wish to elaborate further. I now await replies from

the  authorities. I will welcome them. I hope  with

this  vote  we can accomplish great things  in  the

future.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

I  did not think there was any need to reply to the

Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



for Geylang Serai and Kampong Kembangan.  But

since  you  have allowed that, I will  reply.  This

matter  does not come under the scope  of  the  $25

million vote. Therefore, there is no need for me to

reply  to  the  queries raised by  the  Member  for

Kampong Kembangan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the item of

$25  million  appearing as  loans  to  the  Housing

Authority, the Minister for National Development in

his  speech to the Assembly just now said  that  so

far  as  rentals  are concerned (rentals  which  he

proposes  to  charge),  there  will  be  no  hidden

subsidies.  Could  the Minister  therefore  in  his

reply to us also inform the House, particularly  as

the item appears as loans to the Housing Authority,

whether  the  Government  proposes  to  charge  the

Housing  Authority any interest, and  if  so,  what

interest;  whether  it is on an annuity  basis,  or

whether  it is a loan which has to be paid back  to

the Government in 10 years, 20 years or 30 years in

respect of which the Housing Authority will set  up

a sinking fund?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will turn to pages 430

and  432, the Singapore Improvement Trust, to  whom

moneys were lent under items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  6,  7,

and 8. These moneys were lent from time to time and

the  manner  of the repayments is set  out  on  the

respective opposite pages. The total amounts repaid

on  the  sums  already lent to the  Trust  come  to

almost $4.75 million. I raise this question  for  a

specific  purpose. In the rentals which  the  Trust

has fixed for these properties, there is an element

for  the repayment of interest to Government. There

is  a  further  element in respect of  the  amounts

which  are annually repayable to Government on  the

capital  account. For a number of years, the  Trust

had  been trying to persuade the Government  either

to  give  these moneys as an outright gift  to  the

Trust or, if the Government did not find itself  in

a  position to give it as a gift, at least  not  to

charge  interest. The reason for the  Trust  asking

for  that position to be achieved, Mr Speaker, was

this: that if the moneys were given to the Trust by

way of a gift, then the Trust could reduce by about

40



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



per  cent  the rentals and, therefore,  the  public

would  enjoy  the benefit of these  reduced  rents.

Therefore,  it is relevant for this House  to  know

whether this $25 million, which is about to be lent

to  the Housing Authority by the Government,  is  a

loan  by  way  of  interest, or whether  it  is  an

outright  gift;  or if it is a loan, in  how  many

years would it be repayable, or whether there is to

be an annuity charge?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Minister would like to

wind up?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member for

Farrer  Park is still thinking in terms of the  old

S.I.T.,  when the S.I.T. fought with the Government

for  lower interest or no interest, or for  a  free

gift,  on  their  loans for housing  purposes.  The

People's  Action Party Government do not  think  on

the  same lines in finance. We do not like, as  the

Chinese  proverb says, "To cut out the left  sleeve

of  the  shirt in order to patch the right sleeve."

This is, after all, an inter-governmental item.  If

the S.I.T. do not have to pay interest on the loan,

it  means the Ministry of Finance has to incur  the

cost  of borrowing the money from the public, which

might mean less hospitals and less schools. On  the

same  basis, if no interest is charged on loans  to

other  boards  like the Telephone Board,  it  might

mean  less  houses.  Mr  Speaker,  we  work  on  a

different system. The Government is a whole set-up,

whether  it  is  a  Ministry or a department  or  a

statutory corporation. The Ministry of Finance does

charge  interest on the loans, but the  details  of

the  loans, the rate of interest and the  repayment

terms  have not been settled. They will be  settled

in due course, but I wish to assure the House that,

whatever they are, it makes no difference at all to

the functions of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, the S.I.T. was more or less

independent of Government control, subject only  to

its  Yearly  Report to the Minister for  Lands  and

Housing.  In  those circumstances, the persons  who

ran  the S.I.T., namely the Trustees, and the civil

servants in the S.I.T., always thought in terms  of

getting more concessions for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



themselves - less  interest  or,  if   possible,   an

outright loan or getting an outright gift to  build

houses.  This would mean more money for the  S.I.T.

This  would  also  mean more chances  of  receiving

corruption,   in  the  meantime   to   fulfil   its

construction of so many units per year, at  rentals

with hidden subsidies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not believe in charging rentals by such

methods,  because  it is not a  real  reduction  of

costs.  A  real reduction of costs is  achieved  by

checking  corruption  and having  better  planning,

layout and sites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since the debate began on the budget, we have heard hon. Members of the

Opposition talking of nothing else on housing,  but

that  there are no plans, no units being built,  no

architects and engineers, and that nothing  can  be

done. Mr Speaker, this is not the first time  that

I  have  heard these allegations. As  a  matter  of

fact,  I have heard them many months ago. There  is

still  a  certain  section of the  people  of  this

country  who believe that when the expatriates  are

being  replaced by local people, what can the local

people  do?  This section could be the  expatriates

who  still  stay in this country, or  it  could  be

those  local people who have no faith  in  our  own

people running this country.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that in the next few months more of

such  questions will come: no expatriate architects

in  the  S.I.T. and the P.W.D.; no schools will  be

built  because we have no expatriate engineers  and

architects; no houses will be completed; no  plans,

no  specifications, no programmes, nothing at  all.

What  can  our local people do? Just  now  we  have

given complete proof that our local architects  and

engineers and local management can do as  good  as,

if  not  better than, the expatriates whom we  have

replaced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the struggle against colonialism in this country still carries on, and this is a part

of  the  struggle.  Some might  say  that  low-cost

housing  is divorced from politics, but I say  that

in  the  matter  of  building  hospitals,  schools,

houses, politics comes in. Even in the case of  the

Rent Conciliation Board,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



and  in the approving of plans. The hon. Member for

Farrer  Park  said  just now that  he  was  on  the

Planning  Committee  - but I am sure,  Mr  Speaker,

when plans were submitted to the Planning Committee

by the firm of Tan, Rajah and Cheah



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Honourable the

Minister  is  not  setting a very good  example  by

being  so  irrelevant in this debate.  I  think  we

should now try and confine ourselves to sub-head 1,

which  is  "Loans  to  Housing Authority".  I  have

indicated  that the debate should now  continue  on

relevancies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, but I

was trying to reply to a point raised by the Member

for  Farrer Park about his sitting on the  Planning

Committee,  and  about  the corruption  there.  The

Member  for Farrer Park was trying to play up  this

$415  million programme which we have planned  out.

The   S.I.T. had  put  up  this  programme,   but

unfortunately  it leaked out and was  published  in

the  Press.  This  programme shows  the  organising

ability  of  the S.I.T. It does not  say  that  the

Government  will carry out the programme.  It  says

that the S.I.T. recognises the need for housing and

that it has the organisation ready to carry out the

building of so many houses. But, Mr Speaker, as  a

result  of  the  lavish spending  of  the  previous

Government,  and even after the "windfall"  due  to

the  sale of Christmas Island for $20 million to  a

foreign  government, we cannot do  better  than  to

allocate $25 million for housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Cairnhill said that his

Government  had allocated $30 million in  1957.  We

are not comparing our first year of office with the

third  year  of  office of his government.  We  are

comparing what the Lim Yew Hock Government had done

in  its  first year and what the P.A.P.  Government

has  done in its first year. In the 1955-6  Budget,

which  was  the first Budget of the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government,  $9 million was allocated  to  housing;

whereas   in   the  first  Budget  of  the   P.A.P.

Government, $25 million has been allocated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



to  housing. Of course, we realise that the Lim Yew

Hock Government later increased the money allocated

to  housing  in 1957 to $28 million,  and  not  $30

million,  and  which later in 1959  dropped  to  $7

million for the building of houses in Kampong Tiong

Bahru and Kampong Koo Chye.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we assure the people of this country that we have the organisation, and the policy to

build really low-cost houses for the benefit of the

people.  With  the money available, we  can  build,

say,  approximately 8,000 units, excluding the cost

of  land. Lands are already available to the S.I.T.

We  have enough land to build for another 5  to  10

years,  and  whatever  money is  allocated  by  the

Government,  we will make use of it to the  fullest

extent on the construction of low-cost housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D14 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 2, Mr Speaker, shows "Rural Development

Projects  $800,000". I would like to know from  the

Minister  what the rural development  projects  for

the year 1960 are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the 1960 Budget is

a  budget  which  was not framed  entirely  by  the

P.A.P.  Government.  It  takes  nearly  a  year  to

complete the framing of a budget. When we came into

office, the budget was more or less completed,  and

we  could  only make certain amendments, and  there

was  not enough time for each department to  submit

detailed  schemes of development. That is why,  you

will  notice, Mr Speaker, that in the  Development

Budget  as well as in the Main Estimates for  1960,

most   of  the  items  have  a  qualifying  clause,

"Subject  to  Treasury sanction".  There  are  many

items  for  the benefit of rural development.  But,

Mr  Speaker, until we have finalised  the  details

with  the Ministry of Finance, I am sorry we cannot

release them. But we will do so as soon as we  have

finalised the details with the Treasury.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Is there something so very top secret

about these projects for 1960 that the House cannot

know what they are?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the field of rural

development is entirely new. Despite the fact  that

the previous Chief Minister had the so-called Rural

Development Commissioner's Office placed under  his

direct  charge,  what  had  the  Commission   done?

Practically nothing at all. For the first  time  in

this  country, the Government is looking after  the

welfare  of the farmers and those who live  in  the

rural  areas. The $800,000 allocated for 1960 would

be  mainly  devoted to the development of  projects

for  the benefit of farmers and fishermen. In order

to  be able to meet the demands of these 30,000  to

40,000  families of farmers and fishermen who  have

been  completely neglected in the past, we  require

many millions of dollars. As in the case of housing

which we have debated just now, there is a shortage

of  funds  in  the  Government.  The  Minister  for

Finance has done his best to allocate $800,000  for

the  purpose  of rural development.  This  $800,000

will not go a long way, but we have to be satisfied

with  what we can get at the moment. We have a long

list  of  things which we want to do; for instance,

the  Sungei  Poyang project, where it  is  intended

that  swamps  should be reclaimed in order  that  a

section  could  be  used for prawn  ponds,  another

section  could  be  used for the rearing  of  fresh

water  fish, and the upper reaches of the river  to

be  reclaimed  and  used  for  the  cultivation  of

vegetables.  We  have  also in  mind  projects  for

helping  fishermen, by the construction of  jetties

in  order  that they can land their fish much  more

easily,  and other aids to fishermen. We have  also

schemes  to  help the co-operatives;  how  to  grow

tapioca  on a mass scale; investigations  into  the

breeding of chickens and pigs; investigations  into

the     scientific    growing    of     vegetables;

investigations into the best conversion  ratio  for

pig-feed  and  chicken-feed, and  many  other  such

schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government has limited funds. We are faced with competing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



demands on the limited amount of  money  at

our  disposal. In the Department of Rural  Welfare,

we  are  also  faced  with the same  problem-  many

competing  demands for the amount  of  money  which

this  Government can afford to give. When  we  have

decided  on the priorities in conjunction with  the

Ministry of Finance, Mr Speaker, we shall disclose

the  details  in full and there will be opportunity

then for the Member for Farrer Park to ask all  the

questions he wants to ask in the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, it would appear that the

Minister's  admission  is this:  that  although  he

would like to spend very much more than $800,000 on

his  rural development projects, he has been unable

to  agree with the Minister for Finance as  to  the

exact  projects which the Minister would allow  him

to  carry  forward during the year 1960. I  do  not

wish   to   embarrass  the  Minister  for  National

Development at this juncture, but I would  like  to

remind  him that once this House passes this  vote,

it  has no further control over the spending of the

money, except for the Minister for Finance in whose

safe  hands we can commit it to. In view  of  that,

Mr Speaker, may I withdraw the amendment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under sub-head 4, as far as I can see, there

are  two  items,  (1) and (2), which  are  revotes.

These are projects which are to have commenced this

year  but  have been postponed and are now included

in next year's Budget. I would like the Minister to

confirm  this and to explain why it has been  found

necessary to have two separate heads: (1) Works and

Buildings under Head D14, and (2) Rural Board under

Head D19, under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



which  there are similar items. Is it necessary  to

have  two separate heads? Could they not be  lumped

into one Head?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the point I would like to have

information on is this: whether all the  plans  for

these  four projects are now well on paper  to  the

extent  that  they can be commenced  and  completed

during  the  course  of next year;  whether  it  is

intended  that all these roads should be  built  by

Government  labour; or whether it is intended  that

they  should  go  out to contract;  or  how  it  is

proposed  that  these roads should  be  constructed

during  the year 1960, by voluntary labour  or  any

other form of labour?



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, this is what it

is.  The  Member for Farrer Park has no  confidence

because  he  thinks the expatriate  engineers  have

scooted  from  the P.W.D. The construction  of  the

link  road, Jurong Road/Chua Chu Kang Road, is  now

in  progress and by the end of 1959, $200,000  will

have  been spent. An additional amount of  $213,000

is  needed in order to complete the whole length of

the   road,   which  is  about  2�   miles.   The

construction   of   the  link  road,   West   Coast

Road/Jurong  Road, is an extension  of  the  former

road,  so  that we can link up West Coast  Road  to

Chua  Chu  Kang/Lim Chu Kang area.  In  the  normal

process,  this road would take about two  years  to

complete.  The total cost is $350,000. $200,000  is

being  earmarked  for the first  year  and  another

$150,000 is required in 1961 to complete the  work.

The  construction  of a third road,  a  link  road,

Serangoon Garden Estate/Braddell Road, and  another

new  road, Boundary Road/Jalan Teck Kee,  have  not

yet been started.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, under the old government and for that matter under the old City Council, there were

always  items  of  capital expenditure  which  were

passed  from  year to year. The Member  for  Farrer

Park is so used to such a habit that he thinks that

other   governments  would  also   like   to   pass

expenditure from year to year. I have seen such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



items  in  the  City  Council:  $1  million.   $100

million. For instance, the Kallang Park item in the

City Council went on from year to year - from 1956 to

1957  to 1958 - and nothing was done until the P.A.P.

Government  took  over.  We  just  constructed   it

straightaway. There was no talk about  it.  And  in

two months we completed the project.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the Member for Farrer Park got

his answer plus?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I have "plus", Sir, but no answer! If

I  were  to embark on a debate on the Kallang  Park

project,  I  should  be here for some  considerable

time until you ruled me out of order! However,  the

question I asked was whether these projects will be

carried  out  by  P.W.D. labour,  contract  labour,

voluntary labour, or any other form of labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, these new roads

are  link  roads  in the sense that  they  are  big

carriage-ways, and we require to put  the  projects

out for tender on contract.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I beg leave to withdraw?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Tun

Lim Yew Hock and Mr Thio Chan Bee-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D14 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here again, the same question arises:

whether  these  are  not revotes,  and  why  it  is

necessary  that we should have under  two  separate

heads  provision for almost the same kind of  work.

For  instance, roads and bridges appear under  this

Head.  They also appear under Head D19. It  is  the

same  with lighting. Is there a difference  between

these two, or is one complementary to the other?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member has had his

answer - two heads are better than one!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I had the thought that

perhaps this sub-head refers to the rural areas  in

the  whole  of  Singapore. If by  "rural"  we  mean

"kampong",  we know there are kampong areas  within

the  City  boundary limits which  could  really  be

treated  as  rural areas. I am asking the  Minister

whether  he would not extend to the rural areas  in

the  City boundary limits the same facilities which

are  now  being extended to those areas  under  the

Rural Board, in view of the fact that this sub-head

is  already under "Rural Board" and this particular

one  comes  under  "National Development";  because

some  of these rural areas or kampong areas  within

the  City  boundary do not have street lighting  or

roadside  drains and are in need of  footpaths  and

repairs to their lanes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing, Sir. What I would like to ask the

Minister at this point is, where the kampong people

are  eager to Improve their roads or lanes and  are

prepared  to  provide their own  voluntary  labour,

will  the  Minister  be  willing  to  provide   the

materials  and  the  mechanical equipment?  Because

that  kind  of a co-operative project  would  be  a

community project. It would be very near  to  their

hearts in view of the fact that they are working to

build  or  to repair roads and lanes in  their  own

kampongs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I must congratulate

the  Member for Cairnhill as being a shrewd  person

because, not being an accountant, he could find out

that  some  of  these items are  duplicated - in  the

Rural   Board   and  National  Development - in   the

Estimates. I myself do not know how this came  into

being,  but  I  can tell what the  figures  are.  I

believe  the  reason is that integration  is  still

going  on  in the Government Ministries, the  Rural

Board, the City Council and other statutory boards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main work on the Budget was completed before

the  P.A.P.  Government took  office,  and  in  our

trying to expedite the printing of the Budget so as

to  have money to spend in 1960, there was no  time

to   integrate   many  of  the  items   under   the

appropriate headings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the question raised by the Member for

Tanglin,  nobody  is happier than  we  are  on  the

Government  side that the Opposition  parties  have

now  slowly  realised  that  sweeping  the  drains,

building roads, building the Kallang Park  and  the

Promenade  are useful projects which are very  dear

to  the  people.  Was  it because  the  Member  for

Tanglin  yesterday in his sermon  suddenly  had  a.

change of heart, or was he taking a directive  from

the  Dean  of  the Anglican Church to come  forward

here  and  support the Government  for  working  on

voluntary projects on Sundays? I hope, Mr Speaker,

in  our  next Sunday project - we have one at  Potong

Pasir now and we shall have many more - we shall send

an  invitation to the Member for Tanglin and  other

Members of the Opposition to join us in this useful

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Thio? Volunteering?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I mentioned

this  because in the past there was a  division  of

labour between the City Council and the Government.

I  well  remember one road in the  Toa  Payoh  area

where  we asked Government to repair it. The people

there  were quite willing to help with labour,  but

the  Government said "Sorry, it is not  within  our

power;  you  must get the City Council because  the

road  is  divided into two." We went  to  the  City

Council  and  they said, "Sorry, we  cannot  do  it

because part of it is Government and you must get a

ruling  from them." I am glad that with integration

now they can do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of Sunday labour, Sir,

there  are those who, for religious reasons, cannot

do  it  and  it is written down in the Constitution

that the rights of the religious minorities must be

observed.  So  whether  it is  voluntary  or  not - I

believe it is voluntary - it is voluntary in word but

compulsory in action.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let us not enter into a debate on

can  get  voluntary work from all the  communities,

all religious bodies and all races in Singapore, if

we  can  get the support of the villagers  and  the

Special Squad, we can go a long way, and instead of

building,  say, 10 miles of agricultural roads,  we

can  build 40 miles of agricultural roads  to  help

the  kampong people, who have been ignored so  much

in the past. For this we would like to know whether

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also intended to enlarge the dispensary at

enlarging  accommodation  at  the  Tan  Tock   Seng

Hospital, expansion of the Pathology Department and

also the mortuary at Kandang Kerbau Hospital. These

are included in my development programmes which are

to  be given immediate priority. However, these are

subject to Treasury sanction.

Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Minister for Finance in  his

budget   speech   did  touch  upon   the   Economic

Development  Board, and what  it  hopes  to  do.  I

rather thought it was quite a brief statement,  and

he  did not amplify that statement probably because

he was pressed for time. I was wondering whether he

could  inform the House if this sum of $20  million

to  the  Economic Development Board is an  outright

gift



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



or by way of loan, and what he hopes the Economic

Development Board will achieve during the year

1960.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to answer the

second  question first. It is the intention of  the

Government to make the contribution of $20  million

as an outright grant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now coming to the purposes and functions of the

Board,  I  do not wish to anticipate more than  the

absolute  minimum because of two reasons.  Firstly,

one  does not want to raise the hopes of the people

unduly.  I think that is bad policy. Secondly,  the

experts for whom we have applied through the  World

Bank  will  be  coming  here before  long  and,  in

fairness  to them, I wish to leave the position  as

open as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly speaking, I would say that the primary

purpose  of  the Board would be to  assist  in  the

establishment  of new industries  in  whatever  way

possible,  either  by  lending  them  money  or  by

participating in the formation of new  enterprises.

There  is  also  the  work of preparing  industrial

sites so that the new manufacturing concerns may be

more attracted to Singapore. This would be the case

if  they  could find land, transport, power,  water

supply  and  other essentials laid  down  and  made

available for them at a very low cost.

details  as to how this $7 million will be used.  I

would ask the Minister for Labour and Law to inform

the  House  as to when these work brigades  can  be

formed.  According to the Minister for Finance,  it

would  appear  that it would be some months  before

these work brigades can be set going. I would  like

to hear from the Minister for Labour and Law how he

proposes to recruit these work brigades. Will it be

from the register of unemployed and, if so, will it

be  in  rotation, or will it be in accordance  with

age and need?

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, further to the question

raised, I would like to ask the Minister for Labour

and Law whether he is limiting this assistance only

to  the  unemployed young people, because sometimes

older  people who are unemployed may be in  greater

need,  especially when they have children  to  look

after. In such cases, they would be in greater need

of   work  than  those  young  people  without  any

dependants.  I  would  also suggest  that,  in  the

selection of the unemployed for work, it  would  be

good  to  use  a  kind of points system,  like  the

S.I.T. points system, so that there  would  be  no

charge  of  favouritism, as  could  easily  happen,

because  jobs are now so scarce and the  unemployed

are so many.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, may I be assured that - perhaps

it  is already in the mind of the Minister, but  it

could  be  made  public - in  the  selection  of  the

unemployed, consideration of political affiliations

would not be considered at all?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I

would  like to remind the Opposition benchers  that

none  of  our plans bear the imprint of  propaganda

and  panic.  We  are  going to  start  afresh.  The

previous   Government,  when  the  elections   were

drawing  very near, started to think  in  terms  of

relief  work  for the unemployed. On 1st  December,

1958, they started planning for unemployment relief

with  a  view to building up to a maximum of  about

850  by  the 16th of January. Circulars  that  were

issued



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



prove all this. They also appointed a committee  on

23rd  December, 1958, with the following  terms  or

reference:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To investigate the existing conditions of the

unemployment and the under-employment situation  in

Singapore, and to make their report thereon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To consider the existing categories and

grades  of  skills  and  to recommend  priority  as

regards  training for such skills and  others  that

may  be  envisaged and the educational  requirement

there-for, and to make recommendations for  a  full

employment policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That committee was appointed on 23rd December,

1958,  with  those terms of reference.  I  had  the

pleasure  of winding it up because we have  got  to

get  down  to  the  task of finding  work  for  the

unemployed  and not appointing committees  to  look

into  the  reasons  why there  is  unemployment  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the purpose of our plans and the object in view was adequately explained by the

Minister  for  Finance in this House  on  the  25th

November,  and I do not propose to repeat  what  he

already said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the question of the Member for

Cairnhill,  I  would say that  it  is  proposed  to

recruit through the unemployment register,  but  on

the  basis of age and need. We do not disregard the

claims  of those who are already working under  the

previous Government's unemployment scheme. They are

a  mixed  bag,  as  I have said  so  publicly  once

before.  Some  of  them are well  reported  on  but

others have bad reports. So it is our intention not

to discriminate against those people and, as far as

possible,  to  employ  those  who  have  been  well

reported on in our scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to organise young people on the

basis  of age and need into work brigades,  and  we

propose  to  have a separate brigade for  women.  I

hope  the  Member  for  Mountbatten  will  interest

herself  in these work brigades. We will  make  her

the brigade commander too, if she wants to!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here a report from the officials who have

looked  into the previous Government's unemployment

relief  scheme. They said the scheme has not worked

well, because many of the labourers who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



were  recruited  were unemployable on  the  grounds

that  since they were unemployed for so many  years

they were not amenable to discipline. Also, many of

them  were  employed from the areas in  which  they

lived.  We do not propose to recruit on that basis.

We  propose to recruit through the register, and we

do  not  restrict the recruitment to any particular

locality. The recruitment will be done on the basis

of  age  and need and according to suitability  for

the job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that we are now

making  detailed  plans and  are  processing  these

plans  with the various departments concerned.  One

of  our first duties would be to recruit and  train

the  leaders that we shall need for these projects.

Only those with a sense of dedication and duty will

be  specifically picked for this work, for  Members

of  the  House must realise that masses of  workmen

who  are employed on projects and who are not  well

selected  or badly supervised and under  inadequate

leadership   could   easily   degenerate   into   a

disorganised  rabble,  and  thereby  frustrate  the

Government's  intention. However, every  precaution

will  be taken to ensure that this does not happen,

and advance information will be given to the people

as and when works on these projects are undertaken.

That is all I propose to say at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr   Speaker,   concerning   the   subject   under

discussion,  this  House has just  heard  from  the

Minister  for Labour and Law as to how he is  going

to  carry  out his programme, that is,  how  he  is

going to spend this vote on the unemployed. As  has

been  clarified, one of the schemes is to form work

brigades  comprising youths who are considered  fit

and  suitable  to  be  engaged in  any  development

projects for Singapore. Here, Mr Speaker,  I  wish

to  give a little criticism because the problem  of

unemployment is indeed the same problem everywhere.

It  exists in every country. It is indeed a problem

which  cannot altogether be overcome. I  feel  that

the  Minister for Labour and Law, with his specific

responsibilities to solve the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



unemployment problem, must necessarily  concentrate

on  giving employment to the unemployed,  based  on

the  register  of  the unemployed,  who  have  been

waiting  for  a considerable length of time.  These

registered  unemployed persons  have  been  waiting

anxiously  as  to  when they  can  get  employment.

Moreover,  they  have  responsibilities  to   their

dependants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I think it is more appropriate that, in

giving  employment to the youth, or if we wish  the

youth to work with the object of building the State

of  Singapore  this  should  be  done  through  the

sponsorship of bodies or community centres which we

know  that  the  Minister  himself  is  trying   to

develop.  Therefore, I fail to see if there  is  an

alternative  way in order to instil the  spirit  of

awareness  among the youth. If we  do  not  recruit

from  the unemployed persons who have been  on  the

register for a considerable length of time, and  if

the  jobs  are  given  to the youths  who  have  no

dependants,  then it is not fair to the  unemployed

with dependants, who have at least two or three  or

four  or  five children, aged mothers, and likewise

aged  fathers, who are unable to work  any  longer.

That  is  my only criticism. I think, Mr  Speaker,

this  scheme  should not be used by the  Government

merely  to  recruit youths. But priority should  be

given  to  those who have been on the waiting  list

for  a long time. By so doing, we are helping  also

the dependants of the unemployed persons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I would remind the hon.

Member  for  the Southern Islands of the  good  old

proverb: "While ignorance is bliss, it is folly  to

be  wise." If he understood anything of the way  we

register  the unemployed, he would understand  that

the  registration means very little  in  Singapore.

Now,  people register and re-register for jobs.  If

you  fail  to re-register - you might have registered

in  1949  or 1954 - you are still treated  as  a  new

registrant.  The  whole  register  system  is   one

complete  shambles.  We have tried  to  bring  some

order  into  the present chaos. Since becoming  the

Government, we have asked the unemployed, who  have

previously  registered to reregister  their  names,

and, as a result, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



have today a new register of about 25,000 people on

whom  we can draw for our needs for this new labour

force.  We cannot accept the position that  anybody

who  has been on a dormant register - of about 70,000

names - for  the longest time is the person  who  has

got  first  right  to  a  job.  Such  a  thing   is

absolutely and entirely stupid, and you can  depend

on  it  that this Government does the right  thing,

and does not indulge in complete crass stupidity.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

Hon. Minister was alleging that the Member for  the

Southern Islands was stupid or whether the idea was

stupid.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The idea was stupid.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister is in such a hurry to

get  up!  If  it is just the idea that  is  stupid,

then,  of course, it is in order. But if he alleges

that the Member for the Southern Islands is stupid,

then he is out of order.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is our intention

then to draw upon those who have already registered

within  the  time that we have been the Government.

The   previous  Government's  unemployment   relief

scheme  was based on the previous dormant register.

For  that reason, they recruited lots of people who

were unemployable-people who had never been in jobs

for  years.  They were found completely  unsuitable

for the type of work they were required to do under

various capital development projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another scheme that the previous Government

introduced  was  to  give first preference  to  all

those  who  are  on  our public  assistance  relief

register.  Those who are on public  assistance  get

the first preference because, if you get them a job

on  this  project, that means you pay out  less  on

public  assistance. That is a thing  that  we  must

look  at also. We must also look at the suitability

of  the  people for this job. We must also look  at

their  age;  we  must also look at their  need.  Of

course,  we  have, as I pointed out to  Members  in

this  House yesterday, already increased the public

assistance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



vote   considerably  since   we   have   been   the

Government.  When  we came in, we  found  that  the

previous  Government  had voted  $5.5  million  for

public  assistance. We immediately  increased  that

figure  to  $6.7 million and we have  taken  it  up

further  to  $7.5 million for next  year,  so  that

where  there  are cases of real need they  will  be

catered for under our public assistance scheme. But

we  will  try to reduce the pressure on our  public

assistance scheme as much as possible. If there are

people  who  are on public assistance and  who  are

suitable  for these jobs, we will give  them  these

jobs  so  that  we  can use the  public  assistance

scheme   to  its  best  advantage,  i.e. for   the

assistance of those who are really in need. That is

how we propose to work this scheme.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, it

seems  that  the Minister for Labour  and  Law  has

different  views from those that I have  expressed.

Of course, on the question of administration, as to

how   he  is  going  to  give  employment  to   the

unemployed  by  introducing a new system,  I  agree

with  his  opinion. I know the position well,  that

all the unemployed are required to reregister. What

I intend to convey actually is, how are we going to

solve   the  unemployment  problem?  Some  of   the

opportunities  for employment should  be  given  to

those youths whose responsibilities are lesser than

those  of  the unemployed who have more dependants.

Unemployment  relief can be made through  community

centres  and an appropriate allowance can be  given

according to the days and number of hours worked on

a  certain  project. If, however, we are  going  to

have  permanent work brigades, I think  this  is  a

system  which is already outside the scope  of  our

object of giving relief to unemployed persons  with

many  dependants - wife  and  children.  I  give   an

example. We should not encourage the people so that

they make it a habit of asking for relief from  the

Government. This will weaken the spirit,  and  they

will get used to merely asking for relief from  the

Government.  In the case of a person  who  receives

public   assistance,  we  know  that  it   is   not

sufficient for his livelihood and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



that of his family - that it is not enough especially

if  he  has children who are still in school. Apart

from   their  clothing,  they  require  money   for

textbooks,  etc. With these necessary expenses,  if

the  father  receives aid from the  Social  Welfare

Department,  it will be a problem for him  to  find

extra money to spend on books and things like that.

Although  the  Government provides free  textbooks,

exercise books have to be paid for, as also  sports

fees  and  other  miscellaneous things.  These  all

require  to be paid for. Hence I am of the  opinion

that  as  regards  this scheme of the  Ministry  of

Labour  and  Law,  part  of the  opportunities  for

employment should be opened to the unemployed  with

dependants. For the unemployed youth, we  can  find

alternative  ways  to  give  them  jobs,  say,  for

instance, voluntary work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I have already made the

position  clear,  that  it  is  our  intention,  to

recruit into these work brigades those who  are  at

present  employed  under the previous  Government's

relief  scheme,  and  most of them  are  not  young

people.  Most  of them are people who  are  married

with families. Those who have got good reports will

be  readily  accepted  in our  scheme.  It  is  not

intended that the scheme should be restricted  only

to  the  young  people -  the pemuda  and  pemudi - as

referred to by the Member for the Southern Islands.

But  they  would  be a fairly representative  group

taken from a cross-section of our unemployed people

in the State. I hope that that will allay his fears

in the matter, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Extension and Development of Radio, Information

and  Publicity Services $2,000,000." Here  again  I

see  that the Treasury is holding the whip over the

Minister for Culture. But perhaps the Minister  for

Culture  might be good enough to tell  us  what  he

hopes  to do if the Minister for Finance would  let

him?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, a few days ago the Member for  Farrer

Park  rebuked  me  for  what  he  thought  was   an

unnecessarily  defensive attitude. I  have  thought

over  the matter and I quite agree with him. I will

assure  him that if I take any attitude it will  be

an  offensive one subject, of course, to any ruling

on your part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his observations on the special

expenditure on extension and development of  radio,

information and publicity services, I would like to

assure the Member for Farrer Park that the business

of  trying to divide and rule does not work on this

side  of  the House. It is true this $2,000,000  is

subject to Treasury sanction - but I and the Minister

for Finance get on like a house on fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the special projects that we have in mind,

here again I would not like to take the Member  for

Farrer  Park as much into my confidence as I  would

the  Minister  for Finance, but I can  say  that  a

substantial proportion of the $2 million  would  be

spent on commercial broadcasting, of which you have

had  a  hint  in  the speech by  the  Minister  for

Finance.    We   hope   to   introduce   commercial

broadcasting  some  time in June.  I  do  not  know

whether the Member for Farrer Park is interested in

commercial radio, but if he is, I would inform  him

that it will be on a modest scale. It will not be a

separate  service, but it will be  a  part  of  the

national  service in that its air  time  will  come

from the national programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another scheme that we have in mind (as I have

indicated, I think, on a previous occasion)  is  to

build  a  number  of  very  small  open-air  stages

throughout  the island so that concerts like  Aneka

Ragam Ra'ayat can be brought to more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



places  in  the island. In fact, I think  one  such

theatre  has already been started in King George  V

Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also propose to start short-wave broadcasts

early  next  year and establish reading  rooms  and

more  news  boxes,  because,  unlike  the  previous

Government,  we  have obviously more  to  tell  the

people. We find that the number of boxes bequeathed

to us by the past Government is insufficient, so we

are  establishing  more news boxes  throughout  the

island  where  we can display posters telling  what

the Government is doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If hon. Members opposite do not know what to do

during the evenings and if they take a stroll along

Nicoll Highway or Kallang Park-

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, it is not deserted. What we

that  people can not only enjoy the view  but  also

listen  to excellent music. When Members  from  the

Opposition  have  done with  the  debates  in  this

Assembly,  and  if  they  do  stroll  along  Nicoll

that what he was really meaning to tell me was that

most of this money will go into capital expenditure

either  in  the form of buildings or equipment.  In

view of that, Sir, may I have leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

On  a  point  of  information, Mr  Speaker,  as  I

understand it, this provision is the balance  of  a

three-year  programme. In the remarks column  there

is  a  $375,000 contribution. I do not quite follow

that  remark. Does it mean that it has already gone

into   the  income  estimates  somewhere  in   some

previous   year,  or  whether  this  is   just   an

indication  that  the  $2,154,000  voted  was   not

entirely out of Government funds?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand

that  this money was promised by the Lee Foundation

and that it will be paid in whenever we request the

money.

that extent?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member for Farrer Park

does  not  appear  to have looked  at  the  correct

column.  The  amount to be voted is $1,454,630  and

$2,154,000 is only an estimated cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, Sir, I appreciate it. But there

is   a  note  in  the  remarks  column  which  says

"Includes  contribution of $375,000  from  The  Lee

Foundation", and the total cost of the project,  as

I  see it, is $2.154 million. As the information is

that  this $375,000 has not yet been received,  the

question which follows on that, Sir, is, if it were

received,  would  it reduce the  revised  estimated

cost to that extent?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

fully  equipped  to  answer  the  question  in  any

confidence, but I doubt whether that would  be  the

case. It may be that the note in the remarks column

means that the whole project has taken into account

the  very  generous offer from the Lee  Foundation.

But  I will check on that, and if the guess that  I

have now made is incorrect, I will duly inform him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Mr  Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1957, an international conference of 17

maritime  countries met at Brussels to discuss  the

limitation of the liability of owners of  sea-going

ships.  As  a  result  of this conference,  certain

agreements were made and these agreements have been

included in the United Kingdom Shipping Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, being a free port for the ships of the

world,   should   rightly  have  uniform   shipping

legislation  in harmony with those countries  which

send their ships to our port. It is the purpose  of

this  Bill to include certain provisions which have

been  made  in  the  international  convention   at

Brussels of 1957. The objects of this Bill  briefly

are twofold:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To extend the limits of the scope of

liability;



The amendment reads as follows:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To increase the quantum of liability.



At present under section 340 (1) (c) and (d) of the

principal  Ordinance, the liability of  ship-owners

in  cases of loss of life, personal injury and loss

of  property to a person in another vessel  extends

only   to   occurrences  by  reason   of   improper

navigation  or management of a ship. A new  section

340  in clause 4 of the Bill extends this liability

to  include  the  infringement  of  any  right  and

extends its application to acts or omissions by any

persons  (whether aboard the ship or  not)  in  the

navigation  or  management of the ship  or  in  its

cargo  handling,  or passenger movements.  The  new

section  340 also extends application of  liability

to  any other acts or omission of persons aboard  a

ship. The new section 340, clause 1 paragraphs  (i)

and  (ii),  changes  the limits of  a  ship-owner's

liability in the cases I have mentioned earlier. In

cases of death or injury, either alone or together,

with any loss or damage to property or infringement

of  any right, the existing limit of �15 per ton of

the ship's tonnage is replaced by 3,100 gold francs

per  ton  of  the ship's tonnage. This  is  roughly

equivalent  to  Malayan  $634  per  ton  of  ship's

tonnage.  For  loss of or damage to  property,  the

present  limit is �8, or roughly Malayan  $68,  per

ton  of  the  ships tonnage. The new limit  is  the

equivalent  in  Singapore currency  of  1,000  gold

francs which approximates to Malayan $205.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (4) of the new section 340 extends

liability  under subsection (1) to  occurrences  in

connection with disposal of wrecks. Subsection  (8)

enables   the  Minister  to  set  up  a  fund   for

compensating  the harbour or conservancy  authority

in respect of any reduction in the sums recoverable

by  the  authority resulting from the operating  of

subsection  (4). This fund is to be  maintained  by

contributions collected by the authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a person on board or employed in connection

with a ship serves under a contract governed by the

law  of  any  country  which  does  not  limit  the

liability  in accordance with the new section  340,

the liability of such a person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



is  excluded  by  subsection  (7)  from   the

operation of the remainder of the new section 340.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill repeals and reenacts section

345  of the principal Ordinance to provide for  the

extension of the new liabilities of the ship-owners

to various other persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Speaker, I rise

to second the motion. May I proceed, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is an Order of the Day

and  need not be seconded. But, of course, the hon.

Member can speak.



<br><br>6.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, I should perhaps explain

that  there  has also been a need for international

co-operation  in  maritime matters.  Because  ships

sail  along international highways of the  sea  and

call  at foreign ports in which the law of the land

might differ considerably from the law of their own

native   land.   It   is  easy  to   imagine   what

difficulties could arise if ships sharing the  same

sea routes adopted different navigational rules and

practices.  Or if a ship was subject  to  different

laws  and  rules and regulations at each  different

port   at   which  she  calls.  So  the  need   for

international agreement and co-operation  has  been

recognised. And to this end, there were  held  from

time  to time international conferences from  which

emerged  international  agreement  on  matters   of

common interest and concern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House, Sir, deals with the

liability  of  shipowners to make good  losses  and

damage  which  occur in or in connection  with  the

operation of their ships. In this particular field,

Sir, it has for centuries been accepted by maritime

countries  of the world that ship-owners should  be

entitled to limit their liability for damages.  But

the  circumstances in which limitation of liability

might  be claimed and the manner in which the limit

itself is to be calculated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



have  varied considerably from country to  country.

For some 50 years, Sir, attempts have been made  to

establish uniformity in this field till at last  in

1957,  after a conference in Brussels, a Convention

emerged  which represents a substantial measure  of

agreement between the maritime nations of the world

as to the liability of owners of seagoing ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, even before the Convention, there was

United Kingdom legislation in the Merchant Shipping

Act.  But  even  in  the U.K., it  had  long  been

recognised  that the legislation was  out-dated  in

many  respects. Not least that the limit  of  their

liability was too low. The sums were, in fact,  �15

per  ton for personal injury claims and �8 per  ton

for   property  claims.  The  Brussels  Convention,

therefore, provided an excellent opportunity  which

was readily taken to bring the U.K. legislation  up

to  date  and  to  bring  it  into  line  with  the

provisions of the Convention. The result, Sir,  was

the U.K. Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners

and Others) Act, 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It amends various provisions of the U.K. Merchant

Shipping  Act  which deals with this liability.  At

this  point,  I  should explain that the  Singapore

Government  agreed  that  the  Brussels  Convention

should  be extended to Singapore. It is, therefore,

Sir,  necessary that the provisions in our Merchant

Shipping Ordinance which deal with the liability of

shipowners should be amended and brought into  line

with  the  provisions of the Convention,  in  order

that such extension may be formally effected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this, Sir, is precisely the aim and object and

the scope of the Bill which is now before the House

for its Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might, before I close, Sir, mention that the

representative   associations  of   shipowners   in

Singapore are agreeable to the application  of  the

provisions of the Convention to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

Singapore,  fixed  by  the  Minister  for  National

Development under subsection (1) of section  22  of

the  Singapore Improvement Ordinance (Cap. 259) for

the year 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it has been the practice so far to fix the Improvement Rate at 2 per cent and to

restrict the levy of the rate to properties  within

the City area. I want to make it clear that for the

year  1960 there will be no change to the  previous

practice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wording of the motion is quite different from

that  of  similar  motions introduced  in  previous

years. The difference in the wording has arisen out

of certain amendments which are made to section 22,

subsection   (1)   of  the  Singapore   Improvement

Ordinance in connection with the reorganisation  of

local   government   undertaken   by   the   former

government. In the reorganisation, certain areas in

the  Island  were transferred from the jurisdiction

of the City Council to that of the Rural Board, and

vice  versa,  with the result that the boundary  of

the  City  area  is  altered. The  purpose  of  the

amendments  to the Singapore Improvement  Ordinance

was to enable the Improvement Rate to be applied to

Singapore as a whole and, by means of orders to  be

made  by  the  Minister,  for  properties  situated

outside  the  former City area to be exempted  from

the  levy of the rate as hitherto. An order  making

this  exemption with effect from the  1st  January,

1958,  was  made by the former Minister  for  Local

Government,  Lands  and Housing  and  published  in

Gazette Notification S. 342 on 24th December, 1958.

This  exemption will continue to apply so that  the

status quo is preserved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.

contained in Paper S.L. (New Series) 25 of 1959, be

approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from time to time Courts of Investigation are

appointed under the Merchant Shipping Ordinance  to

inquire  into  shipwrecks, shipping casualties,  or

into  the  conduct or competency  of  the  officers

serving on the ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessors appointed to these Courts are paid $30

for  the  first  day of hearing and  $20  for  each

subsequent  day  or part thereof. These  sums  have

remained  unchanged since they were fixed in  1911,

and recently their inadequacy at present-day values

was  brought to my notice. While I have  taken  due

notice  of the need to increase these fees, I  have

also borne in mind the fact that remuneration for a

civic  service of this nature should not  be  based

entirely  on the present-day value of the  services

performed.  An  equitable remuneration,  therefore,

will  be to revise upwards the fees for the  second

and subsequent days of hearing, since the financial

loss  incurred by each assessor is in no  way  less

than the loss incurred in the first day of hearing.

I  have, therefore, made an amendment to the Rules,

which  are the subject to this motion, to permit  a

sum of $30 to be paid to each assessor for each day

of hearing, thus removing the existing differential

rates  between the first and subsequent days.  This

will  mean  an  increase of $10 in assessor's  fees

when the Court sits for more than one day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Members will agree that this

revision is sufficient and adequate in view of  the

considerations I have mentioned. And I may add that

shipwrecks do not occur every day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the existing Rule 4 (1) (i) of the

Registration  of Imports and Exports  Rules,  1935,

the  Imperial Government and the Government of  the

State   are  required  to  declare  their  imports,

although  particulars as to the quantity or  weight

at  c.i.f. value  need not  be  specified  on  the

declaration. As these proforma declarations are not

used  for  statistical purposes, and as imports  by

this Government are frequent and considerable,  and

it  would be inconvenient for them to declare every

import  which arrives, Rule 4 (1) (i) and  Rule  14

are  now amended to grant the two Governments  full

exemption from declaring their imports and exports,

instead of the present partial exemption on imports

only.  Similar treatment is also being extended  to

Commonwealth    Commissioners,   including    Trade

Commissioners   who  are  resident  in   Singapore.

Opportunity is also being taken to change the names
