<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would like to make an announcement on

the  merger debate. It has become increasingly  evident

during  the  last  8  days  that  in  relation  to  the

amendment proposed by the Member for Queenstown to  the

merger  motion  moved by the Minister for  Labour,  all

points of view appear already to have been advanced and

to have been thoroughly discussed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, it has been distinctly noticed that

certain  Members on both sides of the House  have  been

unable  to offer any new arguments and have,  in  fact,

repeated the arguments used by other Members.  While  a

certain amount of repetition is inevitable in a debate,

constant  repetition of the same  theme  and  the  same

arguments becomes tedious and is not permitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had occasion to refer to the relevant Standing

Order  on  this  point, and, as a further  reminder  to

Honourable  Members, I propose, to read that  Standing

Order  again. It is Standing Order No. 54 and reads  as

follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'54. The Speaker or the Chairman, after having drawn

attention  to the conduct of a Member, who persists  in

irrelevance, or tedious repetition either  of  his  own

arguments or of the arguments used by other Members  in

debate, may direct him to discontinue his speech.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent to which the debate on this matter has been

drawn out is largely due to repetitions of Members' own

arguments  or the arguments used by other  Members  and

if,  in future, the repetitions become tedious, I shall

find  myself  compelled, as I am  bound  to  under  the

Standing  Order,  to  direct  the  Member  speaking  to

discontinue  his speech. This I am always reluctant  to

do, more especially in this particular debate, which is

one on a matter of such grave import to the peoples  of

Singapore and indeed to the peoples of the whole of the

future Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is incumbent upon me as Speaker

to  ensure  that the debate is kept within  its  proper

bounds.  With  that  in view, I  called  a  meeting  of

Leaders  of  all Parties represented on the  Opposition

Benches,  the  independent  Member  on  the  Opposition

Benches,  the  Leader of the House and  the  Government

Whip  in order to ascertain whether there could be some

agreement whereby the conclusion of the present  debate

could be reached at the earliest possible moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain devices are adopted in other Parliaments to

bring  proceedings to a speedy conclusion, but  I  need

mention only two.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, time limits may be placed on the length of

speeches  and,  secondly, Members  voluntarily  subject

themselves to self-discipline in relation to  the  time

they should allow themselves and the substance of their

speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting of Members of the Opposition and the Leader

of the House was held in my Chamber this morning and it

was  agreed that the second device would best meet  the

circumstances   in   the  present  debate.   I   invite

Honourable Members to adopt the course suggested,  that

is to say, to subject themselves to self-discipline and

so  to  see  that their speeches are not  unnecessarily

lengthy and to avoid unnecessary repetitions.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Yong, a ministerial statement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today is the

second   last  day  of  the  Government  Secondary   IV

Examination to be held in the Chinese medium. There are

altogether  three  papers for today;  the  first  paper

being  Additional Mathematics, in which 83 per cent  of

the  candidates  sat for the examination,  and  at  the

moment, the second paper, which is an optional paper in

Geography,  where 1,449 candidates out  of  a  possible

2,521  candidates, that is, 58 per cent, are at present

taking this paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to inform Members of this House that

substitute papers will be prepared for those  who  have

failed  to  attend the examinations for  the  past  few

days.  They  will  be  from Monday,  4th  December,  to

Friday, 8th December, at three emergency centres;  two

next  to the Ministry of Education namely Tanglin Boys'

and   Tanglin  Girls'  Schools  and  at  the  Teachers'

Training College. I regret, however, having to draw the

attention of Members to this afternoon's Press  reports

of  further  incidents this morning between  picketers,

students  and parents in respect of those who  wish  to

take the examinations in and out of examination halls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon today, representatives from the parents of

students who are taking the examinations went to see my

Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Lee Khoon Choy, and  asked

for  police  protection. I have just been  informed  of

this,  and  my Parliamentary Secretary would like,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, to seek your permission and that  of  the

House to move a motion under Standing Order 32.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion which I intend to

move, signed by myself, the Minister for Education, the

Member  for Bukit Timah and the Member for Bukit Merah,

is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House condemns the actions of the picketers

in  obstructing,  intimidating or otherwise  forcefully

preventing students from taking their examinations, and

in  response to an appeal from parents of students  who

wish  to  take these examinations that they  and  their

children  should be afforded police protection,  hereby

resolves  that  this House supports any action  by  the

police  to  protect  students  wishing  to  take  their

examinations to ensure that they are not intimidated or

injured,  and that the students and their  parents  who

accompany  them are given free passage and access  into

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Parliamentary Secretary resume

his  seat  for  a  minute? The Hon. the  Parliamentary

Secretary seeks leave of the House under Standing Order

32 to move the following motion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House condemns the actions of the picketers

in  obstructing,  intimidating or otherwise  forcefully

preventing students from taking their examinations, and

in  response to an appeal from parents of students  who

<br><br>I might remind hon. Members of Standing Order 32, which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Notice shall not be dispensed with in the case of a

motion or in respect of any other proceeding for  which

notice  is  required  except with the  consent  of  the

Speaker and the general assent of Members present.'

that this motion be moved?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There can be no division. The motion

cannot be moved. Is there any other point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Sir, would it be in order for me to

read out the petition sent by the parents?

included in the ministerial statement. Perhaps Mr Yong

would like to continue his ministerial statement. It is

quite in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the petition is

written in Chinese.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps it could be read by the

Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  is  a  petition by the parents of students  which

they handed to me when they saw me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The preparatory Committee of the Parents-Students

Committee  appeal to the Legislative Assembly  to  take

immediate  steps  to ensure freedom of  Assemblymen  to

deal  with this matter and to take immediate steps also

to protect the freedom of the candidates taking part in

the  examination so that they can have free  access  to

the  examination  centres, and that they  will  not  be

stopped  or  hindered  by the picketers,  just  as  the

Assembly  has done so in regard to its Assemblymen.  On

the  28th  November  we presented our  opinion  to  the

Minister for Education to ask for protection for  those

students  who  wish  to  take  the  Government   common

examination  and to allow them to do so  smoothly.  The

Minister  for Education explained to them that  because

the Government wishes to avoid any conflict between the

police  and the students, it has, therefore, not  asked

the police to take any direct measure. During these few

days  the  student strikers have resorted to  force  to

stop  the  parents  and  students  from  entering   the

examination centres. For the safety of the students and

the parents, we hone that the Legislative Assembly will

also  adopt measures, just as the Assembly has  already

approved  a  resolution  to protect  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Education. In  the  same

way, it should also take steps to protect, or order the

police  to  protect, the safety of  students  and  free

access to the examination centres.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this representation and the meeting with the

Minister    for   Education,   the   student   strikers

immediately dispersed. We believe that the Assembly can

also  approve a motion permitting the police to protect

the  students and their parents and to ensure that  the

student strikers will be kept restricted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



so  that  the  candidates can take  their  examinations

freely and without hindrance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this petition has been signed by several parents

of the candidates.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The procedure in this case is this. This

is  in the form of a notice of a motion. I do not  know

whether  it is intended that this should be entered  in

Monday.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Yes, Sir. I would like this motion

is  why  I  asked  for division. You indicated  that  a

division  was not necessary. Sir, whoever  denies  this

that  we should ignore this appeal which has been  made

by -

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, today I wish to criticise  the  Minister

for  Culture  on  two  points. This  will  conclude  my

speech.  What  the  Minister  for  Education  said  was

published  on 24th November, in the Sin Chew  Jit  Poh.

The  Minister  for Education said that if  the  Barisan

Sosialis  leaders  were  sincere  in  fighting  for   a

complete  merger, then they should give up their  fight

for a full internal self-government -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Could it be made clear whether it

is  the  Minister  for  Culture  or  the  Minister  for

Education?



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister for

Culture.  He  said  the  aim  of  full  internal  self-government would negate the goal of complete merger. It

would also cause racial conflict between Singapore  and

the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret what the Minister for

Culture  said on this point. The stand of  the  Barisan

Sosialis is very clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made our proposals based on the present

situation in Singapore:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Complete merger. The content of this merger is that

defence  and  external affairs will be  vested  in  the

hands of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



the Federation Government. Singapore citizens on Merger

Day  should  automatically become Federal citizens  and

there  should  be proportionate representation  in  the

Federal Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A form of confederation. The content is that

defence  and external affairs should be vested  in  the

Federation  by arrangement, but Singapore  should  have

complete control of its internal affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If these two proposals are not acceptable to the

Federation,  then  we should put aside  our  fight  for

merger and be prepared to negotiate with Britain for  a

self-governing Singapore by 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture confused these two things. I feel that he either deliberately want-ed to confuse these two points or that he was not very clear about them. According to the analysis of the Minister for Culture, he said that if we did this, then we would be causing racial conflict between the two territories. I feel that the Minister for Culture wanted to distort our struggle through constitutional means as something

which  would  create  racial  troubles.  Secondly,  the

Minister  for  Culture  said  that  according  to   the

complete merger proposals made by the Barisan Sosialis,

under  which  Singapore citizens would  become  Federal

citizens,  Singapore citizens would lose  because  they

would  have  to  accept  the 4:1  ratio  in  the  civil

service,  which  is now applicable in  the  Federation.

Therefore,  we  said  that under the  Barisan  Sosialis

proposals,  they  would have to accept  the  fact  that

privileges would be given to Malays. I wonder if, after

merger,  the  Chinese in Singapore will  lose  and  the

Malays  will benefit from these proposals. If  this  is

so,  why  are our proposals not accepted by the  Tunku?

Does  the Tunku want to fight for the interests of only

the  Chinese?  I  cannot understand it. The  Government

said   that   the  motive  behind  our   proposals   on

citizenship  is that we want to contest an election  in

the Federation to sit in the Federal Parliament. I want

to issue a challenge. If the citizens of Singapore will

derive any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



benefits from all this, after merger then we will  make

every sacrifice to achieve this aim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the amendment of the Barisan

Sosialis  because  it  proposes  that  the  people   of

Singapore will get more democratic rights after merger.

<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I think the amendment proposed  by  the

Member  for  Queenstown  is not  sincere.  Let  me  now

analyse   the  proposals.  What  is  their  object   in

proposing  this amendment? The question of  merger  was

raised  and discussed when they were in the  P.A.P.  At

that time, the Member for Queenstown did not object  to

our  proposals  on  merger. Why  does  he  now  hold  a

different  opinion on this question? This  year,  there

have been some changes in our Party. The Members of the

Barisan  Sosialis launched a revolution to  ensure  for

themselves the posts of Prime Minister and Ministers. I

want  to tell the people of Singapore that they do  not

want  to fight for the benefit of the people. They want

to fight for their own personal interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Anson by-election, the break-away from our

Party  was  mainly  due  to the demand  of  some  trade

unionists  that  they  should have  a  discussion  with

Britain  for  full internal self-government.  That  was

after  our  defeat  in  Hong Lim.  That  is  why  these

politicians  are  now sitting on the other  side.  They

have  defected from our Party. Therefore,  we  can  say

that  they are waverers. They do not have a firm stand.

They are politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me ask this question. What are

the  fears  of the trade unions if merger is achieved?

As  far  as  I understand, the question of  merger  was

raised  by the Prime Minister of the Federation,  Tunku

Abdul  Rahman. The P.A.P. then agreed to his  proposals

in  principle,  because  this  is  what  we  have  been

fighting for since the inception of our Party. At  that

time, some colonial officers came to Singapore and this

caused fears in the trade union movement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



They were afraid that if we merge with the Right-wing

Federation, it would :then be disadvantageous to the

Left-wing forces in Singapore. They have their

problems and we understand this. In those days, they

suspected that there was something fishy in the

discussions held with the colonial officers. That is

why the trade unionists started their fight against us.

Mr Speaker, Sir, it was because of this that these

opportunistic politicians were frightened. At that

time, they thought that if they aligned with the trade

unionists -

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> On a point of order. Is

the  hon. Member talking on the party issue or  on  the

merger issue?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am just trying to pick up the threads

of  the hon. Lady's argument. I have not as yet come to

the conclusion that she is very irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

every  episode  has its causes and its results.  Now  I

want  to talk on the causes of what is happening.  What

the Barisan Sosialis wish for is not in accordance with

reality.  They  thought that if they aligned  with  the

trade   unionists,   they  could  topple   the   P.A.P.

Government  and  they could hold  the  posts  of  Prime

Minister and Ministers. But their hopes were dashed  to

pieces.  That is why they are now opposing  us,  saying

that our merger proposal is a sort of sell-out.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It does seem to me now that the

hon.  Lady is going a little far away from the  motion.

Parts of this party strife, of course, are relevant but

other parts are not.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

they always say that we sell out the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the merger question was raised, they wanted to

force  us  to resign so that they could have a  general

election. I feel that it was very mean of them to  have

indulged  in  these tactics. If they had  the  courage,

they should have raised this question when they were in

the  Party. But since they dared not do this when  they

were  in  the Party, then they are the people  who  are

wavering.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me ask them whether we are really

selling  out  the people. We have never  sold  out  the

interests  of the people. I feel that the  question  is

one  of either conditional or unconditional merger. The

Members  of the Opposition say that we are selling  out

the  interests  of the people. Let me  state  that  all

these  merger proposals will have to be decided by  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder whether the hon. Lady

could modulate her voice because I find it difficult to

hear  the  interpreter if she raises her  voice.  Madam

Hoe.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We know that

the  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  has  introduced  the

Singapore  National Referendum Bill.  The  people  will

then  decide whether they accept our merger  proposals.

Yet  the Barisan Sosialis accuse us of selling out  the

people.  This is a groundless accusation. Some  of  the

Members  opposite have also said that we should resign.

But,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I have read  a  Chinese  book

called "The Three Kingdoms" and I still remember a part

of  it.  Tsao Tsao had a son called Tsao Chih.  Another

son  called Tsao Pei tried usurp the kingship when Tsao

Tsao  died,  and Tsao Chih wrote a poem to his  brother

saying,  "We are born of the same family.  Why  do  you

persecute  me?" From this, we can see the  attitude  of

the  Barisan Socialis. They try to force us to  resign.

They  claim that they have the overwhelming support  of

the  people and that we have lost the confidence of the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody really knows who represents

the  people.  If the Barisan Sosialis Members  can  say

that  they  represent the people,  then  how  can  they

explain  that at the time when they were in the  P.A.P.

they wore P.A.P. badges and P.A.P. uniform?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Lady should try not to

get  too excited. I have also indicated that I  do  not

like Members pointing to other Members. Sometimes it is

all  right  but  at other times it might  be  a  little

intimidating or it might be offensive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

although I make gestures, I am still addressing you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if they say that the people are supporting them,

then they should resign their seats, which they won  on

the P.A.P. ticket, and then fight the new elections. If

they  were elected again, then they could say that they

have  the  support of the people. Before  the  breakup,

they  did  represent the P.A.P., and therefore  I  hope

these ex-colleagues do not ask too much of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speakers Sir, on this issue of merger, we believe

there should be conditional merger because we have been

separated from the Federation for quite some  time.  We

are  developing  on different lines.  The  P.A.P. have

analysed  the  situation  both  in  Singapore  and  the

Federation, and that is why we propose this conditional

merger.  Our  ex-colleagues also  previously  supported

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the education policy, we have

suggested  autonomy in education in our  proposals  for

merger.  We  can see the situation of secondary  school

students  in  Singapore today.  That  is  why  we  have

suggested this conditional merger because we are afraid

of  such  things.  But from the personal  viewpoint,  I

believe  there  is  something in the Chinese  education

policy  which  I  cannot  accept.  Some  of  them   are

unreasonable.  Complete  merger  as  proposed  by   the

Barisan  Sosialis  is, therefore, contradictory.  I  am

Chinese, educated. I am now learning English. And if  I

were  to  answer Chinese question papers in English,  I

think  it would be difficult for me. Similarly,  if  we

accept the Federation education policy, many people  in

Singapore  will  resent  it.  Those  heroes   who   are

protecting  Chinese  education - what  are  they  now?  I

believe their aim is just to embarrass us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we feel it is important to have

autonomy in labour, because when the P.A.P. framed  its

labour  policy,  we had specially emphasised  it  since

most of the members and cadres of the Party come from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



the  field  of  labour.  We  have  therefore  suggested

autonomy   in  labour  in  order  to  look  after   the

privileges  of the workers. If we do not  make  such  a

suggestion,  then our ex-colleagues, i.e., the  Barisan

Sosialis  members  will accuse us of  selling  out  the

workers.  They  are bound to say this.  They  claim  to

represent the workers, and yet they want to accept  the

labour policy of the Federation. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I ask the Backbenchers in the

Opposition not to interject so frequently? I am finding

difficulty in following the hon. Member because of  the

interpretation. Interjections will not improve  matters

at all.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

let  me  explain the citizenship issue. We have made  a

detailed  announcement that Singapore citizens  have  a

right to elect their own representatives to the Federal

Parliament. But some people say that we are  unfair.  I

will  say  this:  it  is  very fair  because  Singapore

citizens  can elect their own representatives,  but  no

Federation citizens can vote and stand for election  in

Singapore. We cannot go, and they cannot come. That  is

why  I say it is fair. If we say we cannot go but  they

can  come, then it is unfair. It is nonsensical to  say

we  are  selling  out the people of  Singapore  on  the

citizenship issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I only wish to make

an explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understood the Member for

Stamford to rise on a point of order. If it is a  point

of  explanation,  then she cannot make the  explanation

unless  the Member for Bras Basah gives way. I  do  not

know  whether the Member for Bras Basah will give  way.

Will she?



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

she  has  already spoken a lot. She wants to  interrupt

me.  I am not afraid. I have no notes. I can answer her

any time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have no doubt the Member for Bras Basah

has no notes. I have not seen her looking at any notes.

But let us not have a battle of the female sex!



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  she wanted to interrupt me so that she thought  I

could not continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now analysing the citizenship issue. As I said,

we  cannot go and they cannot come. This is fair. It is

true  that  it  is  not too good for  the  citizens  of

Singapore.  In  Singapore we have the Barisan  Sosialis

and  in  the Federation of Malaya we have the Socialist

Front.  If  the Barisan Sosialis in Singapore  and  the

Socialist Front in the Federation could both  win  some

seats  and  formed a majority of representatives,  then

they  could form their own government. If this happens,

we  can  then  say  that the Federation  is  under  the

control  of  Singapore. So we cannot say  that  we  are

selling  out  the people of Singapore. That  is  why  I

think that whatever they have said on merger is just to

distort  the issue and to further their own  individual

aims.  That is why we have to oppose them. We are going

to analyse this and tell it to all the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few days the Opposition

Members  have been attacking us. I feel very sad.  Even

before  our common enemy is defeated, our ex-colleagues

want  to kill us now, and do not give us a chance. They

are too ruthless.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> The Member for Bras Basah

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sure the Member for Havelock is by

no   means  intimidated  by  that  statement.  I  think

probably that word is used metaphorically.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

many of our colleagues have analysed this merger issue.

I  have also read it in the newspapers, and I have also

read  the  criticisms  on merger.  They  accuse  us  of

alleging that they are Communists. That



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



accusation came from the Member for Nee Soon.  He  said

that  we  accused  them  of being  Communists.  Let  me

clarify  it:  we  have  never  alleged  that  they  are

Communists.  We  were only analsing the situation.  The

Member  for Nee Soon has no qualification to  become  a

Communist,  because he is a waverer. He will  never  be

accepted  as a Communist. So I ask him not  to  be  too

worried  over his lack of qualifications  to  become  a

Communist. If he wants to become a puppet, perhaps -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the hon. Member saying that the

Member  for Nee Soon has no qualification to  become  a

Communist?



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It was because

during  the  course  of the debate,  he  levelled  some

accusations  at us. That is why I am only  making  some

kind  of  explanation to show that he was only smearing

us  and  that we are trying to show that he is pink  in

colour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope you will be fair in this

debate.  If they resort to these tactics to  deal  with

us, perhaps we can excuse them because most of them are

rather  young,  and  perhaps  quite  stern;  and  quite

rightly so.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

indeed  regrettable that in a debate on  such  a  major

issue  affecting the future of the people of Singapore,

the  Ministers  of  the P.A.P. Government  should  have

displayed  such  a lack of seriousness.  Perhaps,  Sir,

they   were  so  perturbed  by  what  the  Member   for

Queenstown, the Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis,  said

in  his  address that they became so inattentive.  But,

Sir, I would rather like to believe that they were  all

suffering from a very serious attack of cold and thus a

little  hard of hearing. As it is, Sir, both  the  Hon.

the  Minister for Culture and the Hon, the Minister for

Education  have wasted our time by dealing with  points

which  have  been  dealt with and disposed  of  by  the

Member   for  Queenstown.  For  instance, they   both

challenged  the  Barisan  Sosialis  Members  to   state

categorically



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



whether the Party was prepared to accept the labour and

education  policies of the Government of the Federation

of Malaya and all that they implied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, the Member for Queens-town has

explained our stand on this. This stand, Sir,  did  not

find  favour with the Member for Geylang Serai, and  he

said'  so. I know he is not suffering from any cold.  I

shall,  Sir,  later  on  explain  in  some  detail  our

attitude  to the policies of the Federation Government.

But  I  would like to say first this much. The  Barisan

Sosialis,  unlike the P.A.P., faces facts  and  is  not

afraid  to  state clearly what it feels. In our  policy

statement,  Sir, we called the Federation  Government's

education  policy misguided. Further, we expressed  our

desire  to  change it on merger. I have not, Sir,  come

across any P.A.P. statement which dares categorically  to

condemn the Federation Government's policy. Its leaders

only  whisper that they are opposed to the Rahman Talib

Report. Sir, I dare the Government to state clearly and

unequivocally that they are opposed to the Rahman Talib

Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is of greater significance is

that   these   men,   who   call   themselves   Malayan

nationalists  and socialists, now aspire  only  to  see

some social improvement in Singapore. They say that the

Federation  Government's policies are wrong.  At  least

they say so in private, Sir. All today now agree to the

policies  of  a  Right-wing  Government.  Let   us   be

generous,  Sir,  and  assume  that  they  are  a  shade

different from the S.P.A. Members who sit on this  side

of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in short, we have a situation in

which  there  are men who call themselves Malayans  and

who disagree with the Federation Government's policies,

but  who  will not seek a constitutional way to  change

these  policies.  These people, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  are

supposed  to be Malayan nationalists. Sir,  their  very

actions  betray them to be no more than - it is a  pity,

Sir,  that  the Minister for Culture is not  here - petty

parish - pump  politicians,  whose  politics   and

socialism are confined to the use of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



convenient  words  and phraseology  in  which  our  Dr

Goebbels, the Minister for Culture, specialise. I would

very   much   like  to  call  them,  Sir,  "parish-pump

patriots".  But  in  the face of the  sell-out  of  the

political rights of the people of Singapore, it grieves

me  to  say,  Sir,  that one just has  to  face  facts,

however bitter they are. The word "patriot" would sound

completely hollow in the light of their actions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has attempted to sour

relationship  between  the  Barisan  Sosialis  and  the

Government  of the Federation of Malaya by accusing  us

of trying to topple the Federation Government. Sir, the

Barisan  Sosialis is a Socialist Party, and we  believe

in  the  establishment of a socialist society  for  the

whole  of  Malaya.  We  are  not  afraid  to  say  this

publicly. We must, therefore, if we are to be  true  to

our aim, strive to bring about by constitutional means,

a  government  for  the  people of  Malaya  which  will

establish a socialist society for the whole country. We

know  that the present Government in the Federation  of

Malaya  does  not believe in socialism.  In  fact,  the

Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, has said this much.

We all know that the present Federation Government is a

Right-wing Govern, ment. Therefore, in order  to  bring

about socialism for our country and our people we must,

of  course, try by peaceful and constitutional means to

convince  the  people of Malaya that our  policies  are

better  than  those  of the present Government  of  the

Federation of Malaya. If the people agree with  us  and

decide  that  we  should be their Government,  then  we

will, of course, under those circumstances, replace the

present Federation Government.

only  with people who have no basic political  beliefs.

As   far  as  Members  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis   are

concerned,   they  are  men  with  fundamental,   basic

political convictions. What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



is  wrong with seeking to change the Government of  the

Federation in these circumstances, Sir? After  all,  we

are  operating a parliamentary set-up, If democracy  is

to  mean the will of the majority, then let the  people

decide  in free and open competition. Sir, it  is  for

the  people to have the final say. I wonder whether the

P.A.P.,  which  professes to be a Socialist  Party,  is

trying  to tell us that this is not also their aim.  Or

is the P.A.P., having lost the support of the people of

Singapore  whom  we all know are socialist-minded,  now

trying  to ensure its political future by securing  the

support  of the Rightwing Government in the Federation?

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, can one blame us for  accusing  the

P.A.P. for having deviated from its original Left-wing

stand?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Nee Soon has in his speech quoted

at length the P.A.P. policy statements in the 4th

Anniversary Souvenir publication. He has clearly shown

that it was also the aim of the P.A.P. to topple the

Federation Government. I need not have to repeat all

these things once again. Suffice it for me to say that

if the P.A.P. sincerely believes in socialism, then the

only way to bring about socialism is for it to replace

the present Federation Government, which we all know is

not a socialist Government. Sir, it would be relevant

here for me to say that the Prime Minister has

personally told me many times of his own feelings

towards the Federation Government. The Minister for

Finance should realise that it was also the Prime

Minister's personal intention to topple the Federation

Government. Mr Speaker. Sir, unlike the Prime

Minister, I am not in the habit of relating in public

conversations made in private. But, Sir, extreme

hypocrisy is an intolerable business for one to

witness. Sir, the Prime Minister has told me in

private - told many of us in the past - of his views about

the Tunku. They are not in harmony with his grand

public cry now, namely, calling the Tunku a great

nationalist and placing him with Asian patriots -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think it proper for any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



personally  in  this  manner. It might  be  taken  that

sarcasm is being used. I think it is not right for  any

offence to the Prime Minister of friendly country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I appreciate it, Sir,It is not my intention

All that I want to explain is the attitude of our Prime

Minister,  the things that he says today  publicly  and

the  things  that he had been telling us for  years  in

private This is relevant here, Sir. Of course,  as  you

know,  the Barisan Sosialis has been accused  of  being

anti the Federation Government and of having as one  of

its   intentions   the  toppling  of   the   Federation

Government.  When  I  was just  now  referring  to  the

attitude  of our Prime Minister, I wanted to say,  Sir,

that  I  remember clearly once when our Prime  Minister

was then a -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I understood that all this was leading up

to the point that the Barisan Sosialis think that with

what they call a genuine merger, or with their own

concept of a merger, it would be able to topple the

Federation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was saying, Sir, that I remember clearly

our Prime Minister - he was then a simple, plain Mr Lee

Kuan  Yew - told me and Mr Dominic Puthucheary that  the

Tunku was a duffer -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think I can allow this

trend  of  debate.  What an hon.  Member  says  in  his

personal  capacity  must  not  be  mentioned  in   this

Assembly.  It  is akin to the personal conduct  of  an

hon. Member, and it can only be disclosed or debated on

a substantive motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all that I want to

establish here is that it was also the intention of the

Prime Minister and the P.A.P. Government to topple  the

Federation Governments because, by their own admission,

the  Federation Government was a Right-wing  Government

and, therefore, today, if the Barisan Sosialis says the

Rahman  Talib  Report  is misguided  or  the  education

policy of the Federation Government is misguided, there

is nothing sinister or unusual about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall, Sir, what the Minister for Finance

said.  Why I say this is merely to show that  what  the

Minister  for  Finance accused  us  of,  was  also  the

original intention of the P.A.P. Government, and I have

no  doubt  whatsoever, Sir, that  it  is  the  personal

ambition of our Prime Minister to be the Prime Minister

of  the Federation of Malaya one of these days,  if  he

can help it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as we in the Barisan Sosialis are

concerned,  we make no secret of our views. We  respect

the Tunku because he is the popularly elected leader of

the  people of the Federation of Malaya. As socialists,

we  disagree with his views and we have the courage  of

our  convictions to state publicly that so long as  the

Tunku  and  the  Alliance Government pursue  Right-wing

policies,  it  shall be our responsibility  to  seek  a

change  in  these  policies  by  normal,  peaceful  and

constitutional methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance also alleged that it was

wrong  for  us to demand full, complete merger  on  the

basis  of  Penang and Malacca and also  to  demand  the

automatic  conversion  of  all  Singapore  citizens  to

Federal citizens on merger. The Minister for Finance, I

note, Sir, has conveniently kept away from the Chamber.

I  would rather he listen to this. He said that we  now

realise  our mistake in referring to Penang and Malacca

and  that we have started changing our propaganda line.

Sir,  this  accusation,  I  believe,  was  subsequently

repeated by the Minister for Culture and also, I think,

by  the Deputy Prime Minister. Sir, when we referred to

Singapore merging completely with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



Federation,  like Penang and Malacca, we  were  merely

referring  to  the  fact  that  Singapore,  Penang  and

Malacca  were originally the three Straits  Settlements

under direct colonial rule without any Malay sultanage.

Our  point  was that if Penang and Malacca, which  were

both  colonial  territories like  Singapore,  could  be

merged  completely with the Federation  as  constituent

States,  then  Singapore could  also  be  merged  as  a

constituent  States.  There  is  nothing  contradictory

between this and our demand for automatic conversion of

Singapore  citizens  to Federal  citizens  on  complete

merger. Sir, when Penang and Malacca were joined to the

Federation of Malaya and Singapore at the same time was

separated   from  the  mainland,  the   three   Straits

Settlements  were all in the most elementary  stage  of

colonial  rule.  There was no degree of self-government

whatsoever  in  any of the Straits Settlements.  Penang

and  Malacca, when they were joined to the  Federation,

did not have any State citizenship. So was the case  of

Singapore  in those days. But, Mr Speaker, Sir,  since

its   separation  from  the  mainland,  Singapore   has

developed on its own to almost complete self-government

and has thereby acquired a State citizenship of its own

together with a Head of State. This, Sir, is just  hard

political reality. It is an objective factor  which  we

simply cannot ignore. If Singapore is to merge with the

Federation  now, then the Federation, if it is  sincere

in wanting merger, has to recognise this hard political

reality and take in Singapore as it is now, and not  as

it was at the time of separation. Sir, the 11 States in

the  Federation of Malaya and Singapore may be compared

to a family of 12 people, and one member of this family

was  unfortunately separated by the  British  from  the

rest  of the family when it was still a small boy. This

boy,  Sir,  we  can  call Singapore.  At  the  time  of

separation. Singapore and all the other members of  the

family were small boys. Sir, it is now 16 years  since

they  were  separated. During this period,  this  small

boy,  Singapore, has developed in stature and  maturity

and  is  now  a fully grown-up man, though still  under

British bondage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



He  has  also got married and has children of his  own.

Now, he likes to join back with the rest of his family.

Surely,  Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be very unfair  for

the   other  11  brothers  to  demand  that  this  boy,

Singapore,  should  divorce  his  wife  and  leave  his

children  before he could join the rest of his  family,

especially,  Sir,  when we find  that  these  11  other

brothers  have also, in the meanwhlie, got married  and

have  children of their own. It is unfair, Mr Speaker,

Sir, that this boy, Singapore, who is now a full grown-up  man,  should join with the rest of his family  with

his  wife  and children, and not as though  he  were  a

bachelor when he is not, in fact, a bachelor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has tried to give the

impression that it is unreasonable to demand  automatic

conversion of Singapore citizens to Federal citizenship

because many of our citizens are not from here and  are

supposed  to  have less than 10 years' residence.  This

10-year   residential  qualification,  Sir,   is   only

required  for  those  who  are  applying  for   Federal

citizenship under the naturalisation laws. Sir, I  must

emphasise that the majority of those Singapore citizens

who  were not born here have acquired their citizenship

by  virture of the eight-year residential qualification

in  1957. That is by now four years later. These people

have  already been residing here for 12 years,  and  by

1963, when merger is supposed to take place, they  will

have  at  least 14 years' residence. Sir, these  people

will  have, in fact, four years in excess of their  10-year  residential  qualification.  The  only  group  of

people   who   do  not  have  the  10-year  residential

qualification  are those who were born  either  in  the

Federation  of  Malaya  or in the  United  Kingdom  and

Colonies.  Sir,  we have already put forth  a  question

asking  for the exact number of Singapore citizens  who

require  citizenship  by this  provision  of  the  1957

Singapore Citizenship Ordinance, and as you know,  Sir,

the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for  Home

Affairs  refused to give these figures on  the  grounds

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



they were not available. We know that the number of

this group is very small - about -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder if the hon. Member is

correct in his statement that tie Parliamentary

Secretary refused to give information. Probably the

phrase was "unable to give information because it was

not available." I think that was the answer given. He

was unable to give the information because it was not

available. I think the hon. Member should be fair on

that point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I did say, Sir, that the grounds which were

used were that these figures were not available.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point, of course, is - I may be

wrong - that I think the hon. Member for Thomson did  use

the  word "refused". That is completely misrepresenting

the whole position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I withdraw the word "refused", Sir. I was

saying  that we know that the number of this  group  of

people is very small, between 20,000 and 30,000 people,

and  most of them were born in Malaya and could not  be

considered as foreigners anyway. Sir, they were born in

a  country with whom we are trying to merge. So how can

we grudge them Federal citizenship rights? These people

were  born  in the Federation, and are able to  qualify

for  Federal  citizenship  under  the  present  Federal

Constitution   with   only  a   five-year   residential

qualification    and   not   a   10-year    residential

qualification. Apart from this, Sir, the rest  of  this

group of about 20,000 to 30,000 Singapore citizens  are

those ex-servicemen and expatriates who have chosen  to

take  up  Singapore citizenship, and  their  number  is

very,  very  small, probably only a few thousand.  Sir,

because  of  this  few  thousand, all  the  630,000-odd

Singapore citizens are going to be deprived of  Federal

citizenship rights. What kind of lame excuse is this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of automatic Federal citizenship

rights  for all Singapore citizens on merger  has  been

dealt  with in great detail by my colleague, the Member

for Queenstown, and I do not wish to repeat what he has

said, though



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



it  is  regrettable that the English  Press - the

Straits   Times - unlike  the  non-English  Press,   has

completely  blacked  out  the  detailed  but  extremely

important arguments put forward by him on this question

of  citizenship.  Sir, I wish to  say  here  that  this

Assembly  is  an extremely important medium  of  public

expression  in the State. But by itself  the  value  of

this  Assembly as a medium of public expression is very

limited, for only a few score of members of the  public

can  be  accommodated  in the  Gallery  each  day.  Its

usefulness  therefore,  Sir,  depends  heavily   on   a

responsible Press which will report justly  and  fairly

on  the  proceedings. But unfortunately, Sir, the  only

English  newspaper in the country has now,  like  Radio

Singapore,  become virtually the private mouthpiece  of

the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you may know, on 21st November, 1961, at 10.30 p.m., Radio

Singapore gave a half-hour report  on  the

proceedings of this Assembly, and though the Member for

Queenstown  spoke for 3� hours that day,  whereas  the

Minister  for  Finance spoke for barely one  hour,  the

entire  half-hour report was devoted only to the speech

of the Minister for Finance.

allergic  when  Radio Singapore is mentioned,  I  shall

confine my remarks to the Straits Times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to appeal to all

newspapers  in the country, and to the radio  as  well,

that  at least on this vital issue of merger, let there

be  fair and just reporting of the proceedings of  this

Assembly.  Let  the  public be  as  fully  informed  as

possible  on  this extremely important issue  which  is

going  to  affect not only the present  generation  but

also future generations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I was saying, this citizenship question is the

crux of the whole matter. It is the most vital issue in

merger.   It  is  by  a  careful  study  of   all   the

implications  of this arrangement for separate  citizen

ship  under the P.A.P.'s phoney merger that we will  be

able  to  realise  the  extent  of  the  treachery  and

betrayal  of the P.A.P. Government. That is  why,  Sir,

the  Government-controlled Radio Singapore and the pro-Government  Straits  Times have  so  carefully  avoided

reporting  all  the ugly revelations  of  the  P.A.P.'s

citizenship arrangement. Sir, it is on the crux of this

whole  matter that the P.A.P. have tried to  bluff  the

people wholesale. The P.A.P. have tried to achieve this

by  deliberately misleading and misinforming the people

on constitutional facts and citizenship laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to avoid repetition, I merely wish to summarise

the  salient  points in the argument.  Sir,  under  the

P.A.P.'s  sellout arrangement, Singapore citizens  will

be kept isolated from the rest of the Federation people

by  being  given a separate citizenship. This  separate

citizenship  is unique only to the people of  Singapore

and will not be shared by the rest of the people in the

other  11  States of the Federation. After this  phoney

merger, Sir, Singapore citizens will not be allowed  to

participate  in political activities in the  Federation

because  they will not have Federal citizenship rights,

although they will be so-called Federal nationals.  The

citizens of the 11 other States of the Federation will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



all share common citizenship rights, which are separate

altogether  from Singapore citizenship rights.  Thus  a

citizen,   say  from  Johore,  will  be   entitled   to

participate in political activities throughout  the  11

States  in the Federation - something which the Singapore

citizens  will  not  be  able  to  do.  The  fact  that

Singapore  citizens and Federal citizens will  share  a

common  nationality is irrelevant here, because  within

the   Federation  what  matters  is  not  your  Federal

nationality but your Federal citizenship, without which

you  will,  for  practical purposes, be treated  as  an

alien,  Though in theory Federal citizens will  not  be

entitled  to  participate  in political  activities  in

Singapore,  in  practice  we  can  be  sure  they  will

interfere  wholesale  in  the political  activities  of

Singapore,  simply because the Central Government  will

be under the control of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this right to have full participation in the

political   life   of  a  nation  is   something   very

fundamental  in  any  parliamentary democratic  set-up.

Sir, when we asked for this basic democratic right  for

the  people  of  Singapore,  we  were  accused  by  the

Minister for Culture that we are asking for this  right

because  we in the Barisan Sosialis wish to  stand  for

election  in the Federation, and that it is because  of

this personal political interest that we are trying  to

oppose  the  P.A.P.'s  phoney  merger  proposals.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this is an utter and complete distortion

of  the truth. It is regrettable that the Minister  for

Culture  could not refrain from being personal even  in

his political analysis. [Interruption] In fact, most of

his  so-called  political analysis has  been  based  on

personalities.  I believe he is the author  of  several

articles in the various anniversary publications of the

P.A.P. which sought to give credit for the success  of

the  P.A.P. at  the previous election  solely  to  the

intelligence and genuine of the P.A.P. leadership,  and

not  to the objective political factors as well as  the

dedication  and work of the thousands of the  rank  and

file of the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I was saying, this fundamental right to a

common  political life with one's fellow  brothers  and

sisters  of  the  same nation is not a  matter  of  the

personal  interest of politicians. I  cannot,  however,

say  for  sure that the Prime Minister is  not  himself

interested  in  seeking new political pastures  in  the

Federation. [Interruption] For the Minister of  Culture

knows that our Prime Minister is to be found more often

in  the Federation than in Singapore these days.  I  am

quite sure, Sir, that in the next general elections  he

will  not dare to go back to Tanjong Pagar. This common

political  life  is  the mechanics,  the  framework  of

parliamentary democracy. It is the means by  which  the

people of a country can influence and be influenced  by

one   another  so  that  they  can  together  elect   a

government  that  will  truly  reflect  the  views  and

aspirations of the people as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this common political life is an extremely

democratic   channel   whereby   the   grievances   and

aspirations of any section of our people can  be  fully

expressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, supposing after reunification the extremely

democratic  channel whereby that the Central Government

is  not  caring  for  their interest  and  that  it  is

adopting  a repressive policy towards them,  then  they

should have the right to inform the rest of the Malayan

people of their injustices and neglect at the hands  of

the  Central Government. They should have the right  to

persuade the rest of the Malayan people to elect a  new

government which will look after the interests  of  the

people  of  Singapore as well. Without  this  right  of

mutual  influence to mutual benefit, how are the people

of  the other eleven States in the Federation going  to

know  whether  the Central Government  is  treating  us

fairly and squarely? They may well be mistaken that the

Central   Government   is,  in  fact,   looking   after

everybody's  interest  equally  and  fairly,  and   may

merrily reelect the same Government next time. This  is

especially so in the context of a situation wherein the

Press  and  the radio are nothing but mere servile  and

willing handmaids of those in power.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



Mr Speaker, Sir, under the P.A.P.'s-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder whether the hon. Member

is  fair in saying that the Press and the radio are the

servile and willing helpers of those in power.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Honestly, Sir, I do not see what is unfair

when  that is the position. By practice, our experience

has  shown,  Sir, that there could be  no  other  words

parliamentary enough to be used to describe the  manner

in  which  the  Press, particularly the Straits  Times,

leans to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the P.A.P.'s sell-out, it is precisely this

democratic  right that will not be given to the  people

of   Singapore,  because  we  will  not  have   Federal

citizenship. We can be easily barred from entering  the

Federation  after this so-called merger, even  when  we

are  presented with the so-called Federal  nationality.

We  will not be able to participate in any campaign  in

the Federation for social and political changes for our

people.  We  will  not  be  able  to  form  pan-Malayan

political  Parties or join political  organisations  in

the   Federation  because  we  do  not   have   Federal

citizenship.  In other words, Sir, as my colleague  the

Member  for  Queenstown has pointed  out,  we  will  be

treated  as  outcasts, where our influence in  national

pan-Malayan affairs will be kept at a minimum: firstly,

by  political isolation, and secondly, by  being  given

less   than   proportionate   representation   in   the

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So while the people of Singapore cannot influence the

people of the Federation under this phoney merger,  the

people of the Federation will, in practice, be able  to

come and influence the people of Singapore, even though

they  will  not have Singapore citizenship.  Even  now,

Sir,  before  any  sort of merger,  either  genuine  or

phoney,   has   taken  place,  Federation  politicians,

notably  members  of  the ruling  Alliance  Party,  are

frequently  in Singapore making speeches and addressing

rallies. What more after phoney merger has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



taken  place! But, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish  to  assure

that  it  is  not  that we mind in  the  least  Federal

citizens  coming to Singapore to influence  our  people

here.  In  fact, we welcome them here as  brothers  and

sisters of the same family. But the people of Singapore

must  in  turn  be  treated on  the  same  footing.  No

relationship  based entirely on one-sided benefits  can

give any lasting happiness to the peoples concerned. It

is  bound to cause some degree of jealousy and tension,

which will increase as the days go by, until one day it

may   lead   to  the  complete  severance  of  whatever

relationship that may originally have existed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Tunku realises that the people of

Singapore  will  not  be happy with  this  relationship

based  on inequality. The Tunku, Sir, unlike our  Prime

Minister, is a gentleman with warm human feelings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Three cheers for the big boy!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You should have been here a bit earlier, but

I cannot understand what -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Speaker has been here

for a very good length of time!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. I meant the Hon, the

Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I cannot understand, Sir, is why he has agreed to

treat  the people of Singapore in this unequal  manner.

Is  it  because  our Prime Minister has very  cunningly

misinformed him pf the exact aspiration of our people?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He reads the Press too, you know.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Tunku must know that the Prime Minister

of  Singapore today stands discredited in the  eyes  of

the  people of Singapore. He is one whom the people  do

not trust any longer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is what you say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Why do you not go to Tanjong Pagar? Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I know that among wide sections  of  the

people, the name of Lee Kuan Yew is held in contempt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., Sir, alleges that in a complete and

genuine  merger,  only  about  half  of  the  Singapore

citizens  who  were  born here would  automatically  be

granted Federal citizenship rights, and that the  other

half  of  our  citizens who were not  born  here  would

automatically lose their citizenship status  and  would

have  to  apply for Federal citizenship.  So  says  the

P.A.P. But, Sir, may I ask: what proportion of citizens

will automatically get Federal citizenship rights under

the  proposed P.A.P. brand of merger? The answer,  Sir,

is  n-o-n-e. Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact is  that  under

the  P.A.P.'s  phoney merger, not  a  single  Singapore

citizen  will  have  the  right  to  automatic  Federal

citizenship. In fact, Sir, even those born in Singapore

after  this  phoney  merger will  not  be  entitled  to

automatic Federal citizenship. All that they will  have

will  be Singapore State citizenship, just like  anyone

born  in  Singapore today. How then can  any  Singapore

citizen  obtain the coveted status of a Federal citizen

after this phoney merger which the P.A.P. is attempting

to  ram  down  our throats? We will have to  apply  for

Federal citizenship under the citizenship laws  of  the

Federation as they are today. However, before one could

so  apply,  several  pre-conditions  will  have  to  be

complied with. The Singapore citizen must first go  and

stay  in  the Federation for at least ten years.  After

completing a stay of ten years, he will have to pass  a

Malay  language test. Then, Sir, he has to satisfy  the

Federation Government that he is of good character, and

by  this,  of course, Sir, is meant that his  political

views must be acceptable to the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope, Sir, the English newspaper, the

Straits Times, will not black-out this once again.  The

people  of  Singapore have a right  to  know  the  full

implications  of this proposed phoney merger,  and  the

papers of a country have a great duty - to inform them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



fairly and truthfully. Unfortunately, Sir, the English-educated section of our people have no alternative  but

to depend on the pro-Government Straits Times for their

information. The Straits Times should realise that  the

English-educated  too have a right to  know  the  whole

truth about their future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queenstown has

challenged  the Government to deny the implications  of

their  phoney  merger. I am sure the public  will  have

noted,  Sir,  that up till now the Government  has  not

denied this ugly revelation. They cannot deny it,  Sir,

for  it is simply the ugly truth, and they find  it  so

injurious even to hear it if they choose to be outside.

Sir,  it  is  obvious that the P.A.P. has attempted  to

cover  all  these ugly truths by trying to mislead  the

people by using such vague talk as being equal under  a

common Federal nationality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. is trying to camouflage its sell-out

proposals by trying to mislead the people into

believing that there is no material difference between

Federal citizen and Federal national. Sir, the

Government issued on 25th November a statement to

explain the opinion given by the State Advocate-General. But, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the document which was

tabled by the Prime Minister on the 24th November for

circulation to Members of the Legislative Assembly was

dated 23rd November, 1961. If that is correct, then the

statement that the Government issued the circular on

the 25th November is not quite correct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am sorry. When I said "the 25th", I meant

the date on which it was published in the newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, this so-called explanatory statement added

many  things  which  the  State Advocate-General  never

said.  For instance, Sir, the explanatory note referred

to  the first Merdeka Talks in London in 1956 when  Mr

Lim  Ching  Siong  was alleged to have  agreed  to  the

proposals  by  the  then  Chief  Minister.  Mr   David

Marshall,  who  is  now  the Member  for  Anson.  These

proposals



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



were actually a set of citizenship laws designed for an

independent sovereign State of Singapore; a citizenship

status  that  was to be called "national of Singapore",

They  were put up by the Singapore delegation,  present

among   whom  were  also  our  Prime  Minister.   These

proposals,  as  we know, were rejected by  the  British

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the whole intention behind this mischievous

reference  is  very  clear. It is  to  convey  a  false

impression  to  the public that Mr  Lirn  Ching  Siong

agreed  in  1956  to  the people of Singapore  becoming

nationals,  and the P.A.P. hopes to confuse the  public

into believing that Mr Lim Ching Siong has now changed

his  line. Sir, nothing is further from the truth.  You

will note, Sir, that the term "Singapore nationals" was

used   in  the  proposals  of  1956  to  mean  a  State

citizenship  status for the people of Singapore  as  an

independent  and sovereign State, and not in  reference

to  Federal  citizenship.  Whereas  now,  Sir,  in  the

context of merger, the term "Federal national" is being

used by the P.A.P. to try to make us believe that it is

a  substitute for Federal citizenship, which we know is

not  true.  There is absolutely no relevance whatsoever

in  that  mischievous reference except to add confusion

to the whole matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the State Advocate-General, Inche Ahmad bin

Ibrahim,  has  given  a  legal  opinion  on  the   term

"national" of the new Federation. I regret to say, Sir,

that the statement has not helped to clarify the issue.

He  has not added anything new to what has been said on

the  subject.  The Sunday Times of the  26th  November.

1961,  has, of course, tried to make political  capital

for  the Government by emphasising, in one sentence  in

the  Government's interpretation of the State Advocate-General's  opinion, that the two words  "national"  and

"citizen" have the same meaning. Thus, Sir, the  Sunday

Times,  which  is part and parcel of the Straits  Times

organisation,  is  trying to sell the Government  line.

That is, to be a Federal national is the same as to  be

a Federal citizen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the State Advocate-General; Sir, in fact, did not

state  categorically in his statement  that  the  terms

"national" and "citizen" had the same meaning.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. For the record, I think the hon.

Member  should  quote the passage  which  he  has  been

referring to from the Sunday Times.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am just about to quote the relevant

portions,  Sir,I quote the Sunday Times  of  the  26th

November. This is what it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He [that is the State Advocate-General] said that

there appeared to be no distinction between the terms

"nationality" and "citizenship" for the purposes of the

British Nationality Act, 1948. However, it was

permissable to use the term "nationality" for the

purposes of international law and the term

"citizenship" for the purposes of national or municipal

law, he added.'



<br><br>Sir,  in  the  same  paper, we have  a  report  on  the

Government's  explanatory statement which  subsequently

follows - I  read from the Straits Times  of  the  same

date, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An explanatory Government statement today said that

in  non-legal  language,  the State  Advocate-General's

opinion  meant that the terms "citizen" and  "national"

have the same meaning.'



<br><br>Sir,  please note that it was the Government's so-called

explanatory  statement  and  not  the  State  Advocate-General's  opinion that stated that the two words  have

the same meaning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that a great deal

of  confusion has resulted from the fact that  the  two

words  "national" and "citizen" have been used at times

to  mean the same thing. But, Sir, what is important is

not the word that is being used to describe a political

status  but  the  significance of the political  status

itself. Sir, the only significant paragraph in the long

statement  of the S.A.G. - a statement full of legalistic

jargon - is this paragraph. Let me quote again, Sir,  the

Sunday Times of the 26th. It said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The term "citizen" was usually used in reference to a

person's  domestic or internal rights within a country,

and "national" was usually used in reference to a man's

international standing and status.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



Sir, this is exactly what the Member for Queenstown has

said.  Let  me  quote the relevant part of  his  speech

where  he  was  discussing the difference  between  the

terms "citizen" and "national". He said, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"Citizenship" and "nationality" are two distinct

concepts.  "Citizenship"  expresses  the  right  of  an

individual within a State and "nationality" is a  right

outside the State.'



<br><br>Sir,  what  the P.A.P. is trying to confuse the  people

with  is the fact that these two concepts, namely, your

right  within  a  -  State and your right  outside  the

State, have sometimes been described by the same thing.

That  is to say, Sir, the word "citizen" has been  used

sometimes  to  mean your rights inside  the  State  and

sometimes  to  mean your rights outside  the  State.

Similarly,  the word "national" has been used  to  mean

either of these two concepts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as I can see, in the British commonwealth

though there is a different set of citizenship laws for

each of, the different Commonwealth countries, there is

only  one overall common nationality. That is  to  say,

whether you are a citizen of Australia or a citizen  of

Canada,  you are both a British Commonwealth  national.

The  confusing thing is that this concept of an overall

Commonwealth  nationality for all the citizens  of  the

various Commonwealth countries has been given the legal

title   of   "Commonwealth  citizenship",  instead   of

"Commonwealth  nationality". What  is  more  confusing,

Sir,   as  the  State  Advocate-General  has  correctly

pointed out, is that - let me quote him in the same issue

of the Sunday Times - he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Some Commonwealth countries use the term "national"

to describe their citizens.'



<br><br>Sir,  the  word "national" is being used  in  different

countries  to  mean different thing. It  is  something,

Sir,  like  the word "dollar". A dollar in Hongkong  is

worth  only  about  half  the  Singapore  dollar.  When

someone wants to give us a dollar, one usually means  a

Singapore  dollar.  But  when  these  desperate  P.A.P.

politicians, who are politically bankrupt, offer  us  a

dollar,  we  must  be careful for they  are,  in  fact,

trying  to  pass  off  Hongkong dollars  for  Singapore

dollars.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> American!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Not American. Sir, I know all this sounds

extremely  confusing. In fact, I know  that  even  some

lawyers  are quite confused over the whole  thing.  You

can  just imagine, Sir, our 630,000 poor citizens! They

have  a right to know exactly what deal they are going

to  get Sir, this whole confusion, as I understand  it,

has   resulted  from  the  loose  usage  of  the  terms

"national" and "citizen" to mean either of one  of  two

concepts that I have mentioned. No one is to be  blamed

for this confusion, Sir, except the lawyers who seem to

have  a  vested interest to make their profession  look

all  very  complicated and respectable.  Sir,  what  is

contemptible is this deliberate attempt by  the  P.A.P.

to  cash  in on this confusion in the use of the  words

to  smuggle  in  a  set of political  rights  that  are

completely  different  from  those  possessed  by   the

citizens of the other eleven States of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not a lawyer, and as a layman, I am not

interested   in  all  these  legalistic  and   academic

quibbles on the usage of mere words. Neither am I nor I

am  sure,  are  the  people  interested  in  all  these

meaningless  verbal intricacies. What  the  people  are

interested  in  is not whether one is to  be  called  a

"national"  or a "citizen", but whether one  is  to  be

given  the same rights and privileges as those  enjoyed

by  the  people  of  the  other eleven  States  in  the

Federation.  Call  these political rights  by  whatever

name, Sir, - be it national, citizen, new citizen or what

have you - but the important thing is that there must  be

a  common  citizenship for all the  people  of  Malaya,

including  Singapore,  on merger.  Merger  cannot  mean

anything  else.  The present arrangement  for  separate

citizenship,  Sir, is in direct contradiction  to  the.

concept of merger and, in fact, nullifies it. What  the

people  want after merger is that they will also  enjoy

the rights and privileges now enjoyed by the people  of

the   Federation,   particularly  Federal   citizenship

rights,  which are fundamental to all those who  regard

Malaya  as their home. That is what they want and  that

is  what every responsible leader of our people  should

ask for. It is no use for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P.  Government to tell  us  that  after  their

phoney  merger, both Singapore citizens and the Federal

citizens  will become Federal nationals.  What  we  are

interested  in  is, what, in fact, are  the  rights  of

these  Federal nationals; what, in fact, are the rights

after  merger  of  the Federal nationals,  the  Federal

citizens,  and Singapore citizens? That is  the  point,

Sir. That is the substance of the issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Barisan Sosialis are realists and we are

interested only in the substance of the issue  and  not

in  names.  The  people  of Singapore  are  politically

mature. They can differentiate mere names from the real

substance of the issue. The people of Singapore realise

that the status of Federal national is useful only when

they  go  abroad. But it is meaningless when  they  are

within the country, for within the country what matters

is  the  citizenship status. It is no use  telling  the

people of Singapore that when they go abroad, they will

be  regarded in foreign countries as being equal as the

people  of  the Federation. We know that the people  of

Singapore  and  the Federation will be  possessing  the

same  passport. But what is the use of being equal just

Outside one's country and not being equal inside  one's

country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown has aptly described

this  whole  arrangement  as just  a  showcase  to  the

outside   world  - the  pretence  that  the  people   of

Singapore and Malaya are all united and equal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. is inventing this new term, "Federal

national",  to  hide the fact that what the  people  of

Singapore will possess after the phoney merger is  just

a  State  citizenship and not a Federal citizenship  as

possessed by the people of the other 11 States.  If  it

is  indeed true that we are going to become equal  with

the  Federal citizens, then why do not the P.A.P. just

grant us all Federal citizenship rights? Why do not  on

merger  all  Singapore citizens  be  known  as  Federal

citizens?   Why   must   the  P.A.P. invent   a   new

term - "Federal national" - which is not found in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



present  Federal  Constitution? Why  must  the  P.A.P.

bring   in   three  types  of  citizenship - 1.   Federal

National; 2. Federal Citizen; 3. Singapore Citizen?  If

we are fit to be equal with Federal citizens, then give

us  Federal  citizenship. Why burden  us  with  Federal

nationality?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this double talk of the P.A.P. leadership - I do

not know whether to be angry or to laugh at it -

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Laugh!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It so happens, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I am a

much more serious man than the Minister for Culture. To

him,  perhaps, politics and the business of the country

are matters to laugh about.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Grinning!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I cannot help admiring the agility of

the Prime Minister - his remarkable capacity to twist and

wriggle  in spite of all logic when he speaks. My  only

regret  is  that  this  unusual ability  of  our  Prime

Minister  is  not  put to some honest  service  to  our

people.  My only regret is that it has all been  wasted

in  trying  to conceal the truth from the  people;  the

truth  that  will spell the political  doom  for  these

political opportunists who have betrayed the trust of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown posed in this Assembly

several questions to the Government on the implications

of  this  Federal citizenship arrangement.  Instead  of

answering  these  questions, the Minister  for  Culture

starts   accusing   us  of  asking  questions   without

providing  answers. Sir, what is all  this  nonsensical

talk  by  the Ministers, particularly the Minister  for

Culture, who is supposed to be cultured? We have  asked

the  Government certain questions, and  it  is  clearly

understood  by  anyone  with even average  intelligence

that  answers  are  expected from the Government.  They

have put forward a proposal and the people have a right

to know its implications. Surely the Minister is not so

dense  and dull as not to notice, or is he afraid  that

the  answers, if made truthfully, would lay bare  their

political sell-out?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me answer those questions since the

Government  Ministers have not dared to do.  These  are

what  will happen to the people of Singapore under  the

phoney merger of the P.A.P. -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Point of order. Is it in order for the

Member  for  Thomson to make statements without  having

read  my  speech but only the Member for  Queenstown's?

The answers were provided.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of order. It

does  amaze  me  that  Ministers  have  some  sort   of

intelligence  that brings them into  the  Chamber  when

they are being commented upon by Opposition Members!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> That is precisely the trouble with the

P.A.P. Ministers, Sir!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> They have got intelligence?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> They say one thing and mean an-other. I can

assure  the  Minister  for Culture  that  I  have  read

through  his speech which he has very kindly circulated

to  all  Members of the House at the expense of  public

money.  Opposition Members' speeches are not circulated

to  Government  Departments, statutory bodies  and  all

public  dignitaries. Those circulated are  only  Govern

ment  Ministers'  statements. They  are  not  even  the

Backbenchers'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> When you were a Backbencher, your's

was.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> As a result of that, I have read through not only the Minister's speech, but also the others. There was an attempt by the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for Finance to provide some form of answers to

these questions. But, in the first place, they were not

adequate  answers.  In  the  second  place,  since  the

Ministers fought shy of answering these questions,  let

me  provide the answers. They can then either accept or

deny them as they think fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was saying that these are what will happen to

the  people of Singapore under the phoney merger of the

P.A.P.:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Singapore citizens will retain their State

citizenship - something which they already have. The only

new  thing  they  will  have is the  so-called  Federal

national  status.  This Federal nationality  will  give

them nothing new except a Federal passport instead of a

British passport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Singapore citizens will be allowed to send only 15

representatives  to the Federal Parliament,  when  they

should be entitled to at least 25 Members in the  House

of Representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The P.A.P.'s pseudo merger, if it materialises,

will   not  enable  any  Singapore  citizen  to  become

automatically a Federal citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Not even those Singapore citizens born in Singapore

will have the automatic right to Federal citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. In fact, even those who will be born in Singapore

after  this  phoney merger will not be entitled  as  of

right  to become Federal citizens. What they will  have

will  be  just Singapore State citizenship like  anyone

born in Singapore under the present situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Singapore citizens will not have the right to vote

and  stand  for election when they go to the Federation

after this phoney merger. In fact, they will be treated

like foreigners there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The only way for Singapore citizens to obtain

Federal  citizenship after this P.A.P.'s phoney  merger

is that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) He must go and stay in the Federation for

another 10 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) He must pass a Malay language test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Satisfy the Federation Government that he is of

good  character.  That  is,  Sir,  his  political

views,  must  be  acceptable  to  the  Federation

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he has to apply just like any

foreigner or alien. The fact that he will be a  Federal

national will be completely irrelevant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the seven main important political

implications of this phoney merger, which  everyone  in

Singapore  must  know. But, Sir, there are  also  other

important implications:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Unlike Federal citizens, Singapore citizens will

not  be  able  to apply for jobs direct in the  Federal

Government  service. Their lack of Federal  citizenship

will  be a discriminating factor against them.  On  the

other  hand, Federal citizens will have the  right,  in

practice  though  not  in theory,  to  obtain  jobs  in

Singapore  Government service just as  they  are  doing

right now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The workers of Singapore will not be able to apply

for  jobs  in  the Federation on an equal footing  with

Federal citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The products of Singapore schools and universities

will  not  be  treated  on the same  footing  as  their

Federation counterparts when they apply for jobs in the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Singapore citizens will not be able to move freely

in the Federation. They can be easily barred from going

across the Causeway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Singapore citizens will not have full freedom of

speech  and  expression  in the  Federation.  Singapore

publications will not be allowed to circulate freely in

the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Students from Singapore schools and universities

will  not  have  the  right to  travel  freely  in  the

Federation,  intermingle with Federation students,  and

participate  in  students movements in  the  Federation

without  discrimination. In fact,  the  same  situation

will remain for them as it is now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. The workers of Singapore and of the Federation

will not be allowed to form Pan-Malayan trade unions so

that they can unite and strengthen the organisations in

their struggle to improve their livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. The people of Singapore and the people of the

Federation  will  not be permitted to form  Pan-Malayan

political Parties and social organisations in order  to

bring about unity and common



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



understanding  to  our  peoples  and  to  advance   our

interests as one united people.



<br><br>And last, but not the least, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. The businessmen of Singapore will not have equal

rights and opportunities as Federal businessmen if they

choose  to  do their business in the Federation.  Their

lack  of  Federal citizenship will be a  discriminating

factor against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Member for Queenstown has said, let the

truth  be  out. Let us not try to cover up  these  ugly

facts. Let there be no more bluff. Let the people  know

all  there is to know. They have the right to know  the

truth, the whole truth - nothing less and nothing else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I challenge the Straits Times to publish the ugly

truths of this phoney merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not want any challenges to

strangers in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is not as -



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of

order.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I think it is now  time  for

tea.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have not forgotten the time. I

was  under  the impression that the Member for  Thomson

was winding up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not winding up. I suggest that you can

adjourn  now, Sir. Perhaps it is an appropriate  moment

for tea.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member for Thomson be much

longer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> A little longer.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am glad to hear that. If it is

convenient,  then  we will suspend. I  shall  take  the

Chair again at 5.35 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was saying, Sir, at suspension time, that

the  English-educated is an important section of  our

people,  and they also have a right to know the  truth.

The Straits Times is enjoying the unhealthy monopoly of

being the only English newspaper in our country and  it

is  its  duty and responsibility to let them  know  the

truth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Mr Speaker, Sir, it was the Minister for

Finance  who  first  put up the bluff  that  under  the

Constitution  of the Federation of Malaya,  it  is  not

possible   for   all  Singapore  citizens   to   become

automatically Federal citizens on merger.  This  bluff,

Sir,  was completely exposed by the Member for  Queenstown. In his speech, Sir, the Minister for Finance  had

at  long  last  admitted that it was possible  for  all

citizens  of Singapore to become automatically citizens

of  the Federation of Malaya, though he said that  this

was  only  an  academic possibility. Sir, whatever  the

merits  of  the Minister for Finance are, I can  safely

say  that intellectual honesty is not one of them,  for

if  he  had known that it was constitutionally possible

for  automatic  conversion  of  Singapore  citizens  to

Federal  citizens on merger then why  did  he,  in  the

first  place,  Sir,  try to bluff our  people  in  such

categorical   terms   that  it   was   constitutionally

impossible?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will have noticed that one by

one  the  excuses  put up by the P.A.P.  Government  to

avoid  fighting for full equal citizenship  rights  for

all  Singapore  citizens, on the basis  that  they  all

become  automatic  Federal  citizens,  were  completely

exposed  by  the  Member  for  Queenstown.  As  he  has

summarised, the P.A.P.'s line of bluff was as  follows:

firstly,  automatic conversion of Singapore citizenship

to Federal citizenship was supposed to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



constitutionally  impossible.  Then  when   we   quoted

chapter  and  verse  and  Article  26  of  the  Federal

Constitution,  the P.A.P. changed its  line,  and  said

that it was politically unreasonable to demand for full

Federal  citizenship rights for all Singapore citizens.

Then  later it became a question of having to  register

for  citizenship  all over again and to  pass  a  Malay

language  test.  So  one  by  one  these  bluffs   were

completely exposed by the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the P.A.P. Government now puts up yet another

bluff  which  was not heard by the people of  Singapore

before.  And  this new bluff, Sir, is put  up  by  none

other  than  the Minister for Finance himself  when  he

said that the real reason why the Federation refuses to

accept  automatic conversion of all Singapore  citizens

to  Federal citizen on merger is that there are certain

Singapore  citizens  who are Communists  and  who  will

become  Federal citizens by this automatic  conversion.

Hence  it  is  to  prevent these Communists,  who  have

Singapore  citizenship  rights, from  becoming  Federal

citizens on merger that the Tunku has refused  to  give

Federal  citizenship  rights  to  all  the  630,000-odd

Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have never heard the Tunku say this. And for

all  we know, it may yet be another fast one which  the

Minister  for  Finance is trying to put over  us.  But,

Sir,  if it is really true that this is the real reason

why the Tunku does not want all Singapore citizens  to

become Federal citizens on merger, then we actually see

no   difficulty  whatsoever  in  meeting  the   Tunku's

requirements,  namely,  that no Singapore  citizen  who

also  happens to be a Communist should become a Federal

citizen.  Sir, as the Minister for Finance himself  has

said,  between  God and the Communists,  there  is  the

Special Branch.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Barisan!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, we have also heard the Prime Minister

telling us sometime ago that he believed there are only 300   Communists

in  Singapore.  Sir,  if  these   two

statements were true, then where is the difficulty? Why

cannot the Special



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



Branch  tell  us who these 300 Communists in  Singapore

are? What is sc difficult about it? What would give our

Government greater pleasure than to deprive  these  300

citizens  of their citizenship? The way then  would  be

clear  for  all  the rest of the 630,000-odd  citizens,

provided,  of  course, the Special  Branch - or  whatever

other Intelligence service the Government has - does  not

make  the same mistake as it made in the case of  Tommy

Koh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of the Barisan Sosialis, I wish to state

here categorically that if this is the real reason  why

the  Tunku refuses to accept all Singapore citizens  as

Federal  citizens on merger - namely, to prevent  certain

Singapore  citizens who happen also  to  be  Communists

from  becoming  Federal  citizens - then  let  the  Prime

Minister prove these 300 citizens to be Communists  and

deprive   them  of  their  citizenship,  so  that   the

remainder of the 630,000 Singapore citizens will be

given  automatic  right  to  Federal  citizenship   on

merger.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we sincerely hope  that  the

Minister  for  Finance will have no more excuses  after

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has said that Singapore

citizenship, after this phoney merger, will  not  be  a

second-class  citizenship.  I  regret,  Sir,  that  the

Member  for  Anson  was  being  too  academic  in   his

approach.  It  may be true, from the legal  standpoint,

that   there   is   no  such  thing   as   second-class

citizenship. I am not a lawyer, Sir, and  I  look  upon

citizenship, as I said before, from the viewpoint of  a

layman.  And  to  the  layman, if  he  finds  that  his

citizenship  is  of  value only  within  the  State  of

Singapore and becomes valueless the moment he steps out

of  his  own  State and into the other  States  of  the

nation,  then  he will realise that there is  something

lacking  in his own citizenship, especially, Sir,  when

he  finds  that  the  citizenship status  possessed  by

people in the other States is recognised throughout the

eleven  States of the Federation. Sir, he will  realise

that his own citizenship is definitely inferior. If his

citizenship is inferior, therefore, it can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



described  as  second-class. This may  not  be  legally

true, but from the common-sense point of view, I do not

think the Member for Anson will disagree with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has brought up a very

valuable  point which unfortunately the  Straits  Times

did  not  think  fit  to  give  it  the  prominence  it

deserves. The point, Sir, is that even under the P.A.P.

phoney merger, the 4:1 ratio will still apply to  these

Singapore Government services which will become part of

the pan-Malayan Federal Departments, and that there is,

in  fact, no difference whatsoever in this respect from

a complete merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not recollect the Member for

Anson  saying that under the "phoney" merger, all these

things  will  happen. I do not think he used  the  word

"phoney".  I  think he used the words "P.A.P. type  of

merger".



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I agree with you, Sir. I think he said, in

fact,  the  P.A.P. Government type of  merger.  But  in

content and substance, Sir, we all know that the P.A.P.

type  of  merger is no merger, and that it is merely  a

phoney merger. In other words, the 4:1 ratio will apply

in  a  complete merger, as is also in the case  of  the

P.A.P. phoney merger, to those parts of the civil service

which will come under Federal control. Thus, here, Sir,

another  P.A.P. bluff  against  complete  merger   was

exposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. also tried to frighten us

from  demanding  complete merger  by  threatening  that

Singapore's  free port status will be  destroyed  under

complete  merger.  But  again  we  know  this   to   be

absolutely not true. Penang today is completely  merged

with  the  Federation, and yet she is still maintaining

her  free port status. All this goes to show the  utter

insincerity  of  the P.A.P. It goes to  show  that  the

P.A.P. does   not   want  a  complete   and   genuine

reunification of the people, and because of this,  they

will  seek  every  excuse to frighten the  people  from

calling  for  a complete merger. It is quite  clear  to

everyone, Sir, again for people even with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



average  intelligence, that the people who are in  fact

anti-merger are the P.A.P. themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, what the P.A.P. really wants is not

true  merger but a phoney set-up which seeks  to  place

the  political destiny of the people of Singapore under

the  control  of the Government in the Federation  over

which  the people of Singapore cannot exert appropriate

influence. This aim, Sir, has already been made  clear.

The  P.A.P. simply hopes that this phoney merger set-up

will help the P.A.P. to retain its political power. The

P.A.P. leaders hope that the Federation Government, after

this  phoney merger, will put all the P.A.P. political

opponents into gaol so that there will be no opposition

whatsoever, except the weaklings in the S.P.A., in  the

next election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no people will aspire to or strive for a

political  change that will bring them no gain  or  for

one which will make their plight worse off. It need not

be  repeated,  Sir, that the people of  Singapore  have

long  aspired to be reunited with their brothers across

the Causeway. But, Sir, this aspiration, this aim, this

goal,  has  not been sought for nothing. Nor  have  the

people  longed  for merger as an empty manipulation  to

keep  afloat fast-sinking political bankrupts and turn-coats.  Sir,  the people seek and hope  for  a  genuine

reunification of the two territories so that the united

country  and  the people may have greater  freedom  and

command   greater  strength  to  lead   better   lives.

Therefore, Sir, it is essential that the conditions for

merger  must be negotiated with the mutual welfare  and

progress  of the people of the two territories  as  the

primary  objective. There is nothing insurmountable  in

the way of negotiating a merger wherein the citizens of

Singapore will automatically become the citizens of the

Federation.  We  can have nothing less than  this.  The

people  of  Singapore will never forgive any politician

or group of politicians who dare do otherwise. There is

nothing to prevent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



negotiation  on  the  question  of  automatic   Federal

citizenship being granted to all Singapore citizens. It

is rightly a matter to be negotiated by the two peoples

coming together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who assume responsibility on behalf of the

people  of  Singapore have the duty  to  see  that  any

settlement  arrived at will achieve the  objectives  of

mutual  welfare, progress, greater freedom and equality

for the people. Anything less than these will be a sell-out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, Sir, what the real intention of the

P.A.P. is. They do not want a complete merger  between

Singapore and the Federation. Therefore, each  time  we

give  some  reason to support a complete  merger,  they

start  giving another reason to show why we should  not

have complete merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a trade unionist. All these things remind me

of  what  happen during negotiations between  employers

and workers on matters which will advance the interests

of  the  workers. In such negotiations, Sir,  you  will

find  that the workers' representatives will put  forth

arguments  to support the workers' case,  and  to  each

such   argument  the  employers  will  put  up  another

argument to show why the workers' interests should  not

he advanced. Similarly, Sir, on this merger negotiation

we  in  the  Barisan Sosialis have the support  of  the

people.  Therefore,  we  put  up  arguments  that  will

support  the  advancement  of our  people's  interests.

Whereas  the P.A.P., which has now lost the support  of

the  people and whose political future depends now upon

the   support   of   the  Federation  Government,   and

therefore,  to every argument that is put  forward  for

complete  merger, they have put up another argument  on

behalf of the Federation Government. It is quite clear,

Sir,  whom the Federation Government now represents  in

this merger negotiation. It is quite evident, Sir, that

they  are  more  keen to show why Singa, pore  citizens

should   not  have  equal  status  than  why  Singapore

citizens  should have equal status. If  the  P.A.P. is

sincere  in  wanting  to advance the  interest  of  the

people  of  Singapore, why must it  keep  on  advancing

arguments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



which  will  deny  Singapore  citizens  the  right   to

automatic  Federal citizenship? In fact, Sir,  we  have

seen  our  Prime Minister literally putting words  into

the  Tunku's  mouth in order to deprive  all  Singapore

citizens  of the right to automatic Federal citizenship

on  merger.  He has said that the Tunku would  consider

him  dotty, if we were to put up the argument that  all

Singapore  citizens  should  be  Federal  citizens   on

merger. Surely, Sir, the Tunku can speak for himself. I

am quite certain that the Tunku is not so uncouth as to

go around calling people "dotty". Even in the letter by

the Prime Minister of Singapore  to the Prime Minister of the Federation  of

Malaya,  which was read out in this Assembly - I  believe

it  was  on  Friday, Sir - we could see  that  our  Prime

Minister  was,  in  fact,  supplying  the  Tunku   with

arguments  why  Singapore  citizens  should  not   have

automatic Federal citizenship right on merger. You will

note,  Sir,  that our Prime Minister again referred  to

the  argument that if Singapore were to merge with  the

Federation  like  Penang,  then  only  those  born   in

Singapore  would have the right to Federal citizenship.

In  other  words, Sir, our Prime Minister  was  arguing

that  if  Singapore were to merge with  the  Federation

like Penang, then Singapore should go in not as we  are

now, but as we were 16 years ago when we were separated

and  when  we  did not have State citizenship.  Surely,

Sir,  the  people  of Singapore can  see  through  this

ridiculous  line of argument. Our Prime Minister  seems

to  be more anxious to please the Federation Government

than  to please the people of Singapore. Whose side  is

our   Prime  Minister  on?  On  whose  behalf   is   he

negotiating? The people of Singapore or the  Government

of the Federation of Malaya.

they  speak, they seem to be extremely keen to  put  up

only  those  arguments which would show  why  Singapore

citizens  should not have automatic Federal citizenship

rights. The Minister for Culture, in his speech to this

Assembly,   put   up  many  ridiculous  arguments.   He

contended that after the P.A.P.'s phoney merger,  since

the   Federation   citizens   cannot   have   Singapore

citizenship  rights  in as much as  Singapore  citizens

cannot  have  Federal  citizenship  rights,  therefore,

Singapore   citizens  are  as  unequal  as   Federation

citizens, and therefore, since both are unequals,  they

are  equals. The whole Government benches,  I  believe,

Sir, laughed at this. I suppose they all thought it was

a  very  clever  arguments. Sir, this is an  absolutely

childish and puerile way of arguing -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member has been on the brink up

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I withdraw these words, Sir, As my

colleague,  the  Member for Nee Soon, pointed  out  the

other  day, monkeys confined in cages, looking  out  of

their  cages through the bars, may imagine  that  those

people  outside the bars are prisoners. Sir,  what  the

Minister  for Culture contends is something like  this.

If  a family of 12 people decide to -treat one of their

members as an outcast and confine him to live only in a

dungeon,  therefore, since the other  11  members  live

separately  from  that  one poor  chap  living  in  the

dungeon, they are as unequal as the poor chap living in

the  dungeon. Sir, it is not a case that these 11 chaps

cannot  enter the dungeon, but they simply do not  want

to, whereas that poor chap is clamouring to get out  of

his  plight. Really, Sir, it is sometimes sickening  to

infantile arguments in their -

wonders  how  much more these desperate P.A.P. leaders

would do to try to postpone their political doom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret very deeply the speech made

by  the Member for Geylang Serai. I respect him as  the

elected Member of the people of Geylang Serai who  are

predominantly  Malays. He is the  head  of  a  communal

Party,  the  U.M.N.O.  This question  of  merger  is  a

national  issue that seeks to bring unity, harmony  and

peace  to all our peoples irrespective of race,  colour

and  creed.  I  therefore deeply regret that  on  this

national issue the Member for Geylang Serai should have

made  an emotional speech the other day. He has accused

the Barisan Sosialis of being communal on the basis  of

groundless accusations. It is not only regrettable  but

completely despicable that the P.A.P., which  professes

to  be a non-communal Party, also attempts to stir  up

communal feelings during this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall first deal with these despicable P.A.P.

attempts to stir up communal feelings and I shall  then

later discuss -calmly with the Member for Geylang Serai

on  what he has said. The P.A.P. has attempted to  sour

relationship  between  the  Barisan  Sosialis  and  the

Federation Government and has attempted to  paint  our

differences  with  the Federation Government  as  being

based on communalism. It has tried to stir up hostility

in  the  Federation  against the  Barisan  Sosialis  by

emphasising  that  we  aim  to  topple  the  Federation

Government on complete



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



merger. They have said it in such a way as to  give  a

communal  overtone to the whole matter. I said  earlier

that if the P.A.P. is sincerely a socialist Party, then

these  things  are precisely what they  should  do.  In

fact, as has been pointed out, these were actually  the

very  same objectives of the P.A.P. in those days  when

they had the support of the people. Why is it that the

P.A.P. leaders  are now harping on  these  matters  as

though they carry with them a communal bias?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has challenged us to state whether we

support the Federation policies on education and labour

under  complete merger. This is absolute  nonsense.  We

have already very clearly stated our stand on education

and  labour.  If the Government Ministers had  been  in

this  Chamber  while  the  Member  for  Queenstown  was

delivering his speech, they would have known our  Party

stand on these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just to elucidate them, allow me to quote the

policy  statement  of  my Party made  on  the  28th  of

August, 1961:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We fully realise that many of the policies of the

present  Right-wing  Government in the  Federation  are

unacceptable  to us. The present Federation  Government

is in close alliance with foreign capital. It has bound

the  country  to  the  so-called British/Malaya  mutual

defence  treaty  and  turned  our  motherland  into   a

military  base  for British armed forces.  Its  foreign

policy  has alienated our country from the main  stream

of  Afro-Asia, particularly Indonesia, Ghana and India.

Its  internal policies are repressive, particularly  to

trade  unions and intellectuals. Freedom of expression,

organisation and other civil liberties are  curbed  and

its  educational policy is misguided. Nevertheless,  we

are  willing to accept these disabilities and  join  up

with the socialist forces in the Federation to build  a

great alliance with peasants, workers and intellectuals

to  defeat  by  constitutional  means  the  reactionary

forces at the general elections. Our socialist comrades

in   the  Federation  have  for  long  been  waging   a

determined struggle against the reactionary  forces  of

the   Federation  Government.  We  will  strength  this

struggle by joining hands with the Federation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will note, Sir, that we have stated in categorical

terms  that  as  a  Party  which  firmly  believes   in

socialism,  we cannot agree with the present Federation

Government's -policies on labour, education  and  other

matters. This is only to be expected in view of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



the fact that the present Federation Government is not

a  socialist  Government. What we seek to  do  is  that

after  complete merger, we will utilise all the  normal

constitutional and democratic methods to  convince  the

people of Malaya that our policies are better and  hope

thereby  to  effect  a change in these  policies.  That

would  appear, Sir, to be the normal democratic way  of

doing  things.  But  apparently it  is  something  very

unsatisfactory to the P.A.P. which professes  to  be  a

socialist Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we notice that the P.A.P., on the one hand, are

actually  playing to communal feelings in Singapore  by

harping  all  the time on the fact that  they  seek  to

safeguard  Chinese education in Singapore; yet  on  the

other  hand, they accuse us of being communal  when  we

are  prepared  to  let the Federation  Government  have

complete  control  of  our  educational  policy  in   a

complete merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicly, the P.A.P. professes to be a non-communal

Party. But we have noticed that in recent months it

has been playing a very dangerous communal line in

local politics. We have known that the P.A.P. leaders

in private have been using communal arguments in order

to split the Malay members and the Chinese members of

the socialist movement in Malaya. We know that during

the period of the split within the rank and file of the

P.A.P., the Minister for Culture went to the Federation

to seek the support of the socialists in the Socialist

Front of the Federation of Malaya. We know that in

those instances, the Minister for Culture tried to play

a communal line when he met members of the socialist

movement in the Federation -

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, you will have noticed during the debate

on  this  amendment  that various Government  Ministers

have accused the Barisan Sosialis of being communal and

all  that I seek to do is to explain our stand  and  to

show,  in fact, whether we, as socialists, or the P.A.P

Government,   which  profess  to  be   socialist,   are

communal.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether I am wrong,

but  I  think the allegation that the Barisan  Sosialis

were  communal  was  made  in relation  to  the  merger

motion.  There is no debate as to whether  or  not,  in

fact,  in  other  instances the  Barisan  Sosialis  are

communal  or the P.A.P. are communal. I think the  hon.

Member  is bringing in some other aspect of this  being

communal or non-communal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I can assure you that what I am saying

is,  in  fact, related to the merger issue that we  are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, Sir, he told a Malay socialist - a

friend  of mine - that Mr Lim Ching Siong has now become

anti-nationalist and anti-Malay and he said this  in  a

very  indirect  way. The Minister for  Culture  alleged

that Mr Alex Josey who I believe lives with him in the

same  house  -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow tall

these personal names to be brought into this debate.  I

do  not know how that is relevant to this merger issue.

If  the hon. Member wishes to make a direct allegation,

he  must be able to substantiate it, or tell me exactly

how  it  is  relevant to this merger motion.  I  cannot

allow all these personalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I did say, Sir, that I intend to show the

relevance of what I am saying to the motion that we are

debating  today.  Sir,  we are debating  the  issue  of

merger  and  it  is  something that  affects  all  our

people.  It so happens that we, have two large sections

of our population - one Chinese and the other Malays.  I

have  noticed, Sir, the Government speakers all through

this  debate have directly and indirectly implied  that

we are opposing merger on a communal basis and all that

I  seek  to  do, Sir, is to show that this is  not  the

case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is needless to say that the communal line of

the  Minister for Culture failed completely to win over

the  support of the Malay socialists in the Federation.

.We  know  that  our Malay socialist cornrades  in  the

Federation  are  able  to  see  through  the   P.A.P.'s

mischievous and bankrupt propaganda line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we heard the Minister for Culture saying the

other  day in this Assembly That our demand for Federal

automatic  citizenship for all Singapore citizens  will

strengthen the P.M.I.P. in the Federation.  Sir,  what  absolute rubbish is  this.  Everyone

knows  that  the  P.M.I.P. is on the decline.  Everyone

knows  that  the Malay rakyat and workers are  becoming

more politically awakened nowadays and are beginning to

see  through  the  emptiness and futility  of  communal

propaganda.  Like their Malay brethren  in Indonesia,

the Malays in Malaya are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



beginning to realise that the answer to their  economic

problems lies in socialism. Why is the P.A.P., which is

supposed  to be a socialist Party, completely  ignoring

the  fact  that the Party Ra'ayat in the Federation  is

gaining  strength from day to day? Why has  the  P.A.P.

not  mentioned  in  this  House  the  fact  that  Inche

Boestamam,  the  leader  of  the  Party  Ra'ayat,   has

declared  in  the Federal Parliament debate  on  merger

that  Singapore should only be taken in in  a  complete

merger  with  all  Singapore citizens becoming  Federal

citizens? Is the Minister for Culture going to tell  us

that   Inche  Boestamam,  the  Chairman  of  the  Party

Ra'ayat,  by  saying  this  was,  in  fact,  trying  to

strengthen  the  P.M.I.P. which is  supposed  to  be  a

communal Party?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I need not have to tell the people that the

Minister   for   Culture's  arguments  are   not   only

ridiculously  hollow but that they are  becoming  quite

dangerous.  Sir,  it  is  regrettable  that  in   their

desperation, the P.A.P. leaders are playing a dangerous

communal  line. We have noticed that even  some  months

ago  before  the split had taken place the  P.A.P. was

shouting  dangerous  slogans  like  "Israel  and   Arab

world",  "Chinese chauvinism", etc. Yet  in  the  early

days  of  the  P.A.P.,  we  heard  the  P.A.P. leaders

constantly boasting that the Chinese in Singapore  were

not chauvinistic but socialistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We clearly remember, Sir, our Prime Minister in 1957

boasting  that  the election of Inche  Buang  Bin  Omar

Junid  on the P.A.P. ticket in the Kallang by-election,

which was predominantly a Chinese constituency, was  an

outstanding demonstration of the non-communal  attitude

of the Chinese in Singapore. Yet today, Sir, the P.A.P.

is   playing  a  double-edged  communal  line.  To  the

Chinese,  the  P.A.P. tries to appeal  to  chauvinistic

feelings by harping on autonomy on education.  Even  on

the  debate, Sir, on the dispute in the Chinese schools

the other day, the Prime Minister deliberately spoke in

Mandarin when we all know he can express himself better

in English and yet -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the point was raised by the

Member   for  Have-lock.  He  objected  to  the   Prime

Minister  commenting that the Member for  Havelock  was

speaking in Mandarin and I ruled the Prime Minister out

of  order.  Now  I  find  the  Member  for  Thomson  is

objecting  to the Prime Minister speaking in Mandarin.

Let  us  not  say 'Yes' and 'No', 'Yes' and 'No'.  That

seems  to  be what the debate is coming to.  Shall  we

carry on with the merger debate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the P.A.P. has also been playing on the

fears  of  the  non-Malays  in  the  civil  service  by

constantly  harping  on  the  question  of  the  4:  1

preferential treatment for Malays in the Federal  civil

service.  This, Sir, is a dangerous piece of anti-Malay

propaganda by  the  P.A.P.  Yet, on the other hand, to the  Malays,

the  P.A.P. is trying to paint the Barisan Sosialis  as

being  pro-Chinese by saying that the Barisan  Sosialis

does  not agree with the Federation Government's policy

on  education. But any intelligent person knows that it

is  because  the  P.A.P. also does not agree  with  the

Federation  Government's education policy that  it  is

trying   to  have  a  different  education  policy   in

Singapore.  The only difference is that the P.A.P. has

not  got  the guts to admit this for fear that it  will

lose the favour of the Federation Government whose help

it needs very badly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government, having lost the support of

the people, has forgotten all its socialist principles.

It  is  playing on very dangerous communal  propaganda,

stirring  up one community against another. Sir,  I  am

not  a Chinese. My ancestors came from India but I  was

born  in the Federation and so were my parents. I  look

towards  Malaya  as the country of  my  birth,  as  the

object  of my loyalty. That is my only country.  I  was

brought up and educated in this country to which I  owe

my  complete  loyalty.  Sir,  I  am  a  socialist  and,

therefore, I cannot be a communalist. For anyone,  Sir,

to  accuse a socialist of being communalistic  is  like

anyone trying to accuse a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



Christian of not believing in Jesus Christ.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, socialism and communalism are

something  like  black and white. We cannot  breed  one

with the other. If you are a socialist, you cannot  be

communalistic  at  the same time. It therefore  grieves

me,  Sir, to hear the Member for Geylang alleging  that

we in  the Barisan Sosialis are communalistic.  Sir,  I

would  be grateful if the hon. Member could point  out

the  parts  of  the  speech made by my  colleague,  the

Member  for  Queenstown, which were  communalistic.  In

fact,  the  Member for Queenstown became very emotional

when  he came to that part of his speech which appealed

for  communal unity and harmony. He also sought in  his

conclusion to show that there is no antagonism between

the  basic  interest  of the various  races  living  in

Malaya.  He  illustrated this  by  describing  how  the

workers  of  the  various  races  in  Singapore  united

themselves  to  fight and struggle  for  better  living

conditions. I believe he quoted the outstanding example

of  the Public Daily-Rated Employees Unions Federation,

how  workers of various races have complete  unity  and

identity  of aims and interests. Sir, how can  one  who

appeals  for communal unity and harmony be  accused  of

being communal?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown, as you know, is a

medical man and he has been trained to regard all human

beings   as   basically  the  same,  that   under   the

superficial  difference of colour of  the  skin,  human

beings  are  basically composed of the same  anatomical

and  physiological  elements. How can  anyone  possibly

accuse  the  Member for Queenstown of  all  persons  of

being communalistic?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Geylang Serai quoted our reference

to  apartheid as going to show that we have  adopted  a

communal  attitude.  Sir,  we  have  often  heard   the

Federation  Government saying that one of  the  reasons

why  they  did  not want Singapore to  merge  with  the

Federation  is  that  there are  too  many  Chinese  in

Singapore.  We  all know the reason why the  Federation

Government is prepared to accept



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



Singapore only if the Borneo territories come in at the

same  time.  Sir, it is because the Government  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya hopes that  the  non-Chinese  in

Borneo  will  thereby help to balance  the  Chinese  in

Singapore.  Is  this  not a communal  approach  to  the

problem  of  reunification? Does  not  the  Member  for

Geylang Serai agree that this is, in fact, communalism?

Sir, we say that if this is the reason - namely, that the

Federation  Government  is  afraid  of  the   numerical

strength  of  the Chinese in Singapore on  merger,  and

because  of  this it hopes to isolate  the  people  of

Singapore by giving it separate citizenship - then,  Sir,

this  proposed  constitutional set-up  would  obviously

smack heavily of apartheid, and we appeal to the Tunku,

above all others, to refrain from imposing such a  set-up  on  the  people of Singapore. Sir, how can  we,  by

being  so,  be accused of being communalistic?  It  is

because we do not want communalism that we oppose  the

set-up that smacks heavily of communal isolation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really cannot understand, Sir, why the Member for

Geylang  Serai  concluded that we are communalistic  in

our  approach. Sir, with the greatest, respect  to  the

Member  for  Geylang Serai, I believe he has completely

misunderstood   what  my  colleague  the   Member   for

Queenstown has said. Sir, the other day the Member  for

Geylang  Serai  admitted  that  he  knows  nothing   of

socialism. I think, Sir, it is because he knows nothing

of  socialism  that  he begins to  suspect  us  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis of being communalistic. I  have  said

that   socialism   and   communalism   are   completely

antagonistic  ideologies. If  the  Member  for  Geylang

Serai understands something of socialism, Sir, I do not

think  he  will  ever  accuse us  socialists  of  being

communalistic.  Sir, socialism is an ideology  that  is

sweeping across the world, and I am sure that the  next

generation  will be able to fulfil our  hope  that  the

whole  human  race  on  earth will  be  living  happily

together  in a socialist world. I would appeal  to  the

hon. Member for Geylang Serai, for his own elucidation,

to  try  and understand what socialism is, so  that  at

least



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



if  he wishes to criticise the socialists, he should do

it  on  the basis of what he knows about socialism  and

not  on  the  basis  of  what he does  not  know  about

socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to discuss

briefly  the  basis for unity among all  our  races  in

Malaya.  I  think,  Sir, you will agree  that  this  is

perhaps  the  most appropriate moment in  our  history,

because we are today faced with the prospect of a  plan

for  reunification, a  plan to  unite  the  people  of

Malaya, which unfortunately, Sir, in my view,  is  not

going to bring about unity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that when anyone talks about

communal  problems, they commonly refer to the  Chinese

and  the Malays. I think this is because the Malays and

the  Chinese  are numerically the same. Sir,  I  am  an

Indian  in  origin and I cannot, therefore,  be  biased

towards  the Malays or the Chinese. I am, as  it  were,

neutral  in  the matter. As a socialist.  I  view  this

whole  question  of  communal unity  from  a  socialist

standpoint  and  not  a  communal  standpoint.   As   a

socialist, Sir, I cannot see any antagonism between any

race in our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the majority of the Malays, the Chinese, and the

Indians,   are  poor.  The  majority  of  these   three

communities live from day to day, struggling for  their

livelihood. As a trade unionist who all the time  works

with them, I have seen workers of all races sharing the

same  difficulties, the same problems and the same hope

for a better standard of living. Sir, it is the hope of

the  majority of all our communities that there  should

be  a  change in the social and economic set-up in  our

society  so  that  it  will bring about  better  living

conditions  to the poor people of all our  communities.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed:</b> Yes. (In Malay): I would like to know

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am gradually inclining to that point of

view.  It  seems to me that the Member for  Thomson  is

going  further  and  further away  from  the  amendment

before  the  House. I did stop another Member - I  forget

who  it was -  who began a discourse on socialism, and  I

said  that  that was taking him too far away  from  the

amendment. May I ask the Member for Thomson not  to  go

too tar away from the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I do not intend to go too far and I

wish to assure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime

Minister  that  it  is  not  my  intention  to  give  a

discourse on socialism. I seek to explain the stand  of

the 13 Members of the Barisan Sosialis, and the Barisan

Sosialis  as  such,  on  this  issue  so  that  it   is

understood clearly once and for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point that I wanted to make just now is this.

Just  as  there  are poor Malays, there are  also  poor

Chinese  and  poor  Indians. Just as  there  are  Malay

peasants struggling from hand to mouth, there are  poor

Chinese who live in wretched slums in the Chinatown  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the cry for better living conditions for better

economic standards, is a cry common to the poor of  all

races in our country. I believe we must unite the  poor

of  all  races to bring about a better form of society.

If  the  poor  of  each  of these communities  were  to

struggle separately for a better living, they would not

achieve- as much as they would if they struggled  as  a

united body. And I see, Sir, in this common struggle by

the majority of all communities for better standards of

living,  a real basis for unity between the peoples  of

all  races.  Sir, I can assure the Member  for  Geylang

Serai  that  when  the Malay peasants struggle  against

exploitation  by  members of any community,  they  will

find in the workers of Singapore, irrespective of their

colour,  race,  or creed, friends that  are  second  to

none.  Amongst the workers and the peasants, there  can

be no basis for communalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for the Southern Islands has tried to

say  that  the Chinese in Singapore should be  grateful

for what they are having now. Sir, I think this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



is  a very regrettable statement to make. No one should

consider himself grateful for what he has. What we  are

having now is merely the result of objective political,

social,  economic,  and  historical  factors.  If   the

Chinese  or  the  Indians,  and  for  that  matter  any

community,  have political rights in Singapore,  it  is

because  the historical, social, political and economic

conditions  necessitate this right. No political  right

should  be  considered  a  result  of  charity  of  any

particular community, just as the Malays from Indonesia

have  the right t participate in the political life  of

the country which they have come to adopt as their own.

People who have come from other countries also have the

tight to political participation in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the peace, harmony and unity that we have today

among  the  various communities in Malaya is  something

which  all the people should be grateful for, not  just

the Chinese, the Indians, or the Malays. Racial harmony

and unity is something that will bring benefit not only

to one particular community but to all the communities.

Sir, we the Barisan Sosialis are deeply concerned with

the  economic  difficulties of our Malay  brothers  and

sisters.  This is not because the Malays are inherently

backward, as the British wanted us to believe.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder if the hon. Member can

relate that to the merger motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am coming to the 4:1 ratio, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I think the hon. Member has

made  his  point. He has been labouring on this  point,

and  it is just the type of labouring that I have tried

to ask Members to avoid, by making my announcement this

morning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I abide by what you say, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Barisan Sosialis agree that special

attention   must  be  paid  to  improving  the   living

conditions and economic welfare of the Malay  community

in  this  country. Unlike the P.A.P., Sir,  we  do  not

grudge  special  preferential treatment  to  our  Malay

brothers  and sisters in Singapore on complete  merger.

Unlike the P.A.P., Sir, we do not try



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



to  frighten the people of Singapore by asking for

complete  merger, by harping on the 4:1 ratio,  or

the  preferential  treatment  for  Malays  in  the

Federation.  We fully agree with the intention  of

the Federation Government in respect of its desire

to  raise  the  standard of living  of  the  Malay

rakyat  and the Malay workers of our country,  who

have    suffered   enough   at   the   hands    of

maladministration under the colonial government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to assure the representatives of the

U.M.N.O  in this Assembly that if they truly  want

to  struggle  for better standards of  living  and

better  economic conditions for the  Malays,  they

will  find in the socialist movement a friend that

is  second to none. I wish to point out, Sir, that

they  can take that as a categorical assurance  on

behalf  of  all socialists in Malaya.  I  wish  to

point out to the Member for Geylang Serai and  the

Member  for the Southern Islands that it  was  the

socialist  movement in Singapore  which  persuaded

the Chinese and the Indian and the other non-Malay

communities  to adopt a non-communal line  and  to

accept   the   Malay  language  as  our   national

language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Geylang Serai, in concluding

his  speech, used words like "long axes" and "long

parangs". Sir, I am sure -

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> I used the words "long axes"

and "parang" metaphorically. But if the Member for

Thomson  would like further clarification  of  the

word  "parang",  I  would  be  only  too  glad  to

clarify.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am grateful for his clarification,

Sir.  But to many people who are not as conversant

in  the  Malay language as the Member for  Geylang

Serai, the words "parang" and "axes"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



mean   something  much  more  than   metaphorical.

Perhaps,  Sir,  it  is just unfortunate.  I  quite

understand,  Sir,  that  perhaps  the  Member  for

Geylang Serai was carried away by his emotion. But

I  wish to assure him, and I am sure he will agree

with me in this, that an emotional display will do

no one any good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to say just this one bit to Members

of  U.M.N.O. We will never resort to  the  use  of

violence  to solve the problems of our people.  We

shall    only    use   reasoning,   understanding,

tolerance,  peaceful and constitutional  means  to

achieve  our objectives. This is because  we  have

full confidence in these methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one would have expected from

the  P.A.P.  Ministers some new  points  in  their

arguments as to why merger with Singapore entering

as the twelfth State is unacceptable to them. They

have  opposed  our  amendment, but  kept  signally

silent  as  to  the reasons for their  opposition.

Instead,  they have replayed the same  old  P.A.P.

propaganda  tune. Thus, the Minister for  Culture,

in his rambling address, has confined himself only

to a rehashing of the usual P.A.P. trash, and this

too,  Sir, far less convincingly than in the past.

He  has  tried  to show in a very  roundabout  and

tedious  way  that  the Barisan  Sosialis  is  not

sincere  in  its  call for merger as  the  twelfth

State of the Federation of Malaya, and that we are

in   fact,  anti-merger.  I  fail  completely   to

understand  how he has arrived at this conclusion.

Even  the  statements he has quoted  do  not  lend

support  to his contention. I will deal  with  the

statements a little later. But I am sure  many  of

us  here  are  just  as  bewildered  at  the  word

"logic". Probably, Sir, his consultation in occult

sciences  and astrology must have aided him  m  no

small way to arrive at what he wants us to believe

in.  Sir,  when desperate politicians  reach  this

stage,  they are well past the border line between

sanity and insanity. He has stated, Sir, that  the

key to the understanding of the stand taken by the

Barisan  Sosialis lies in the fact that  we  broke

away  from  the P.A.P., not over the  question  of

merger  but because we wanted to push forward  the

constitutional anti-colonial struggle; because  we

wanted to abolish the Internal Security



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



Council  and wrest from our colonial masters the  right

of   self-determination.  This,  Sir,  is   a   correct

observation.  The  crisis in  the  P.A.P. was  not  over

merger, but over the departure of the P.A.P. leadership

from  the  proclaimed socialist aims and objectives  of

the  Party.  The P.A.P. leadership was not  willing  to

strive for more freedom. In political jargon, Sir,  the

P.A.P. leadership  moved further and  further  to  the

Right, and  thus  further and further  away  from  its

socialist aims and promises before it came into office.

This soon became indistinguishable from the actions  of

a  Right-wing  Government. Permit, Sir,  to  quote  the

Tunku -  a  very  shrewd  man  according  to  our  Prime

Minister - to illustrate my point. On the 16th  October

in the Federal Parliament, on the merger debate, he was

reported thus in the Straits Times of 17th October:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore, after the elections of 1959 tried to set

up  what  we might call an extreme Socialist Government

under the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they assumed office they tried to put to trial

Socialist  ideas  and  at the same  time  attempted  to

secure    an    understanding   with   the   Federation

Government.'



<br><br>A few paragraphs later, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They found it difficult to run the island without the

cooperation of men in commerce and industry,  and  also

without  being on the best of terms with the Federation

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsible leaders then realised that they owed a

duty to the people to serve their interests rather than

themselves, so the seeds of difference between the non-Communist and pro-Communist elements in the P.A.P. were

sown which today have broken into a complete break.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Prime Minister of Singapore felt rather

concerned  and approached me with some of his  problems

and  difficulties.  We  made a  careful  study  of  the

situation  and  came to the conclusion  that  the  only

salvation for Singapore would be in some form of closer

economic   and  constitutional  association  with   the

Federation.'



<br><br>Sir,  in  other  words,  the  Tunku  states  that   the

leadership of the P.A.P., since assuming office in  May

1959,  have  forsaken  their socialist  policies.  They

have,  in the eyes of the Tunku, who prides himself  on

being  a  Right-wing leader, changed from  "an  extreme

Socialist Government" to "responsible leaders.". We all

know what the Tunku means when he says



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



"responsible   leaders".  The  hon. the   Member   for

Cairnhill  was  also once referred to as a  responsible

leader.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture quoted some of our Party

statements and tried to draw ridiculous inferences from

the  stand  our  Party has taken on the  constitutional

future  of  Singapore. He tried to ridicule  our  Party

stand   by   saying  that  we,  after   advancing   two

alternatives,    namely,    complete     merger     and

confederation,   concluded   that   Singapore    should

therefore  have  only  internal  self-government.  Sir,

allow me to quote in full once again the statements  of

my  Party on the constitutional future of Singapore, so

that there will be no distortion of our stand. They are

only brief quotations, Sir. The Minister for Culture, I

believe,  also  used the same documents to  quote.  Sir

this is the Declaration of Meetings of the Conveners of

the Barisan Sosialis. I quote item 5:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our stand on the constitutional future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis stand for a united Malayan State

comprising  the territories now known as Singapore  and

the Federation of Malaya. Unification of the Federation

and  Singapore is inevitable and we are glad that there

is some universal recognition of this fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we note that thoughts on a united

Malayan  State  are being tied up with the  concept  of

Malaysia,  i.e. including the Borneo territories.  The

way  ahead  therefore for a real reunification  of  our

people and our country is in one of two directions:



(a)   An  immediate,  full  and  complete  merger  with

Singapore  joining  Federation as a  constituent  State

like  Penang  or  Malacca. (b) As an  autonomous  unit

within  a  confederation  with the  Borneo  territories

coming in when possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the serious disabilities, that the

socialist  movement will have to  put  up  with  by  an

immediate  and full merger. Our socialist  comrades  in

the  Federation  have  been struggling  to  remove  the

various  oppressive laws and put an end to the  various

oppressive measures directed against us. We shall  join

them and intensify the struggle against these laws  and

measures. In the meantime, we are prepared to accept as

a stage to eventual merger a constitutional arrangement

for  a confederation within which Singapore will be  an

antonomous unit with full autonomy in internal matters,

including  internal security, and conceding  by  treaty

the  fields  of  external affairs and  defence  to  the

Federation  Government. Such an  arrangement  will  not

only mean quite substantial advances for the people  of

Singapore  hut  it will also bring an end  to  colonial

rule in Singapore.



Whatever the direction-'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



This  is  an important paragraph, Sir, from  which  the

Minister for Culture used to draw wrong inferences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whatever the direction we choose to take, it is

imperative  that  the anti-colonial  struggle  must  be

intensified.  We  must  abolish the  Internal  Security

Council and wrest the right of self-determination  from

the colonial power by 1963.'



<br><br>And,  Sir,  in  the  statement issued  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis   on  the  constitutional  advance   and   the

reunification  of  the  two  territories  on  the  27th

October, 1961, we said this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We wish to emphasise once again that merger must

remain  our important objective. If merger is  possible

forthwith, then we are prepared to convince the  people

of  Singapore  to  accept this opportunity  to  achieve

national unity. In view of the fact that the Tunku  has

stated  categorically that the merger we ask for cannot

be  attained in the immediate future, we must  consider

alternatives  of  constitutional  advance.  As  a  step

forward to eventual merger, we will agree to some  form

of  relationship with the Federation of Malaya based on

full   autonomy   for  Singapore,  including   internal

security.'



<br><br>This  is  in  the absence of full and complete  merger.

Further:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The constitutional struggle of our people must,

however,  not remain stagnant whilst we wait  for  some

form  of satisfactory relationship with the Federation.

While   our  people  settle  their  problems  to  unite

themselves,  we must not forget, that the  main  factor

that  divides  our territories and our peoples  is  the

existence of the colonial power. The imperialist policy

of  divide  and  rule needs no explanation.  The  fight

against  colonialism  in  whatever  form  is  not  only

antagonistic  to the unity of our peoples,  but  is  an

essential complement. While we forge ahead the tempo of

uniting  our peoples, it is important that  we  proceed

all   out   to   eradicate  colonialism  in  Singapore.

Therefore,  if  no  satisfactory  relationship  can  be

established  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya  in  the

immediate  future, we must strive for full and  genuine

self-government in 1963.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had to read this throughout because I wanted to

make  sure that there is no distortion of our stand  at

least  in  the future. Sir, you will have noticed  from

these quotations that we believe it is only when either

merger  or  confederation is impossible  that  we  will

persist  in  fighting  for more democratic  rights  and

political freedom for our people, and that the  minimum

demand  we  should  put up in the  next  constitutional

talks in London in 1963 is complete self-government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



for the people of Singapore. It is clear from  our

statements  that  if  at any time  complete  merger  or

confederation  is  possible, then we will  gladly  grab

this  opportunity to have closer relationship with  the

Federation  based  on equality and  democracy.  But  we

cannot agree if the proposition put forward is like the

P.A.P.'s phoney merger. We cannot agree with the P.A.P.

that  in  the  absence  of  any  form  of  satisfactory

unification  with  the  Federation,  Singapore   should

remain  politically  stagnant. We have  stated  clearly

that  the  struggle  for  more  democratic  rights  and

political freedom for the people of Singapore does  not

in   any   way  contradict  our  struggle  for  genuine

unification  between Singapore and the  Federation.  We

have  stated that since it was the colonial power which

divided  our people and our country, any struggle  that

will  reduce  colonial influence in  our  country  will

logically  reduce  the  main factor  that  divides  our

people  and  our country. That seems to be the  logical

and  sensible  way  for anyone who  sincerely  wants  a

genuine unification of our people. We cannot agree with

P.A.P. that the continuance of colonialism in Singapore

will in any way contribute to the unity of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture speaks of complete self-government in Singapore as though it is something fearful and frightening, as though it is something that would divide Singapore further away from the Federation. Sir, let me suggest to the Minister for Culture that he should read what his master, the Prime

Minister  (Mr  Lee  Kuan Yew) said on  internal  self-government  in Singapore in 1955. I have only  a  brief

quotation  to make from Hansard, Vol. 1,  col.  21,  of

26th April, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We believe, Sir, that this country is fit now for

full self-government-'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that was in l955 - six years ago. And six years

ago,  our  Prime Minister believed that Singapore  then

should have full self-government straightaway. But  now

six  years  later,  his  colleague, the  Minister  for

Culture, is telling us that we in Singapore should  not

have  full self-government because that will  divide

Singapore further away from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



Federation. What utter rubbish! Who is doing the double

talk?  who is doing the double thinking? Who is  saying

one  thing  at  one time and another thing  at  another

time?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister later, on 4th April, 1956, said, in Hansard, Vol. 1, col. 1794 words which are now being contradicted by the Minister for Culture. I shall quote

these words, Sir, but I want to say first that when the

Prime Minister was speaking then, he was speaking on  a

motion  moved  by  the then Chief Minister,  Mr  David

Marshall, to instruct the All-Party Delegation  to  the

constitutional talks in London "to seek  forthwith  for

Singapore the status of an independent territory within

the Commonwealth, and to offer an agreement between the

United  Kingdom Government and the Singapore Government

whereby  the Government of the United Kingdom would  in

respect  of  Singapore exercise control  over  external

defence  and  give guidance in foreign relations  other

than trade and commerce."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, this motion called on the

delegation  to seek an independent State  of  Singapore

having control over all its internal affairs, including

internal  security, but with external  defence  in  the

control  of  the  U.K. Government who shall  also  give

guidance in foreign relations. Our Prime Minister  said

this in col. 1794:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not believe that my Freedom is

a  matter  for argument and that I must justify  why  I

must be free.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are admirable words, Sir, but our Prime Minister

continued further. We quote him in the fourth paragraph

of col. 1794:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Freedom is the birthright of all peoples everywhere

in  this  world.  Because my forefathers  migrated  for

purely  selfish economic reasons to what they call  the

South  Seas,  a  whole generation of some  two  million

Chinese  are today left in Malaya with Malaya as  their

only home and, necessarily thereby, the sole object  of

their loyalty.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet today, Sir, our Prime Minister wants us to think

that  getting  some form of political integration  with

the  Federation  at  all costs, even  at  the  cost  of

selling away our equal citizenship



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



status,   is  something  justifiable.  He  refuses   to

consider   any   form  of  constitutional   advancement

whatsoever  out  of  the context of merger.  Our  Prime

Minister  begins  all  of  sudden  to  think  that  any

constitutional  advance for Singapore towards  reducing

colonial influence in Singapore will lead to a  further

division  of  Singapore from the Federation.  Why  this

sudden  change  of attitude? Or was he advocating  this

attitude in 1956 merely because he then had the support

of  the people but now, having lost the support of  the

people,  he  has  abandoned it because  he  knows  that

without the Federation Government support, he  will

not have a hope of political survival?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, Sir, I must congratulate the Minister

for   Finance  on  his  observation  that  the  Barisan

Sosialis is roughly in a similar position as the P.A.P.

was  in .1959. Sir, why does the Minister not draw  the

obvious conclusion that the P.A.P. of 1961 is different

from  the  P.A.P. of 1959? Power corrupts and  absolute

power corrupts absolutely. We have seen its bad effects

even though the power is not absolute. We have seen, in

the  history of the socialist movement, renegades  like

the  MacDonalds  and  the Stracheys  who  fall  by  the

wayside.  What  the  socialist movement  discards,  the

P.A.P. embraces with glee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may God spare us the fate of the angry young men

of  the  '50s  who, in a short space of 2�  years  in

office,  have  not  only lost their  youth  but  their

anger. The Tunku has, in addition, shown one point  and

that  is  that it was, only after - I repeat,  Sir,  only

after -  our  Prime  Minister had run into  difficulties

within his own Party, because of his refusal to rectify

his mistakes, that is after Hong Lim, and the demand by

five   other  trade  unionists  and  myself,  that   he

prostrated  himself  before  the  Tunku,  -begged   the

Tunku's  help and cooked up this present deal which  he

has the temerity to call merger. Again, at the time  of

the  Hong  Lim by-election when I, in common with  five

other  trade  unionists, made the call  to  the  P.A.P.

leadership   to  rectify  its  ways,  to  release   the

political detainees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



and  strive for the abolition of the Internal  Security

Council by 1963, to proceed with the unification of the

trade  union  movement, and to restore the  citizenship

rights   deprived  from  the  anti-colonial   fighters.

Merger,  Sir, was not then an immediate issue. We  were

not  anti merger. Merger was not the issue which  broke

the back of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all had, and still do, subscribed to the view

of  independence through merger. But we are  not  slick

lawyers nor are we confidence tricksters. We accept the

words  "merger" and "independence" at their face value.

We  did  fail, Sir, to foresee that men driven  mad  by

power  and  desperation  could  even  attempt  to  tear

meanings out of words. Sir, we are wiser today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, merger was later on slipped in by the P.A.P.

leadership  to  cover  up  their  departure  from   the

socialist  aims of the P.A.P. and to hide the  betrayal

of  the trust the people of Singapore had bestowed upon

them  in  1959. The P.A.P. leaders sought to depict  by

this maneuver those who had demanded for internal self-government  by 1963 as being anti merger. To  us,  Sir,

the anti-colonial struggle is a complementary phase  in

the  struggle for national unity and reunification. The

separation of our countries, as the Minister for Labour

has  said,  is due to colonial machinations. We  cannot

thus   accept   the  perpetuation  of  colonialism   in

Singapore   as   conducive  to  the  reunification   of

Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are serious students of politics. When we know

the  root  cause  of our troubles, we  shall  seek  its

removal.  We  do  not go in for symptomatic  treatment.

There   is   no   conflict  in   our   call   for   the

intensification of the anti-colonial struggle  and  our

stand  on  merger. Our call for the intensification  of

the  anti-colonial struggle and the  abolition  of  the

Internal Security Council can in no way imply  that  we

are   anti   merger.  It  is  utterly   dishonest   and

mischievous to equate this call for greater freedom  as

indicating that we are afraid of merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture quoted the letter

written  by Mr Lim Ching Siong, the Secretary-General

of  the  Barisan Sosialis, which was published on  24th

June,  1961, in the Straits Times. This did not in  any

way  show that we are anti merger. But he used this  to

try  and  draw  inferences that the  meaning  contained

therein  amounted to our being anti merger. Sir,  I  do

not  have  a copy of the letter. I am quoting from  the

speech  made by the Minister for Culture which has  the

quotation of the relevant part of the letter he quoted.

Since  this has been admitted, I suppose it will be  in

order  for  me  to use this. This is the part  that  he

quoted:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Merger we have hitherto come to understand was a

thing of the distant future. However, recent statements

by  leaders  of  the  Federation hold  out  an  earlier

promise   of   the   union  of  the  two   territories.

Encouraging as it is, the question now arises, on  what

terms will this be effected?'



<br><br>Sir, I will repeat the last sentence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Encouraging as it is, the question now arises, on

what terms will this be effected?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the Government in the Federation and the

Left-wing   Government  in  Singapore   apply   certain

conflicting  policies.  This  is  recognised   in   the

statement  by  Dr  Toh,  the  P.A.P.  Chairman,   that

whatever  the constitutional position of the future  we

must  have control over labour and education.  This  is

exactly   our   concern.  We  have  stated   that   any

constitutional arrangement must not mean a setback  for

the people in terms of freedom and democracy.'



<br><br>This is the quotation, Sir. How can any sane person say

that this quotation shows that the Barisan -Sosialis is

not  sincere  in  wanting merger for Singapore  as  the

twelfth  State? Let me repeat, Sir: all  that  Mr  Lim

Chin  Siong  said  was,  "Encouraging  as  it  is,  the

question  now  arises,  on what  terms  will  this  be

effected"   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  the   salient   facts

therefore, are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We supported the idea of merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We were ignorant of the details of proposed

merger, like all the people of Singapore, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We stated the principles on which any

constitutional arrangement should be based.

<br><br>Thus,  Sir, on 28th August in our policy statement  and

again in our Declaration of the Meeting of Convenors of

the Barisan Sosialis - both of which I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



read   out - the  very  same  declaration  which   the

Minister  for  Culture has so ably  read  out  to  this

House, we have maintained the same consistent stand. We

confine  ourselves  to  an analysis  of  the  political

situation to a statement of principles and to  pointing

out  in  bold  relief the directions  heading  for  our

constitutional advance. We call, as our first priority,

for  the  complete merger of Singapore as  the  twelfth

State  despite  the fact that the details  of  the  so-called  negotiations were not made available to us  and

in  the face of the Tunku's apparent somersault from an

attitude of

riot  wanting merger to his publicly stated desire  for

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture wanted to know when it

was  that we decided to call the P.A.P. deal a sell-out

and  a phoney merger. Let me state again, Sir: we  were

not  against  merger at that time; we are  not  against

merger today, and we have never been against merger.  I

challenge the P.A.P. Government to quote from  tiny  of

our statements that we are against merger. Sir, to call

the  P.A.P. deal a sellout and a phoney merger does not

in  any  way show or imply that we are against  merger.

The P.A.P. deal is not merger, and we have said so.  It

is  not only a perversion of the meaning of merger, but

it can also be better described as tipu orang merger - in

the words, I believe, of the Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when did we call the P.A.P. deal a sell-out? When

did  we  describe the P. A. P, citizenship  arrangement

agreed  to by the P.A.P. Government as making Singapore

citizens second-class citizens in the new Federation of

Malaya?  Sir, we called the P.A.P. deal a  sell-out  as

soon as sufficient details were revealed in this act of

striptease politics. Now, Sir, we have exposed the deal

naked  for all to see. Who would not be aggrieved  when

he realises that the P.A.P. is parading a prostitute as

a virgin?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been described as the "angry young men."

We  are  proud  to  be  the angry  young  men  of  this

generation.  We  are  young in age.  Sir,  but  not  in

experience. We are glad that we are not old and  senile

as the P.A.P. leadership.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



We  are angry Sir, and justly so. What man in his right

senses  would not be angry today at the way things  are

done  and  especially,  Sir, at the  treachery  of  the

P.A.P. Government?

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  debating the issue arising  from  the  motion

introduced  by  the  Minister for Labour  to  which  an

amendment  has been moved by the Member for Queenstown,

a  full  sense of consciousness and realisation  should

influence our minds and thinking in order that  we  may

not  deviate  from our avowed objective and  contradict

our  national  interests with catastrophic consequences

which the people of the State do not want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crystal clear to every nationalist fighter that

the issue we are debating is a national issue which has

become   the  avowed  objective  of  all  true  Malayan

nationalists  who have come to regard Malaya  as  their

sole   homeland  and  the  object  of  their  undivided

loyalty.  We  will continue to have  hopes  in  and  we

appeal  to  all  Malay  nationalists  to  observe  this

principle  with  a  view  to  the  establishment  of  a

peaceful, prosperous, happy and united Malayan nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, since this a national

issue, it is imperative that we sink party and personal

squabbles  so  that we may be able to  resolve  in  its

proper perspective all the problems confronting us  for

the well-being of the State and its entire people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, I am left with no alternative

smearing  and  challenging  everyone,  and  saying   to

himself,  "Now,  look  at  me.  My  disciples  are   as

countless  as  the  ants. So be  careful  of  my  magic

weapon."  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  it  is  only   proper,

therefore,  that  the people whom he  has  derided  and

challenged  should take up that challenge and  say  "An

eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the motion in the name of the Minister for Labour cannot but be regarded as a sincere call to all genuine Malayan nationalists, faced with

this  national issue, to renew their determination  and

faith in the struggle. Our struggle is a continuance of

the  struggle of the Malayan nationalists who  preceded

us. This motion, Mr Deputy Speaker, is a challenge  to

the  self-proclaimed true Malayan nationalists.  It  is

also  a  challenge to those who still  waver  in  their

stand.  To those who are at the cross roads,  the  time

has  come for them to declare on which side of the road

they   stand.  In  these  circumstances,  Mr   Deputy

Speaker, Sir, every true Malayan nationalist, be he  in

this  Chamber or outside, is duty bound to respond  and

affirm   in   all  consciousness  as  a  true   Malayan

nationalist that the issue before us must be settled in

the spirit in which it is intended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in the beginning I was indeed proud to hear the introductory remarks of the Member for Queenstown, who is also the Chairman of the Barisan

Sosialis  and who has, out of the blue, come  into  the

limelight  by his record-breaking feat in the Assembly,

having wasted 27,000 seconds of the Assembly's time. He

prefaced  his speech by declaring his and  his  Party's

stand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



of  not  being anti-merger. In fact, he and  his  Party

support  to  the  hilt  the unification  of  these  two

territories.  We  appreciate that, Mr Deputy  Speaker.

But he has put forward his amendment to the motion. And

it is this "but" that is confusing all of us. For on my

part, Mr Deputy Speaker, allow me to congratulate  the

brains behind the amendment, whether they are inside or

outside  this Assembly, for their skill and  ingenuity

in phrasing the amendment. So craftily is the amendment

worded  that it is made to appear like a neatly wrapped

parcel  which  has almost succeeded in hoodwinking  the

people.  But, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the neatly wrapped

parcel  are concealed traces of venomous poison  which

is  very  dangerous  to the people.  Only  those  whose

vision  is  blurred can be deceived,  and  those  dull-witted  can  be  misled  and  confused.  Where  we  are

concerned,  we are able to distinguish the sex  of  the

fishes in the water by their very movement, let  alone

the  venomous poison which is easily discernible by its

colour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, there is no necessity to take us to the history of far-away Northern Ireland, as was related by the Member for Queenstown in this Assembly

when  he commenced his speech. But, Mr Deputy Speaker,

let  us  for a moment turn to the past and review  and

assess  our position in order to enable us to plot  the

way  ahead  and  find out the ways of life  which  are

suitable for our people and our State in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to know ourselves than to know others. To

a   true   Malayan   nationalist  fighter,   the   term

"Federation    of   Malaya"   automatically    includes

Singapore. The two territories are inseparable, be  it

from the historical, geographical or any other point of

view. Hence, Mr Deputy Speaker, the separation imposed

upon  the  Federation of Malaya and  Singapore  is,  in

fact,  tantamount to the commission of a criminal  act,

as  stated  earlier  by  my  colleague,  the  Hon. the

Minister  for  Labour, when he introduced this  motion.

The  separation of these two territories  afflicts  the

hearts and minds of all true-hearted Malayan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



nationalist freedom fighters. Although this does not in

any  way  dampen  our spirits or mar our determination,

this  man-made  division in fact, further  kindles  the

fire  of nationalism and intensify our faith to reunite

the  two  territories  by confronting  and  eliminating

colonialism, in any form, whether from the West or  the

East.  And more especially against the colonial stooges

whose desire it is for the State to worship the West or

East,  and  specifically Moscow. All these factors  are

obstacles  to hinder and prevent the development  of  a

true  Malayan  nationalist ideal from  becoming  deeply

rooted  and  embedded in the hearts and  minds  of  the

people who love this fair land of ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we should not forget that ever since the British colonialists set their foot on our soil on a mission of colonial exploitation, they

immediately partitioned and tore asunder our tiny State

into  twelve  midget States and formed three  different

colonial  administrations, namely, three countries,  to

form  the  Straits Settlements, the four  Malay  States

forming  what was known as the Federated Malay  States,

and  five  other  States to form the Unfederated  Malay

States,  or British Protected States. This is  not  the

history of Northern Ireland, Mr Deputy Speaker.  That,

in  brief, was how the British colonialists implemented

their  divide  and rule policy on our small  fatherland

before the outbreak of the Second World War.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, let us now review briefly the local political situation after the Second World War. During the transitional period of handing over admini

stration  from  the  Japanese Fascists  to  the  Allied

Powers,  the  British colonial government despatched  a

mission to obtain the signatures of the Malay rulers by

which  sovereignty would be transferred to the British,

and  thereby created the Malayan Union. If  I  were  to

make a review of this, Mr Deputy Speaker, it does  not

mean  that I am bringing up communalism, but merely  to

explain  the history of our fatherland for the  benefit

of our future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was widespread and strong opposition. Feelings

were  running  high among the Malay masses.  Eventually

the  Malayan Union was sent to the grave in  1948.  The

opposition movement to the Malayan Union resulted  in

the  birth of a Malay political movement known  as  U.M.N.O. under the leadership of Dato Onn Bin Ja'afar  in

1946 which adopted the slogan, "Hidup Melayu", or "Long

live  the  Malays".  This is, however,  important.  The

progressive  Malay  nationalist forces  formed  another

political Party called the Malay Nationalist  Party  of

Malaya, which subsequently formed a Youth Section and a

Women's Section. The slogan adopted was "Merdeka".  The

controversy  between these two groups, i.e. the  Party

with  the  slogan "Long live the Malays" and the  Party

with the slogan "Merdeka", intensified and became worse

when  the  Federation of Malaya Agreement  was  to  be

implemented. The progressive Malay nationalist  forces,

with   the   Malayan  Nationalist  Party   of   Malaya

initiating the move, organised and united all  factions

of  Malay  nationalists into one federation called  the

People's   United  Front,  or  PUTRA  abbreviated,   as

mentioned by the Member for Queenstown, in his  speech.

At  the  same  time,  PUTRA called upon  the  non-Malay

nationalists  to  form  a  separate  federation.   This

federation  gave birth to the All-Malayan Council  for

Joint  Action  or abbreviated A.M.C.J.A.  Subsequently,

these  progressive  federations were  amalgamated  into

PUTRA-A.M.C.J.A.  This federation  later  drafted  the

People's   Constitution  as  a  countermand   to   the

Federation  of  Malaya  Agreement,  which   came   into

operation in February 1948.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, whilst on the subject of this Putra-A.M.C.J.A., I must confess that I was greatly impressed by the remarks of the Member for Queenstown

when  he mentioned this Federation. He also quoted  the

People's  Constitution. He said that those  people  who

have now been branded as pro-Communists did participate

actively  in the Putra-A.M.C.J.A. which was  considered

to be a true Malayan nationalist movement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, may I ask the Member for Queenstown when he and his friends came to know of Putra A.M.C.J.A. and whether he has ever taken the

trouble  to  make  a  thorough study  of  the  People's

Constitution  which he mentioned? Are all  the  people

who   support  the  People's  Constitution  and  Putra-A.M.C.J.A. non-Communist Malayan nationalists? or  are

they  pro-Communists or genuine Communists  cloaked  or

dressed like wolves in sheep's clothing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, much of the time of the Assembly would be taken up if I were to describe in detail the attempts made by the Malayan Communist Party to ride on

the  backs of Malayan nationalists in order to  achieve

their own political ideology. This may possibly result

in  my having to break the record-breaking feat of  the

Member  for  Queenstown. However, I will  rest  content

with the Member for Queenstown holding the record. For

my  part,  I  shall  briefly  attempt  to  relate  the

objective for which all true Malayan nationalists  have

fought. At the same time, I shall expose the real  aims

and  activities of the pro-Communists and the Communist

cadres   who   have   infiltrated  into   the   Malayan

nationalist  political movements. Before  doing  so,  I

wish  to  ask  the  Member for  Queenstown  again  this

question. There is no need for me to challenge  anybody

else. Are all the progressive Malayan nationalists  who

support  Putra-A.M.C.J.A. true Malayan nationalists?  I

believe that at that time the Member for Queenstown was

busying himself with medical practice.

Secondly, the Member for Queenstown has referred to the

People's  Constitution. But has he studied it carefully

and  are his followers and he really prepared to  make

the  People's  Constitution the basis  of  his  Party's

manifesto,  with  all  its implications,  which,  among

other  things,  states that Singapore is  part  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya? This is important.  It  is  not

communalism. But it is enshrined

in   the  People's  Constitution  that  Malaya  is  the

sovereign right of the Malays, that Malayan citizenship

is "Melayu", with undivided devotion and loyalty -

as  Chairman is to refer Members to Standing Order  54.

As  Chairman  I consider that what the hon.  Member  is

saying  is quite relevant to the amendment, because  it

is  a  little  subject  on  the  past  history  of  the

Federation,  and  is quite within the amendment.  Inche

Yaacob.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, what I

have  related so far is closely associated.  We  cannot

create something new without first reviewing the  past.

Nationalists  have pioneered the way  for  our  present

nationalists to fight. So we should go back to the past

so  that  we may not be led astray. Mr Deputy Speaker,

the  articles  contained in the  People's  Constitution

were  mentioned  by  the Member for Queenstown  in  his

speech. Mr Deputy Speaker, if we have not studied  the

People's Constitution thoroughly, do not crow  when  we

do not know head or tail of what we are crowing about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to clarify about the sincerity of the Communists and the pro-Communists who were at work with Malayan nationalist forces in the

struggle   for  Malayan  independence,  including   the

independence of Singapore, when they fought against the

British. Of course, in the struggle against the  common

enemy,   that  is  British  colonialism,  they   fought

shoulder  to shoulder with Malayan nationalist  forces.

But,  Mr  Deputy Speaker, how far did their  sincerity

go?  When  the People's Constitution was  drawn  up  by

Malayan  nationalists,  the  Malayan  Communist   Party

really gave their sympathetic support. But they refused

to  be  signatories; they refused to  be  tied  to  the

ideals  of the Malayan nationalist struggle. Therefore,

when  the Emergency was declared in Malaya, the Malayan

Communist  Party  withdrew  their  sympathy   for   the

People's Constitution because they failed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



to  persuade the Malayan nationalist fighters to take

up  arms  against British colonialism, although  they

did  manage to drag a handful of Malayan nationalists

to join them in the armed insurrection in Malaya. Mr

Deputy  Speaker, it will be clearly seen,  therefore,

that the object of the Communists was to make use  of

the Malayan nationalist movement as a vehicle for the

achievement of their sinister aims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, on this matter, this reminds me of the political terminology used by the Communists, i.e., social chauvinism, a political definition which

means  that  the principle is to support  nationalist

movements, especially in times of war. The  Left-wing

socialists  or Communists must support  any  form  of

national administration in a given State. But, at the

same  time,  they  should exploit  the  situation  by

creating  economic  and  political  crises   and   to

organise the people so that they would be in the mood

for  social  revolution  in  order  to  establish   a

Communist State. In a similar way, they hope  to  use

the  nationalist  movement  as  a  steppingstone.  Of

course,  they  themselves pose as  nationalists.  We

have  studied these Communist tactics.  We  know  the

political  A B C taught by the Communists in  Malaya.

Mr  Deputy Speaker, that is the Communist method  of

struggle.  They hide behind the facade of nationalist

movements and behave like wolves in sheep's clothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now revert to the amendment moved by the

Member for Queenstown. He claims to have graduated as

a  Left-wing  socialist only after  reading  tit-bits

from  Marxist  and Leninist pamphlets. There  are  at

least  four  underlying motives behind his amendment,

namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To influence the people to reject and wreck

merger, because he knows



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



that  if  we demand complete merger based on  Malayan

history   and  within  the  context  of  the  Malayan

situation, the Federation Government will reject  the

demand.  So their aim is to avert merger. But  it  is

regrettable  to see that they prefer  to  live  under

British colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Failing to subvert merger completely, they

will  attempt to delay as long as they possibly  can

the  trend  of  merger  until  such  time  as  their

stooges in the person of D. R. Seenivasagam  or  Lim Kean  Siew and others have formed the Government  in

the  Federation. I think by that time there will  be

no happenings such as I have stated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Should they succeed in their two plans

referred  to above, they can brag to the people  and

claim  that  they  are the real  saviours  who  have

fought  to  safeguard the fundamental  interests  of

the people of Singapore. In this way, they dream  of

being  elected by the people in order  to  form  the

government.  We  know they have  already  designated

the would-be Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) With the formation of the Government, the next

logical  thing follows, that is, Singapore will  be

turned   into  a  base  for  the  dissemination   of

Communism  in  South-East Asia which, in  course  of

time,  will  be  able to control the  whole  of  the

Federation of Malaya.
