<br><br><!-- Tun Yusof Ishak bin Ishak (His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Tun Yusof bin Ishak)</b> <i>(In Malay)</i>: Hon. Members of  the

Legislative Assembly of Singapore -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>NEW CHAPTER IN OUR HISTORY</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore scene is now part of the Malaysian

landscape



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 16th of September this year, about ten

weeks ago, we entered a new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



chapter in the history of our people. On that  day

we achieved our independence in Malaysia. It was a

momentous  and irreversible event in our  history.

But  partly  because  so many  other  things  were

happening  at the same time, the full significance

of the changes that have taken place was not fully

apparent. It is just as well if we were to pause a

while  and  recount the changes  that  have  taken

place and the new power structure within Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore was in the midst of her general

elections at the time. A few weeks just before the

31st of August, it seemed as though Malaysia might

be   postponed  indefinitely.  Indeed  there   was

uncertainty  right up to the 29th of  August  when

the  new  date,  16th  September,  was  announced,

subject, it would appear, to a favourable  finding

by the U.N. Secretary-General's Assessment Report.

It  was  only  on the 14th of September  that  the

favourable assessment was reported and  the  date,

16th September, became an absolute certainty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reunification and independence, also came

"confrontation".  Our  first  lesson  in  national

unity had to be learnt quickly. For the new nation

to  survive external pressures and threats, it was

imperative  that  loyalty to the new  nation  must

transcend  all  other  interests.  The  people  of

Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore can be proud that the

past  ten  weeks  have seen  a  growing  sense  of

national  purpose uniting us all in  Malaysia  and

this  in  spite  of  the immediate  discomfort  of

military  and economic pressure inflicted  on  the

borders of Sarawak and on Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>The Short Term</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short term the elaborate constitutional

framework  of  checks  and  safeguards  of   local

autonomy  for Singapore can prevent  any  drop  in

standards   of  economic  prosperity,  of   public

services,   of   social   amenities,   educational

facilities and public housing, whatever happens in

the rest of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the long run we must all realise that

prosperity  or  poverty  is  indivisible   between

member  states  of  a  nation,  just  as   it   is

indivisible between people in a member state.  Our

destiny



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



is  irrevocably intertwined with that of the  rest

of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powers over defence, security and foreign affairs

are  all  vested  in  our  Central  Government  of

Malaysia.  On 1st September, 1962, we in Singapore

decided  to place our future together with Malaya.

The  centre of gravity of political power  is  the

Central  Government  of  Malaysia.  It  is  policy

settled  by a Government which commands a majority

of  the Members of Parliament in Kuala Lumpur that

will  decide our fate and the fate of the rest  of

Malaysia. For instance, whether "confrontation" at

present  confined to a trade boycott of  Singapore

and   Penang,  and  military  pressure  along  the

borders  of  Sarawak is contained  and  held,  and

slowly  resolved, depends upon the policy  settled

by  the Central Government, not that of any member

State Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>The Long Term</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An even more important reason why in the long run

it  is the Government of Malaysia that will settle

the  shape  of  things to come,  is  that  overall

financial  and  fiscal powers are  vested  in  the

Central  Government. And it is the  financial  and

fiscal  policies  of  a  nation  that  decide  the

structure of its society. Whether we are  to  move

towards  a  more  just and equal  society  depends

primarily  upon how to use the powers of  taxation

and expenditure to bring about a redistribution of

opportunity  and ultimately of wealth amongst  our

people.  Even  before merger the capacity  of  the

Singapore Government to bring about this change by

financial and fiscal policy was conscribed by  the

actual   economic   limitations   of   Singapore's

economy, one so intimately linked with that of the

Federation  that  any  violent  disparity  in  the

policies of the two Governments would have brought

unpleasant  consequences  for  both,  though  more

unpleasant  for Singapore than for the Federation.

For  instance, had the differentials in income tax

rates  between  Singapore and the Federation  been

very  much greater than the five per cent  at  the

top  bracket between 55 per cent in Singapore  and

50  per  cent in Malaya, there would have been  an

inevitable movement of wealth and wealthy men from

Singapore to the Federation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Central Government controls the financial

and fiscal policies over the whole of Malaysia, as

indeed it must be if Malaysia is to make sense  as

a  nation.  Indeed  it  is  open  to  the  Central

Government,  if it were ill-advised enough  so  to

do,  to  reverse some of the more progressive  and

forward-looking policies which have  already  been

embodied into our income tax and revenue laws. For

instance, we have a higher differential for income

tax  of 55 per cent on incomes above $100,000  per

annum,   instead  of  50  per  cent  as   in   the

Federation,  and we have separate  assessment  for

earned  incomes of married women; and  income  tax

concession for owner-occupied houses is limited to

a  maximum annual value of $3,000 instead of being

without  limit as in Malaya, and so on.  In  other

words, it means that in the long run the order  of

our  society  will be determined  by  the  Central

Government. So any political movement  that  seeks

to  bring  changes in our society must necessarily

have pan-Malaysian support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Against the Broader Canvas</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a nation success or failure is all-embracing.

Singapore's  problems   of   economic

progress  and social revolution must therefore  be

seen  against  the broader canvas of Malaysia.  No

political  movement  can be  effective  if  it  is

localised  and  isolated either  to  Singapore  or

Kuala  Lumpur or Ipoh or to any of the other towns

in  Malaysia.  If Singapore is to  make  its  full

contribution  to  the  development   of   a   more

prosperous Malaysia in which wealth and prosperity

are  more evenly shared amongst the people whether

in  the urban or in the rural areas, regardless of

race, religion or culture, then she must play  her

full part in the Malaysian political milieu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>The Next Five Years</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the immediate present, we can take

satisfaction   in   the   fact   that   the    new

constitutional   framework  has  already   ensured

stability and certainty for the next five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the industrial front with the fall in

influence  of the Communist united front  movement

in  the  trade  unions, there has  been  increased

demand  for factory sites in Jurong, and  for  the

smaller



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



industrial  estates  of  Tanglin  Halt,   Redhill,

Bendemeer and Kampong Ampat. In fact, all the  138

sites  in  the  four  smaller  industrial  estates

covering 72 acres have been taken up. In Jurong 47

sites  covering  an area of 380  acres  have  been

allocated whilst applications for another 35 sites

covering  a  total  of  329 acres  are  now  being

negotiated. The confidence and optimism, reflected

in  the  prices  of immovable properties  and  the

investment applications for industrial  sites  for

factory buildings and machinery, are well founded,

based  as they are on the political stability  and

security    of    Malaysia   and   the    economic

possibilities  of a common market  of  10  million

people  in  a region with the highest standard  of

living in South Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed but for Indonesia's "confrontation" it

would  he  fair  to  say that  within  four  years

Singapore's  first phase of the Jurong  industrial

site  would have got off to a splendid start.  But

even   in  spite  of  indefinite  continuance   of

confrontation,  there  is every  prospect  of  our

making  up the eight per cent loss on our national

income caused by confrontation within two years by

alternative fields of economic expansion.



<br><br><i>The  Changed  Position of the Singapore Government and the Singapore Assembly</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have noticed on page 38 of the

Estimates for next year's expenditure that a whole

series  of  items relating to Federal  expenditure

has  gone  over  into the Federal budget.  Certain

major spheres of government activity have now gone

over to the Central Government. In political terms

it   means   that  there  will  be  more  coherent

development  of all those services  which  are  in

their   very  nature  Pan-Malaysian,  like   civil

aviation,   meteorological  services,   transport,

telecommunications,  posts,   judicial   services,

audit,  immigration and passports, defence, police

and  prisons.  This change in the power  structure

may  temporarily  give a sense  of  void  in  this

Assembly.  Some of the stirring issues which  have

agitated  Singapore over the last  eighteen  years

will  no longer excite this Chamber or the island.

Independence  is  an accomplished  fact.  However,

subversive activity by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



anti-national     Communist    elements     within

independent Malaysia is a continuing problem  that

will  have  to be met and faced. But the ceaseless

attack  against  the police and  other  organs  of

Government    which   checkmate   the    Communist

conspiracy  will now be carried over to Parliament

House in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one danger that we must

constantly bear in mind. Although Members  do  not

have  the  constitutional  obligation  to  concern

ourselves  in  this Chamber with Communist  united

front  activity  and the threat it  poses  to  the

national   security  of  Malaysia,   the   process

nevertheless  goes relentlessly on.  It  would  be

fatal  if  we  believed that with the  powers  now

vested in Kuala Lumpur we in Singapore can opt out

from this struggle. It is tempting to believe that

the  strength  of the rural base  of  the  Central

Government  can  enable all these problems  to  be

resolved   by  straightforward  security  actions,

either by disruption of the Communist united front

organisations  or  by  neutralisation   of   their

principal  activists. But the  long-term  solution

does   not   lie  merely  in  negating  the   open

manifestations   of   Communist    strength    and

organisation. The only conclusive solution  is  to

win  the constant battle for hearts and minds -  a

battle   that  can  only  he  won  by  intelligent

political, economic and social policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close our eyes to the real problem, the

economic and social injustices of our society, and

the challenge which Communist doctrines exploiting

these  injustices can mount, is to run the  danger

of losing the battle by default. The problems that

have  beset  us  for  the last  decade  and  given

Singapore  its  reputation as a  highly  volatile,

riotous city, they all remain. Independence,  with

merger and Malaysia, have removed a number of  the

basic  causes of discontent. But the other  latent

social  causes  of discontent and  dissatisfaction

remain.  They  must be resolved.  Poverty  in  the

midst  of  plenty, unemployment  in  the  face  of

affluence,  the rising expectations  of  a  better

life which universal education has aroused amongst

our  younger  people,  these  are  problems  which

require  our  constant effort before  things  will

improve  permanently. To close our eyes  to  these

basic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



problems  and  to leave the Central Government  to

deal  with  the open manifestations of  discontent

which Communist activists exploit would be to lose

the long-term battle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If democratic values of a tolerant society are to

survive  in  Malaysia, then we in  Singapore  must

continue to play our part to counter the Communist

challenge by meeting them in the open argument and

even  more  so by enlightened social and  economic

policies.  For  it  is these policies  which  will

establish   in  every  one's  mind   the   growing

conviction that a more just and equal society  can

be  achieved by a democratic State, provided  that

the  people have an understanding of the practical

alternatives open to them.



<br><br><i>THE NEXT STAGE OF THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION IN                      SINGAPORE</i>



<br><br><i>Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the power of fixing the level of taxation

has  shifted  to Kuala Lumpur, the tax  collection

remains  with Singapore. So also the bulk  of  the

power   of  expenditure  remains  with  Singapore.

Members   will  have  noticed  that  next   year's

estimates  of expenditure, despite the absence  of

all  Federal items from it, still show  a  sum  of

nearly $350 million or about three-quarters of the

total revenue to be raised in Singapore. How  this

revenue is spent, is within the competence of this

Assembly   and   the   Government.   Within    the

limitations of this revenue we can bring about the

next stage of the social revolution in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can decide for ourselves the details of how

this money is to be spent and how the benefits  of

this  expenditure  are to be spread  more  equally

amongst  our  people. Two big items overwhelm  all

others. Education amounts to about a third of  the

budget, and health amounts to nearly a fourth.  It

is as it should be, in that order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No single factor is more likely to bring about a

more    fair   and   just   society   than   equal

opportunities for education for all. The ideal  to

which  all  nations  in the world  aspire  is  the

utilisation  of  all its human  resources  to  its

maximum.  Free  education  from  kindergarten   to

university is the ideal that will help bring this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



about.  We  have achieved free universal education

for   six   years   in  primary  schools.   Before

"confrontation" began, it had looked  possible  to

introduce  free  secondary  education  within  two

years.  In  fact, it was the hope of my Government

to  introduce free secondary education  for  1964.

But  with  the loss of 8 per cent of our  national

income  as a result of the stoppage of trade  with

Indonesia, we will have to postpone it to a  later

date, probably 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the meantime, the number of bursaries and

scholarships  for  secondary  education  will   be

increased  four-fold to assist bright children  of

poor   families   to  finish  secondary   schools.

Scholarships  and  bursaries for higher  education

abroad,   and  in  the  University  of  Singapore,

Nanyang  University, the Polytechnic and Ngee  Ann

College will also be increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's policy to give equal

treatment  for the four language streams.  Parents

will  continue  to  have  a  free  choice  of  the

language in which they wish their children  to  be

educated. It is the intention of the Government to

improve  the standard of teaching of a second  and

even third language in all schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teaching of Malay in all schools will be

intensified. The quality of teaching of Chinese in

English medium schools, as well as the quality  of

teaching  of English in Chinese and Malay  schools

will be raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integration of schools using different

language  media of instruction introduced  by  the

Government in the last few years will be continued

and, indeed, brought one stage further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward planning for teacher training and school

buildings  is  ahead or keeping pace  with  actual

needs.  Twenty-six new schools, 10 primary and  16

secondary, are being built and 18 will  be  opened

during  1964. Extensions to the Teachers' Training

College are also being made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence of adequate provision to meet the

educational and recreational requirements  of  the

rural  population has been exploited by  the  pro-Communist  organisations  to  spread  their  anti-national propaganda under cover of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



"educational  activities".  The  Government   will

therefore  expand  the  programme  of  the   Adult

Education movement to meet these requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems which beset Chinese education

is   the   use  the  Communists  make  of  Chinese

educational   issues  as   a   cover   for   their

penetration  of schools amongst some students  and

even  teachers.  They have in the  past  caused  a

great  deal  of  agitation and unrest  in  Chinese

schools,  including  the  examination  boycott  in

November 1961. From the middle schools a hard-core

group   of   Communist   student   elements   have

penetrated Nanyang University. As in the  case  of

Chinese   Middle   schools  in  1955   and   1956,

discipline  is  not now under the control  of  the

University   teaching  staff.  Student  committees

working    in    conjunction    with    graduates,

administration staff in the University  and  Board

of  Students  Welfare are in de  facto  charge  of

discipline,  a  position from which this  militant

Communist  minority eliminate all  student  groups

who do not accept their leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential that there should be confidence

and  good faith between the Central Government and

the  State  Government  in  the  handling  of  the

security  problem in all educational institutions,

including  the incipient problem in the University

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is when the Central Government does not doubt

that the Singapore Government has no intention  of

hindering  the Central Government from discharging

its  paramount duty of ensuring that no  Communist

activity  is  subverting the nation in educational

institutions that we can exercise our autonomy  in

education to the best advantage.



<br><br><i>Health</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to education, the largest expenditure is on

health.  Nowhere in South Asia are there  clinical

and  hospital care for the sick of such dimensions

and   standards.  Thirty-two  Government   clinics

handling between over 3.5 million attendances  for

this year and eleven existing Government hospitals

with  6,800  beds for a population of 1.8  million

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



put a great strain on the medical services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortage in doctors is being slowly overcome,

but the extension of Government clinics and health

facilities  has  been at a higher  rate  than  the

recruitment   of   new   doctors.   Administrative

efficiency  and  tightening  of  "referrals"  from

these  clinics to the hospitals are  essential  if

the strain on the medical staff is to be checked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is still necessary to have one other

general  hospital. The Thomson Road Hospital  will

become the second general hospital next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School dental clinics now a part of new school

buildings provide an ever increasing and  valuable

service  to  school  children under  the  care  of

dental nurses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans are being finalised to provide family

planning   information  and  facilities   at   all

maternity and child welfare clinics in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Public Health side, the Ministry is

planning  a  reorganisation of the City  Cleansing

services.   A   gradual   rundown   of   transport

equipment,  expansion of urban and  housing  areas

and  the corresponding huge increase in the number

of  hawkers,  inadequate  methods  of  supervision

resulting in lack of discipline in the work force,

complicated  by secret society elements  in  their

midst,  have brought about an increase in rubbish,

flies and mosquitoes. All this can and will be put

right.  Reorganisation  can  succeed  once   these

factors have been dealt with.



<br><br><i>Housing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third largest item of expenditure from public

funds  will be on housing. By the end of 1964  the

Housing  and Development Board will have  achieved

the  target of 52,000 units within four  years  of

its  commencing operations. Public housing at  the

rate  of 12,000 units per annum or 45 minutes  per

unit will continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year will see the beginning of the re-building of the old city of Singapore. A team of

United  Nations  experts have given  their  report

which  is  now under close study and consideration

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



implementation.  An Urban Redevelopment  Authority

will  be set up to control and co-ordinate  public

and private development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the demolition of Outram Prison is

proceeding to provide the first decanting area  as

urban renewal commences in the eastern and western

sectors of the central city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One difficulty is that World Bank loans are not

available  for  expenditure on housing  and  urban

renewal,  and so all loans will have to be  raised

internally  within  Singapore or  externally  from

commercial sources and in part financed  from  our

accumulated surplus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the shortage of land, there are land

reclamation schemes. At Bedok, about 40 odd  acres

have  already been reclaimed. The reclamation belt

will  eventually stretch a half mile into the  sea

from Bedok along the coast to Nicoll Highway. This

together  with  some  200  acres  of  land  to  be

reclaimed  in  Kallang Basin will  provide  enough

land  for both public and private building  within

the  next  five  years. The  Toa  Payoh  new  town

project  where 200,000 people will  be  housed  in

some 40,000 units will be well advanced by the end

of  the  five  years. As the  land  value  in  the

central part of the city is very much higher  than

that in Queenstown or Aljunied, it is not possible

to  let  out  flats  at that  rate.  For  example,

Selegie  House, where the land value  is  $10  per

square foot as against 50 cents per square foot at

Queenstown, flats have to be let out at  the  rate

of  $30  for  a one-room unit, $60 for a  two-room

unit,  and  $90 for a three-room unit.  A  similar

problem will arise with reference to houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming year, the Housing and Development

Board  will be working out plans for the  sale  of

low-cost  housing flats on instalment plan.  After

an  initial  down payment, rents would  cover  the

purchase  of  the  flats over a  period  of  10-15

years. All in all, it is expected that some  $300-400  million will go into public housing over  the

next five years.



<br><br><i>Public Utilities</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the massive housing programme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



and   progress  in  industrialisation,  electrical

consumption  increased throughout 1963.  The  main

source of the supplies which will be required with

future  expansion  will be the Pasir  Panjang  `B'

Power  Station.  Construction  progress  has  been

satisfactory.  The  new  Power  Station  will   be

delivering   energy  into  the  new  66,000   volt

distribution system by early 1965. The new Station

will  have  a capacity of 120 megawatts  and  with

further plans for extension is double the capacity

of this new Power Station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past year the Public Utilities Board

laid  18  miles of gas supply mains to connect  up

12,400  consumers  bringing the  total  to  42,500

consumers. In addition, new trunk mains have  been

laid at the cost of $1.58 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress has been made in implementing the Scudai

River  Scheme  during the year. This  scheme  will

provide  an  initial output from 15 to 30  million

gallons a day by June 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile an appraisal team from the World Bank

has   been  out  here  to  carry  out  on-the-spot

investigations  on  the Johore River  project  and

report to the Bank. A firm of consultants has been

appointed.    Soil   investigation   is    nearing

completion and planning and design work is in  the

hands  of the consultants. Tenders for the  supply

and  erection of the treatment plant are  expected

to  be called early next year while those for  the

supply  and/or  laying of the main  pipe  and  the

manufacture  of  the  pumping  plant  will  follow

shortly after that.



<br><br><i>Welfare</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social welfare benefits for unemployment and

sickness relief will continue. Homes for the aged,

boys'  hostels, approved schools, institution  for

girls,  welfare home for Muslim women and  creches

will  be  gradually expanded. Two creches  in  the

MacPherson  Road area, new and up to  date  junior

approved  school for boys, two new  boys'  hostels

are  being  planned, and some  are  already  under

construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The network of community centres will spread

throughout the whole island



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



so that no community in the city and no kampong in

the rural areas will be without a community centre

within   comfortable  travelling   distance.   The

organisation  of  the  People's  Association   has

expanded  somewhat too rapidly in  order  to  keep

pace  with the expansion of activities. There will

now be a period of re-organisation and re-training

to  improve  the  scope  of  activities  in  these

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also planned to expand the Work Brigade

which  acts  as  a useful means of  utilising  the

energy of youth between the time they leave school

and  when they obtain their first employment.  The

permanent  staff  of  the  Work  Brigade  will  be

increased  to  provide  a permanent  framework  of

trained men and women able to handle an increasing

intake  and turnover of young recruits,  who  will

spend  anywhere between six and 18 months  in  the

Brigade before getting employment. The Brigade  at

present  2,000-strong will be doubled  within  two

years and trebled within four years.



<br><br><i>Kampong and Rural Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next five years will see the extension of all

water  and electricity services to all the present

kampongs  in Singapore where there are  more  than

200  houses  in  a square mile. A new  policy  was

implemented over a year ago in which the  cost  of

installation is considered feasible if it  can  be

recovered by payment of services over a period  of

seven  or  eight years, instead of five  years  as

formerly.  It  means that we must be  prepared  to

provide  these amenities as a public  service  and

not necessarily as a profit-making proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main lanes in the vast network of rural

tracks   will   be   improved   for   agricultural

transportation  by  laterite  surfacing  and  open

drains. All the principal arterial tracks will  be

tarred.



<br><br><i>Labour</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's economic expansion and prosperity

depends  upon  an intelligent labour policy  which

will  ensure  the building up of  a  healthy  non-Communist trade union movement. One of the biggest

contributing factors to instability



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



in the past decade has been the absence of such  a

movement. Unintelligent labour policies  aimed  at

keeping  the  working population docile  had  only

opened  the  road  for  militant  action  led   or

inspired  by  Communists  exploiting  the  genuine

grievances of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last four years saw the beginning of a

coherent  policy of industrial peace with justice.

Both  employers and workers were educated  on  the

need for mutual accommodation for mutual survival.

Large  fields of industrial discontent and  unrest

had been wiped out by wage agreements, legislation

and  arbitration  in  the  Industrial  Arbitration

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of industrial peace with justice is

fundamental  if we are to succeed  in  our  plans.

Without industrial peace there will be no economic

expansion,  leaving  everybody  worse   off.   And

without justice and fair play to the workers whose

efforts  help  employers to make profit  on  their

capital,  there  can  he no  long-term  industrial

peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in the history of the labour

movement,  the  workers have  become  educated  on

their   rights   and,  equally  important,   their

responsibilities. Irresponsible strike action, and

worse,   strike  action  for  political  purposes,

workers  have found to their cost to  he  damaging

not  only  to  employers hut also  to  themselves.

Communist  influence has temporarily  receded.  On

the other hand, for the first time in Singapore, a

vigorous non-Communist leadership is emerging from

the  unions  as  militant and  as  active  as  the

Communists, but not using and exploiting the trade

union  movement  for direct political  objectives.

Employers have also come to realise the wisdom of

a  fair wage policy to ensure stability. The stage

is now set where with an intelligent policy on the

part  of  employers it is possible to ensure  that

the non-Communist trade union movement strengthens

as  the Communists are isolated and prevented from

re-establishing  influence and  control  over  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all this, the Industrial Arbitration Court has

played,  and  will Continue to play, an  important

role in holding the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



scales  between competing demands of  capital  out

for  maximum  profit and workers out  for  maximum

wages  and  fringe benefits. The next  five  years

will  be a period of consolidation. A Trade  Union

Bill  to improve the laws regulating trade  unions

will  be introduced. There will be no more omnibus

unions  of  the Shop and Factory Workers  type  in

which  a  few Communist activists could manipulate

thousands  of  workers  ranging  from  clerks  and

salesgirls to bus drivers and motor mechanics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two important factors in preventing trade unions

from   being  exploited  by  Communist  and  other

subversive   elements  are,  first,  a  widespread

literacy  among workers, and second, education  of

trade  union  leaders in trade union organisation,

administration,    collective    bargaining    and

democratic  leadership.  As  to  the  first,   the

Government will be arranging through the  National

Trade  Unions  Congress and  the  Adult  Education

Board  comprehensive workers' education programmes

in  the  four language streams. As to the  second,

the   Government  has  sought  and  obtained   the

assistance    of    the    International    Labour

Organisation  to expand the research and  training

facilities  for  trade unionists  offered  by  the

Labour Research Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most important is for both workers, trade

union leaders and employers to realise their joint

responsibility  with  the  Government  to   ensure

Singapore's  economic growth without  which  there

can  be  no  social progress. Whatever  the  trade

union practices and precedents in established  and

developed countries, a developing country requires

a  forward-looking approach both by employers  and

organised workers. Restrictive practices on either

side must not be allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government proposes to set up a Labour

Advisory  Council  consisting of  Labour  Ministry

officials, management representatives and  trade

union representatives to advise the Government  on

all   matters  relating  to  improved   industrial

relations, employees' welfare,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



and  industrial  training  related  to  industrial

economic matters.



<br><br><i>Marine and Port Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore for the fourth year in succession has

maintained its position as the fifth largest  port

in   the   world,  the  second  largest   in   the

Commonwealth and the busiest one in the Far East.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Harbour Board has plans to provide

another four deep-water berths at the East Lagoon,

including  ancillary buildings and  equipment  and

also  to  develop the Telok Ayer  Basin  with  the

provision  of  a finger pier for coastal  vessels.

Both  these  projects are estimated  to  cost  $50

million. With the introduction of a Common  Market

in Malaysia, it is envisaged that in future multi-storeyed warehouses at the West Wharf and the East

Lagoon  will  have to be constructed in  order  to

provide greater warehousing facilities. The  Board

has  already approved a $10 million housing scheme

for  its employees. Work has begun on this project

and  when  it is completed within the next  twelve

months,  the Board would have housed approximately

60 per cent of its 10,000 employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harbour at Jurong is well under way. The

whole  project is expected to be completed by  the

end  of 1964. The harbour will have a total length

of  wharves of 9,000 feet for ocean-going  vessels

and 3,000 feet for coastal vessels.



<br><br><i>Culture</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last four and a half years saw a stimulation

of  local  cultural troupes, folk dancing,  music,

painting  and  literary  works.  The  Ministry  of

Culture  has  now become a part of the established

framework  of  the  Government  to  encourage  the

creative and artistic expression of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also more efficiently disseminates news,

information and provides entertainment. This  year

has  seen the rapid growth of television. Starting

with  a  pilot  service in February,  it  has  now

established  a  two-channel programme.  Television

will  provide  a  wide range of entertainment  and

education. But more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



important,  with  judicious  programming,  it  can

nurture Malaysian consciousness and national unity

so  essential  for  the survival  and  success  of

Malaysia.



<br><br><i>Rate  of  economic  growth determines  success  or failure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must always remember that every

social service - education, health, housing, social

welfare,  community centres, television,  sickness

and unemployment relief, Work Brigade, and all our

plans  for more social benefits - all this  depends

on  increasing our national income. A  more  equal

distribution  of  the  benefits  of  our   society

without increasing the sum total to be shared will

not  make  us a developed society. Only  sustained

economic growth can make this possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not often understood in newly independent

countries that none of the good things in life are

free,  that  whilst some members of the  community

may  get  some  things free, the community  as  a

whole  must  pay for every single item  given  out

free or subsidised. It is all too easy in a system

of  one  man one vote to promise the sun, and  the

moon, and the stars, and election time becomes  an

auction  time  in which political Parties  try  to

outbid  one  another in giving away  the  national

inheritance free of charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has reason to be grateful to the

majority  of its population for being sufficiently

realistic and practical to understand the economic

implications of specious promises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success in building a prosperous, affluent

and  equal  society depends on economic growth  to

pay  for the services we want and their expansion.

It   means  we  must  succeed  in  our  plans  for

industrialisation.  Jurong must  succeed  together

with  all the minor industrial estates in Redhill,

Tanglin Halt, Bendemeer, Kampong Ampat, and  along

Bukit  Timah Road. We have the basis for  success:

confidence  locally and abroad  in  our  political

stability  and  security, a common market  of  ten

million  and  an able and industrious people.  All

that is required is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



continued    understanding   of   the   overriding

objectives by workers, employers, and the  public.

Industrial   expansion  requires  that   employer-employee  relations be stable. To  be  stable  the

terms  must  be fair. In case of disagreement  the

Government  must hold the balance to  ensure  that

investors  are  not broken by irresponsible  trade

unionism, nor workers exploited and not paid their

just due because of weak trade unions.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objectives of economic and social

policies were all mapped out four and a half years

ago when the present Government first took office.

The  problems are the same - to create  more  equal

opportunities  for  all  and  ensure  rewards   to

everyone   according  to  their  contribution   to

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have learnt from the experiences of the last

four years. The next few years will be a period of

consolidation   where   the   benefit   of   these

experiences   can   help   bring   about   tighter

organisation and more efficient administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the setback in the trading sector

because  of  Indonesia's  trade  boycott  we  have

sufficient reserves accumulated over the last four

years to see us through to industrial success  and

prosperity.   But   there   must   be   stability,

discipline and combined effort to ensure  a  rapid

industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention to bring forward

a  number  of  construction projects and  increase

expenditure  generally in  the  public  sector  on

construction  and  road  works  and  other  labour

intensive projects in order to increase employment

to  make  up  for  the drop caused  by  the  trade

boycott.  These  works, particularly  those  where

expenditure is proportionately more on labour than

materials, can to some extent make up for the loss

of  8.7 per cent of our national income and lessen

the  multiplyer  effects  of  this  drop  in  our

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the problem of inadequate schools and

teachers,  of  the shortage of homes,  houses  and

flats,  has  been broken. We can now  afford  more

than  just  the bare essentials permitted  in  our

original crash programme. Whereas in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



the  first  few years schools were all stereotyped

and with the minimum of facilities, now there is a

wider variety of design and of facilities - playing

fields, school halls, school canteens. So too with

housing.  Whereas four years ago the emphasis  was

on  one-room flats, now those on the waiting  list

are  for  two-  and three-room flats  and  getting

their  share.  Part  of the disbursements  of  the

Government  over  the next few years  will  be  to

beautify  the  city - more parks and gardens,  more

trees,  even public fountains, to add a little  to

the  gracefulness of life in this one of the great

cities of Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year in April when the car parking garage at

Cecil  Street/Market  Street  is  completed,   the

tarmac on Raffles Square will be broken up to make

way  for trees and flowers and fountains. The next

objective  in our social revolution  is  not  only

more  of  the basic necessities of life for  every

one  but  also  some  of  the  gracefulness  of  a

civilised   and  cultured  society  for   all   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last four and a half years have shown what

was  possible when a hardworking and  able  people

was given honest government and good planning. The

future promises well. Free universal education for

primary,  secondary and vocational schools  is  no

longer  a  dream. It is within fulfilment  in  the

next  five  years. The rebuilding of old Singapore

will  change  large parts of our sky line.  Jurong

will present a picture of the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  Modern  industry, efficient  and  well

laid out with cheap water and power, sea, road and

rail  transport as good as any in the  world,  and

workers  in modern flats, the first instalment  of

three  thousand of which will be built  in  Jurong

next year by the Housing and Development Board. At

the  end  of five years, when the first  phase  of

Jurong succeeds, as it can and must, then we  will

see  the first manifestations of an affluent Asian

city in which a pleasant life with amenities of  a

civilised society is not only for the wealthy  few

but for the working many.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geography and history have conspired to make this

island  an  oasis  of progress  and  plenty  in  a

turbulent  and chaotic region of Asia.  Our  human

resources,  the skill and industry of our  people,

the ingenuity and resourcefulness of our merchants

together with the integrity and drive of an honest

administration  can turn this  into  a  metropolis

that Malaysia can be proud of.
