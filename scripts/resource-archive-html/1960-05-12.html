<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on clause 5.



An amendment has been proposed*:



<hr size="2" noshade>

* An amendment proposed by the Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee) on 11th May, 1960.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, line 27, to leave out "The

Comptroller"  and  insert "Where  the  Comptroller

considers  it  necessary in the execution  of  his

duties under this Ordinance he".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think it was the Hon, the Prime Minister who  made

the  suggestion  that the proposed amendment  made

the   section   clearer  and  that  without   that

particular amendment it could have been  that  the

Comptroller could have gone into the premises  for

any  purpose whatsoever, even for purposes outside

the scope of the Ordinance. But that cannot be so,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, for in line 32 of  the  clause,

the purposes for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



which  the  Comptroller may  exercise  his  powers

under this clause are categorically set out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...for the purpose of ascertaining any facts

or  inspecting any books and documents  which  the

Comptroller  considers necessary or  relevant  for

the purposes of this Ordinance...".



<br><br>Therefore,  the Comptroller's entry is limited  to

the purposes enumerated in that particular clause.

So to say that that amendment makes it clearer,  I

think, Sir, is not right. If anything, it makes it

easier and puts the Comptroller outside the  ambit

of  the  Courts  by  introducing  that  particular

amendment.  I  myself see no point or  purpose  or

usefulness in that amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If there is no other Member wishing

to speak, I will put the question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6, line 3, to leave out "statutory" and

insert "legal".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment is to bring

within  the  proviso a category  of  persons  who,

under  the  law - and by law I mean both the  common

law  and the statute law - are precluded from giving

any information to any person unless the person in

respect  of  whom the information is sought  gives

his express permission to that person. On that,  I

would   like   to  refer  to  the  advocates   and

solicitors practising in the Courts here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advocates and solicitors, Mr Speaker, Sir, are

under  a legal obligation not to disclose matters,

which   have  been  disclosed  to  them  by  their

clients, to outside persons or parties unless  the

clients   themselves   expressly   authorise   the

solicitors  so  to  do. That is  covered  by  many

common  law  decision cases. I am wondering,  Sir,

whether  it is the intention of the Government  to

overrule  the present position by the use  of  the

word  "statutory" in this clause. If the intention

of the Government is that the words "statutory





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



obligation"  should mean that a person  who  says

that  he  has  the benefit of this  proviso  must

point  to  a particular statute rather than  case

law, then advocates and solicitors would lose the

privilege. If Government does not intend to  take

it  that far, then this amendment would meet  the

case  by  preserving the privilege of an advocate

and   solicitor  to  maintain  secrecy  regarding

matters  of  his client, unless his client  tells

him  otherwise.  In  any  case,  Sir,  since  the

Comptroller  would  know  who  the  advocate  and

solicitor was, he would also know who the  client

was.  Therefore, all that the Comptroller  would

have to do would be to get hold of the client and

exercise  on  him the rights which the  Ordinance

confers on him, and through him, he could get  at

the advocate and solicitor concerned. It would  I

think  be in the best interests of the profession

that  that privilege should be protected, and  if

the Government feels that it should be so, I feel

that  the  amendment would meet the  case  rather

than the clause as it now stands.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the point raised by the Member

for  Farrer  Park  has been discussed  at  length

during  the  meeting between the  Governments  of

Singapore and the Federation in Kuala Lumpur last

month.  It was agreed between them that it  would

be   the   intention  of  this   Ordinance   that

solicitors  would  not  be  exempted   from   the

provisions of this clause, and that only  persons

under  statutory obligation would be outside  its

provision. These would include officials such  as

the   Controller   of   Foreign   Exchange,   the

Superintendent  of  Census,  the   Registrar   of

Imports  and  Exports, and possibly a  few  other

officials.  It is felt that in this matter  there

are   no   grounds  whatsoever   in   drawing   a

distinction   between   the   relationships    of

solicitors   and   their   clients   and    other

professional persons and their clients.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Sir, I would just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



like to remind the Member for Farrer Park that he

drew  a  distinction in this  House  between  the

avoidance of that clause and the evasion of  that

clause.  He  praised lawyers of sufficient  merit

who  were able to advise clients on the best  way

of  avoiding these tax laws. I do not see why  he

must  be afraid of that now when he said that  he

has  been able to advise his clients on the  best

way  of avoiding the tax laws. He should be  just

as  prepared  to co-operate with the  Comptroller

and  explain  to him how these tax  laws  can  be

avoided.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the avoidance of income tax is a

highly  skilled art, particularly  when  we  have

such  an efficient Comptroller of Income Tax  and

an  efficient Minister for Finance. However, Sir,

I will not go into that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Law has said that so

far  as  the solicitors are concerned it  is  not

against  their interests to disclose  what  their

clients  have told them. But it has been the  law

that  anything said to a solicitor in  confidence

must   be  respected  by  the  lawyer.  But   any

statement  made to a clergyman or a doctor  or  a

dentist  or any other professional man has  never

been protected in a Court of law. The lawyer  has

always  been  in  a privileged  position.  I  was

wondering whether to get at the tax evaders it is

necessary  to take away that privilege which  the

Courts of law have thought fit to confer upon the

legal profession.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am sure that the legal

profession would welcome the provision of the law

as   it  stands,  since  this  will  add  to  the

safeguard   against   any   approach   by   shady

characters   for   assistance  from   the   legal

profession  either to evade or  to  avoid  income

tax. I take it that the Member for Farrer Park is

not  against  the  principle of  the  Comptroller

having  access  to information in  the  hands  of

solicitors,   since  he  has  put   forward   the

suggestion that this could quite easily  be  done

by direct application of pressure on the taxpayer

himself. But the main



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



reason is that there are no grounds whatsoever for

distinguishing between, let us say, solicitors and

accountants  in this particular field.  Both  deal

with   tax  matters,  and  if  we  were  to  grant

privilege  to  one and not to the other,  then  we

might well be accused of discriminatory treatment.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the discriminatory treatment is

already  here,  having  been  conferred   on   the

solicitor  by the Courts of Law, for reasons  best

known to them. But if the Comptroller thinks  that

that  should be taken away and that it is  in  the

best interests of the State that it should happen,

well, it is for the Legislature to say so and  for

the Government in power to say so. And I dare say,

Sir,  when  this Bill is passed and  becomes  law,

certainly the legal profession will comply with it

in  the  best  way they can. But as matters  stand

now,  they  have this protection and they  are  in

duty  bound  to  their  clients  not  to  disclose

information. If they did disclose it,  they  would

be  liable  in damages to their clients.  That  is

also a provision of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, on the question of tax avoidance, we

have  heard a number of times about how solicitors

encourage tax avoidance. Mr Speaker, Sir, they do

not  encourage  tax avoidance. They  advise  their

clients  in tax avoidance. May I put a case  in  a

simple  form so that even the Minister for Finance

might  understand it? Supposing there was a bridge

and  the  Government  was charging  every  vehicle

using that bridge a toll tax of a dollar. That  is

a tax which goes to the Exchequer Fund and it will

be  used  for purposes of the State. If  I,  as  a

motorist,  avoided  the  bridge  and  went  to  my

destination  in  a roundabout way,  was  I  acting

contrary to the interests of the State?  Or  if  I

advised a friend of mine, "Do not be such a  fool!

Why do you pay that dollar? If you go this way and

that way, you will avoid paying that dollar." That

is all the advice I give. Have I acted against the

interests of the State?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.

move, "That the clause be read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an amendment that would bring joy to the

heart of the Member for Farrer Park, because it is

the  one  thing,  which he has  been  persistently

clamouring  for,  that  is, the  concentration  of

authority in the hands of the Comptroller  himself

and not delegation to his subordinate officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of this Bill provides that any person who

carries  on  a  trade  or  exercises  any   trade,

business  or  profession  shall  keep  and  retain

proper   business  records,  and  issue   serially

numbered  receipts for sales. Under  the  proposed

section  67  (3)  contained  in  clause   6,   the

Comptroller  has wide powers not only  as  regards

laying  down  the  form in which the  records  and

receipts  are to be kept, but also in  respect  of

waiving the provisions of section 67 (1) either in

regard  to particular persons or class of  persons

or  classes of records. These powers are  so  wide

that it is desirable that they should be exercised

only by the Comptroller himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "Comptroller" in section 2 of

the  Ordinance includes a reference  to  a  Senior

Assistant Comptroller or an Assistant Comptroller.

It  is proposed to insert the proposed section  67

in  the  definition of "Comptroller" so  that  the

powers  exercisable in that section  can  only  be

exercised by him.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a  Third

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill, as

originally envisaged by the Government, except for

a   few  minor  amendments,  will,  on  the  Third

Reading,  be  passed. It will become  statute  law

when  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara has assented  to

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am suggesting to the Minister for Finance

that, as a result of these amendments, there is in

the  Ordinance a hiatus. The present  position  is

that   where   the  Comptroller  has  raised   his

assessment   for  the  year  of  assessment,   the

taxpayer has to pay the tax within 30 days of  the

assessment.  If he does not wish to  pay  the  tax

within  30 days as set out in the Ordinance,  then

he  must file a notice of objection. On the notice

of  objection, if the Comptroller and the taxpayer

come  to  an  agreement, there  will  then  be  an

amendment to the tax, and the amended tax will  be

paid  to  the  Comptroller. But if the Comptroller

and  the  taxpayer,  on the notice  of  objection,

cannot  come  to  an agreement and - these  are  the

operative   words,   Mr   Speaker,   Sir - if   the

Comptroller so signifies to the taxpayer  that  he

cannot agree with the taxpayer, then and only then

will  the  right of appeal, so far as the taxpayer

is  concerned,  arise.  On notification  from  the

Comptroller   that  he  cannot  agree   with   the

taxpayer,   then  within  seven   days   of   such

notification, a notice of appeal must be filed and

the  matter  then  goes to  appeal.  That  is  the

position under the existing law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will be the position after these amendments

have  been passed? The position will be  that,  as

soon as the Comptroller raises his assessment, the

tax  must  be paid within 30 days. The  taxpayer's

right  of  appeal will only arise if  he  files  a

notice of objection within 30 days and, mark these

words,   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  if  the  Comptroller

signifies  to  the  taxpayer that  he  is  not  in

agreement  with  his objection.  So  that  if  the

Comptroller, under the new law,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



keeps  quiet  about the notice of  objection,  the

right of appeal does not arise. In this case,  the

Government  can have the cake and eat  it  too.  I

know  of  cases, Mr Speaker, Sir - and  here  I  am

prepared  to  give  facts  and  figures   to   the

Minister,  if  he  wishes me to, in  writing   - now

pending  before the Comptroller where notices  of

objection  have been given, but no  agreement  has

yet  been reached between the Comptroller and  the

taxpayer,  with  the result that  no  appeals  can

arise.  That position now is all right so  far  as

the  taxpayer is concerned, because tax also  need

not  be  paid. But when the position is  that  tax

must be paid within 30 days, you can imagine,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, what hardship can be caused  to  the

taxpayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a hypothetical case - this is not

unusual - where notice of objection has  been  given

but  agreement  has not been reached  between  the

Comptroller and the taxpayer, and no intimation to

that effect, in writing, has been passed on to the

taxpayer.   Two   years  elapse   and   then   the

Comptroller  says,  "I  do  not  agree   to   your

objections."  The right of appeal then  arises.  A

notice  of appeal is filed, and another two  years

is  taken  before the appeal is heard - I  was  told

that that is the normal length of time. So four to

five  years could elapse, Mr Speaker, Sir, before

the  taxpayer  could  have  his  case  heard.  The

Finance Minister is laughing, but it could  happen

because  he himself has told the House  that  from

the  time of objection to now - two to three  years -

nothing  has been done by the Board. I am  telling

the  Minister that two to three years have  passed

in  the  Office of the Comptroller and he has  not

signified his dissent to the taxpayer. I think two

and  three  makes  five - I  believe  that  is  good

finance, too. So the Government says, "Pay the tax

within  30  days,  but the determination  of  your

rights must wait for another five years." I do not

think any decent Government, however anxious it is

to collect tax, would leave the taxpayer in such a

position.  I  do  not  know whether  it  would  be

necessary  to  amend  the Ordinance  to  secure  a

statutory right on the part of the taxpayer to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



call the Comptroller to give his decision within a

stated  period. But perhaps the Minister  himself,

under the new section 3A, might now be able to  do

it   by   giving  a  general  direction   to   the

Comptroller that in such matters he must say "yea"

or  "nay" within 30 days. I hope that one  of  the

more  pleasanter duties of the Minister,  when  he

gets  his power under the new section 3A, will  be

to issue a general direction to the Comptroller to

the  effect that in future he shall say  "yea"  or

"nay" within 30 days.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Farrer  Park has brought up very clearly  the

reason  why  it has been necessary to bring  about

the  amendments  that  we  are  seeking  from  the

Assembly.   He  has  given  instances  of   delays

resulting  from  the lodging of an  appeal  or  an

objection against an assessment. It is because the

present  Ordinance  makes  it  so  attractive  for

taxpayers to lodge an objection that we have  such

a large number of objections raised that it is not

possible,  within the resources of the Income  Tax

Department, to deal with them expeditiously.  This

has  a cumulative effect in that the moment people

know  that  there  will  be  delays  in  giving  a

decision  on this from the Comptroller,  there  is

all  the  more an incentive to lodge an  objection

until we get to the ridiculous stage where it  may

take four to five years to bring about finality in

these matters. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  when the taxpayer has to pay his tax  first,

we  shall  not  find  large  queues  of  taxpayers

lodging objections, and the fears which the Member

for  Farrer  Park has just expressed will  not  be

realised.

<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. has

been  in  power  in Singapore for  almost  a  year.

During this period of time, several Bills have been

tabled  and  passed in this Assembly. The  point  I

wish  to emphasise here is not the number of  Bills

which  have been tabled by the P.A.P. To a  certain

extent, Bills introduced by the P.A.P. reflect  the

conditions  prevailing in Singapore at the  present

time,  and  the  conditions  which  the  Government

intends to achieve in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing is clear. That is that every action

taken  by  the People's Action Party Government  in

the  field of legislation has been made  not  as  a

result  of any pressure, nor as concessions to  any

demand by any particular group. In fact, we of the

People's  Action Party can take pride in  the  fact

that  every  measure taken by us in the  political,

economic and even social field has originated  from

our  own plans and considerations and taken on  our

own  initiative. It is not necessary for me to give

details  of the steps already taken by us  for  the

improvement of the living conditions of the  people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our own initiative, it is enough for me to

introduce   this  National  Language  and   Culture

Institute Bill at its Second Reading today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if the Government wishes to develop and popularise our national language, and promote

the  evolution of a Malayan culture as a  permanent

measure   and  a  long-term  policy,   it   becomes

essential to set up a National Language and Culture

Institute  for  the purpose of directing,  and  co-ordinating all work in this direction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Institute of National Language and

Culture  has two aspects, that is to say,  language

and   culture.  We  have  decided  to  set  up  the

Institute  with these two main objectives,  because

we  believe that the problem of achieving  national

unity  is  equal  in importance to the  problem  of

developing  the  national  language  and   national

culture.  Efforts which aim merely at  popularising

the  use of Malay as the national language will not

be  enough.  It  is essential to  make  efforts  to

encourage  mutual  understanding  in  the   various

aspects  of  the  cultures of  the  races  in  this

country  as the first step to infuse the spirit  of

unity.  Through such efforts, it is  hoped  that  a

basis  for  the  eventual synthesis  of  a  Malayan

culture will be laid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the first aspect, i.e. language,

the  immediate task before us is to popularise  the

use  of  the national language among the people  of

Singapore, the majority of whom are non-Malays. The

object  of this task is to educate the majority  of

the people in the national language during the next

four years. Non-Malays in Singapore who do not have

a  sound  knowledge  of  Ma-lay  number  about  one

million  persons. It is clear that the  problem  of

popularising the use of the national language among

these  people is a tremendous one. The  role  which

the  Institute  will  play  in  solving  this  huge

problem is only a part of the overall solution. The

Ministry  of  Education  will  also  share  in  the

solution  of  this problem. The Institute  will  be

responsible  for  producing books on  the  national

language,   text-books  and  books  on methods   of

teaching  the  national language to  non-Malays  of

various   races  and  cultures.  The  Ministry   of

Education  will,  of course, produce  the  national

language teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to that, the Institute will publish

magazines  in  the national language which  can  be

easily  understood by people of various age groups.

It is also necessary to produce radio programmes in

the   national  language  which  can   be   easily

understood  by  listeners of all  races.  Books  on

politics,  economics and science will be translated

into Malay, Chinese and Tamil. Books and novels



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



on  Malayan  subjects will be  published.   School

text-books in the national language, and books  on

Malayan  subjects  for our schools  will  also  be

published.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In carrying out the aforesaid tasks of the

Institute,  it  must  be borne  in  mind  that  we

earnestly  desire to co-operate  with  the  Malay-Indonesian  Language  Co-ordination  Committee  by

implementing  decisions on  spelling,  terminology

and  other matters relating to the standardisation

of Bahasa Melayu and bahasa Indonesia, agreed upon

by  Malaya  and Indonesia. Our Language  Institute

will try to establish relations and cooperate with

organisations  which have similar objectives  such

as  the  Language  and Literature  Agency  in  the

Federation   of   Malaya,   and   the   Indonesian

Literature Institute, so that duplication  in  the

translation of books, etc., for instance,  can  be

avoided,   and  in  general  to  carry   out   the

objectives  of the Institute. We will regard  such

organisations  as being our elders and  possessing

more experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultural aspect of the work of the Institute

is  no  more and no less important than  its  role

concerning language. The Institute will  encourage

research  in  all aspects of cultures existing  in

one country, so that the people can understand the

matter    more    deeply.   This   will    include

sociological,  political  and  art  research.  For

example, research on the Malay opera or the Peking

opera  has never been carried out before. It  will

be  useful  if  research is  carried  out  on  the

background of these two types of operas  in  order

to  find out whether their feudalistic backgrounds

should  be restored or revived, or whether  a  new

type of Malayan drama should be created to replace

both types of opera in the national language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Members of this Assembly have surely

noted  that,  among  other  things,  our  Language

Institute   aims  at  encouraging  and,   wherever

necessary,  providing  facilities  for   promoting

Malayan  fine arts. Such objectives are  based  on

the  fact  that culture is a thing that lives  and

grows.  Members of this Assembly who  are  present

here will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



agree  with me that, in the field of culture,  the

arts  can  only  live  and  grow  well  if  it  is

nourished by healthy and progressive art creations

which  are  consistent with changing  times.  Even

though  some  of our arts contain  traces  of  the

influences  of  the past, yet not all  these  past

elements should be eradicated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to draw the attention of this Assembly to one of the objectives of our

Language  Institute,  namely,  to  encourage   and

promote  literary talent in the national  language

and  other languages used in this country with the

aims  of fostering the growth of a Malayan culture

and  Malayan  consciousness. In this  transitional

period of our educational system, it will be found

that  there are many among the people of Singapore

who  are  gifted with literary talent.  But  their

talent  can  be brought to light only through  the

language in which they have been taught,  such  as

Chinese,   Tamil  and  English,  apart  from   the

national   language.   It  would   therefore   be

reasonable and realistic for us not to allow  this

to  be wasted. It is better to allow them to write

short  stories, drama and plays with  a  Malaysian

theme  and background than to allow them  to  rely

only on books and perform plays and drama imported

from  China, London, Taiwan or Madras. As  I  have

said earlier in regard to the growth of a culture,

which  is  nourished by healthy  elements,  it  is

likewise  the same in the case of arts, literature

and drama.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the establishment of the National Language and Culture Institute is based on the

need  for  such a department that can  tackle  and

solve  various problems connected with our  common

aim  to  make Malay the national language of  this

country.  Owing  to  the acute shortage  of  Malay

teachers in Singapore, it is necessary for the  Ministry  of  Education to provide  courses  in  the

national  language  for non-Malay  teachers.  This

shortage of Malay language teachers is likewise  a

problem  for this new department which we wish  to

set  up, in so far as our Language Institute  will

face  the  problem  of  producing  books  in   the

national language and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



other  text-books for the non-Malay  teachers  who

will  teach the Malay language to non-Malays. This

is indeed an extraordinary situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I wish to mention is the role

of  the National Language and Culture Institute in

the  adult education campaign which the Government

is  planning to intensify. Our Language  Institute

must  play an important role in achieving the aims

of the Adult Education Board in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on behalf of U.M.N.O.

particularly,  I  say  thanks  to  God   Almighty.

Neither  will I forget to offer my congratulations

to    the   Government   which   has   shown   its

determination  not  only to raise,  encourage  and

develop the Malay language, but also to solve  the

problem of nationality for all our citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, once again I pay tribute to the

policy  of  the People's Action Party. During  the

First Session of this Assembly, the speech made by

the  first  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  of  a  self-

governing  Singapore was made in  Malay.  But  the

then Yang di-Pertuan Negara is not an Asian. He is

an  Englishman.  From before the colonialists  had

encouraged Government servants especially to study

the   Malay   language.   Similarly,   they   also

encouraged  those  people who were  interested  in

learning that language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What impresses me in the speech by the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Culture was his remark that political history will

also  play its part in culture. Mr Speaker, as  a

Member of the Opposition, I need clarification  as

to  what  political  history we  should  tell  the

people  of Singapore, because if we are to extract

this  only from the history of the Malays, it will

be  communalistic. As I am still in  the  dark,  I

think it should be clarified in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, I have noted this

fact - the people of Indonesia and the Federation of

Malaya,  who  are  our neighbours,  have  achieved

independence. I am proud of them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the question of culture, which should

be   encouraged,  we  have  seen  the   Indonesian

badminton  team whose members are the  Ra'ayat  of

Indonesia.  They are not of Malay origin,  because

all  of  them wear caps. Likewise, representatives

of  the Federation of Malaya who go abroad put  on

songkoks or caps. Could I have an explanation from

the  Government whether, in culture, we should put

on   caps   to   show  that  we  are  representing

Singapore,  which will be achieving  independence?

This is merely a question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, I do not know what

to  talk about. Looking at the Opposition,  I  see

that  the Member for Mountbatten is wearing sarong

kebaya  and  a  shawl. Will this be  part  of  the

problem of culture in so far as national dress  is

concerned? What would be the style of our national

dress? Are we going to wear white shirts and  long

trousers  like  the Government side  or  like  the

Opposition  Members, including myself, who  merely

put  on  caps?  I  feel that this  too  should  be

clarified,   if  it  is  the  intention   of   the

Government to get support from the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to all this, Mr Speaker, nearly one

year  has  elapsed since this Assembly  came  into

session. I hear with great regret that Mr Speaker

will be resigning from office. But what to do? Mr

Speaker will be succeeded by another Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period of one year, Mr Speaker, I

wish  to offer my highest congratulations  to  the

Prime  Minister,  who has, on  several  occasions,

used  the  national language in this Assembly.  It

could  be said that the language used by the Prime

Minister has been of a high standard. But what has

become  a question mark to me is that, aside  from

the  Malay Members sitting on the Government side,

only one Member has made his speech in Malay. So I

hope that the Government should, as an example  to

the people of Singapore encourage the use of Malay

right  inside  this Assembly House if  we  are  to

merge with the Federation of Malaya. We know  what

language is used there. In their Senate the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



official  language  is  Malay.  It  should  be  an

inducement in this Assembly, and I hope  that  Tun

Lim Yew Hock in future -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member cannot

address  a Member of this House by name. There  is

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I apologise, Mr

Speaker,  I  withdraw that part of my speech.  Mr

Speaker, I also hope that Opposition Members, like

the  Members for Cairnhill and Farrer Park,  will,

if possible, speak in the national language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would also like to say something about culture. I would like to know whether the

Government,  in order to create a culture,  wishes

to  make Malay culture as a basis? It is merely  a

question which I pose to the Government, because I

wish  to know further how the Government is  going

to  implement the aim of creating one  culture.  I

have  given  considerable thought to this  matter.

The  Malays  cannot easily be persuaded  to  leave

their  traditional culture. But we  must  remember

that our fellow citizens in Singapore are made  up

of  various races who have shown their loyalty  to

Singapore.  We  know from history that  there  are

people  who have had their own culture generations

ago, and their culture is very much older than our

Malay  culture. Are they prepared to discard their

own  culture? Or will it be a hotch-potch of  this

and  that  culture of those people  who  have  now

become   citizens  of  Singapore?   I   hope   the

Government will enlighten me on this matter so  as

to enable us to go further into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Malays have ronggeng or

joget  which  is  also part of their  culture.  At

wedding feasts joget is performed to entertain the

guests.  In  the changing times that  we  are  now

facing, Malays as well as non-Malays like dancing.

The  colonialists brought their own culture to our

land.  Likewise  the  people  of  other  countries

brought  culture  similar  to  the  one   I   have

mentioned just now. I would like to have a  fuller

explanation on such matters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point I would like to bring up

in  this  Assembly. In the matter  of  culture,  I

would also like to refer to our national language.

When are we going to use our national language  on

notices,  notice-boards, etc.? The  names  of  the

roads  should also be in Malay. Are  we  going  to

permit  matters to remain as they  are  today?  We

must  take positive steps now to bring the  people

together. We must eradicate all imported  elements

from  our  culture.  All notices,  advertisements,

etc, should be printed in Malay. In this way,  we

can show to the people of the Federation of Malaya

that Singapore is taking positive steps to promote

the  use of the Malay language. With such a  claim

to  our credit, I feel that the possibility  of  a

merger  with the Federation of Malaya will not  be

so  remote. In whatever we do, we must be sincere.

We must not do things half-heartedly because we do

not wish people to level the criticism that things

are done half-heartedly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you may recall how, during the

Japanese occupation period, the Japanese tried  to

introduce  their  own  culture  in  the   occupied

countries. But the method by which they  tried  to

achieve  this was by force. We know  that  such  a

method  would  be  resisted  by  people  who  love

independence, unity and prosperity. They would  be

prepared to fight to the death on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Government will clarify,

particularly  to U.M.N.O., the nature  of  Malayan

culture  in  Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  also

hope,  with respect to you, that you will be  able

to  conduct  proceedings in this Assembly  in  the

national  language  so  that  you  will  not  say,

"Order, order" in English but in Malay.

<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Leong Keng Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   we   have   just   heard    the

parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Culture say that the National Language and Culture

Institute  will concentrate on the  study  of  the

Malay  language  and promote  the  mixing  of  the

various  cultures. We, as members of the Education

and   Culture  Ministries,  should  support   this

resolution.  We  should  co-operate  with  the

Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



Culture and work hard on it so that it may  be  a

success.  We  know that in the past the  colonial

Government tried to divide the people because  of

its  multi-racial society. In the past, there was

no   inter-relation   and  co-operation   between

schools  of  the four different language  groups.

The  non-English  schools were suppressed.  Since

the  new  Government came into power,  Malay  has

become   the  national  language.  The   National

Language   and   Culture   Institute   will    be

established  for the development of the  national

language  so  that more people will  be  able  to

express their views in Malay. That is what we aim

to  do.  In  the schools, the study of the  Malay

language  has been introduced. The Malay language

should be the same as that of the Federation  of

Malaya  and  Indonesia. We have already  sent  a

delegation to Indonesia to study the problems of

education  there. The textbooks of Indonesia  can

be  used by us to nourish the Malayan culture.  I

believe  that  in future Singapore  will  send  a

delegation to the Federation of Malaya  to  study

Malayan culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote the development of the Malay

language,  we must engage in various  activities.

We  must  encourage the teachers to make  use  of

Malayan history and background in their writings,

so   that  the  next  generation  of  people   in

Singapore will have a clearer picture of  Malayan

culture.  In  the  past, the  textbooks  used  in

English  schools came from England,  the  Chinese

textbooks  came from China or Hongkong,  and  the

Indian  textbooks  came from  India.  Only  Malay

textbooks  were produced locally but  no  serious

effort  has been made to improve the standard  of

these books with the result that there are only a

few  Malay  textbooks.  I hope  in  future  Malay

textbooks will be produced by the Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the training of Malay teachers,

we  have  trained  many  teachers  to  teach  the

national language to students in schools. We have

started  courses in the Teachers Training College

for  teachers  to learn Malay so that  in  future

they will be able to teach Malay. Since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



the establishment of the Adult Education Council,

adults  can study the national language at night.

The Ministry of Culture can encourage the use  of

the national language in school magazines and  in

many  other  ways.  The new Government  has  made

Malay  the  national language, but we should  not

just  sit  back and shout about it. We must  take

positive  steps  to  popularise  Malay   as   the

national language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope in the not too distant future we will be

able  to  have a clearer understanding of Malayan

culture  and that we will also be able to express

our views in the national language.

<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Moh Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohd. Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in support of the Bill

setting  up  the  National Language  and  Culture

Institute, I wish to say that the time  has  come

for a self-governing Singapore to be administered

by a political party which has the support of the

masses in establishing an institute which aims at

promoting  and  developing the national  language

and  culture.  The  national  language - which   is

Malay - is a national issue, which should have  the

support   of   all   sections  of   the   people,

irrespective of their party leanings, and of  the

fact that generations of them have lived here, as

long  as  they owe their allegiance to Singapore.

In  the  Federation  of Malaya  there  exists  an

institute  called  the  Language  and  Literature

Institute. Similarly in Indonesia, we  find  such

an  institute. Both these countries have Malay as

the   national  language.  Mr  Speaker,  we   in

Singapore   also  take  Malay  as  the   national

language.  It  is therefore appropriate  that  we

should have our own National Language and Culture

Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the objects of the National

Language  and Culture Institute, as mentioned  in

the  Bill are, inter alia, to enrich and  develop

the  Malay language so as to make it an  adequate

and  comprehensive medium of expression and  also

to  spread  knowledge  of the  language  to  non-

Malays.  Here  we  could  picture  how  wide  the

objects of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



Dewan are. Apart from carrying out research, I  am

confident,  Mr  Speaker, we know that  the  Malay

language  has been in existence for a good  number

of years. It is hoped that with the cooperation of

all  concerned in this Island, regardless of their

party  leanings, we will achieve our determination

to enrich and develop the Malay language and study

and know the Malay language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of culture, Mr Speaker, we are

trying to build our national culture from whatever

cultural  sources  are  available.  I  think   our

culture  is  still  at a stage where  research  is

being  carried out, because the officials  of  the

Dewan  will  carry out research into our  national

culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

should  like to clarify that Government has opened

the  way  towards one language which will be  used

and which will be spoken by people of all races in

Singapore.  For  the  purpose  of  achieving  this

objective,  the support of the Opposition  Members

will be welcome.



<br><br>3.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  of  the  opinion  that  the  National

Language  and  Culture Institute is  a  necessity.

Since  the P.A.P. Government introduced the slogan

that  Malay is the national language, the majority

of  the Chinese people in Singapore have not  only

accepted it but are also taking positive steps  to

learn  the language. No matter where they  are - in

the   trade  unions,  Nanyang  University,   rural

organisations, all the branches of the P.A.P., and

in  various  commercial  organisations - many  Malay

classes  have been set up. I can put  it  in  this

way - the majority of the Chinese workers, the young

students  and the intellectuals, sincerely  accept

Malay  as  the national language. They  are  aware

that   if  they  can  directly  communicate  their

feelings   and  their  thoughts  to  their   Malay

brothers,  then  the Malays' fear of  the  Chinese

will  be  eradicated. The Malays will then realise

that the so-called Chinese chauvinism is not as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



serious  as  that  considered by  the  non-Chinese

educated  people.  It can be said  that  the  non-Chinese  educated young people regard the learning

of  the Malay language as more important than  the

study of the English language. This is not because

the  study  of Malay is easier than the  study  of

English,  but that they are aware that  the  Malay

language  is the most important means of achieving

national unity in Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Member for Kampong

Kembangan made some comments on Malayan culture. I

venture  to take this opportunity to say something

so   that  everybody  will  understand  what   the

attitude  of the Chinese youth is towards  Malayan

culture.  Throughout the year the  campaign  among

the  majority of the Chinese youth to learn  Malay

has created a certain psychological change. In the

past  many  Chinese  educated youths,  because  of

their lack of understanding of the Malay language,

looked  down on the Malays. But this attitude  has

changed now. Since we have declared Malay  as  the

national language, their attitude has changed, and

they now accept Malay as the national language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many articles translated from Malay

into  Chinese appearing in the Chinese newspapers.

In  these newspapers, we can read a lot of  essays

about  the history of Malay literature.  This  is

proof  of  the change of attitude of  the  Chinese

youths  towards Malay literature. We can see  from

the  many  articles that the Chinese  youths  have

been able to translate into Malay, essays on trees

and  plants, and there is the Chinese  version  of

Sejarah  Melayu or Malai Chi Nien.  The  works  of

Ungku  Aziz are welcome and are earnestly  studied

by  the  Chinese youths. Today the Chinese readers

learn more and more of Malay works. From the Malay

Tribune  run  by the Nanyang University,  we  also

read articles published by the Utusan Melayu.  The

translation  is made by Mustapha. From  all  these

translated articles, the Chinese youths,  for  the

first  time,  learn that there are  many  literary

workers  who  work  very hard  and  who  have  the

correct mentality and consciousness in this field,

especially when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



they  learn  about the transitional  changes.  And

when  these Chinese youths learn Malay literature,

they   deeply  respect  the  Malay  writers.  They

discover that in the history of Malaya there  were

certain  people like the Chinese Wun  Tiang  Siang

and  Yeok  Fay.  There were also people  who  were

resourceful  and  brave, for example,  Hang  Tuah.

These  Chinese youths have as great a respect  for

Hang  Tuah  as they have for Wun Tiang  Siang  and

Yeok  Fay. All these translated versions  and  all

these  essays  appear in the newspaper,  but  they

have  not  been  done  under a good  organisation.

Therefore,  it is clear that a certain  amount  of

effort has been wasted by the Chinese youths. They

not only decide to learn more about the living conditions  of  the  Malay  people  and  their   past

history, but they also try to pass on to the Malay

people their own feelings and their points of view

in  this  respect. We can see for  ourselves  that

there is a certain newspaper which is being run by

the  Nanyang University. Another publication,  the

Kesusasteraan  Kebudayaan,  is  also  run  by  the

Nanyang  University.  The  running  of  these  two

publications is to encourage the Chinese people to

understand the Malay people, and also to encourage

them  to  translate Malay literary works  for  the

benefit of the non-Malay people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if instead of trying to

understand Malay culture in a purely formal way we

try  to  understand it from the way which  I  have

mentioned  just now, that is, by showing  as  much

respect  for  the  past Malay  heroes  as  for the

Chinese heroes, then we can achieve national unity

in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, there are many people who are

learning Malay. But some of them have stopped half-way.  One  of the most important reasons which  is

responsible  for  this  failure  is  the  lack  of

suitable  textbooks for beginners. At present,  we

have such textbooks like Sinar Baru,, which is for

beginners. Our adult readers are people  who  have

much    experience,   and   they   are    somewhat

sophisticated.  A  textbook like  Sinar  Baru,  of

course,  cannot satisfy their needs  and  desires.

Moreover, the supply of books



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



is not adequate. Another reason for the failure is

the lack of a good Chinese! Malay dictionary. When

this  National Language and Culture  Institute  is

set  up,  we can then carry out the task, which  I

have  mentioned  just  now under  a  well-directed

organisation. We will no longer waste our time and

energies  as we have done in the past.  After  the

setting-up  of  this Dewan Bahasa  dan  Kebudayaan

Kebangsaan,  we  will bring a new  climax  to  our

campaign for the encouragement of the learning  of

the  Malay language. In addition, it will make  an

unlimited contribution to our national unity.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I fully support the

establishment of a National Language  and  Culture

Institute,  for which the Bill has been introduced

today  by  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister  for  Culture. The decision to  establish

this  National Language and Culture Institute  was

made  by  the Language Congress and the All-Malaya

Language  and Literary Congress more than  a  year

ago,  although  at  the meeting  of  the  Congress

referred to, members from the Party which form the

Government  today  were not represented.  Yet  the

People's Action Party Government is always  paying

attention to the welfare of the people, especially

in  the sphere of language and literature, and  it

is  doing something which had been resolved by the

Malay  Language  Congress, an  organisation  which

represented    all   the   language   institutions

throughout  the  land.  The  setting  up  of   the

National  Language and Culture Institute  had  its

origin at a meeting of the Malay Language Congress

when  a resolution was adopted. As far as I  know,

at  the  opening  of the All-Malaya  Language  and

Literary  Congress, Singapore was  represented  by

the Singapore Government. The Singapore Government

was   represented  by  its  junior  Minister   for

Education.  He made a fiery speech, and  gave  an

assurance  that  the resolution  of  the  Congress

would  be  fully  supported. In the circumstances,

Mr Speaker, if we were to note the time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



which  has elapsed from the moment the resolution

to  establish the Language Institute was  adopted

up till now, I think, we are a little behind time

in  setting  up this Institute. However,  with  a

view  to  the full realisation and the fulfilling

of the aspirations of the people, we have decided

to establish a body known as the Dewan Bahasa dan

Kebudayaan Kebangsaan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we consider the objects of the

Institute, I am quite sure there will  be  nobody

who  will oppose them. On the contrary, they will

be  proud  of the fact that our objects are-based

on  facts and not on fiction. Mr Speaker, I wish

to  bring  this  point to the  attention  of  the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan, who has repeatedly

and  indirectly  challenged  the  Government   to

declare  its stand on the meaning of  culture.  I

think  the subject which we were discussing  just

now  is  similar to what we do when we provide  a

site to grow rice. We will provide the seed,  and

the  result will be that we will reap the harvest

in  the future. So that only when the time  comes

for us to reap the harvest will we decide whether

we  are  going to make it into a bryani or  fried

rice.  So  the  clarification asked  for  by  the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan is not how  we  are

going  to ensure that the harvest will be a  good

one, but what we are going to do when the rice is

ready  to  be cooked. I think this is a question,

which  no linguist will be able to answer.  As  a

matter  of  fact, I am not an expert on  language

and culture. But from what little I know, culture

is  not a dead thing, nor is it a thing which can

be  shaped  or  handled by human beings,  like  a

shirt  for a man to put on. Culture is  a  living

organism. No government could force any  kind  of

culture  on  the  people, as was  quoted  by  the

Member  or  Kampong Kembangan when this  sort  of

thing happened during the Japanese Occupation. In

the  final  analysis, culture is evolved  by  the

people themselves, not by any government.  So  it

is  up  to  the people of Malaya, who  owe  their

undivided allegiance to this fair land  of  ours,

to evolve a national culture.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am conscious of the fact that some

frivolous matters have been raised. For instance,

coaching  the representatives from the Indonesian

badminton  team putting on caps. But I think  the

Indonesians  who came to Singapore with  songkoks

were  Chinese. When they were asked, "How do  you

do",  they said, "Well, thank you". But we  would

be  disappointed if the residents  of  a  country

like  Singapore, which has accepted Malay as  its

national  language, were asked, "How do you  do?"

in  Malay  and they would not be able to  answer.

The  basic problem is how to spread knowledge  of

the  Malay  language.  This  is  what  we  should

concentrate  on.  Similarly,  Mr  Speaker,  with

other  matters  like the nature of -our  culture,

names   of   roads  and  so  on,  which   require

clarification.  The setting up of  this  National

Language  and  Culture  Institute,  as  has  been

explained by the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister for Culture, will lay the foundation  on

which   we  can  enrich  and  develop  the  Malay

language  so that all the people will  learn  the

Malay  language. Why do we refer  to  it  as  the

Bahasa   Kebangsaan  or  the  national  language?

Because the Malay Language Congress has made,  as

its  slogan, language is the soul of the  nation.

So that if we know that the Malay language is the

national  language, then the soul of  the  nation

will  be  created  by the people themselves.  Mr

Speaker, it is not just a question of culture  or

national  language. A youth, if he is  forced  to

marry  a girl whom he does not know, will  reject

her,  because, as the Malay saying goes, "If  you

do  not  know someone, you will not love  him  or

her." So the first step is to spread knowledge of

the  Malay  language to the people: so when  they

have  studied and grasped the Malay language they

will begin to have a love for it. Generations  of

Chinese and Indians will then have an interest in

learning the Malay language. When the people  are

already  versed in the knowledge of  the  various

cultures  that exist in Malaya, then  there  will

evolve   a   spirit   of   mutual   respect   and

understanding  among  the  various   races.   Mr

Speaker, in the struggle to achieve our object of

spreading



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



knowledge  of  the Malay language,  we  must  work

hard,  whether we are from the Government  or  the

Opposition  benches. Our object is the same,  that

is, to create a national culture. So, Mr Speaker,

the  point  is  to work hard - not  to  lead  or  to

demand. That can be equated to a child crying  for

milk.  But  for us, there should be  no  need  for

pleas  or  fears. The attitude we should adopt  is

"We  will do this. We will demonstrate to  society

that we are positive in our actions." For instance

sepak  raga jaring, which is a national game.  The

extent  to which this game is indulged in  can  be

seen  from the fact that Chinese and Indian youths

also  have an interest in it, and they participate

in  it.  I have heard that it was a Chinese  sepak

raga  jaring  team,  which  won  the  championship

recently.  That is the kind of culture  which,  by

itself,  has been accepted by all the races  which

live   in   Singapore.  Sepak  raga   jaring   has

automatically become a national game. So  I  hope,

Mr  Speaker, we should base our struggle  on  the

principle  that we must work, work and  work.  The

Government, on its part, will be pleased to accept

any   constructive  criticisms.  So  that  is  the

clarification  I wish to offer to the  Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan who has sought  information  as

regards the nature of culture, whether all  of  us

should  put on caps, the changing of the names  of

roads  to Malay names, whether ronggeng should  be

employed   at  wedding  feasts.  These   will   be

determined by society. It would be too  premature

at  this-stage to prophesy. I know Mr  Za'aba,  a

professor, and Che'Gu Mahmud Ahmad, an  expert  on

Malay  culture.  These experts themselves  do  not

dare  to  come out into the open and say what  the

nature of Malayan culture should be, because  they

know that culture is not a dead thing nor is it  a

thing which could be forced on the people. Culture

is  the  result  of  the birth  of  a  process  of

enlightenment and refinement of taste acquired and

gradually evolved by the people.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):Mr Speaker, in regard to this

Bill  setting up a National Language  and  Culture

Institute, I feel it is not necessary or essential

for the Government to emphasise the objects of the

Bill  since  the Opposition Members realise  their

responsibilities  as  to how  they  are  going  to

create   a   national  identity   comprising   the

generations of the various races. It should not be

the attitude of the Government to use the piece of

paper  on which the Bill is printed as a commodity

to hoodwink the masses. As a responsible member of

society  trying  to  create one  nationality,  Mr

Speaker,  I wish to emphasise this in no uncertain

terms.  The Government itself is aware  that  this

Institute contains two schools of thought, one  of

which is to create a united and strong nation.  In

talking about language and culture, there are -two

aspects,  which will benefit certain  sections  of

the  people.  Take the question  of  the  national

language.  If we dwell at length on the fact  that

Malay  is the national language, it will naturally

impress  the  Malays  because their  language  has

become  the  national language. But  what  is  the

object of making Malay the national language?  Is

it  because it is recognised, or is it because  it

will be an instrument, which will bring benefit to

those,  concerned? If the purpose is to  make  the

people realise that that is the only means whereby

they  can  improve themselves,  then  I  say  that

language  becomes  an instrument  to  improve  the

welfare  of the people. From the changes going  on

in  Indonesia  and  the Federation  of  Malaya  at

present, we can see that the Malay language is the

national language. Therefore, in Singapore,  there

is  no other way but to see that Malay becomes the

national language, because the use of the national

language  will  bring benefit  not  to  particular

individuals  but to all the people. Therefore,  we

should  work together on this problem  so  as  to

make  the  national language become one  which  is

nurtured and loved by the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning culture, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government side has stated that that is a matter,

which cannot be forced on the people. But culture

has  its influence. Also it is culture, which can

keep one party apart from another, because to the

individual  using culture, it gives  rise  to  an

expression  of feelings and opinions.  Therefore,

it is not something, which can wholly be accepted

if  the  individual cannot raise himself  to  the

standard  of  the culture. If this is  something,

which can benefit us, we should use it. But if it

is  something,  which is not in accord  with  us,

then  I  feel it can give rise to failure in  our

effort to build a national culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister for National Development today,  he

stated  that the Opposition should not  have  any

fears  about  the objects of this  Institute.  He

said   we  should  wait  until  the  harvest   is

collected before we decide on what to do with it.

It  is as though the Member wanted to make fun of

what  my  colleague has stated. We from  U.M.N.O.

will  continue to watch over this matter  because

the  Malays in Singapore, who have been  accepted

by  law  as the indigenous people of the  island,

look  upon it weightily and we from U.M.N.O. will

oppose anything that is contrary to what is  laid

down in the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say here, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the

Ministry of Culture is about to hold a huge  mass

meeting  on  National  Day,  but  we  cannot   be

together with them because what is to be  carried

out on that day is not in accord with what we  in

the  Opposition think is healthy for the  people.

This  is  the  second time that Members  of  the

Opposition  are not together with the  Government

on  a national occasion. The dictatorial attitude

adopted by the Ministry of Culture in refusing to

accept  the  views and opinions  offered  by  the

Opposition is resented, and I hope this  will  be

given  due  consideration by  the  Government  in

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To talk about this and that and to tease one

another  in  this  Assembly  is  an  attitude  of

irresponsibility. What we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



should  try to resolve is the problem of  how  to

make  Singapore prosperous so that every  citizen

will  feel that he is living in a safe and  sound

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to dwell further

on  the  matter except to elaborate on one point.

The  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for

National  Development  has accused  the  previous

Government of not setting up a similar Institute.

This  kind  of  talk  is irresponsible.  This  is

merely to win the acclaim of the people. I  would

like  to  say  that  the  National  Language  and

Culture  Institute in Malaya was  established  by

language  enthusiasts with  the  support  of  the

Federation  Government,  but  the  Institute   in

Singapore  is  to  be set up  by  the  Government

itself.  So  you  will  find  that  there  is   a

difference  between the Institute in  Malaya  and

the  Institute  that  is  to  be  established  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  in  reply  to the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan,  let me reiterate that  culture  is  a

living  thing  and  it grows  constantly.  As  an

example,  drama  as an element  in  our  national

culture  should be based on our national language

but  the  materials  used  in  our  drama  should

reflect  a  Malayan  society  comprising  Malays,

Chinese, Indians and others. Eastern elements  in

such  a drama could suitably go hand in hand with

Malay,  Chinese or Indian culture. For  instance,

what  materials should we use for art?  Art  also

requires a Malayan element. Mr Speaker, Sir, our

efforts  to unify the people should be  based  on

the   national  language.  That  is  the  primary

objective of the proposed Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of notice boards and street

names,  which  are  now in  English,  the  P.A.P.

Government  has definitely taken the  stand  that

these  will  be  replaced and written  in  Bahasa

Kebangsaan (the national language).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency's

recommendation for this Bill and I  beg  to  move,

"That this Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has two main purposes, firstly to

strengthen the law for the suppression  of  common

betting-houses,  betting  in  public  places   and

bookmaking,  and,  secondly, to enable  off-course

betting  on  racing to be conducted under  certain

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definitions of "access" and "common betting-house" have been amended to bring in persons who

carry on bookmaking activities by telephone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Bill like this, Mr Speaker, Sir, if we are

to  deal effectively with bookmaking, it would  be

necessary   for  us  to  introduce  a  number   of

presumptions and we have done so in this Bill.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.42 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 (3) of the Bill provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A place shall be deemed to be used for habitual

betting  or  wagering if betting  or  wagering  is

frequently  carried  on  therein,  notwithstanding

that  betting  or  wagering  is  not  the  primary

purpose for which such place is normally used."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (2) of the Bill provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any person who occupies or has the use

temporarily of a place which is kept  or  used  by

another person as a common betting-house shall  be

presumed  until  the contrary is  proved  to  have

permitted such place to be so kept or used."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 (1) of the Bill provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any person accepting or receiving bets, stakes

or  wagers  or found in possession of  any  books,

accounts,    documents,    telegrams,    writings,

circulars, cards or other articles



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



which  are  used or appear to have been  used  or

intended  to be used in connection with  or  which

relate  or appear to relate to the business  of  a

bookmaker shall be presumed until the contrary  is

proved to be acting as a bookmaker."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 (2) of the Bill provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any person who settles or pays money or money's

worth in respect of bets or wagers relating  to  a

horse-race or any other kind of race shall also be

presumed until the contrary is proved to be acting

as a bookmaker."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 of the Bill provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In all proceedings under this Ordinance any

evidence  given by a police officer not below  the

rank of Sergeant that any book, account, document,

telegram, writing, circular, card or other article

produced  before the court had been  used  or  was

intended  to  be  used  for betting  or  wagering,

shall, until the contrary is proved, he deemed  to

be sufficient evidence of the fact."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of punishment under the Ordinance, Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, has been increased. Thus, for

offences  relating  to common betting-houses,  the

punishment  has  been increased from  a  fine  not

exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a  term  not

exceeding  12  months,  to a  fine  not  exceeding

$20,000   or  to  imprisonment  for  a  term   not

exceeding  2  years  or  to  both  such  fine  and

imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill makes it an offence to

publish the results of any public lottery or horse

race,  but  the publication of the  results  of  a

horse-race   in  a  licensed  newspaper   is   not

affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill gives power to a police

officer to arrest on reasonable suspicion  and  to

search the person arrested where he believes that,

by delay in reporting, the offender may escape.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the increased powers which the

Government seeks in this Bill will help it to deal

more effectively with bookmaking and betting,  the

Government  has also taken a realistic  attitude,

and  has  taken  the view that  it  is  better  to

control bookmaking and betting where circumstances

are  such  as  to  make it impossible  for  it  to

suppress book-making and betting altogether. It is

therefore proposed to permit off-course betting on

racing under certain conditions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 of the Bill provides a means whereby an

approved  racing  club  or  association   may   be

exempted from all or any of the provisions of  the

Ordinance, thereby enabling such exempted club  or

association  to lawfully conduct or  promote  off-course  betting on racing and to admit members  of

the  public  to  its premises for the  purpose  of

betting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Minister for Labour and Law has stated that  there

are  two main purposes in his moving the Bill. The

first  is  to  strengthen the law against  illegal

betting and illegal bookmaking. The second  is  to

enable off-course betting to be held under certain

conditions.  Sir, we on this side are not  opposed

to  his  first purpose, although there are certain

defects  in  the  Bill to which my colleague,  the

Member  for  Farrer Park, will in due course  draw

the attention of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we read the Bill up to and including

clause  22  and the two Bills that are  to  follow

this  Bill,  we realise that the real  purpose  of

moving this and the following two Bills is not  so

much to suppress common betting-houses, betting in

public  places  and  bookmaking,  as  to  legalise

betting  shops  and  provide more  facilities  for

betting  and gambling under certain conditions  by

which  Government  will be able  to  increase  its

revenue.  There is nothing wrong - in  fact,  it  is

laudable

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- for the Government to look for ways and means to

increase revenue. But, Sir, there is a limit as to

what  sort  of means should be employed  to  raise

additional  revenue. The Minister for  Labour  and

Law  has been quoted by the Straits Times  in  its

issue of Thursday, 7th April, as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Byrne emphasised, 'We have no intention of

encouraging gambling in any way.'"



<br><br>Sir,  I  agree with him. I wish he had also  said,

"We  wish to discourage gambling." I wish  he  had

indicated  that  the desire of the  Government  is

that,  although it may not be possible to suppress

gambling completely, they would try their best to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



limit and to reduce gambling to the smallest scale

possible. But he went on, as if he had surrendered

to the situation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we must accept the fact that gambling is now

taking  place in Singapore on a large  scale,  and

much of the profits",

<br><br>you   will   notice,  Sir,  that  the   capitalist

mentality seems to be creeping in there -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"from this gambling goes into the pockets of

bookies and gambling racketeers. No income tax  is

ever paid on these profits."



<br><br>The Minister added:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is to be gambling on this large scale,

we  might as well take the opportunity to see that

the State gets its proper share of the revenue."



<br><br>Sir,  that  sort of reasoning is rather dangerous.

There is a lot of kidnapping going on. Since it is

impossible  to  stop  or prevent  kidnapping,  the

Minister   for  Labour  and  Law  is   practically

suggesting to his colleagues, "Say, you chaps.  We

cannot  stop  or prevent kidnapping. Huge  ransoms

are being paid to the kidnappers. The State may as

well  go  into  the business. Get  a  few  fellows

kidnapped,   and   then  we  can  get   additional

revenue."  Sir, it is dangerous to encourage  that

sort  of reasoning in the State. It is like saying

that  since  secret society activities  cannot  be

totally suppressed, the Government should organise

their   own  secret  society  for  the   sake   of

increasing  the  State  revenue.  I  am  sure  the

Minister would not do that, but there is a  danger

in  that  the  young people in  Singapore  may  be

encouraged  to reason along those lines.  A  wrong

thing  does  not become right just because  it  is

made  legal.  A bad egg remains bad, although  one

may paint it white, black, red, green, or yellow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, Sir, agree that we should not encourage

gambling. We should discourage it and limit it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is what we are doing!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> But I am afraid, Sir, the

purpose  of this Bill is not to do so.  It  is  to

expand gambling, and the main purpose behind it is

to   increase  the  revenue  of  the  State.  This

decision of Government has come as a shock to many

people.  Many  have praised Government  for  their

anti-vice drives. Their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



moves  to  close down juke boxes, certain  massage

parlours, and other methods of recreation regarded

as  yellow  culture,  although  perhaps  made  too

drastically, were commended by, I would  say,  the

majority  of  the people. But what will  they  say

when,  in place of the jukeboxes, they see betting

shops; when, instead of gambling on a small scale,

they see gambling on a big scale? That seems to be

a great come down from the lofty perch established

by  the  Minister  for  Home Affairs.  Instead  of

following the socialist line, they have  taken  to

the capitalist line and beyond.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, imagine in future, visitors to the State of

Singapore  looking around. They  see  coffee-shops

and  trading shops. They then come across  certain

shops and, not knowing what they are, they ask the

Singaporeans,  "What are those?" The  answer  they

get is, "Oh! Those are betting shops." Is this the

Government's new industry? Are we to see more  and

more, betting shops year by year? is Singapore  to

be  converted from the emporium of South-east Asia

to  the  gambling den of South-east  Asia?  Surely

this  is contrary to the declared policy laid down

by the People's Action Party in its Five-Year Plan

against immoral and yellow culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was a boy, about 42 years ago, my

father  talked  about a gambling  den  across  the

Straits of Johore. There was then no gambling  den

in Singapore. There had been gambling on the five-foot  ways during Chinese New Year, but  that  had

disappeared   too.  Now,  42  years  later,   this

Government has decided that we should go back,  to

the  most backward period of the colonial era, and

reintroduce   public  gambling   places.   It   is

regrettable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of raising State revenue by legalising

betting shops is not a new thing. Ever since 1947,

officials  in the Treasury have suggested  to  the

Government that an easy way of replacing the  lost

revenue  from  the Government opium  monopoly  was

this  way. Time and again the subject was  brought

up,  and Government at that time could have forced

the issue by using their official votes. But, Sir,

we must give credit where credit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



is  due. Although the Government at that time,  in

the   post-war  period,  had  the  majority,  they

listened   to  the  views  of  the  minority   and

restrained  their  hand. Betting  shops  were  not

legalised;  public lotteries were not  introduced.

And  so  the  old Government lost  the  chance  of

making   millions  of  dollars.  But  today   with

Singapore  in  the  hands  of  a  Party  which  is

supposed  to  make self-government a  success,  we

find  that in their desire to raise more  revenue,

they have decided to go back and reintroduce those

measures  which  are regarded  as  unworthy  of  a

Government and which have demoralising effects  on

the citizens of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are sorry that this Government, starting

with  high ideals, has been sorely tempted because

of  its  need  for  funds to  do  what  they  have

condemned.  During the debate on  the  Income  Tax

(Amendment)  Bill, they condemned the tax  evaders

for  doing something which is not quite right  for

the sake of profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Government to answer

five  questions. I hope the answers will be  given

without  any hurling of abuse. The first  question

is:  has  the  Government changed its  policy,  as

indicated by the Minister for Home Affairs, in its

campaign  against  vice  and  yellow  culture   in

Singapore? If a chap ji-ki promoter is caught,  he

is  imprisoned or banished. Those who  participate

or  help  the promoters are liable to  suffer  the

same  fate. But after these three Bills are passed

those  people who promote gambling on a big  scale

under   the  protection  of  this  Bill  will   be

honoured, because they can contribute a big  slice

to  the  State revenue. So, on the one  hand,  you

have  the  chap-ji-ki promoter and his  supporters

getting  a prison sentence or being banished,  and

on  the  other  hand, you have gambling  promoters

getting the kudos. If this kind of policy goes on,

the  Government will very soon introduce legalised

prostitution.  Later on they will reintroduce  the

Government opium monopoly because there  is  money

to  be  found  there. Sir, the Government  of  the

country  is  supposed to set  an  example  to  its

citizens as to what is right and wrong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the children in schools are told that they

should not gamble. When they gamble on the school

premises   or  even  outside,  the   police   are

informed. Now what are the teachers to say to the

children when these betting shops operate openly?

There  is  nothing in the Bill  to  suggest  that

there is going to be an age limit for a schoolboy

to place his bets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will be setting an unsavoury example

to  the  citizens, especially the young citizens.

Is this exchange worthwhile - $10 million extra for

the  public coffers, but the young manhood of the

nation is being spoilt?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, during the election campaign,

the Prime Minister warned public servants not  to

bet  outside  office hours, but he  also  implied

that  there  was too much betting  during  office

hours,  because  he  said that  the  phones  were

continually  engaged. Does he want  to  encourage

betting  to  the extent that people  who  are  in

Government   offices   regard   betting   as   an

honourable  game? If they get into  debt  because

they  participate in this new game introduced  by

the Government, are they liable to be sacked?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now ask the Minister for Labour and

Law  to  answer  the  second question?  Does  the

Government  truly  and  sincerely  believe   that

legalised  betting :shops should be encouraged  -

because  such  gambling  will  be  good  for  the

welfare of the people of Singapore? Sir, I have a

random  selection of quotations  from  the  local

Press. The Singapore Free Press of 24th February,

1960,  has  this to say on betting. Perhaps  they

said  it without knowing that the Government  was

about to introduce this Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Betting is a mug's game



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints by punters at the Bukit Timah amateur

meetings  when they got back only  $5  for  their

winning $5 tickets after backing the winner  just

prove again that betting is   a mug's game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty per cent of all the money going on to the

tote   disappears  in  Government  tax  and  club

commission before the horses start.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dividends are paid out to the nearest dollar below the actual dividend, all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



cents  from one to ninety-nine being broken money

and retained by the Club.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you bet long enough you lose all you start

with."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Government makes $10 million!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is one from the Sunday Times of January,

20th, 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coroner denounces gambling. It led to the death

of two."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Laughter] Sir, it is not a laughing matter,

because these two people were valued teachers  in

educational institutions, but because they became

enamoured of the craze for lottery tickets, there

was  a misunderstanding between two good friends,

and one was shot and the other committed suicide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one might say that even this additional

revenue is blood money. It is blood money because

it  led to the death of citizens who should  have

continued   to   live  and  contribute   valuable

services  to the country. Sir, now and  again  we

read  of people who are well educated members  of

the  Bar  and  who, I am sorry to say,  sometimes

were tempted because of this

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I would not mention names -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The one who has just got

suspended, I suppose!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> One was tempted and used the

client's  money.  A  former  clerk  was   tempted

because  he  fancied he would gain  $16,000.  His

fancy  did not come off, and he was sentenced  to

three  years' imprisonment. Another,  who  was  a

salesman, said that he punted on horses and  that

led  him  to misappropriate gold ornaments  worth

$12,000.  He pleaded guilty and was sentenced  to

13 months' imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what happens to many unlucky fellows who

become enamoured of the idea that they could make

money  out of betting. There are only two parties

who are sure of making money on betting, and they

are the organised and the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the face of these misfortunes, can the

Government  maintain that the provision  of  more

betting  facilities  and more  opportunities  for

gambling  would be for the good of the people  of

Singapore?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is this. Does the Government

regard  betting shops as a good socialist  method

of  raising  money  for the State?  The  People's

Action  Party  claims to be  a  democratic,  non-communist,  socialist party. Is it  socialist  to

resort  to  a  means of raising revenue  for  the

State  whereby those who are poorest are made  to

contribute  the  most  in  proportion  to   their

income?  This  is an indirect way of  taxing  the

people,  so  that more money come from  the  poor

than from those who can afford it. The rich go to

the races; they buy lottery tickets, and they bet

for  fun. If they lose, they can stand it. It  is

nothing  to  them. They know that the chances  of

winning are very meagre. But the poor are tempted

because  of their poverty, forgetting that  their

chances of winning are meagre. They bet, and they

bet  more heavily than they can afford to,  which

means  that many will lose money that could  have

been better spent on food for their children  and

on  clothes.  Of course, it could  be  said  that

these  poor people should not bet. If they cannot

afford  it,  they should not bet. It  is  like  a

fisherman who dangles a tempting bait to the fish

and  he  says to the half-starved fish,  "Do  not

take  the  bait. Let the fat ones take it."  Sir,

that  is  against human nature. The fat ones  are

not  likely to take the bait. But the hungry will

do it. And the poor in Singapore will be the ones

most tempted to take the bait and most tempted to

lose money on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thought that this Government, when it

came  to  deciding  between  the  temptation   of

getting  more  money and losing  its  conscience,

would be prepared to lose the money and keep  its

conscience.  Apparently  it  is  just  like   any

capitalist government. It is worse than the post-war  Government which resisted the temptation for

the sake of the people of Singapore. One argument

is  this: if  it could be done in Australia  and

certain  other  countries, why cannot  we  do  it

here?  They  forget  that in  Australia  and  New

Zealand  the standard of living is so  high  that

every  worker  could afford to lose  some  money.

Here the standard of living is not that high  and

yet, with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



increased unemployment, the Government say to the

unemployed, "Come along. Even with your dole  you

can give a portion back to the State."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fourth question is this. Does the

Government  honestly believe that  betting  shops

will  reduce rather than stimulate more  gambling

in  Singapore?  The argument is that,  by  having

these betting shops, business would be taken away

from  the  illegal bookmakers and from those  who

take  part in chap-ji-ki gambling. Those who like

chap-ji-ki will continue to gamble on the chap-ji-

ki. Those who like football will continue to play

and watch football. It is not going to be easy to

say to them, "We give you this new game; give  up

the  old  game. We give you the legalised betting

shops; give up the chap-ji-ki" it is not so easy.

So  the result would be that, in addition to  all

these  old  gambling faci1ities which  have  been

regarded as illegal, there will be  these  new

facilities provided by the Government as a result

of  the  legalisation of betting shops  and  more

sweepstakes  and lotteries. If  there  is  to  be

gambling on this scale, we might as well take the

opportunity to see that the State gets its proper

share   of   revenue.   Its   proper   share   of

revenue - that seems to be the chief  aim  of  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth question. Will legalised betting shops

mean  less  crime  in  Singapore?  The  Singapore

Police officers have consistently maintained that

more  gambling  means  more crime.  More  betting

shops and more gambling facilities will mean more

crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Party in power contested the last

elections,  it did not say that it was  going  to

introduce  more gambling. In fact, the impression

created  was  that  if this Party  was  put  into

power,  it  would never resort to  anything  that

would be regarded as vice or yellow culture. Many

voted  for  this Party because they said,  "Well,

this Party will be more honest and cleaner, etc.,

etc."  I am sorry to say that this is a big come-

down for the Party in power. This Bill will cause

the  Party  to lose the respect that some  people

had for them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



For  the  sake of more revenue, it is  willing  to

give  up its old policy, its anti-vice drive,  its

closure  of juke box shops. They are now finished.

It  is a new policy. Vice is dishonourable when it

is  not legal. But vice becomes honourable when it

pays its contributions to the State coffers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that Government has got the votes to

push  this Bill through, but is it really  earnest

about  the Will of the people? May I suggest  that

the  Government do one thing? Let there  be  a  re

ferendum.  Let  the  Government  ask  the   people

whether they wish this Government to have more and

more gambling in order to raise more revenue. Some

will  vote for it. But if the people think of  and

care  enough for their children, they will  prefer

to  lose the $10 million extra revenue and let the

Government find it in some other way, rather  than

have  this Bill passed and have harm done  to  the

character  of the young citizens. Some  will  say,

"Why should there be all these moral scruples?"  A

man  is  honest because he has moral  scruples.  A

Government is honest and it acts honestly  because

it has moral scruples. If we are to throw away our

moral scruples for the sake of more revenue,  what

sort  of policy are we going to introduce for this

country? I am sorry, Sir, the respect which I  had

for  certain policies and measures of  the  P.A.P.

Government has received a great shock.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, before I start speaking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



on   this  Bill,  please  permit  me  to  make   a

confession  in just one sentence. As  a  woman,  I

cannot  help taking a secret delight in  the  fact

that  my  choice of dress and my taste in  costume

jewellery  (which - for  the  information   of   the

Members - costs  me next to nothing) have  attracted

the   attention   of   two   Ministers   and   one

Assemblyman!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Bill, Sir - when I read this Bill, f

wondered  whether it was a case of good intentions

foiled  by  a faulty method of implementation,  or

whether it was a case of an ulterior motive hidden

behind pseudo-good intentions.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Lady comes

straight up against the Standing Order which says -

speaking  from  memory - that  a  Member  must  not

impute  an improper motive to another Member,  and

"ulterior   motive   hidden   behind   pseudo-good

intentions",   I   suppose,  must   be   improper.

Therefore, I think the hon. Lady ought to withdraw

that expression.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I beg to withdraw it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, is intituled "An Ordinance to

suppress common betting-houses, betting in  public

places . . .". But it ends up with an explanation,

which reads:



"...thereby enabling such exempted club or

association to-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) lawfully conduct or promote off course

betting on racing in Singapore and elsewhere; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) admit members of the public to its premises

for the purpose of betting and allow members of

the public to take part in betting."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no matter how much one stretches one's

imagination, it is difficult to reconcile  oneself

with the conflict that goes on. It is difficult to

think of this Bill, which legalises the conducting

and   promotion  of  more  betting  places,  which

creates   more   opportunities  for   betting   by

legalising betting on races run outside  Singapore

as well as in Singapore, and which makes it easier

for  more  people to indulge in betting in  public

places, as an Ordinance to suppress common betting-houses and betting in public places. This, Sir, is

a classic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



example  of  Government's  inconsistency.  May   I

mention  in passing, Sir, that only last month  we

had the "Monogamous Marriage" Bill which legalises

all  pre 2nd of March polygamous marriages! On the

one  hand, Government goes all out to get  rid  of

vice,  but  on  the other hand their  Party  paper

advocates the legalising of prostitutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the public are confused by

Government's - shall  I borrow  the  phrase  of  the

Minister  for Finance? - "rushing from  gimmick  to

gimmick to dazzle the public". They feel that  the

inconsistencies and contradictions  in  Government

Bills and policies are just an attempt to lead the

public  up  the  wrong path. The  Government  have

always  boasted that they have the  confidence  of

the  people,  but these inconsistencies  in  their

Bills   and   policies  will   soon   shake   this

confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Government is not unaware that many

people  have become victims of moneylenders  as  a

result  of  betting, even when betting  in  public

places is an offence. Now they will get themselves

more deeply into debt, especially when they can go

boldly - and  within  the  law - to  a  betting  shop,

perhaps a few yards from wherever they may be,  to

place  their  bets legally. One needs  no  crystal

ball,   Sir,   to   foresee   office-workers   and

Government  servants  getting  themselves  heavily

indebted  and  getting the sack  eventually,  thus

creating valuable vacancies which can be filled by

men whom Government think are more worthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nobody can deny that betting has brought

about  the  downfall of many an office-worker  and

has  brought  much misery and unhappiness  to  the

home  and the family. I therefore cannot  see  the

sense of introducing a Bill, which, in effect, has

every possibility of bringing more misery and more

unhappiness  to more homes and more families.  The

argument  put  forward  that  because  we   cannot

control betting we must therefore legalise it does

not hold water, Sir. The youth of this country are

attracted  towards joining secret societies.  What

did  Government do? Government did  not  recognise

secret  societies. I must compliment the  Minister

for Labour and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



Law  because  he organized, promoted and  expanded

youth   clubs,  community  activities,   etc, to

distract  these  young people from joining  secret

societies.  He does not condone the  existence  of

these secret societies by legalising them. I think

the same thing should be done here. Something must

be  done  and  Government  must  surely  have  the

ability  to  think of ways and means  to  suppress

betting without legalising it, without the risk of

getting more people to go and bet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not so very long ago, at a time when the

Government  servants were crying out  against  the

slash in salaries and were complaining that it was

causing  them hardship, the Government  vigorously

protested that they were short of funds and  could

not  help it. You will remember that there  was  a

suggestion that the Government should run a  State

lottery.  At  that time, the Government  indicated

that  they  were against the idea of  running  the

State with revenue obtained from gambling. What is

happening   today,   Sir?   The   Government    is

introducing a Bill which cannot be of any  use  to

anybody except to raise its revenue. The rich  who

can afford to bet will still go to the racecourse.

The  poor masses who cannot afford to go there  to

bet will be plunging themselves and their families

into  disaster  if  they  frequent  these  betting

shops. For whom are these betting shops? The  rich

will  not use them. The poor people will use  them

to their own detriment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What crowns Satan with victory, Sir, is the fact

that  there is no provision in this Bill  to  stop

school  children from making use  of  the  betting

shops. Probably Government have something in  mind

to  do  something about it later on, but according

to what we read in the Bill, there is no provision

to indicate the age qualification of those who are

permitted  to enter these betting shops and  place

their bets. Clause 22 (3) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shall be lawful ... to admit members of the

public to its premises ...".



<br><br>Sir,  school children and students are members  of

the  public,  are  they not? If  their  lives  and

future  are ruined, the sins will be on the  heads

of all those who support this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is it worth the while raising revenue at the

price  of  destroying the peace and  happiness  of

homes?  Those  who  cannot afford  to  go  to  the

racecourse  are invariably the people  who  cannot

afford  to  bet  without putting  themselves  into

trouble and getting themselves into debt. Then why

in  the name of common sense tempt them with these

facilities  of  more  betting  houses  mushrooming

everywhere  for them to place their  bets  legally

without  any risk and inconvenience? If there  are

any  here  who hail this Bill because it makes  it

legal  and convenient for them to spend their  pay

packets  on  betting, let them bear in mind,  Sir,

that they are courting their own downfall and  are

preparing  to  hand over their jobs  on  a  silver

platter to their rivals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, is based on the Betting

Ordinance, the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance  and

the  Federation of Malaya Betting Ordinance, 1953.

According  to  the  Comparative Table,  there  are

eight new clauses. Clause 22 is one of them,  Sir,

and  it legalises betting houses for the rich  and

the  poor,  the young and the old, to place  their

bets.  Clauses 8, 13 and 15, I am afraid, tend  to

deprive   the   people  of  their  civil   rights.

Singapore citizens have always been proud  of  the

administration of justice by its Courts in that  a

man  is  innocent  until he is  tried  and  proved

guilty.  These  three clauses,  Sir,  make  people

guilty before their trial, and the onus is on them

to  prove  the contrary. Sir, clause  8  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any person accepting a -"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Lady is going into

the  details  of the clauses, I suggest  that  the

proper place to do so is in Committee. We are  now

dealing with the general principle of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Surely, Sir, this Bill has

been introduced to enable the Police to catch  and

prosecute  the  guilty,  not  to  incriminate  the

innocent. To make people guilty before their trial

and  until they prove the contrary is against  all

principles of natural rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some clauses of this Bill defeat the aim of

the  Bill  itself. As I have mentioned  before,  a

Bill  intituled  "An Ordinance to suppress  common

betting-houses,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



betting in public places . . ." should, to say the

least, make an attempt to reduce the conducting of

betting  places and the promotion  of  betting  in

public  places; and not, as is the case with  this

Bill,  increase,  promote  and  legalise  betting-

houses   and   betting  in  public   places.   The

government of any State, Sir, has always been  and

is  still  looked upon as the father of the  State

and her people. Which father, Sir, would encourage

his  children to gamble or to bet, especially when

he knows that the children cannot afford to gamble

without  destroying himself and his family?  Which

father  would  do  it? Perhaps a cruel  stepfather

might!   Now,   which  father  does   the   P.A.P.

Government claim to be? A father to the  State  of

Singapore and her people, or the cruel step-father?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not

often that the Opposition have had the opportunity

to  bask  in the glow of superior virtue.  But  we

quite  expect that in the course of the debate  on

this  Bill  they  will try to make the  Government

look  as  if they are encouraging what  they  term

"vice". We also have seen, in the instances of the

two Opposition Members who have spoken against the

Bill,  much  sanctimonious wringing of hands  over

the  poor,  the  weak and the  foolish,  who  ruin

themselves through gambling. But before I  attempt

to  rebut  their  arguments, may I  first  make  a

disclaimer?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Tanglin was holding forth at

his   usual  hilarious  best  on  this  Bill,   he

repeatedly made the point that the Government  was

moved  by  financial considerations to  pass  this

Bill;  that is, it is the demands of revenue  that

have  made them agree to allow off-course  betting

under  certain  conditions. Now, I hasten  to  add

that  I  am not the villain of the piece, nor  are

fiscal considerations the over-riding or even  the

important  ones in this issue. The  Government  of

today - and indeed the Government under the previous

administration - has  to choose  between  two  alter

natives. The first is to allow off-course  betting

under    well-controlled,    properly    regulated

conditions;   the   other  is  to   pretend   that

bookmakers do not exist, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



that  the vicious atmosphere in which the  illegal

bookmaker   operates  together  with   the   whole

apparatus  of  secret society gangsters  does  not

exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we of the P.A.P. are, above all, realists.

We  do not pretend that given the imperfections of

human  nature  as they now exist  in  our  present

society,  we shall be able to suppress  completely

gambling  in  all its forms. The only  alternative

then  is  to see that such an activity carries  on

under  controlled  and well regulated  conditions.

That is the purpose of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin expressed great admiration

for  the  previous administrations  for  resisting

repeatedly  the  temptation  to  allow  off-course

betting. But he did not draw attention to the fact

that this policy was completely futile because off-course betting was in any case taking place to the

detriment  not  only of persons who  were  foolish

enough to patronise these institutions but also to

the  loss  of  public revenue.  No  one  tries  to

pretend   that   gambling  is  not   foolish   and

irrational  behaviour. But in a free society,  you

cannot  completely eradicate these  manifestations

of  a very natural instinct, as gambling is, among

the  people,  especially in a commercial  entrepot

like Singapore. If you are to aim at the ideal and

try  to eradicate gambling in all its forms,  then

you  will merely reduce the administration of  the

law  to  ridicule and contempt. We  are  therefore

taking  the  courageous  stand  of  admitting  the

imperfections of human nature, and try to make the

best of a bad job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to end on a light-hearted tone. The

Member  for  Tanglin,  in the  last  part  of  his

speech,  declared  himself to be  disappointed  at

this  move  of  the Government. He said  that  his

previous  high regard for our sense of  dedication

and high sense of purpose received a shock. I have

always  suspected that the Member for Tanglin  has

been  a  secret admirer of the P.A.P. but I  would

not  try to raise his hopes by saying that he  has

any chance of being admitted into our circle!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> No desire!

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not know about that. The

Member  for  Tanglin has been  a  member  of  many

political parties in the past, and I have no doubt

that if given half a chance he would ask us for an

application  form! If he feels so  strongly  about

this  issue, he will have one consolation - that  in

his  capacity as one of the leaders of  the  Moral

Rearmament   movement,   he   will    have    more

opportunities    for   the   exercise    of    his

proselytizing  zeal.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been quite

noticeable  for some time now that the Member  for

Tanglin   has  moved  so  often  in  the  rarefied

atmosphere  of moral rearmament that he  tends  to

get out of touch with reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I stated in my speech on the

Second Reading of this Bill that the main purposes

of  this Bill are, firstly, to strengthen the  law

for  the  suppression  of  common  betting-houses,

betting  in  public  places and  bookmaking,  and,

secondly,  to enable off-course betting on  racing

to  be  conducted under certain conditions. I  did

not  hide anything. That was our objective. I also

made  it clear that although the increased  powers

which  the  government sought in this  Bill  would

help  it to deal more effectively with bookmaking

and   betting,  we  had  also  taken  a  realistic

attitude, and had taken the view that it is better

to    control   bookmaking   and   betting   where

circumstances  are such as to make  it  impossible

for   us   to  suppress  bookmaking  and   betting

altogether.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not in any way changed

from  our  socialist principles. We stand  on  the

principle that gambling is a social evil.  We  are

also  honest and we recognise the fact that  there

is gambling on a large scale in our State. We have

taken  great  pains to bring this situation  under

control.  About ten months ago, below  the  office

where  I  used  to work, I remember quite  clearly

there  was  a coffee shop. The public  went  there

every  day.  They were placing bets quite  openly.

They  could place any bet they wanted on any  race

meeting,  whether  the race meeting  was  hold  in

Singapore  or in the Federation of Malaya.  A  few

steps  along the same road, there was  a  gambling

parlour - juke boxes,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



pretty  girls - and everybody was tempted to go  in.

That  was  the situation, and everyone knew  about

it.  These are facts. It is not the little  people

who  place bets and so on who are really the evil

doers.  The evil doers are the people who organise

all  these things and get a profit out of it. They

organise it, and they give you a discount  on  it.

They  make  their  money on it. They  exploit  the

situation,  and work it for a profit motive.  They

keep those profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, suppose we carry out our

socialistic    principles   to    their    logical

conclusion. We hound the bookmakers. We  logically

put  the Turf Club out of action. Well, they  will

go  across  the  causeway  and  start  a  gambling

paradise  there.  We will then  get  back  to  the

situation which the Member for Tanglin referred to

42  years ago, when his father could go across the

causeway  to  take  part  in  gambling.   We   are

realists. We know that that is the position and we

have got to face it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin has said

that  we  are now trying to reintroduce conditions

similar to those existing during the time  of  his

father.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, clause 22,  sub-clause

(1) of this Bill has been on our statute book from

1929,  when  the Member for Tanglin was  11  years

old. By virtue of the exemption provisions in this

sub-clause,  it  is possible for  gambling  to  be

restricted   to  the  subscribing  and   associate

members  of  a  particular racing  association  in

Singapore.  Does he really honestly  believe  that

the  tickets on sweepstakes organised by the  Turf

Club  are  not,  in fact, being sold  outside  its

membership to the people of Singapore? You can buy

the  tickets  if you want to. You need  not  be  a

member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that is the situation, and we

think  it  is  better  to  acknowledge  that  that

situation  exists and try to place gambling  under

proper  control.  We can do it  by  extending  the

provisions of clause 22 (1) . Everybody knows  that

any  member of the public can go to the Turf  Club

and  take part in punting if he so desires.  There

is such a membership as the subscribing membership

and it is known that subscribing members transfer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



their badges to one another. It is quite easy  for

any  member of the public to go to the race course

if  he  wants  to.  So let us not be  hypocritical

about  these things. Let us acknowledge the facts.

If   we  do  that,  we  can  reconcile  these  two

apparently conflicting objectives. In this Bill we

are  taking determined steps to put the bookmakers

out  of action. We mean everything we say. We have

introduced  very hard presumptions.  Why  have  we

done  it?  It  is because it is very difficult  to

detect  and bring the bookmakers to book for  what

they  do.  That is why we have to depend on  these

presumptions. The Member for Mountbatten has  said

that  we  are seeking to change the  law  and  to

alter our liberal tradition by making persons  who

are    innocent   guilty.   These   are   ordinary

presumptions which, we have to introduce if we are

to  mean what we say. I have mentioned that in the

speech  I  made  earlier  on.  I  have  drawn  the

attention of the House to these presumptions. They

are  hard  presumptions. They are intended  to  be

hard  presumptions so that we can deal  with  this

situation effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also pointed out that it is our intention

to  raise  the penalties for this type of offence,

and we have so proposed in this Bill. It is no use

people  blinking facts and charging  us  with  all

sorts of things, accusing us of inconsistency  and

saying  that  we  are jettisoning our  principles.

They do not believe the things that they say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has referred to our

monogamous marriage Bill. She said, "Look  at  it.

This Bill which seeks to introduce monogamy is the

same  Bill which legalises prostitution.  What  is

all  this  about?" Mr Speaker, Sir,  on  the  3rd

March,  when this Bill was introduced. I  remember

meeting  the Member for Mountbatten in the Hokkien

Huay  Kuan.  The women of Singapore had  called  a

public  meeting  to express their  views  on  this

Bill.  I  remember the Member for Mountbatten  was

there and she asked permission from the ladies  to

speak.  She went on to the platform. I was curious

to  hear the things she would say about this Bill.

She  welcomed,  it  and said:  "Dear  sisters,  in

Singapore  we have now come to the position  where

at last we women have got



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



our  freedom." She spoke for three-quarters of  an

hour, and I clapped her. For I then believed  that

a great change had come over her. But when I heard

her later in the House, I was so stupefied that  I

even forgot to remind her of what she had said  at

the  Hokkien  Huay  Kuan a few weeks  before.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we are not that sort of people.  We

are not chameleons. We do not change our colours.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is a direct reference to

a  Member  of  this  House. To  call  a  Member  a

chameleon is unparliamentary. Perhaps the Minister

would like to withdraw that word.



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I realise I was getting

very near to the rocks and the shoals.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister withdraw?



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I do withdraw, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  all  things  we  have got to  be  honest  with

ourselves  first. We must understand the situation

in which we find ourselves. We cannot blink facts.

We must not try to distort facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin was in his element just

now   when   he   talked  of  the   exploits   and

achievements of the past Government with which  he

was so closely associated. Mr Speaker, Sir, if he

was  a  realist,  and if he really understood  the

social  position, he would have  agreed  that  the

best  way to deal with the situation would be  not

to  blink facts but to accept the position as  one

finds  it  and try to resolve the difficulties  as

best one can. And that is what we have proposed in

this Bill. That is the solution we offer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there was the charge made

against   us   that   we   were   increasing   the

opportunities for betting; that we might have good

intentions  but  that those good  intentions  were

foiled by faulty methods of implementation.  That

we  might, after all, have ulterior motives behind

these  pseudo-good  intentions.  Is  that  a  fair

charge to make? Does this Bill really and honestly

encourage  gambling and increase the opportunities

for betting? If it did, we would not have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



introduced those presumptions. Why did we?  It  is

because we are realists, we really intend to  deal

with the situation and with those who make profits

out   of  gambling  and  keep  those  profits  for

themselves,   that   we  have   introduced   these

measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was also pointed out that

there  is  nothing  in  this legislation  to  stop

students  and school children from going  to  the

betting  shops. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do  not  think

the Members who made that charge really understood

the  provisions of clause 22. It is clearly stated

in that clause that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Yang di-Pertuan Negara may by notification in

the  Gazette,  either generally or  in  particular

cases, exempt from all or any of the provisions of

this  Ordinance  the members and officers  of  any

racing  club  or  association in  respect  of  any

totalisator  or pari-mutuel betting or  any  other

system or method of cash or credit betting...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the organisation that is

exempted under the provisions of this clause would

be exempted under conditions, and it would be well

within   the  organisation's  power  to   restrict

children and school children from entry into  such

premises.    They   could   easily   make    those

restrictions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out that

under  clause 22 (3) of the Bill we have  provided

that  all  bets  received must be  placed  on  the

totalisator.  We have provided that  it  would  be

unlawful for any such organisation to run its  own

private  book.  That is the protection,  which  we

have  sought, and that is the safeguard, which  we

have entered in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that earlier on the

Member  for Tanglin referred at length to  various

newspapers on the evils of gambling and so on.  As

luck would have it, I was also referred today to a

newspaper  report.  This  report  appears  in  the

Singapore  Free Press of Thursday, 12th May.  What

does the report say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Off-Course Betting In Britain by July



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London, Thurs.-The House of Commons lust night

passed  a Government Bill to legalise cash betting

on  horse races in betting shops to be set up  all

over the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voting was 211 to 42 - a Government majority of 169.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, expected to become law by the end of

July, now goes to the House of Lords."



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, probably there  are  people

elsewhere  in  the  world who  are  realists  like

ourselves.  They  look at a particular  situation,

they see it to be what it is, and they are willing

to  move with the times. But there are some people

who  are  so bound up with the colonial  tradition

that they can only think in terms of that colonial

tradition. They believe that a person who is  part

and parcel of that system can do a thing only in a

certain  way  and believe it to be right  for  all

time.  Now  we are not like that. We do  not  have

those mental blinkers. We see the situation as  it

is  and  we are determined to find a solution  for

the difficulties that we meet. That is why we have

proposed this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been challenged to answer five questions.

The   first  question  is:  Have  we  changed  our

policies  as  announced by the Minister  for  Home

Affairs against vice and yellow culture? I say  we

have  not  changed  our  policies.  We  are  still

against vice and yellow culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Government truly and sincerely believe

that  legalized  betting shops should  be  set  up

because gambling would be for the welfare  of  the

people  of Singapore? The answer is that  gambling

is  a social evil. There are people who still want

to  gamble,  whatever you do, Even in co-operative

organisations  you will find that  situation.  You

will  find  the  thrifty  lending  money  to   the

improvident. Now, most of the improvident have got

very   firm   contacts  with   moneylenders.   But

nevertheless  that  sort of  thing  goes  on.  The

provident earn dividends from that situation. That

is  how  the  co-operative  and  thrift  and  loan

societies run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 3 was: Does the Government regard

betting  shops  as a good source of raising  money

for the State? We have never wanted to raise money

by  this method. We have said that there are  many

people making money out of bookmaking and keeping

that money,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



running  these  rackets for  their  own  purposes,

giving discounts, giving credits and earning -huge

profits. Now we say that we want to put all end to

that,  to  stop  them from doing it.  We  will  so

reorganise  it that this money will  come  to  the

Government.  But we do not do this  primarily  for

the,  reason that we want this money. If they take

those pro, fits in that way, it is but right  that

they should be stopped from doing so: that we,  as

the  Government,  should avail ourselves  of  that

money.   Question  No.  4.  Does  the   Government

honestly  believe that betting shops  will  reduce

rather than stimulate gambling? I do not think you

can make the situation worse than it is today.  It

is on a very large scale. It is already stimulated

out of all proportions and the only thing to do is

to keep it under control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 5. Will these legalized betting

shops  mean  less  crime  in  Singapore?  I  would

venture  a  guess, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  if  we

bring this situation under proper control, we will

be  able to reduce the incidence of crime.  It  is

well   known  that  many  bookmakers   are   given

protection  by  secret societies.  They  carry  on

these operations with the protection received.  If

all  this is brought under proper control, I could

say that we would be able to reduce crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say that we have

good  intentions, we have no ulterior  motives  in

introducing this legislation, and we do  not  ever

try  to conceal ulterior motives under pseudo-good

intentions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this clause seeks to

provide:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any person who announces or publishes or causes

to  be announced or published, either orally or by

means  of  any print, writing, sign or  otherwise,

the  result  of  any public lottery or  horse-race

shall  be guilty of an offence and shall be liable

on conviction to a fine not exceeding two thousand

dollars:".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my understanding of the words,

"announces  or publishes" is this: if  one  person

mentions  by  word of mouth or  in  writing  to  a

second person, then that is announcing or publish.

ing within the meaning of the clause. So that this

position  could easily arise. I go  to  the  Bukit

Timah  Race Course. Having lost all my money after

the third race, I retire and come back. On the way

I  meet Mr X, who is anxiously awaiting a bus  to

get  to the Turf Club. He says, "Hey, what is  the

matter with you? Why are you back so early?" I say

"Well,  I lost my Bets on the first three  races.

Such  and such a horse won the first race.  I  did

not  back it. Such and such a horse won the second

race. I did not back it. Such and such a horse won

the  third  race. I did not back  it."  That,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, is announcing or publishing  within

the meaning of this clause, as I see it. Is it the

intention  of  the Government that such  a  person

should be guilty of an offence and shall be liable

on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to make is on the

proviso, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided however that this section shall not

apply to anything published or forming part of any

announcement  in  any newspaper  relating  to  any

horse-race or the result thereof if such newspaper

has  been printed or published under a licence  in

that  behalf  duly issued in accordance  with  the

provisions of the Printing Presses Ordinance.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means, I take it, Mr Speaker, that the

right to publish or announce, as prohibited in the

main  clause,  is only available to any  newspaper

and  that  only  to any horse-race or  the  result

thereof.  Although the main clause talks  about  a

public lottery, the proviso does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



not  say  anything about it. The subsequent  Bills

which  will  come up before the House will  enable

public   lotteries  to  be  run.  So,   does   the

Government    then   intend   this   position - that

newspapers can only publish the results of  horse-races  but  they may not publish the winner  of  a

lottery ticket?



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the intention is to

prohibit  oral  communication of  the  results  of

horse-races. Mr Speaker, Sir, it has  been  found

that  when  the  Turf  Club recently  removed  all

facilities  with regard to public  telephones  and

when  the  Rediffision broadcasts  of  races  were

stopped,  there  were  teams  of  people   running

between  the  Turf  Club and  neighbouring  coffee

shops  and  communicating the  racing  results  to

interested   persons.  It  is  the  intention   to

prohibit  that sort of thing in this  clause.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, there are precedents  for  this.  I

would  refer the Member for Farrer Park to section

4  (f)  of  the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance.  I

will read the section to him:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any person who -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) writes, prints or publishes or causes to be

written,  printed or published any lottery  ticket

or  list  of  prizes  or any announcement  of  the

result  of  a  public lottery or any  announcement

relating to a public lottery;...



<br><br>shall be liable  to

a  fine not exceeding six thousand dollars  or  to

imprisonment for a term which may extend to  three

years.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his second submission with regard to the

proviso,  I  think the intention is  to  permit  a

licensed  newspaper  to make these  announcements,

Sir,It will be necessary, I think, to include  in

this  proviso reference to a public lottery.  "The

result  of  any  public lottery or horse-race"  is

contained  in  clause 6. But for  some  reason  or

other,  the  reference  to  "public  lottery"  was

inadvertently omitted in the proviso. The  proviso

should really read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...any news paper relating to the result of any

public lottery or horse-race".



<br><br>using the same words in the main clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any newspaper relating to the result of any

public lottery or horse-race".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that we refer to

the relevant Standing Orders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly, of course, the procedure is that when

the  Chair  calls a clause, that is the time  when

amendments ought to be proposed. Thereafter,  when

the  Question is proposed, "That the clause  stand

part of the Bill", the debate can only be on  the

principle of the clause itself. No amendments  can

be  proposed. Any amendments that are  thought  of

can  only be made by way of recommittal.  But,  of

course,  if  there is no dissentient voice,  there

can  always be a suspension of Standing Orders  to

enable  the  Minister to move  his  amendment.  Is

there  any  dissentient  voice?  There  being   no

dissentient voice, will the Minister please  move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 6, as amended,

stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the

Minister for Labour and Law said that there  is  a

precedent for this particular clause and he quoted

a  section from the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance

relating  to  public lotteries. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that  particular  section  in  the  Common  Gaming

Houses  Ordinance  relates  to  public  lotteries,

which  are  illegal.  Public  lotteries  were  not

possible  in the Colony, but now, as a  result  of

the various amendments to this Bill and to the two

subsequent Bills, public lotteries, provided  they

are  conducted in a particular manner, will  cease

to be illegal. Therefore the publication can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



take  place.  I appreciate the motives  which  have

impelled the Minister to frame the clause,  but  in

framing it, the scope of the clause is so wide that

it has taken in the case of the man - as I cited -  who

went  to the race-course to bet, came out when  the

race  meeting  had gone halfway, and  said  to  his

friend,  "My  horses did not come  in.  Some  other

horses came in," and he mentioned the names of  the

horses. It seems to me that he is certainly  guilty

under  this  clause, because he has  announced  the

results of a horse-race. If the Minister gives  the

assurance that it is not the intention to prosecute

such  a person and the Police have instructions  to

that effect, then I think it would meet the case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, surely it must be

presumed that the Government acts reasonably in

these matters.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I understood that the Member for

Mountbatten wished to say a few words on clause 8.

This is the time to say them.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I believe that the

clause has been framed with this in mind,; that the

person  charged  is guilty. Let us take  the  other

side  of  the picture. Supposing the person charged

is  not  guilty.  There are many a  book,  many  an

account,  a document, telegram, writing,  circular,

card  or  other article which may easily appear  to

have been used or intended to be used in connection

with  or  which relate or appear to relate  to  the

business  of  a  bookmaker, and the person  may  be

entirely  innocent. What then if the  law  presumes

that  he is guilty? There are sometimes cases, Sir,

when  it  is  difficult to prove yourself  innocent

although  you  are innocent. What happens  in  that

case?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is an ordinary legal presumption,

presumption  arises. It does not mean to  say  that

the  person  is  guilty, but until  he  proves  the

contrary  he  would be deemed to  be  acting  as  a

bookmaker. These are ordinary presumptions of  law,

Mr Speaker, Sir,I do not wish to take up the time

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 15 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this clause is

borrowed from section 37 (i) of the Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance (Chapter 137). This particular clause 15

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In all proceedings under this Ordinance any

evidence  given by a police officer not  below  the

rank  of Sergeant that any book, account, document,

telegram, writing, circular, card or other  article

produced  before  the court had been  used  or  was

intended to be used for betting or wagering, shall,

until  the  contrary is proved,  be  deemed  to  be

sufficient evidence of the fact."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that this clause has been inspired by

section  37  (i) of the Dangerous Drugs  Ordinance.

That  section  in  the  Dangerous  Drugs  Ordinance

relates  to  opium  pipes, opium utensils,  smoking

lamps,  opium rags, etc, which, on the face of  it,

quite obviously can only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



be  used for smoking opium. The question on  which

the   presumption  will  arise  is  whether  these

articles  were,  in fact, used in that  particular

case for smoking opium. But the presumption arises

by the very nature of the articles, which can only

be  used for smoking opium. Here, Mr Speaker, the

position  to  my  mind  is quite  different.  This

police  officer  not below the  rank  of  Sergeant

brings   along   any   book,  account,   document,

telegram,   writing,  circular,  card   or   other

article, produces them in Court and says that they

were  intended to be used for betting or wagering.

And  the  presumption shall arise. Now, a book  by

its  very  nature  can be used for  all  sorts  of

purposes.  Similarly, an account,  a  document,  a

telegram, a piece of writing, a circular, a  card,

or  any  other  article.  While  appreciating  the

elusiveness  of the bookmaker and the  anxiety  of

the  Minister to bring him down in a legal tackle,

I  feel, Mr Speaker, Sir that, the presumption is

so  wide in its scope and its nature that it could

very  easily be refuted. I think a presumption  of

this  nature  will not cause the  person,  against

whom  the  presumption arises, any  difficulty  in

rebutting it.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would refer the

Member for Farrer Park to a more recent precedent.

It  was not long ago that the Common Gaming Houses

Ordinance  was  amended in  this  House.  On  that

occasion, Mr Speaker, Sir, there was an amendment

to section 9, which is very much on similar lines.

If  I  may  read  this to the  Member  for  Farrer

Park - the amendment reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where evidence is given by a police officer not

below  the  rank  of  Sergeant that  any  document

produced  before the court is a lottery ticket  of

any  public  lottery or is an account, memorandum,

or  record  of stakes or wagers in or relating  to

any  public lottery, the court shall presume  that

such  document is a lottery ticket of such  public

lottery  or  an account, memorandum or  record  of

stakes  or  wagers in or relating to  such  public

lottery, as the case may be."



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, I have got the Hansard report on

my   Second  Reading  speech  in  regard  to  that

amendment Bill, and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



remember that I pointed out to the House then that

by this clause the Court is required to accept the

evidence of a police officer not below the rank of

Sergeant, that the document produced before it  is

a  lottery  ticket  or an account,  memorandum  or

record  of  stakes or wagers in or relating  to  a

public  lottery.  On that occasion,  I  think  the

Member  for  Farrer  Park did not  pay  very  much

attention to this clause, but rather he sought  to

suggest  that  the  Minister might  be  very  much

tempted   to   abuse  his  powers  under   another

amendment -  an amendment to section  2 - which  gave

the   Minister  power,  by  notification  in   the

Gazette,  to  declare  any game,  method,  device,

scheme  or  competition to be a  lottery  for  the

purposes  of the Ordinance. He suggested that  the

Minister might even think of declaring football to

be  a  public lottery. Now, mark you, he was aware

of  that clause then and took no objection to  it.

This  provision  is  not  new.  It  is  a  similar

presumption.



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> With respect to the Minister for

Labour  and Law - that particular section which  the

Hon. Minister quoted just now was in reference  to

"public  lottery".  The position  then  was  quite

different.  There  would  be  numbers  on  it   to

indicate  that it was part and parcel of a  public

lottery.  Therefore  the presumption  arises.  The

position  here is that any book, account, document

or  telegram received by some person or other  and

when  produced by a police officer is presumed  to

be intended to be used for betting or wagering. It

could be that the document, on the face of it, has

nothing whatsoever to do with betting or wagering.

All  that  need happen is a statement by a  police

officer  that that ,particular book or account  is

used   for   betting   or   wagering.   In   those

circumstances,  the presumption  could  easily  be

rebutted  by the accused saying, "I bought  it  to

keep my accounts", or something like that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If the book was bought to

keep  an  account,  I am quite sure  the  evidence

would  be  rebutted and the accused acquitted.  As

the Member for Farrer Park knows, what happens in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



these matters is this. A junior police officer or

a  junior Inspector has been in charge of some

investigation  into  a minor gambling  racket.  A

sergeant,  who  is  usually  an  expert  in  that

particular  line, goes to Court and, rather  than

go through the whole rigmarole, "I am a Sergeant.

I  have been in the Police Force for the last  25

years. I have been chasing gamblers in chap ji-ki

and  4-digits - now the latest craze - for  the  last

five  years.  I  can therefore  prove  that  five

bottles  here really means five points, and  that

half  a  bottle means I put half a dollar  either

way.". you just cut the whole proceedings  short

and say, "Look, here is an expert. He is presumed

by law to be an expert. He says it is what it is.

If  it  is  not, then I am not quite  sure."  The

person who is charged can rebut it. If, in  fact,

he  says, "It really means I am going to buy  two

bottles  of  catsup and a bottle of beer,"  there

should not be any difficulty in proving it.



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> All I am saying to the Minister, in

this particular instance is that the net is being

cast so far and so wide that the fish is going to

escape. That is all I am saying.

yesterday   that  we  were  debating   the   word

"wilfully"  and we are back again  today  at  the

same  time  on the word "wilfully". I  distinctly

remember the Minister for Finance saying how very

difficult it was to prove "wilfully". Might I say

here  how  very difficult it would  be  to  prove

"wilfully" here again? Here is a case  where  the

believe to be true, may require the production of

the original information and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



permit  an  inquiry and require  full  disclosure

concerning the informer. This is a very desirable

clause, particularly when the person against whom

the  information is given is going to get into  a

great deal of trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have thought, Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

clause read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...believes that the informer made in his

information a material statement which  he  knew

or believed to be false or did not believe to be

true..."



<br><br>then  the consequences should ensue. I would have

thought  that  to  be  enough,  because  somebody

moving  against the informer would have  to  show

that  he knew or believed it to be false  or  did

not   believe  it  to  be  true.  If   in   those

circumstances, he made a statement, I  think  the

consequences  envisaged  in  that  clause  should

ensue.  But why the State insists that it  should

also  be  made  "wilfully", I am  at  a  loss  to

understand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this, in fact, is a

vintage  section  of  the  Ordinance.  The   word

"wilfully"  appears in section 9 of the  existing

Ordinance, which became law in 1934, having  been

introduced  by the Betting (Amendment)  Ordinance

in 1934. This word "wilfully" has been in the law

for  the  past  26  years, and we  have  made  no

changes to the existing section.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> All I can say to the Minister for Law

is  that it is high time that he took the cobwebs

off  some  of our laws. I am suggesting,  in  all

seriousness to the Minister, that this is one  of

the  sections  which  should be  changed.  Merely

because  it has remained in our Statute book  for

26  years does not make it sacrosanct. When it is

clearly  bad  legislation,  then,  when  we   are

bringing about amending legislation, it  is  time

when these imperfections should be eradicated.  I

am  suggesting  to  the Minister  that  the  word

"wilfully"  should  be taken out.  I  suppose  in

those  days it was necessary for the Police Force

to  function efficiently to have these  informers

and give them full protection. But nowadays we do

not  need  these informers. The Minister  himself

has said so, "Our Police are not go-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



ing  to  depend on informers but on their own  two

feet" - big feet. So I feel, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that

it  is time the word "wilfully" went out. To  give

protection to the informer, all that need be  said

is,  "That he made a material statement  which  he

knew  or  believed to be false, or did not believe

to be true". If he did any of those things, surely

then   the  consequences  envisaged  there  should

ensue.  Why  should a person, who seeks  to  prove

that  a  false statement has been made on  top  of

that,  have  to prove that, "He did it wilfully."?

One has to prove mens rea.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, must we keep

repeating ourselves all the time? The point I made

just  now  was  that  this  word  "wilfully"   was

imported   into  the  section  by   an   amendment

Ordinance  enacted in 1934. And  there  were  good

reasons   why   that   amendment   Ordinance   was

introduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Well, this is a new Bill and I take

it that it is intended that the various clauses in

this  new  Bill  should stand  or  fall  on  their

merits.  It  is  no  use the  Minister  trying  to

bolster  his  case  by  saying  that  an  amending

Ordinance   previously   introduced   this    word

"wilfully".  No doubt there might have  been  very

good  reasons for introducing it 26 years ago when

colonialism was in its hey-day. But when  we  have

got   self-government  by  people  rooted  in  the

masses, I think we should really view these things

properly  and kick the informer where he  deserves

to be kicked. He does not need such protection. It

may be that in the old days the informer had to be

protected on all sides, and the Crown made it very

difficult for him to be got at. Whereas now, if an

informer  gives information which gets  a  private

citizen into trouble and if the Court comes to the

conclusion  that the information given was  false,

and  the informer knew that it was false,  then  I

think the consequences envisaged should ensue. The

person  who  is  moving against the  informer,  in

other   words,  the  accused,  should   not, in

addition, be called upon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



to  prove  that  the informer acted  wilfully  and

maliciously - that  is what it means,  wilfully  and

maliciously.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Member for Farrer Park is a

practising lawyer and has been practising law  for

many,  many  years. He knows that this  very  same

clause  appears in many of our laws where  similar

protection is given to informers. That  very  same

clause is written into many of our laws.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to belabour

the  point,  but  does  it really  make  all  that

difference whether the word "wilfully"  is  in  or

out of the clause? In deciding finally whether  or

not   the  informer  had  offended  against   this

particular provision, the Judge must make  up  his

mind  whether the informer knew what he  said  was

false. And when he put his mind to that particular

point, the informer would have had it. If it was a

material   point  and  the  Judge  came   to   the

conclusion  that  the informer  was  fully  compos

mentis when he made it, then the presumption  must

arise  that  he  was wilful. Like  so  many  other

elegant  amateurs  in the art of  legislation  and

draftsmanship,  it  sounds  better  if   you   say

"wilfully  or maliciously to have done  so-and-so"

than  to leave the bare bones and skeleton of  the

verbs by themselves. If the Member for Farrer Park

takes offence at the inelegancies of parliamentary

draftsmanship,  then perhaps  at  some  subsequent

date,  when we have more leisure, we might  listen

to  an essay on the subject from him. But right at

the moment, it really does not count whether it is

in  or  out. That is the way it was drafted  years

and  years  ago.  There is no good  reason  why  a

cricket bat which has been cut into that shape for

years  and years should be altered. That is not  a

very good reason.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, might I remind the Prime Minister

that  in  the recent boat race between Oxford  and

Cambridge,  Cambridge put a hole  in  their  oars'

blades, and so lost the race?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Prime Minister himself supports my

argument.  I  do not want to attempt an  essay  on

parliamentary   draftsmanship - that   is   not   my

function



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



in  this House. As I understand the interpretation

of   statutes,   Mr  Speaker,   every   word   is

deliberately  intended to be  there  and  must  be

given  its natural meaning. If the word "wilfully"

is  put in deliberately in the clause, in addition

to  the  words  "which he knew or believed  to  be

false", then the courts must give a meaning to the

word "wilfully". To say that "which he knew or  be

lieved to be false or did not believe to be true",

exactly  equates  with  the word  "wilfully",  Mr

Speaker,  I  am  unable to  accept.  As  the  word

"wilfully" is put in there deliberately, then  the

courts  will interpret that to mean that it should

be  given a meaning over and above the other words

which  follow it. If the Prime Minister thinks  it

does  not matter whether "wilfully" is in or  out,

could  he  not concede the point to the Opposition

and say, "Let us have it out"?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, line 32, to leave out "or heard".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a presumption against the house and the

occupiers.  That is what the marginal  note  says.

Can I seek the indulgence of the House to read the

clause:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If any books, documents, telegrams, writings.

circulars,  cards  or other  articles  used  as  a

subject  or  means of betting or wagering,  or  in

connection  therewith,  are  found  in  any  place

entered  under this Ordinance, or upon any  person

found therein, or if persons are seen or heard  to

escape  there from on the approach or entry  of  a

Magistrate or police officer not below the rank of

Assistant Superintendent...",



<br><br>then  the  presumption arises. I can understand  a

presumption arising, Mr Speaker, Sir, if a man is

seen  escaping from the premises. But I  am  at  a

loss  to understand how a presumption is going  to

arise if somebody is heard escaping. You hear with

your  cars, you see with your eyes, and  on  these

you give evidence. If I hear somebody escaping, do

I  know who has in fact escaped? All I can say  is

that somebody has escaped. But I cannot say who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



he is. So I would, with great respect, suggest to

the Minister that the words "or heard" are quite

meaningless and will not bring about any

presumption.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 1 think the

Member for Farrer Park lacks imagination. If in  a

dark night I were to hear somebody scampering away

in the back lane, and hear the somewhat stentorian

voice  of  the Member for Tanglin saying, "Chabot,

chabot!," and he is caught subsequently,  then  I

can  presume  that, being a person  of  reasonably

good auditory function, I can give evidence that I

heard    a    voice   which   not   only   sounded

schoolmasterish  and authoritative,  but  quaintly

agitated,  and I say, "This is the  man."  On  the

contrary,  if  I  were  to hear  a  lady-like  and

feminine voice saying, "Lari, lari! ", then I can,

if I am sufficiently acquainted with the dear Lady

from  Mountbatten, say, "Well, she is the one that

scooted!" When you hear, it does not mean that you

hear  just  noises. It means recognisable  noises,

either  by  the  daintiness of  the  feet  or  the

gentleness of the voice, or otherwise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may add to what

the  Prime Minister has already said. I  think  we

the  same auditory sense as we have, and this very

section has been in our existing law from the 23rd

December,  1912,  that is,  when  the  Member  for

Tanglin was 12 years old.

work  in the Assembly, but it would not work in  a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I merely point out the absurdity of those two

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the point I wish to raise here is

this. As I understood it, the normal practice, Mr

Speaker, Sir, - here I am subject to correction  by

the Minister for Labour and Law - is that when there

are  two  or three or more accused involved  in  a

particular  crime, then it is up to the  Crown  to

decide  which  one  shall give  evidence  for  the

Crown,  and that person will then be put up  as  a

witness  for the prosecution. It is not within  my

knowledge  where  this duty is  cast  on  a  trial

judge. Sub-clause (1) seeks to impose such a  duty

on the Judge. Sub-clause (1) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whenever two or more persons are charged with

any offence under this Ordinance, the Magistrate's

Court or District Court may require one or more of

them  to  give evidence as a witness or  witnesses

for the prosecution."



<br><br>This, to my mind, is a very unusual procedure. Is

there  any  reason  why  the  prosecution,  before

prosecution proceedings are instituted, could  not

have picked on one or the other accused to do  it?

To  call  upon  the  trial Judge  to  perform  the

function is something, which I do not think is  in

the interests of justice.



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a similar provision

exists in all our laws. I checked back on this and

the Member for Tanglin was 12 years old.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under clause

22,  may  I  ask the Minister for Labour  and  Law

whether  betting and gambling facilities would  be

controlled   and   reduced,  or   controlled   and

increased?  It seems to me, Sir, that this  clause

will  give  more opportunities for gambling.  Sir,

like  the Minister, we face realities, but with  a

difference.  We  want to face realities  with  the

desire  to  control,  limit  and  reduce  gambling

facilities.  We do not want them to  be  increased

and  exploited  to the tune of $10  million.  Sir,

under  clause 22, at page 10 of the Bill,  in  the

last  line,  the  word "any" in  the  phrase  "any

racing  club or association" could mean  that  the

Government  would  be prepared to  approve  racing

clubs  or associations not only for horse  racing,

but also for greyhound racing, motor racing, cycle

racing  and  other  kinds  of  races.  Could   the

Minister  for Labour and Law give us the assurance

that  approval would be given only to such  racing

associations as have the present facilities  under

the   law,  and  to  no  other  racing   club   or

association, thereby at least limiting the evils?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, under sub-clause (3), I read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shall be lawful at any time for any racing

club  or association exempted under the provisions

of subsection (1) of this section to admit members

of  the  public to its premises when racing  takes

place...".



<br><br>"at any time". Would that mean that there would be

racing  the whole day long? Then the admission  of

members of the public. The Minister has assured us

that  there would be some kind of ruling  so  that

school  children and children under a certain  age

limit would not be admitted to these places. Would

he  give  us  the assurance that under  this  sub-clause  school  children  and  children  under   a

certain age limit would not be admitted? But  even

then  this  is  going to expand and  increase  the

facilities for betting and gambling.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, the Government's

intention  to  see that bookmakers do  not  escape

paying a licence or tax or whatever be the charge,

and that they should not swindle the Government of

revenue,  is laudable. But the position  is  this.

Let  us face realities. Let us say, for argument's

sake, that there are 10 bookmakers operating in 10

places.  Instead of scoundrels working on  it  and

benefiting by it and Government losing on it,  the

Government  says  "Let us have 10  places  in  the

hands of a legal and licensed association and they

will  be  paying  Government  revenue."  But  what

happens  to the 10 places that have been  operated

by   the   bookmakers?  Are  they  going   to   be

extinguished just like that because the  legalised

association  has opened 10 new places?  I  believe

bookmakers offer a discount or whatever they  call

it.  They  do offer some sort of competition.  Now

what   competition   will  be   offered   by   the

organisation  that is legalised to carry  on  this

business? Would we not be returning to a  position

worse than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



the  position;  that  of  having  10  bookmakers

running  legally and these l& others still running

illegally? Is it not better to get hold of the  10

that are now functioning illegally than to set  up

a  competition  with 10 others  that  are  running

legally?  I think we are going round in a  vicious

circle and returning to where we started.

arrested, locked up and put out of the way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer to the comments made by the

Member  for  Tanglin when he sought  an  assurance

that  it would not be the policy of the Government

to  increase public betting. I have no doubt  that

when  the  Member for Tanglin said those words  he

had  in  mind an increase in the visible forms  of

betting, i.e., the number of bets put on the tote,

the  number of people attending race meetings  and

so   forth.  But,  may  I  suggest  that  a   fair

comparison  is not between what is  the  level  of

legal  betting now and in the future, but  between

the total of legal and illegal betting now against

the total of legal betting in the future?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, already we

see  a  conflict  of opinions and interpretations.

The Minister for Labour and Law has indicated that

there  will be a limit to and a reduction  in  the

visible   evidence   of   betting   and   gambling

facilities.  Then  the Minister for  Finance  says

that  there is a difference and there could be  an

increase  in the visible evidence. Sir, I  do  not

know  who  would implement the policy.  But  under

this clause, there are definitely powers to enable

the  facilities  to  be increased.  Not  only  the

members   of  the  racing  association  would   be

admitted, but members of the public generally with

or  without payment of a fee would be admitted. So

if  the visible evidence is not reduced in any way

but  rather increased, and the invisible  evidence

is  not  going to be reduced, then it  means  that

there  is  going to be more and more  betting  and

more and more gambling. We on both sides



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



face  reality. If we both agree on the  principle

that   we  should  try  to  reduce  if  we  cannot

eliminate, then I hope the Minister will agree  to

limit also the visible evidence of the betting and

gambling facilities.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> When I said the visible

evidence of an increase in betting as against  the

invisible  forms of betting in illegal bookmaking,

I  was  trying to make the point that if in future

there  is  an increase in Government revenue  from

this  form of controlled betting, then the  Member

for Tanglin cannot claim that that there has been-

an  increase  in  the  total  amount  of  betting,

because  the  increase in stakes put on  the  tote

would  mean  for the greater part  a  transfer  of

betting  now  going through illegal bookmakers  to

the proper controlled channels.



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the

moment,   I   believe   the   particular    racing

association  has  only one town office  where  the

betting can take place. Now, under clause 22,  not

one but a hundred places can be set up, or even  a

thousand -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Or even a million!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Yes. How then can the

Minister maintain that the facilities will not  be

increased?  The facilities will be increased  and,

with more facilities, there is no doubt that there

will be more gambling. If there is only one coffee

shop,  you would expect a certain number of people

to  patronise  it When you have got  1,000  coffee

shops,  one  cannot say that there  will  be  less

people taking coffee.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to seek some information from the Minister who now

appears to be quite an expert in horse-racing  and

the  payment  of  dividends  on  the  totalisator.

According to clause 22, there is no restriction on

the residential qualification of a racing club. In

other  words, any racing club in Malaya or outside

Malaya can still apply for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



exemption.  If,  let us say, the Perak  Turf  Club

wants  to  open  a betting shop in Singapore,  can

they  apply?  Or  is  it intended  that  only  the

Singapore  Turf  Club can open betting  shops  for

races  run in the Federation? If that is  so,  how

are they going to operate on the totalisator?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Byrne, is there any reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the debate could be wound

up?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  for  Finance said  that  the  answer  is

obvious. The bookmakers will be arrested  and  put

in gaol. Why cannot we do this without increasing,

promoting  or  legalising betting shops  all  over

Singapore? Cannot we do it now? Cannot  we  arrest

them   and  throw  them  into  gaol?  Government's

answer,  I  suppose, will be that when the  public

are  deprived of the means of betting, there  must

be  a substitute for them. Sir, the Turf Club will

serve  the purpose. Those who cannot afford to  go

to  the  Turf Club evidently cannot afford to  bet

without  getting  themselves  into  debt.  Why  is

Government providing facilities for such people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Law has just now

mentioned  that  if we do not have betting  places

here,  people  will go to Johore, as  happened  42

years  ago.  I  would like to remind the  Minister

that  the Singapore Turf Club is situated  between

Johore  and  Singapore and there is no reason  why

they  should go to Johore when they can go  there.

The  Minister  has also mentioned that  this  will

make  it easier for people to buy lottery tickets.

They  go to Johore and buy lottery tickets.  I  do

not  think  we  have  heard  of  cases  where  the

purchase of lottery tickets has brought about  the

downfall  of  a worker. It is usually his  placing

bets,  and  not  his buying lottery tickets,  that

causes his downfall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suppress betting houses, I think we need to

tighten  up  the  laws  and  get  at  the  present

culprits, rather than try to compete with them  by

promoting and legalising betting shops.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It seems to me that there is

repetition, which is becoming tedious. I wonder if

the  Prime  Minister  would like  to  add  to  the

debate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the

reasons  why  the  present  bookmakers  cannot  be

caught  and  thrown  into  gaol  is  that  it   is

difficult to catch them. Therefore, many of  these

provisions    have    been   introduced - all    the

presumptions   about  account  books,   telegrams,

documents  and so forth - so that we can  deal  more

efficaciously with them. I am quite sure that with

the  blessings  of all sides of  this  House,  the

police force will be spurred on to greater efforts

to bring them to book.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we on this side can

meet rational arguments. But we find it difficult

to meet fanatical arguments -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I thought something like that

would happen. I do not think the Hon. Minister can

allege that anything fanatical has been said in

this House. Perhaps he would like to withdraw the

word "fanatical"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, can I substitute the word

"tenacious"?  Mr Speaker, Sir, we make  it  clear

that  we do not wish to increase the opportunities

for gambling. That is not our intention at all. We

have   the   powers   to  deal  effectively   with

bookmakers and we intend to use those powers. That

is all we propose to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the other matter, which was raised by

the  Member  for Cairnhill as to how this  Betting

Bill  will  operate, that will become apparent  in

due course. I do not propose to say anything about

that at this stage.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's recommendation to proceed with this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House is aware that both the Governments of

Singapore  and the Federation of Malaya have  been

seriously troubled for a great number of years  by

the  operations of bookmakers who  have  not  only

deprived the State of legitimate revenue but  have

also  permeated every walk of life to  the  extent

that  they have become a menace to society. It  is

this Government's policy to wipe out this form  of

illicit gambling which goes on on a large scale in

Singapore,  since it undermines  the  welfare  and

morale of the people. Gambling has therefore to-be

confined within the limits permitted by the law so

that the State and the people can be protected. To

this  end, Government is introducing three related

Bills  incorporating  the  recommendations-of  the

various  committees  which have  been  set  up  to

examine the problem of illegal betting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Betting and Sweepstake Duties

Ordinance  provides for betting on the totalisator

or  pari-mutuel and sweepstakes promoted by racing

clubs and associations by the members only. It  is

because  the  general  public  is  excluded   from

participating  in these games of chance  that  the

bookmakers   have  been  able   to   exploit   the

situation.  Therefore, by  throwing  open  to  the

public participation in the properly organised and

legal  activities of such clubs and  associations,

by  allowing these clubs and associations to  sell

sweepstake   tickets  partly  in   Singapore   and

elsewhere,  bookmakers  will  be  driven  out   of

business.  In addition, it is intended to  provide

for  the  collection of duty on any other kind  of

betting  that may be promoted by racing  clubs  or

associations  which is made or  conducted  through

any totalisator or pari-mutuel.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, that these amendments will once

and  for  all take care of what has been a serious

loss  of  revenue  and  a danger  to  the  healthy

development of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister, in moving the

Second Reading of the Bill, has made reference  to

this  curse  which is not only confronted  by  the

Singapore Government but also by the Government of

the Federation of Malaya. Since he has brought  in

the  Government  of the Federation  of  Malaya,  I

would  like to know, Sir, whether there  had  been

any consultation with that Government before these

three Bills were introduced?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what I am

troubled about is that an assurance has been given

verbally that gambling facilities and so  on  will

be  reduced,  but  from the wording  in  the  Bill

itself  it  would appear that there  would  be  an

expansion of such facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice, Sir, in this Bill before the House

that  the  words  "every" and "any"  are  repeated

again  and again. As a school master, I know  what

these words mean. The door is left wide open.  Any

body and everybody can come in. We were given  the

assurance that school children will not be allowed

in,  and  so  forth.  I wish a provision  to  that

effect could be put into this Bill. In any case, I

hope  enough publicity will be given-so  that  the

public will expect that school children and  those

children  of a-certain age will not be allowed  to

participate. For instance, clause 4 provides  "Any

person  may  buy a ticket . . .".  I  suppose  any

person  may also sell a ticket. I can imagine  the

sale of sweepstake tickets not only to adults  but

also  to pupils outside school premises. In  spite

of all that we may say, that our children will not

be  allowed  to buy them, we may find that  school

boys will be buying them and saying to themselves,

"Why should we study? There is no use studying and

getting promotion. We can win a prize and we will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



be rich. There is no need for us to get

employment." If old people can think in this way,

what more the young people? The children will be

demoralised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to be too difficult, but the

wording in this Bill gives the impression that the

Government side are also human:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...there shall be charged a duty of ten per

centum...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...there shall be charged a duty of thirty per

centum...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government expects an additional

revenue  of  $10 million, it would  mean  that  in

Singapore at least $100 million must be  put  down

as  stakes  so that at least $10 million  will  go

into the public coffers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do hope that Government will really act

according to their assurances that these Bills are

being  passed to control, limit and reduce betting

and   gambling  facilities  so  that  the  harmful

effects will not be increased.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill

is  really consequential to the Betting Bill  just

passed.  I  do not think that there is  very  much

that I could usefully say other than to point  out

that  the  Member for Tanglin has been pursued  by

fears of such nightmarish proportions that nothing

I  can  say  can ever have any hope of  reassuring

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed section 2 (2) says that sweepstake

tickets  can be sold on a horse race that  is  run

exemption and sell tickets in Singapore?  Or  does

it  mean  that  the Singapore Turf  Club  will  be

allowed to sell tickets on horse races run in  the

some  relevance  to  the  extent  of  gambling  in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is complementary to the Betting

Ordinance and seeks to provide a means whereby  an

approved  racing club or association  may  legally

promote  and  operate a public lottery.  The  Bill

gives  power  to  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  to

exempt the members and officers of any racing club

or  association from the provisions of the  Common

Gaming  Houses Ordinance in respect of any  public

lottery  or  sweepstake held, promoted, organized,

administered  or operated by it  or  by  its  duly

authorized officers or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>

be  an  offence for a person to buy  a  ticket  or

chance  or to take part in a public lottery  held,

promoted,  administered or operated  by  a  racing

club or association which has been so exempted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, we were given the

assurance that only one particular racing club  in

Singapore  will be given approval to organise  all

these betting shops and the sale of sweepstake and

lottery tickets. Supposing there should be various

agents  selling lottery tickets issued  by  racing

clubs of other countries, then under this Bill  no

action  can be taken because the proposed  section

23 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notwithstanding the prohibitions and penalties

prescribed  and  imposed  in  this  Ordinance   in

relation  to a public lottery it shall not  be  an

offence  for any person to buy a ticket or  chance

or take part in any public lottery held ...".

the  facilities for gambling because  these  Bills

are so worded that the door is left wide open.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Minister said that in England
