Yeow Chong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would  like  to touch on  the  subject  of

rehousing   of  dispossessed  families  from   land

cleared  for redevelopment purposes. Normally,  all

dispossessed  families  from  clearance  sites  are

rehoused  in  Housing and Development  Board  flats

where  they will settle down permanently. But there

are  instances where, after having stayed in  these

flats  for  some time, these people  have  to  face

clearance  action for a second time  because  their

flats  are  to  be demolished for redevelopment  as

high-rise flats I will quote a few cases which have

come   to  my  knowledge.  This  is  what  I   have

experienced in recent months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four blocks of the former three-storey S.I.T.

flats  along  Old  Airport Road in my  constituency

were  affected by the redevelopment scheme. In  the

course  of  giving  assistance to  their  rehousing

problems, I discovered that a few families who  had

been  displaced  once before had  to  face  another

clearance  action  for  a  second  time.   In   one

instance, the displaced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



family had hardly resettled for a month  at

their  present flat when they had to move.  Another

resettler  was  very  bitter  about  having  to  be

evicted  again within a short space of four months.

This  particular  resettler told  me  that  he  was

rehoused  from  Beach Road where his  property  was

acquired by the Government at a price far below the

market  value.  In another case, a  tenant  of  the

Housing Board was transferred only eight months ago

from  his former flat which he had declined to  buy

over.  There  were also two rehousing  cases  which

took place about a year ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the above cases you will be convinced

that  the  Housing and Development Board have  been

very   careless  and  irresponsible  in   rehousing

displaced  families. It seems to me that they  have

totally  no regard or consideration for people  who

have  to suffer all the inconveniences, the  most

serious of which is the problem of school transfers

for their children. Is there no proper coordination

among  the various departments of the Housing Board

over  the  matters of rehousing and redevelopment?

Sir,  you  will  agree with me  that  planning  for

redevelopment takes some considerable  time  before

it   can  be  implemented.  Of  course,  there   is

sufficient time for the architects in the  Building

Department  of the Board to keep the  Lettings  and

Resettlement Departments informed of the areas that

will  be  affected  by redevelopment  schemes.  The

Lettings  Department will not then  release  vacant

flats  in  the area to the Resettlement  Department

for  rehousing  purposes. If this  had  been  done,

there  would not have been the cases which  I  have

mentioned  just  now.  In this  respect,  will  the

Minister kindly seek an assurance from the  Housing

and  Development Board that care will be taken  not

to  rehouse dispossessed families in any area  that

is  likely to be affected by redevelopment schemes?

Also,  can he ascertain from the Housing  Board  if

there   is  any  co-ordination  among  the  various

departments  over  the  matters  of  rehousing  and

redevelopment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may I be given permission to deal with the National

Development Division first and later on my Minister

will deal with the Law Division?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the point raised by

the Member for Kampong Kapor, in which he suggested

a  further increase in the income qualification for

people  to  apply  for  or purchase  Housing  Board

fiats, the present income ceiling is fixed at  $500

per  month  for  the individual  or  $800  for  the

combined  family income. There is  already  a  long

list  of  applicants waiting to rent Housing  Board

flats,  and  any  further increase in  this  income

ceiling  will  only further aggravate  the  present

situation. The income ceiling of a family  for  the

purchase of Housing and Development Board flat  has

recently  been  raised from $1,000  to  $1,200  per

month. It is considered that this income ceiling is

adequate at present and any further raising of  the

income ceiling cannot yet be justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member for Delta who has made

the  suggestion  to pay a lump sum compensation  to

shopkeepers  affected by the  clearance  scheme,  I

wish  to  inform the House that the present  policy

relating  to  the  clearance  of  shops  is   being

reviewed and the suggestion that shopkeepers should

be  given  a  lump  sum compensation  in  place  of

alternate   shop  premises  will  be   taken   into

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has complained that full

consideration was not given to the removal of stand-pipes.  There are certain procedures governing  the

removal  of stand-pipes. The present procedure  for

the  removal  of stand-pipes is as follows.  Before

action is taken for the removal of a stand-pipe -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An ad hoc committee has to consider the

following points: the unnumbered houses in  the

vicinity are given house numbers to enable  the

house owners to make applications for individual

connections,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Water mains are laid, if none is available in

the vicinity of the houses, for the house owners to

make the connections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A reasonable period of time is given to the

house owners to make the connections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also complained that

the  stand-pipe at Gek Poh Road near Lorong  Kabong

was  removed  without reason. Sir, that  stand-pipe

was  removed on 28th February, 1969, after  notices

had   been   given  to  the  Member  of  Parliament

concerned,  the  Citizens' Consultative  Committee,

and the District Secretary on 25th March, 1968, and

10th  February,  1969,  respectively.  However,   a

request for its retention was made by the Citizens'

Consultative Committee on 20th March, 1969  but  by

then this stand-pipe had already been removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of a second stand-pipe, the

Stand-pipe  Removal  Committee  did  not  agree  to

reinstall it but agreed that a water wagon would be

sent  during  the  drought period should  the  need

arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water mains that have been laid at Lorong

Kabong cost $39,450, and an additional main will be

laid soon, costing $31,500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a proposal to lay mains in the

interior part of Joo Koon Road. This proposal  will

be  submitted  to  the  Urban  and  Rural  Services

Committee for consideration at the next meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the stand-pipe at the l3½ m.s.

Jurong  Road, due notice to remove it was given  to

the  Member of Parliament concerned, the  Secretary

of  the  Citizens' Consultative Committee  of  that

Constituency,  and  the District Secretary,  Jurong

West.   Although  a  petition  was   received   for

unsealing the stand-pipe as it was serving  hawkers

at the 13½ m.s., the petitioners had been informed

on  the  very  day, through the District  Secretary

that  the  stand-pipe  was not  meant  for  washing

market  and  hawker stalls, for which  purpose  the

market  owner had to provide taps and pay  for  the

water consumed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>

2.45   p.m



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also complained that

farmers  encountered difficulty in applying  for  a

permit to construct chicken sheds or pigsties. I do

not know the true nature of his complaint, but what

I  know  is  that the Primary Production Department

has since 1964 assisted the farming community free

of   charge,  and  has  also  supplied  on  request

standard  plans  for  the construction  of  chicken

sheds  or  laying  cages. The  measurements  for  a

chicken  shed are 8 feet high by 24 feet wide,  and

for  a pigsty 8 feet high with a floor area of  100

square feet per unit. However, the farmer will have

to  obtain the landowner's permission to build, and

also  he  has  to indicate on the site  plan  the

specific spot he intends to construct. These  site

plans  can be purchased from the Land Office at  $2

each.  If  the  farmer  follows  the  procedure  of

applying for a permit - and this is quite simple  - I  do not think he will encounter any difficulty at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also pointed out that

although he is no longer a member of the Urban and

Rural  Services  Committee,  certain  officers   in

charge  of  projects continue to send him  letters

for  recommendation of certain  projects.  In  this

respect,  if  he  can give me the  names  of  these

officers, I will wake them up.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first

deal  with  the queries from the Member for  Mountbatten?  He cited a few cases of resettled  persons

having to be resettled again. It is true that a few

dispossessed   families  have  been  subjected   to

clearance action for a second time. This is  indeed

regrettable,   but,   unfortunately,   not   always

avoidable.  The Housing and Development Board  does

take  care not to rehouse dispossessed families  in

an area likely to be affected by development. To do

otherwise  would  be foolish and only  add  to  the

already considerable resettlement problems  of  the

Board. The Member can rest assured that there is co

ordination between the various departments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Board over matters  pertaining  to

rehousing  and redevelopment. But as  I  said  just

now,    sometimes   a   second   resettlement    is

unavoidable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an example. Before we separated from

Malaysia, we rehoused certain farmers in  Choa  Chu

Kang and Jurong. As a result of our separation  and

the build-up of our armed forces, more land has had

to  be  acquired  for purposes of the  Ministry  of

Defence, e.g., S.A.F.T.I. As a net result,  farmers

whom we had settled years ago have had to shift and

be  resettled, much to their annoyance, of  course,

as  it  causes a lot of inconvenience. This is  one

example  where such resettlement for a second  time

was unavoidable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may now go on to certain queries from

the Member for Delta regarding the Ministry of Law.

I   understood   her  to  say  that   the   Chinese

translation  Kuan - I  hope  I  have  pronounced  it

correctly   -  of  the  English  word  "Judge"   or

"Magistrate" has a colonial flavour.  Not  being  a

Chinese  scholar, I cannot agree or  disagree  with

her.  But  I would like to point out to Members  of

this  House that Judges and Magistrates do not come

under  the  jurisdiction of the  Ministry  of  Law.

Under our system of government, they are completely

independent of the Executive. Our laws are  printed

in   English,  and  the  English  word  "Judge"  or

"Magistrate"  is  still being used  in  many  other

countries - Malaysia, India, Ceylon. So  I  do  not

think  it has a colonial flavour; at least not  the

English word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also suggested that more publicity

should  be  given  on T.V. and over  the  radio  to

certain  Bills  passed  in this  House,  e.g.,  the

Abortion  Bill.  Somehow I feel this  query  should

have  been  directed to the Minister  for  Culture.

But, I, for one, feel that sufficient publicity  is

already being given in four languages on Television

Singapore and over Radio Singapore. You get  it  in

the  news  bulletins, and there is a special  half-hour  where  all the proceedings in Parliament  are

reported. What I fear is that if we have much  more

publicity on T.V. and over the radio, resulting  in

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



cutting  down  of entertainment time,  then  people

will  get fed up and turn to some other channel  or

station.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am satisfied with some but not  all

of  the replies of the Parliamentary Secretary.  As

regards the farmers' applications for permission to  build  chicken pens or pigsties, I did  not  say

that  the  Primary  Production Department  did  not

assist the farmers. I said that the Department  has

since given them a great deal of assistance. What I

complained  about was that the various  departments

did not seem to co-ordinate well. For example, when

an  application  to  build a  chicken  pen  with  a

maximum  height  of  8 feet went  to  the  Building

Surveyor's Department for approval, it was rejected

because  the  height  was more  than  the  allowed

maximum  of  6  feet. So there is  a  lack  of  co-ordination among the various departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary has

also asked me  to name  the officers who did not know that  I  am  no

longer  a  member of the Urban and  Rural  Services

Committee.  I can tell him that these officers  are

in   the   Electricity  Department  of  the  Public

Utilities Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the procedures in connection with

the  removal of stand-pipes, as far as I know,  the

Members  of Parliament concerned were not informed.

It   is  only  just  now  that  I  have  heard  the

Parliamentary Secretary inform the House  of  these

procedures.  The Parliamentary Secretary  dare  not

admit that the Ad Hoc Committee was in the wrong to

disconnect those stand-pipes which should not  have

been  removed,  but since he has  promised  to  lay

water mains in the areas concerned, I beg leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1201 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1004.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the matter of widening Paya Lebar Road, I

defined  my  attitude  to it  at  the  last  Budget

sitting. It seems that this road-widening  project

is  now  nearing completion. I am not  a  garrulous

woman  trying  to  harp on the  subject  again  and

again,  but  as the representative of  Paya  Lebar

Constituency,  I am duty bound to  look  after  the

interests   of  my  constituents.   I   cannot   be

indifferent  to  their hardship,  particularly  the

shophouses  and premises affected by this  project.

Many  of them have been asked to move to some other

place. The most hard hit are the shophouses.  As  a

result of this road widening, these people incurred

losses  in business, and some of them even  had  to

wind   up  their  businesses.  The  loss  was  very

substantial, whether in terms of human resources or

material  resources. It is true that  in  order  to

widen this road, the land abutting this road has to

be  utilised, and the premises on both sides of the

road  have  to give way. I have received complaints

in  my  capacity as Member of Parliament from those

of my constituents affected, and have tried my best

to  explain to them why it is necessary  to  widen

this  road. Generally, they are not totally against

the  scheme  to widen this road. At the same  time,

most  of  the premises have already been shifted  a

few  yards back from the main road. If there is  no

empty  space at the back of their original premises

they  have  to  make  do with smaller  and  cramped

premises  and the shophouses have to be reduced  in

size.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the enlightened and understanding Minister

will  give  them  all the necessary assistance  and

sympathy, and allow them to live and carry on  with

their business in the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to draw the

Minister's  attention to is this. In my  discussion

with those residents who have been affected by  the

road-widening scheme, I have discovered that  there

is  no proper liaison among the various departments

concerned. For example, the road was widened up  to

the  shop  premises, but the owners of these  shops

were not given alternative accommodation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



They came to see me. As a result, I wrote  to

the   department  concerned  on  the  question   of

alternative  accommodation. While  the  matter  was

under  discussion,  another  department  issued   a

demolition notice to the people there. Sometimes it

is the P.W.D. which issues such demolition notices.

These   people  do  not  understand   why   another

department  should  send them a further  notice  of

demolition   when  the  matter   is   still   under

discussion.   They  do  not  understand   why   the

officials  in the various departments do  not  have

proper liaison with one another. No one knows  what

the  other is doing especially in regard to such  a

serious matter as the demolition of shophouses. The

shopowners  are  bewildered  and  at  a   loss   to

understand  what is going on. I hope  the  Minister

concerned   will  take  measures  to  prevent   the

recurrence of such incidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to bring up is that

of  the  officials  of  the departments  under  the

Ministry   of   Law   and   National   Development,

particularly  the  Land Office inspectors  who  are

called  Ti  Niu,  the Chinese meaning  of  which  is

"bulls". Being "bulls", they are very hot tempered.

I  do not want to deny that the people in the rural

area are not as well educated as those in the urban

area.  Nevertheless, they understand what is  going

on  in  this world. They can sense that these  Land

Office inspectors are trying to boss over them.  At

times,  the Land Office inspectors are bureaucratic

and  insolent in their dealings with the people  in

the rural areas. I hope the Minister will take note

of  this.  I have received many complaints  to  the

effect  that  when members of the public  go  to  a

department to apply for something, the officials in

the  office  just  gesture  with  their  hands   to

communicate with them. They do not talk with  them.

They  even glare at them. Such an attitude is  very

bad.  Many country folks came and asked me  whether

it was because they dressed shabbily that they were

looked down upon by the staff in the department. If

this  is  the  case,  will the  Minister  take  the

necessary  drastic measures against these officials

who judge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



persons  by  their  appearance and attire?  Certain

members   of   the  public  do  not   know   which

department  to  go to on business, and  when  they

want   to  approach  a  certain  department  -





<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, you have filed an amendment on

subhead 1004, but so far

you  have  been dwelling on all sorts  of  subjects

except "Permanent Secretaries".



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  feel  that the Permanent Secretary of a Ministry

should  be  responsible for  his  subordinates.  He

should   see  to  it  that  they  behave  properly,

otherwise it will be a waste of money to pay a huge

salary  to  our  Permanent  Secretaries  for  doing

nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have mentioned just now that

sometimes   when  the  country  folk  go   to   see

Government  officials, they are  scared,  overawed,

and  break out in a sweat. Invariably the officials

will  give  them wrong directions and guidance  and

they  have to go from one office to another without

getting  any  result. Therefore, I feel  that  such

discourtesy and bureaucratic attitude on  the  part

of  these  officials should be taken  note  of  and

proper measures taken to deal with them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Paya

Lebar  has  for  some time now been very  concerned

about  the  widening of Paya Lebar  Road  from  its

junction  with  Bartley Road to its  junction  with

Airport  Road. I think he admits that  there  is  a

need  to  widen  the road and, as a result,  people

must  shift,  but we have not evicted  any  of  the

persons occupying houses along the road without any

notice.  We  have given them ample  time  but  some

squatters  are still there. As a result,  the  road

has  been widened in parts but the widening has not

been completed yet. If I may cite the figures,  298

squatters or occupiers were served with notices  of

eviction,  of  whom  only 144  have  been  cleared.

Another  154  units of houses still  remain  to  be

cleared.  No one likes to shift, so they approached

their Member of Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



He  has  written me several  letters  and

these have been given careful consideration by  the

Ministry,  otherwise those 154 squatters would  not

be  there  today. I appeal to the M.P. to use  his

good influence and see what he can do to help evict

the 154 squatters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar also complains about

rudeness  in the Land Office. I have said time  and

again in Parliament that for Back-benchers to come

here  and make general allegations of rudeness does

not  get us anywhere. If the Member knows the facts

of  a  certain case where a civil servant has  been

rude  to  a member of the public, let us  have  the

full  particulars and the matter will  be  inquired

into, and that civil servant will be dealt with  if

he  is  wrong.  But to make general allegations  of

rudeness  here  takes it no further.  We  do  issue

departmental   circulars   insisting   that   civil

servants  treat  members of the public  fairly  and

urgently, certainly without rudeness, but I  cannot

do anything, neither can the Permanent Secretary do

anything,  unless  specific allegations  with  full

particulars  like  date, place,  names  of  persons

involved are brought to our attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, may I refer to the statement

made  by  the Member for Punggol, who is  not  here

now, when during the debate on the Estimates of the

Ministry  of  Finance, he referred  to  a  case  of

rudeness  in  the Public Utilities  Board.  I  have

looked into it. Apparently this happened more  than

two years ago. There was a small incident which was

due   to  some  misunderstanding.  The  Member  for

Punggol turned up at the Public Utilities Board the

next   day.   The  matter  was  settled   to   the

satisfaction of all parties, including  the  Member

for  Punggol. I am surprised that the Member should

have  come  here two years later to complain  of  a

little  incident that had happened  in  the  Public

Utilities Board such a long time ago.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members will remember that when the

People's  Action Party first came to  power,  civil

servants were so afraid to move because of pressure

put  on  them by politicians. But I put it  to  you

that  if  the  Director  of Public  Works  and  the

General Manager of the Public Utilities Board  have

to  deal  daily with complaints from 58 Members  of

Parliament, they will not be able to do  any  other

work. So I would suggest that if you gentlemen have

any complaints, you address them either to me or to

my  Parliamentary  Secretary  (National  Deveopment

Division)   or  my  Parliamentary  Secretary   (Law

Division).



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  I  withdraw my amendment, I would  like  to

raise another point. The Minister says that, as the

Member of Parliament for Paya Lebar, it is my  duty

to  persuade my constituents. I have done a lot  of

persuasion.  The reason why some of them  have  not

moved   out  is  that  they  have not  been  given

alternative accommodation. Some of them have  their

backyard   enclosed,  and   we   would   like   the

authorities to be more lenient with them and  allow

them time to find alternative accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say that

it  is  the  duty of the Member for Paya  Lebar  to

evict these people. I asked for his assistance. The

trouble  with Paya Lebar Road is that most  of  the

squatters there do not want to move. All they  want

to  do  is  to move backwards from the  road.  They

still  want to be on the road front. In many cases,

we  have  allowed  them  to demolish  part  of  the

premises and reset their houses backwards. But,  in

some  cases,  there are already houses behind  them

whose  owners will not move. So we reach a position

where  the  squatters will not move.  But  wherever

possible,  we  allow these people  to  reset  their

houses  backwards so that they are  still  on  Paya

Lebar  Road. This also happened in respect  of  the

widening of Upper Serangoon Road.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1201

be reduced by $100*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Low Yong Nguan).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this amendment, I wish to raise two

points. Firstly, a few unpleasant developments have

taken  place  in the implementation  of  our  urban

renewal  schemes. When the Resettlement  Department

takes  action  to resettle people, there  are  some

residents who are not resettled. According  to  the

usual practice, sub-contractors are asked to tender

for the demolition of shacks, and the clearance  of

the   area.   This   has   given   rise   to   some

unpleasantness. Let me quote an example which  took

place  not  very long ago. The place at which  this

took place is a historical spot in Singapore called

Covent  Gardens,  and it has a history  going  back

more  than  100 years. The Housing and  Development

Board  has  plans to develop this area. Many  attap

houses  in this area were demolished and the people

had to move out. But there are still a small number

of  people  who for various reasons have not  moved

out  as  yet. The Housing Board has already awarded

the  tender to sub-contractors to clear this  area.

The  sub-contractors have taken the good and usable

articles  from the area and have burnt the unwanted

household   furniture  and  articles.  These   sub-contractors  are only concerned with  making  money

and are not bothered with the lives and property of

the people. When these unwanted articles are burnt,

the  people who are still staying in this area  are

in  danger  of losing their lives and  property  if

there is a fire. Sir, this is only one example from

my  constituency. I understand there  were  two  or

three  such  incidents caused  by  the  burning  of

unwanted articles on the site. These



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



fires endangered the lives of the people living  in

the  area. Although we may regard this as  a  small

matter, our citizens may consider it as a matter of

great  importance. They are not so  much  concerned

with  the  sub-contractors as with the  Government.

They think that this is a deliberate attempt by the

Government  to set fire to the houses on  the  site

which  is  required for urban renewal so  that  the

Government  can proceed with urban development.  So

many  fires of this nature have taken place  and  I

have  not  seen the Minister taking action  against

the  sub-contractors whose actions have  endangered

the lives and property of the people. This is not a

small matter. It is a matter of great importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fire in my constituency, I saw certain

officials in the Resettlement Department  and  they

promised to look into this matter. They have spoken

to the sub-contractors and have warned them that if

they  persist  in  starting  fires,  they  will  be

punished  and  fined. I would like to know  whether

the Ministry has made investigations, because there

is  evidence that the fires were started  by  these

sub-contractors. I hope the Minister  will  give  a

detailed  explanation so that I can  report  to  my

constituents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point I want to raise concerns

recreational grounds for people staying in  housing

estates.  When  the People's Action Party  came  to

power,  it  was one of the Party's aims to  provide

these facilities for the people in housing estates,

because  they  were then staying in  "pigeon-holes"

and were restricted in their movements. This is not

the  best environment to build socialism and cannot

be  permitted by our Party which professes to be  a

socialist Party. Therefore, we resolved to do  away

with  the then Singapore Improvement Trust and  set

up what is now known as the Housing and Development

Board. The main function of the Board is to provide

houses for our people, and its housing achievements

have  brought honour and won praise for our country

from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



most  of the countries in South-east Asia. Many  of

our  people  are now living in flats built  by  the

Housing and Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly, we had many empty spaces or grounds

near  housing  estates which could be utilised  for

recreational purposes. But in the last year or two,

these  grounds have been sold to oil companies  for

the  construction of petrol stations. The promises

that  our  Party  and our Government  made  to  the

people during the elections have been forgotten  or

changed. A number of my constituents came to see me

last  week,  saying that the only open space  which

can  be utilised as a recreational ground had  been

sold by the Housing Board to an oil company for the

construction of a petrol kiosk. After listening  to

this  complaint, I made investigations, and I  feel

that  such a small space should have been reserved

for  the  people  in the area for  the  purpose  of

recreation.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children can walk and play around there because

there  is  no  other  better open  ground  in  that

particular  area for recreation. Since the  density

of  the population there is high and there is a lot

of traffic, that place is not suitable for a petrol

kiosk. The Ministry of Law and National Development

has  sold the space to a petrol kiosk and, in doing

so, it has taken away a small piece of ground which

the people could have used for recreation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the people's

fundamental right and the land should not have been

sold  to  the  petrol kiosk. It  should  have  been

reserved  for the use of our people. The Government

did not seek their views when it sold the piece  of

land.   The  building  of  a  petrol  kiosk   there

constitutes  a danger to the lives of  the  people.

They  would  like to have that piece  of  land  for

their  use.  They  have appealed to  the  Citizens'

Consultative Committee to help them in this  matter

and they have asked me to convey their views to the

Minister. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



until today they have not received any reply.  They

do  not  know what the Ministry of Law and National

Development  is  going to do. I hope  the  Minister

will answer in great detail the two points which  I

have raised just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first deal

with the last point raised by the Member for Delta.

I  have  not  been  able  to  follow  her  line  of

argument.  She referred to one petrol station.  She

said that it was built on land used by children  to

play on and, in the same breath, she said that  the

P.A.P. was breaking its promises to the people. One

piece  of  land  and  Government  is  breaking  its

promises!  I do not see the logic of the  argument.

These  are  the  facts. The Member  for  Delta  and

certain  of  her  constituents did  appeal  to  the

Ministry  of National Development not  to  allow  a

petrol station to be built on a small site of land.

They  raised  two  objections.  First,  on  traffic

grounds.  Secondly,  they alleged  that  when  they

purchased the houses, it was on condition that that

land  would be reserved as a children's playground.

Investigation has shown that there were no  traffic

problems  and, second, there was ample other  space

for the children to play on, and that there was  no

promise or undertaking that that piece of land  was

to  be  reserved  for recreation.  The  appeal  was

rejected  and I have already written to the  Member

for  Delta. I am surprised she has not received the

letter. Probably it is on the way to her.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked why the Government did not consult the

people  when  it wanted to sell its own  land.  Why

should the Government consult the people when it is

the  owner? May I point out to the Member for Delta

that the money from the petrol station goes towards

the subsidy of Housing Board flats. It does not  go

into  the  pockets of members of  the  Housing  and

Development Board. It is used to subsidise rents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also referred to Covent Gardens. I

remember answering her

question  in Parliament as to when the  Government

was going to develop Covent Gardens. We are now  in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



process of developing Covent Gardens. Most  of  the

people have shifted. There was an unfortunate  case

of  a fire there which took place during the rather

dry spell Singapore had to undergo in February when

we  hardly had any rain for 32 days. It was a  fire

from a rubbish pile. The evidence does not show who

started  this  fire, whether it was  the  squatters

remaining  there, or the contractor as  alleged  by

the  Member  for  Delta. But she  feared  that  the

people might think that it was the Government  that

was aiding and abetting the contractor to start the

fire.  Surely the Member should know better.  These

are  rumours circulated by our enemies. During Chap

Goh  Meh  there were dozens of fires in  Singapore.

Surely  the Government did not start every  one  of

them!  But  I will look into the complaint  by  the

Member  for Delta and try to ensure that  no  other

fire takes place in Covent Gardens.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would like to clarify one point.  This  is

about  the plot of land which has been used  for  a

petrol  kiosk.  The  Minister  has  said  that  the

Government  can  make  use of  any  piece  of  land

whenever  it  wants to. Naturally it can.  When  it

wants  to make use of a piece of land, it can  take

it  at any time. But then it should not forget that

when  it  came  to  power, one of  its  fundamental

policies  was to provide more recreational  grounds

for  our children. I would like to ask the Minister

whether,  if  a petrol kiosk is built there,  there

will  be a recreational ground for the many  people

who  are  now living there in high-rise  flats.  Of

course, no one will oppose the Government's  action

to  make use of the land there. But what I want  to

say  is that land in that area is limited. Has  the

Minister seen that piece of land? Our Party  Branch

is  just across it and I am quite familiar with the

locality.  There are already four petrol kiosks  in

that area, all near together within a short stretch

of  Havelock Road. The traffic along Havelock  Road

is  congested.  Who can say that it is  not?  There

have already been four cases of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



children who were run over by cars. Is this not a

traffic problem?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is to seek information only. Will the

Minister enlighten this House on the performance of

the Jurong Fish Market and the Jurong Abattoir?

What was the cause of the boycott by the pork

dealers last year and how was it solved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

on the 9th of this month the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Law and National

Development (National Development Division), in

answer to a question raised by me, said that by the

end of last year there were 20,357 registered farms

and the registered farmers numbered 53,291 people.

In addition to the members of their families, there

were altogether about 175,400 people engaged in

agricultural activities or depending on

agricultural activities for their livelihood. They

raised about $245 million worth of agricultural

produce - an achievement that went unnoticed by

other people. If they had not brought forth such a

huge amount of agricultural produce, we would have

lost an equivalent sum in foreign exchange. They

also produced supplementary foodstuffs such as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



pigs, chickens, eggs and others. Some of them  were

exported, thus earning for Singapore quite a  large

sum of money in foreign exchange.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can thus see that these farmers play a very

important  role in our national economy. But,  Sir,

most  of them are very poor. They have to work very

hard,  going out to the farms in the early  morning

and working there until late in the evening. Almost

every  member of the family has to do his share  of

work. Even if he is a student, he has to help  when

he  comes  back from school. But the  prices  these

farmers  get  for  their agricultural  produce  are

normally  very cheap, and therefore  they  find  it

difficult to make ends meet. At times they  may  be

able to sell their produce at higher prices and  so

make  more money, but they have to set aside  part

of  their money to tide them over difficult  times,

such  as  when prices are low or when a  misfortune

befalls them, as happened in last December's flood,

and  in the recent drought when they incurred heavy

losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the farmers' land is

affected  by  clearance, then their lives  will  be

more  miserable. Normally, when a certain piece  of

land  is  earmarked for development, it is acquired

by  Government and then put under the control of  a

statutory  organisation. Usually, on  a  change  of

landlord, their rent is increased and their  burden

naturally  becomes  heavier. Prior  to  the  actual

development  of the site, the farmers are  notified

not  to engage in agricultural activities any  more

in  view of immediate resettlement. It is true that

in  order to avoid unnecessary losses, the  farmers

dare  not  engage  in agricultural  activities  any

more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, sometimes the farmers have been

waiting for three or four years, and there is still

no  sign  of  resettlement. So during this  waiting

period,  they  have  no  income  from  agricultural

activities. They have to maintain their  livelihood

on their previous savings. It is envisaged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



that  they  lead quite a hard life. When  the  time

comes  for their resettlement, their houses,  fruit

trees  and vegetable crops which are the result  of

their   years   of  toil,  have  to  be   abandoned

overnight. They have to make use of the  small  sum

of compensation and start everything all over again

when  they  have been resettled in the resettlement

area.  Moreover,  when they are  resettled  in  new

sites,  the land allocated to each of them  is  not

more  than 14 acres. Since the land area is smaller

than  what  they had previously, their agricultural

produce  will be less. Their income is  accordingly

less.  Also,  when they are resettled  at  the  new

site,  they have to spend some money on building  a

house. This will have a higher assessment and  they

have  to pay increased property tax. They also have

to pay other overhead charges. All this will impose

an  additional burden on them. All along they  have

been  suffering in silence. Because of our economic

policy,  they have to make some sacrifices for  the

good  of  the whole nation. This merits our praise.

But  the  cause  of the farmers'  suffering  is  an

artificial  one,  i.e., the prices of  agricultural

produce are subject to fluctuation, and so at times

they have to sell at a loss. How pitiful this is!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulties of the farmers and the

fluctuation of prices in agricultural produce have

been  pointed out by me on many occasions, and  the

reply  has  invariably been the same - that  prices

are  governed by the law of supply and  demand.  So

the  Minister is not in a position to do  anything.

However,  the Government can at least do  something

to  alleviate  the farmers' plight.  It  is  to  be

admitted  that since the inception of  the  Primary

Production  Department, it has rendered  assistance

to the farmers in many fields, especially in making

an  effective check on swine and chicken epidemics,

introducing  new scientific methods  of  production

and  new  agricultural  medicines  to  farmers.  In

general, farmers appreciate such services. However,

Sir,  when  we  compare  the  livelihood  of  these

farmers  10 years ago with their livelihood  today,

we  can see that there is almost no improvement  at

all. Since the Government is allocating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



a  large  sum  of money to the National Development

Division,  we should expect something  better  from

this  Department, and the Government should try  to

improve  the standard of living of the farmers.  As

far as I can see, the main cause of the fluctuation

in   prices  of  agricultural  produce  is   random

production.  For  instance,  whenever  there  is  a

festival, the farmers will try to produce  more  in

order  to  sell  at a higher price. But  since  all

farmers  have the same idea, more will be produced

and so prices will fall. In the end, all their toil

and  sweat come to nothing. Instead they lose money

when they sell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, farmers are poor, so they

have  to  depend on loans not only in  the  initial

stages  of  farming  but also  in  the  process  of

production.  They have to borrow at  high  interest

rates  from  chit  fund  companies,  grocery   shop

proprietors, landowners and others. The farmers may

have to repay their loans in kind. In the end,  the

farmers  have no control over or say in the  prices

of  their produce. If they transport their  produce

to  distant  markets, they cannot make much  money,

because  their produce is limited and the  distance

is  far. Moreover, farm work takes up a lot of time

and  they  cannot assign a person to  a  particular

job.  So, as usual, the farmers have to sell  their

produce  through a middleman who  can  sell  it  at

prices  much  higher  than what  they  pay  to  the

farmers. Some people may say that our market  is  a

free  one and if the farmers are not satisfied with

the  price  paid by one middleman, they can  go  to

another  middleman for a better price. But we  must

know  that since the farmers are tied down by their

loans  and  by  the  other  factors  that  I   have

mentioned, they are not able to do this. It behoves

the  Government  to lend them a helping  hand.  The

Government cannot shirk its responsibility  to  the

farmers.  It has the bounden duty to improve  their

lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I urge the Government to set

up   an  organisation  -  a  National  Agricultural

Planning and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



Sales  Board  -  to  help  the  farmers,  with  the

following functions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to get specialists to collect information and

data and analyse what agricultural produce  is

best  for  cultivation, and in what  quantity,

and  when and where to sell it. All this  will

give   the  farmers  some  sort  of  guidance,

instead   of  letting  them  go  about   their

business blindly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This board can set up a factory to process

any  excess agricultural produce and  preserve

it  in cold storage or for export. It can also

be canned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The board can give loans to farmers who need

them,  so  as to save them borrowing  at  high

interest  rates  from  moneylenders  and  from

being exploited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) More important, the Government can help the

farmers by engaging in wholesale buying and selling

of  agricultural  produce. The exploitation  by

middlemen will therefore be done away with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government will do all these things for

the farmers without making much profit, what little

there  is  can  be  spent on overhead  charges  and

maintenance,  so  that both farmers  and  consumers

will  benefit. In other words, all the people  will

benefit from the setting up of this board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate: if the Government is sincere in

taking care of agricultural development, now is the

time  for  it to consider seriously how to  improve

the lot of the farmers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under this

subhead,  I  would  also like  to  give  my  views.

According to statistics, the farming population  is

10  per cent of the total population. Most of  them

stay  in the rural areas. As a Member of Parliament

for  a  rural constituency, I would like  to  avail

myself  of  this  opportunity  to  praise  the  con

tributions our farmers have made to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



our country. Because of their efforts and hard

work, they are able to provide us with cheap

agricultural produce to meet all our needs, so that

we have no need to import from abroad such

commodities as chickens, eggs, and pork. These

items are daily necessities. Although land is

limited, the farmers, because of their hard work,

are able to raise $250 million worth of

agricultural produce every year. This is not a

small sum. Of course, I will not deny that in this

respect the Primary Production Department has done

a lot to help the farmers. For instance, this

Department has taught them how to use scientific

methods of production, how to produce better

strains of livestock, how to prevent certain

livestock diseases, and how to vaccinate their

livestock. All these measures have helped the

farmers in their agricultural produce and animal

husbandry.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have received complaints from farmers

in my constituency that recently the Primary

Production Department has stopped its services of

free chicken vaccination. I feel that this free

service should not be stopped. The expenditure

involved is not very much. Therefore, I would urge

the Minister to continue with this service for the

farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Member for Jurong has mentioned the

prices of farm produce. As far as I know, prices

fluctuate all the time. In July or other periods of

the year, pork and chicken are sold at lower

prices, whereas the prices of feed-stuffs for pigs

and chickens are relatively dearer so that in the

end the farmers will be selling at a loss. This

will force them to borrow money from other sources.

I hope the Government can render some form of

assistance to the farmers to tide them over their

difficulties. I would like to ask the Government

whether they are giving subsidies to the farmers.

In many countries farmers are subsidized. Whenever

the market price is low, the Government will

subsidise the farmers, or they will buy the farm

products from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



farmers  in  order to maintain market stability.  I

wonder whether our Government can do the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether

the Government can help the farmers to organise co-operatives.  The  main  function  of  the   Primary

Production  Department  is  to  help  the  farmers.

Therefore,  the  staff  of the  Primary  Production

Department should devote more time to help them.  I

have  also  heard that some of the  staff  of  the

Primary  Production Department do not know  how  to

make  use of their free time. I would suggest  that

during their free time they should go to the  farms

and  discuss with the farmers the formation of  co-operative  societies  so  that  they  will  not  be

exploited  by middlemen. In this way,  farmers  can

buy  what  they  need at a lower  price,  including

animal  feeding  stuff, and sell their  produce  at

higher prices.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Sir, may I first deal with the

queries  from the Member for Havelock.  The  Jurong

Fishing  Port and Production Market began operation

in  February 1969, a little more than a  year  ago.

All  the  65  licensed  fish  merchants  previously

operating   in  Ellenborough  and  Clyde   Terrace

Markets had removed to Jurong. The Fisheries Office

at  Telok Ayer Basin was also removed to Jurong  on

the  same  day.  I am happy to say  that  both  the

Fishing  Port  and  the  Auction  Market  are   now

operating very smoothly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the fish merchants have formed themselves

into  one  association. Meetings are held regularly

between  the association and the Primary Production

Department  to  ensure that any  problem  that  may

arise is given prompt attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the fishermen, the fish merchants and

the retailers have adapted themselves very well  to

the new environment. They have organised themselves

in  groups  to travel daily to Jurong.  Each  night

about 3,000 to 4,000 of them congregate at the fish

markets  from one o'clock in the morning  to  about

six  o'clock  the  same morning  to  conduct  their

business.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new car park will be opened next month to

reduce the problem of traffic congestion. Since the

opening  of  the  port, many foreign  vessels  have

landed fish for sale in Jurong and many more  joint

fishing  ventures have been launched to catch  fish

for  sale.  Ice plants, cold storage and processing

facilities are being provided in an area  of  about

40   acres  to  serve  the  fishermen  and  fishing

vessels.  There  has  been a marginal  increase  in

retail  prices of fish, but it is hoped  that  with

the  increased landings, the prices  of  fish  will

return to normal and may even be lower than before,

if an abundant supply of fish is available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock also wants to know why

work stopped at the Jurong Abattoir on the 5th  and

6th  of  August. This was due to a misunderstanding

between   the  officer-in-charge  of   the   Jurong

Abattoir  and some private butchers.  In  order  to

prevent vandalism and mischief in the abattoir,  no

private  butchers or workmen were allowed to  enter

the  grounds  until a few hours before slaughtering

began.  Owing to a misunderstanding on  the  agreed

time  for entry, some private butchers and  workmen

who came earlier, were refused permission to enter,

and  so  they  made a big fuss. As a result,  their

colleagues    decided    to    stop    work.    The

misunderstanding was subsequently settled  and  the

abattoir resumed operation on the 7th August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the Members for Jurong and

Sembawang  who proceeded to tell us so  much  about

farming.  May I say at the outset that there  is  a

shortage  of  land in Singapore.  Land  is  getting

scarcer  and  scarcer in spite of  our  efforts  to

reclaim  land, and it is for this reason that  when

we  resettle farmers it is not possible to allocate

to  them more than two acres. Both the Members,  of

course are rather concerned with the plight of  the

farmers. The Member for Jurong says that they  have

suffered in silence for ten years. I disagree.  The

Member  for  Sembawang has pointed  out  that  they

export  annually  to the tune of $250  million.  If

that is true, they cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



be  suffering. If they are, they are certainly not

suffering  in  silence,  because  they  have  good

spokesmen, for example, the two Members here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members main grouse is the price. In answer

to  their questions, I have said before and  I  am

afraid  I  have to repeat myself if they  want  to

repeat  themselves here, that prices are regulated

by  demand  and supply. If demand exceeds  supply,

prices go up. If supply exceeds demand, prices  go

down.  You do not need to be an economist to  know

this.  But when the price of eggs goes up, I  have

to answer questions in Parliament from Members who

want  to  protect the consumers. Consumers grumble

that the price of eggs has gone up. When the price

of eggs goes down, I have to answer questions from

Members  who  represent the farmers. I  am  afraid

there  is  not  much  the  Government  can  do  to

regulate the price of farm products. We have tried

co-operative  societies,  but  they  have  been  a

dismal failure. Do farmers need subsidies?  If  so

it  is  the Minister for Finance who will have  to

decide  whether or not a subsidy should  be  given

and,  if  so,  how  much  should  be  given.   The

Government is not abandoning the farmer. As far as

possible, we want to be self-sufficient in food. I

say   "as   far  as  possible",  and   we   render

considerable  assistance  to  farmers.   I   think

Members   know   that   the   Primary   Production

Department   is  concentrating  its   efforts   on

developing  intensive farming techniques  such  as

hydroponics, mushroom culture, broiler production,

intensive pig production and so on, because of the

shortage  of  land. I understand that  many  farms

have  now increased their production without  much

additional  land. I can assure both  Members  that

the effort to encourage farming will continue, but

I  would agree with them that there is still  room

for improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for chickens, half a cent per dose of vaccine

was charged for vaccination of chickens with

effect from 1st January



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



this  year. In addition, a service fee of  half  a

cent  per  chick will be charged for carrying  out

the  inoculation  at  the farmer's  premises  with

effect from 1st April this year. The charging of a

fee  for chick inoculation is not new. Since 196l,

a  charge  of  half  a  cent  has  been  made  for

vaccinating  each day-old chick. This  charge  was

merely  extended  from a day-old  chick  to  adult

birds  from the 1st January this year. This  is  a

small  charge which I think the farmers  can  well

afford  to  pay.  The charge of half  a  cent  for

vaccinating poultry at the premises of the  farmer

is  really not an exercise to make money,  but  to

encourage   the  farmers  to  do  the  inoculation

themselves  and not to rely on the Department.  In

fact,  a short course has been conducted to  train

all  farmers  who  wish to learn  the  inoculation

technique,  but  some of them  perhaps  cannot  be

bothered  about  the course and  hence  the  small

charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Madam Chan Choy Siong and Mr Lim Cheng Lock.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is the Minister for Law and National

Development  aware that hotels  in  Singapore  are

collecting  as much as $40 per month per  taxi  if

taxi drivers wish to get into the hotel grounds to

pick  up passengers? This is serious and I  wonder

whether  the Minister is in a position to  declare

some  space  in the hotel grounds for the  use  of

taxis  so that this extortion of poor taxi drivers

can be stopped.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, will the Minister also consider increasing

parking spaces for taxis at Raffles Place and other

places where there are shopping centres so that  it

will be convenient for tourists to call for a taxi?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would  like to find out from the  Minister

whether  there  is a policy on the marking  out  of

parking  lots in the city area. As you  are  aware,

Sir,  recently the marking out of parking lots  has

been extended to places away from the central area.

Can  the  Minister inform us whether the policy  of

marking   out  parking  lots  is  to  ease  traffic

congestion or to earn revenue without consideration

for the hardship caused to shopkeepers in the area?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Changi  asked for more parking places for taxis  in

hotels. The Ministry of National Development is not

in charge of hotel grounds. It is the proprietor of

the hotel that is in charge of the grounds. But  if

there  is space outside the hotel on the main road,

then we will provide spaces if available. I do  not

know  whether  the Member for Changi  has  specific

instances of any particular hotel in mind.  But  if

particulars  are  given  to  me,  I  will  ask  the

Superintendent of Car Parks to look into the matter

in order to provide more parking spaces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor wants to know

whether  the  policy of providing car parks  is  to

make money or to ease congestion. The answer is the

latter. To give you an example. We have to impose a

very   small  parking  fee  for  motor-cycles   and

scooters.  This  is not to make money  but  because

motor-cycles and scooters were parked all over  the

town  in  a haphazard fashion, even along  passage-ways  and  under buildings. There were  not  enough

parking spaces for scooters in the central area  of

the  city.  As a net result, we had to impose  fees

for  parking.  The object is to see that  they  are

parked in an orderly way. Certainly the five or ten

cents charge has not been put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



on as a tax measure. But with the growth of traffic

in  the  city  and the increase in  the  number  of

vehicles, I am afraid we have to extend the  places

where  we  allow cars to park. The underground  car

park at Raffles Place is full every day, and so  is

the  multi-storey car park in Telok Ayer. We intend

to  build  a  few more car parks and we are  hoping

that  private enterprise will also build some.  The

whole  object is to provide adequate parking spaces

and   to  ease  traffic  congestion.  Some  of   my

officials think that we should keep cars out of the

city  and stop them perhaps somewhere near  Kallang

Park and ask their occupants to come by buses.  But

I  am  going into deeper problems and if I  do  not

stop, I will go on to mass transit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister  did not get my point. Taxis  are  usually

parked outside hotels. But if the taxi drivers want

to  come into the hotel grounds in order to pick up

passengers,  they  have to pay  a  certain  sum  of

money,  as  much  as $40 per month. Therefore,  the

Planning  and Chief Building Surveyor's Department,

when   approving  plans  for  hotels,  should  make

provision for parking spaces for taxis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which the Minister has not answered

me  is  whether  he  will consider  increasing  the

parking spaces for taxis at Raffles Place and other

places where there are shopping centres so that  it

will be convenient for tourists to call for a taxi.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, like the Minister for

Communications, I am not aware of this $40 a  month

fee which has to be paid.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> That is why I am bringing up

the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Is this fee paid to the hotel?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> This amounts to extortion and

blackmail.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if it is blackmail and illegal,

why appeal to me? Surely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



a  taxi  can  go  into the hotel grounds  to  bring

passengers. Sometimes, it is the other  way  round.

Some  taxi drivers extort from passengers. This  is

one  case where the hotels are extorting from  taxi

drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for parking lots, I think the Member is aware

that  taxis are not allowed in hourly parking lots.

This   is   prohibited  under  the  Motor  Vehicles

(Parking   Places)  Rules,  1959.   However,   this

prohibition   has   been   relaxed    in    certain

circumstances where taxis find it necessary to park

within a parking place on payment for reasons other

than  the  purpose of plying for hire  during  such

period.  For  instance, letting  down  tourists  in

shopping  areas and having to wait  for  them.  But

then  when we allow them to do this, cases of abuse

arise  and,  from time to time, have been  reported

and  action has been taken where taxi drivers  have

tried to ply for hire from parking places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for providing more taxi stands, we will look

into  it.  But as I have said just now, it  is  not

only  a  question of parking spaces for  taxis  but

parking  spaces  for the general public.  With  the

increasing number of vehicles on the road, we  need

more and more parking spaces.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

request the Minister to instruct the Superintendent

of  Car  Parks that in the marking out  of  parking

lots,   he   should   be  more   discriminate   and

considerate to shopkeepers and have regard  to  the

type  of  business  and the loading  and  unloading

activities which they have to perform.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Car Parks

over 10,000  parking lots. Invariably, all  licensed

godowns  fronting parking places are provided  with

loading and unloading bays, whilst other individual

requests are considered on the merits of each case.

On  receipt of an individual request, a  census  is

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1207 (contd) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1207 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1551.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, it is undeniable that since

1959, when the P.A.P. came to power, the Government

has   been  looking  into  the  problem  of   rural

development.  The  Government has  been  allocating

large  sums of money every year to improve the  lot

of  the people in the rural area. This deserves our

praise.  However, the same position does not  apply

to  my  constituency. It has now been designated  a

developed  area.  I  do not know  whether  this  is

fortunate or unfortunate for us. As Jurong has been

designated  a  developed area,  the  earning  of  a

livelihood here is more difficult



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



than in other constituencies. Applications for  any

project must go through many departments, and  must

pass through the hands of many kuans, that is,  the

Chief  Building Surveyor's Department, the Planning

Department  and  also the Jurong Town  Corporation.

After   an  application  has  gone  through   these

departments, it will be sent to the Urban and Rural

Services  Committee for approval.  After  this,  it

will  be sent to the Projects Committee. Only after

it has been approved by this committee will work on

the  project commence. Just imagine! An application

has  to go through many departments. Naturally this

is  a  great  waste of time. Usually it  will  take

about  one  or two years before work on  a  project

will   commence.  Roads  which  should  have   been

repaired  are  neglected. In the  course  of  time,

their condition begins to deteriorate. In the  end,

the  Government has to incur more money  to  repair

the roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. If an application is sent

to  a  certain  department for  approval,  it  will

usually shirk its responsibility and will not  deal

with  it. This is what I was complaining about  the

other  day - the roundabout way an application  has

to  go  through. It may well be that after  two  or

three years there will be no definite reply whether

a  project  can be undertaken. The Urban and  Rural

Services  Committee  may not  be  in  favour  of  a

certain project for various reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case where it is necessary to metal a

road. Of course. I myself will not agree to a rural

track  being  metalled  if  the  place  is  to   be

developed very soon. However, even applications for

minor repairs have been turned down. I would appeal

to   the  Minister  to  consider  the  applications

favourably,  as  the rural people also  pay  taxes.

Therefore,  as  taxpayers, they  have  a  right  to

better  roads. Even if they are required to remove,

they  will have to tread along good roads. It  will

then  be  easy for them to remove. Since  they  are

obliged  to  pay taxes, they should be  given  good

roads.  What I mean to say is that if major repairs

cannot be made to certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



roads,  then  minor  repairs  should  at  least  be

undertaken.  This will alleviate the  suffering  of

the  evicted  people, because if they use  the  bad

roads  when  removing,  they may  incur  additional

expenses.  Of course, I realise that the Government

has  difficulties in matters like this. However,  I

would  urge the Parliamentary Secretary to consider

these  points. If there are certain  holes  in  the

roads,  they should be filled up so that the people

who are evicted can travel along them more easily.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Member for Jurong has been a member of the

Urban  and Rural Services Committee for some  time.

Therefore, he must have known very well the way the

U.R.S.C. goes about these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of repairs to roads,

this will depend on certain factors. The Member for

Jurong  also knows very well the factors  which  we

must  take into consideration. The Urban and  Rural

Services  Committee  gives equal  consideration  to

every  request  from  the  various  constituencies.

Jurong    Constituency    is    undergoing    rapid

development.  Therefore, the U.R.S.C. will  always

consider   carefully  the  various   requests   for

projects   in   this  constituency.  Many   places,

especially  the Jurong area, will be  developed  in

the future. In the circumstances, any request for a

project  to  be undertaken in that constituency  is

handed  over to certain departments, for  instance,

the  Jurong  Town Corporation, the Land Office  and

the  Chief Building Surveyor's Department. This  is

to  ensure that the project in question is  related

to  certain  sites which are about to be developed.

Therefore, there may be some delay in approving the

projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the requests to repair roads, the

U.R.S.C. is   always   giving   them   favourable

consideration.  Every constituency  is  allotted  a

certain  fixed provision for construction work  and

development. Therefore, the U.R.S.C. cannot approve

the  provision of hundreds of thousands of  dollars

for

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Works Department

spends  a  large sum of money every year on  public

projects  usually  exceeding  $10  million.   These

projects  include the building of  roads,  bridges,

canals and other construction work. We cannot  deny

that  the  Public Works Department has made  a  big

contribution  to  the  development  of   Singapore.

However,  there  are certain shortcomings  in  this

Department which call for remedy. I would  like  to

advance the following three points. First, is there

duplication of work when the P.W.D. is  engaged  in

the  construction of roads? For instance, in  order

to  widen a road, the P.W.D. will do away with  the

pavements along that road. After several  days,  it

will  once more construct pavements along it. There

may be a divider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



in  the  middle of a dual carriage-way. After  some

time, this divider will be removed. The road may be

turned into a one-way traffic road.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the strange thing is that after two or three

weeks  the divider is again put back in the  centre

of  the road, and once more the road becomes a dual

carriage-way. This laying and dismantling and again

re-laying  the  divider  is really  surprising  and

incomprehensible. What does all this show? It shows

that the Public Works Department normally does  not

plan   its   projects  in  advance,   and   traffic

congestion is the result. In the end, public  funds

are wasted. I hope the Minister will supervise this

Department and stop duplication of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give another example of the same

manner  of work done by the P.W.D. at the  junction

of  Rochore Canal Road. Work on the central  circus

has  been delayed for one or two years, because  it

has  been  changed  about  in  the  manner  I  have

described. I do not know if the Minister  is  aware

of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another point. When roads in the

urban  areas  have to be repaired, I  suggest  that

repair  work be done at night. The reason  is  that

traffic  is  normally  very busy  during  the  day,

especially  in the city area such as  South  Bridge

Road  and  Robinson Road. If road  excavations  are

necessary  in order to lay underground  cables,  it

will  be better to carry them out in the night.  If

they  are done in the day, they will cause  traffic

congestion because school children have  to  go  to

school  and people to their shops or offices.  This

heavy traffic will also cause accidents. So I would

ask   the   Minister  whether  he   will   consider

instructing the Department concerned to  carry  out

their  road repair work at night instead of in  the

day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question that I would like to ask the

Minister is whether or not he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



has   received  reports  of  malpractice  by   some

contractors. In my constituency I find that certain

roads  have pot-holes or cave-ins about six  months

after   they  were  made.  This  shows   that   the

foundation is not well laid. Normally there  should

be a solid base before the road can be metalled. So

if the base is not properly laid, the surface will,

of  course, cave in. I ask the Minister  if  he  is

aware   of   reports  of  malpractice  by   certain

contractors. If there are, I would like him to take

measures to deal with them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  on  rainy days, especially when the  rain  is

heavy,  you will see pools of rain water collecting

at  various  bus shelters and at pedestrian  cement

pavements  along  MacPherson Road  and  Mountbatten

Road,  and  perhaps  in other parts  of  Singapore.

Because  of  the stagnant rain water at  these  bus

shelters, people who want to board the bus have  to

step  into the rain water and so wet their  shoes,

socks and trousers before they can get into it. The

only  way  they can avoid getting wet is either  to

remain  at the bus shelters and not board the  bus,

or  to  take off their shoes and socks and roll  up

their trousers before stepping into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I request the Minister for

National  Development to instruct the  Director  of

the  Public  Works  Department to  look  into  this

matter  to see that the rain water flows  into  the

drain  and not collect and stagnate at bus shelters

and  pedestrian  cement pavements along  MacPherson

Road  and  Mountbatten Road, or in other  parts  of

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may first deal

with the Member for Bukit Ho Swee. He mentioned the

constituencies of MacPherson and Mountbatten. I  am

inclined  to ask: What about Toa Payoh or Bukit  Ho

Swee?  Apparently the problem is this. Most of  the

existing  bus shelters were constructed many  years

ago  at a time when traffic conditions were not  as

bad as they are today. In those days



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



buses  were able to stop on the metalled  carriage-way without seriously interfering with the flow  of

traffic. But now we have many more vehicles on  the

road,  and  buses cannot stop on the metalled  side

without  blocking vehicles behind  them.  So  as  a

result they go onto the side of the road. This  has

caused  land adjoining the edge of the carriage-way

to  be  damaged, resulting either in ruts or holes,

so  that,  as the Member said, passengers  get  wet

when  they  step into puddles. However, the  Public

Works Department is now constructing more and  more

proper bus bays and also carrying out rather urgent

minor  widening of certain parts of the  roads  for

these  bus bays. This will convert the land between

the  bus shelters and the edge of the road  into  a

proper  carriage-way,  and  you  can  see  some  in

Queenstown and Toa Payoh. We hope to increase  them

and lessen the plight of passengers on rainy days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now deal with the Member for Sembawang.

He  grumbles about roads and asks whether there  is

co-ordination within the P.W.D. about the  building

or  digging of roads. He must not blame the  P.W.D.

alone, because it is not the P.W.D. alone that digs

these  roads. The Public Utilities Board also  digs

roads. They dig roads to lay water and gas pipes or

electric  cables. Another board that digs roads  is

the  Singapore Telephone Board. They are quite busy

in  extending  telephone services in Singapore.  So

between  the  P.W.D., the P.U.B., and  the  S.T.B.,

there was chaos at one time. The P.W.D. would build

a  road  and metal it. Then the following week  the

P.U.B. would come along and dig it to lay a  water

pipe; they would then fill it up and metal it. Then

on  the following week the S.T.B. would come  along

and dig it up again.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> It happened to Thomson Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> This happened in the past. I

understand from my colleague, the previous Minister

for  National Development, that when he  took  over

the office of National Development, he had occasion

to call a meeting of all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



the road-diggers - if I may call them

such; and he gave them certain instruc

tions and asked them to co-ordinate.

Apparently they did it with some

success, but not sufficient, as far as I

was concerned when I took over the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two years ago I also had

occasion to call a meeting of all the

road-diggers.   They   posed   certain

questions to me. I directed that once

a road was newly surfaced or built, no

one was to dig it without the permission

of the Director of Public Works. Then

the queries came: "What happens if a

water main bursts? What happens if an

electric  cable  short-circuits?  What

happens if there is a gas leak? We cannot wait for the permission of the

Director of Public Works to attend to

these matters." Anyway, we have

settled that, and I have directed that

no department is to dig any newly-built road without the permission of

the Director of Public Works. Of course,

if a gas main is leaking, or water is

running out of a pipe, these can be

repaired immediately. This has led to

some measure of success. So if you see

a newly-built road or a newly-surfaced

road, and someone comes and digs it

the following week, please let me

know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also

wants road repairing to be done at night. This entails certain problems. It means

double pay, and not all types of work

can be done at night without bright

lights. But there have been certain cases

where, to avoid traffic jams in congested parts of the city, work has been

done at night. This has been done at

the barest minimum. But if we can

meet the question of costs, I would agree

with the Member for Sembawang that

if all road work can be done at night

- and I am told that not all road work

can be done at night - inconvenience

to the public will be lessened.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, before I withdraw my amendment,

I have two supplementary questions to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



raise. First, the Minister has said just

now that because there was no proper

liaison between certain departments

certain projects could not be properly

co-ordinated. This has led to undesirable

incidents.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my understanding, both

the P.U.B. and the Public Works Department are under the portfolio of the

Ministry of Law and National Development. Therefore, the Ministry should

have long ago taken measures to co-ordinate these departments so that such

incidents would not have happened. The

Minister has said that no such incidents

were repeated recently, but I tell him

that the same things did happen. For

instance, according to what I understand, the construction work along Mac-Pherson Road has been carried on for

half a year. So far it has not been

completed yet. I would like the Minister

to investigate why work on it has been

so slow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point the Minister

has not answered me, and that is whether he has received any reports about

malpractices by certain contractors. If

so, the number of cases reported last

year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no

doubt the Public Utilities Board and

the Public Works Department are under

the same Ministry, called the Ministry

of Law and National Development. I

can assure the Member that these are

two separate Ministries - the Public

Utilities Board being under the Ministry

of Law and the Public Works Department under the Ministry of National

Development. The only connection is

the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that nothing was done. I

told the House just now that even before I was appointed as the Minister

in charge of National Development, my

predecessor, Mr Lim Kim San, had

called a meeting in order to co-ordinate

road digging. The Singapore Telephone

Board is not under my Ministry, but

you can rest assured that the Minister

for Communications has given me full



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



powers to deal with the Telephone

Board as far as road digging is concerned. In the ultimate result, I am

responsible for road digging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for malpractices, I have not heard

of any - there may have been - but if

there are, they are dealt with by the

Public Works Department. Where the

contractor is at fault, he is either suspended for a suitable period or liquidated damages claimed against him. I

am afraid I know of no specific cases

in the last year. There may be, but I

am not aware of any.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (In Mandarm):</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's detailed

reply, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong:



(2) That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1208 be reduced by $100.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1209 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2013*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Selvadurai)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, against this subhead 2013 is a

sum of $4,250,000. As it is of an annually recurrent nature, I assume that

this represents the total cost for keeping

our streets bright at night. As this is

by no means a small sum of money, I

am just wondering what measures are

being enforced, to see that our street

liehts are maintained not only efficiently

but economically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed that on most evenings

on my way home at about 6.30 p.m.

and sometimes even earlier, quite a lot

of our street lights are already on. This

seems to me to be a waste of public

money, because during most days it is

only after seven in the evening that our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



streets become really dark. I think we

can regulate this street lighting more

efficiently. If we could delay switching

on the street lights by one hour every

night, I should imagine we could save

about 10 per cent of that $4,250,000.

which will come to about $425,000 per

annum. It is also not an uncommon

sight to see street lights left on into

the day. Sometimes even at 12 noon

you can still see the street lights are

on. We have jacked up the P.U.B.

charges, and we are asking our people

to pay more for P.U.B. biÍls, but what

are we doing to economise?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Although the lighting of rural roads in

Bukit Panjang Constituency has gone

apace, there is a fairly large stretch

along Woodlands Road which is still

unlighted. It is dark. I remember that

in the last Budget session there was

an undertaking that this stretch would

be lighted. I wonder if something could

be done about this.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> I will first deal with the

Member for Bukit Panjang. I understand practically the whole stretch of

Woodlands Road has been lighted, work

having been done towards the end of

last year. Apparently now that there

are lights, there have been requests for

the lights to be made brighter. Perhaps

there are not enough lights, but these

requests are being considered and

brighter lights will be put in when the

needs of other areas for street líghts

have been satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu grumbles about street lights coming on at

any time. He has a point, because I

myself wonder why sometimes the street

lights were on before sunset. Apparently

the answer is this. All street lights in

Singapore are at present controlled by

two types of automatic switches. First,

those controlled by electric time clocks

are set to switch on at 6.45 p.m. in the

evening and switch off at half-past six

the next morning. Some of the older

type of electric time switches cease to

operate when electric supplies are interrupted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



due to breakdowns, and this affects the time

device. Consequently, these clocks have to be reset

manually  after  electricity  supplies  have   been

restored.  In such circumstances, street lamps  may

be  on  when they should be off or vice versa until

they  are reset. Hence the Member's query and mine.

There   are   apparently  20,000  such   time-clock

switches  in  service,  and  it  would  cost  about

$100,000 to replace them with a more modern type of

time-clock switch which is not affected by  failure

of electricity supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of switches are those controlled

by  photo-electric  cells  which  are  switched  on

automatically  when night falls  and  switched  off

with  the  advent  of daylight.  Street  lights  in

certain  areas  which  are  controlled  by   photo-electric cells may come on and off depending on the

darkness or the brightness of the sky. As the times

of sunset and sunrise vary during the course of the

year,  so  will  those  lights  come  on  and   off

accordingly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> This is not very satisfactory.

I  would  invite the Minister concerned to  take  a

drive  from  Newton Circle all  the  way  up  north

between  6.30  p.m. and 6.45 p.m. It  is  quite  an

interesting  sight  to see that the  street  lights

seem not to be following any fixed time schedule at

all along the same stretch of road. Nevertheless. I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1200 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2014.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned with the policy relating to the

building  of  rural  roads  and  I  hope  that  the

Government will reassess it. The current policy, if

I may say so is, by and large to build gravel roads

and  not  metal  roads  in  the  rural  areas.  Our

experience  has  been  that  these  gravel   roads,

although  they are cheaper to build about - one-third

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



the  cost  of  metal  roads - tend  to  deteriorate

sooner,  and with every heavy torrential  downpour,

we  discover  that  they revert to  their  original

state in a matter of 18 months. This means that  we

have  to reapply all over again for the resurfacing

of  these roads, incurring the same amount of money

once  every 18 months. I wonder if we could instead

metal these roads piecemeal without having to metal

them  wholesale. We could do half  the  road  at  a

stretch  so  that in the long run  we  really  save

money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member has made a valid point. In

fact, the Urban and Rural Services Committee agrees

with  this  view  that when you make  up  roads  to

kampong  standards, it is better to tar them,  even

if  this costs a little more, than merely to gravel

them  and  spend less, but then you see your  money

washed  away  in 18 months. The policy  now  is  to

spend  more  money and tar these roads rather  than

just make them up with gravel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subhead relates to drainage and it is also

connected  with  floods.  I  know  that   we   have

statements  in  this House about flood  alleviation

measures,  but  I  am  really  concerned  with  the

silting  up  of  rural  drains.  I  will   not   be

exaggerating when I say that the condition of  many

of  these  drains  in  my  constituency  is  really

shocking.  Every  time we have a  heavy  rain,  the

drains  silt up and there does not seem to  be  any

kind  of recurrent maintenance to clear these  and

other water-ways so that there is a smooth flow  of

water.  Could  not  some system  be  introduced  to

maintain   these   drains,   not   merely   in   my

constituency but also in other rural constituencies

as  well?  To a large extent, this does  contribute

towards easy flooding of residential



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



areas. And this has become acute over  the

last few years.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware of this

problem. But responsibility for the drain  depends

on  where  the drain is. If it is along  a  public

road,   then  it  is  to  be  maintained  by   the

Government, either the Public Works Department  or

in  some  cases, the Ministry of Health, Cleansing

Unit.  But  there may be drains which run  through

private property, then it would be the duty or the

responsibility of the owner of the  land  to  keep

them  clean and the water flowing. Action  can  be

taken  by  the  Ministry of Health against  owners

whose drains are clogged and breed mosquitoes. But

that  is  merely a punishing action. To  get  more

positive results perhaps Members of Parliament who

have  these problems can make applications  direct

to  the  Urban and Rural Services Committee  which

will consider and approve the applications if  the

funds are available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is really a small point. It concerns

the  activities  of Building Inspectors  in  rural

constituencies. Very rigid application of the  law

quite often stands in the way of house owners  and

hut  owners  from  repairing or  renovating  their

houses whenever there is a leakage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



after  rain  or whenever there is dilapidation  or

something like that. Perhaps directives  could  be

given  to these inspectors not to be too harsh  on

these  residents.  I would have thought  that  the

main  purpose of the law is to prevent people from

actually  building  new  structures  or  extending

their  structures without getting  proper  permits

from  the  owners  as well as the  Chief  Building

Surveyor's  Department. Quite often, house  owners

are  pulled  up  by the Chief Building  Surveyor's

Department  on very small and venal  points.  Sir,

could something be done about this?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some building

inspectors  are over-zealous and do their  job  by

applying  strict  rules,  as  a  result  of  which

complaints  come  to  Members of  Parliament.  But

whenever  a  house  is rebuilt  or  repaired,  one

question  arises  and  this  sometimes  leads   to

difficulty  as  to whether or not the  landowner's

permission  and signature should be obtained.  The

landowner  is  only too happy to get  rid  of  his

tenant or occupier and, in most cases, he will not

sign.  So  we  have not applied the  rule  rigidly

here.  Members  can tell their constituents  that,

for  minor  repairs to temporary dwelling  houses,

these  can  be  approved without  the  landowner's

signature.    In   addition,   applications    for

reconstruction  of  temporary  houses  which   are

dilapidated  -  in  other  words,  demolish   and

rebuild  -  can also be made and approved  without

the  landowner's  permission.  But  there  is  one

danger to this. In many cases, they say that  they

are rebuilding the same house, but they do not and

then  they  are in trouble. They do not  need  the

landowner's permission provided they rebuild the

same house on the site. If the room is 10 feet  by

10  feet make it 10 feet by 10 feet. In that case,

you do not need the landowner's permission. But if

you  are extending the house completely, then  you

will need the landowner's permission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the same name of Mr J. F. Conceicao)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with about 90 years of history, the Botanic

Gardens is a widely used recreational ground by our

citizens and tourists from all parts of the  world.

And a large sum of money is being spent to maintain

the  greens and flowering plants. I would  like  to

suggest  to  the  Minister the introduction  of  an

entrance  fee for the Botanic Gardens so  that  the

people  will realise that the beautiful scenery  in

the  Gardens that they enjoy seeing as well as  the

other good things in life are not free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to suggest to the Minister

that  stern  action  be taken  against  people  who

litter the Botanic Gardens. Sir, if you take a walk

early in the morning in the Gardens, you will  find

a  lot  of newspapers scattered allover the ground.

The  night watchmen should be more vigilant and the

culprits  who are caught littering should be  dealt

with.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I

think there is no doubt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



of  our  intention  to ensure  the  development  of

Singapore  into  a  garden  city.  Presumably,  the

Botanic Gardens has an important role to play  in

this campaign. Yet when one looks at the staff list

of the Botanic Gardens, one is surprised to see the

dearth  of trained horticulturists in such a  staff

list.  According to the 1968 Botanic Gardens Annual

Report,  one of the curators whose field, I  think,

is  horticulture was transferred to the  Trees  and

Parks Division. This brings me to the point that it

would  be  more  efficient, in  my  view,  for  the

purpose  of  Singapore's development  as  a  garden

city,  that the Botanic Gardens and the  Trees  and

Parks Division should come under one management, so

to  speak.  We  certainly  hope  to  see  continued

success   in  the  Government's  efforts  to   turn

Singapore into a garden city. Towards this  end,  I

think  there should be more consideration given  to

generating citizen participation in this exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed on television that the Primary

Production  Department is advertising the  sale  of

garden fertilisers. I think the Botanic Gardens  or,

if  it  is  joined  up with the  Trees  and  Parks

Division  under  a  kind of joint management,  this

organisation  could  run courses  for  the  general

public or programmes of public education over radio

and on television to encourage our citizens to make

their  homes  and surroundings resemble  attractive

gardens and add more pleasure in their lives.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Katong has made many valid points. I agree with him

that  the Botanic Gardens is under-staffed. I  have

asked the Chairman of the Public Service Commission

to  advertise  locally and abroad for  more  expert

horticulturists  and  silviculturists.  With   more

qualified men on the staff, it will be possible for

lectures  to  be delivered even to members  of  the

Citizens' Consultative Committees, because  I  feel

that  it is only with mass participation that we  can achieve our object of making Singapore a garden

city. I am afraid that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



at  the  moment  it  is not possible  for  them  to

deliver lectures. They have their hands full. But I

would  ask  Members  of Parliament  to  ask  their

Citizens' Consultative Committees to go round their

constituencies and find out the barren places which

are  the  best  spots where perhaps trees  or  even

plants  and  hedges could be grown. We  could  make

this combined effort, and funds from the Urban  and

Rural  Services  Committee can  be  used  for  this

project. But when the trees, hedges or plants  have

been  planted, it will be beyond the means  or  the

present  capacity  of the Botanic  Gardens  or  the

Trees  and Parks Division to maintain them in  good

condition. I think Members will agree with me  that

it  is no use planting if your plants are half-dead

or half-baked.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have in mind is planting done by the Trees

and  Parks  Division but maintenance by members  of

the   public.   In  other  words,   the   Citizens'

Consultative  Committees should  get  together  and

choose  places  for planting, and when  the  plants

have been grown, the maintenance will be completely

done  by members of the constituency in which  case

they  will  not only maintain the plants  but  also

protect  them. With the co-operation of all Members

of  this  House, I am sure we can make Singapore  a

greener  and cleaner city within a space of  a  few

months.

seems  to have upset him. We have our litter  laws,

but  it  is  not  easy  to  catch  people  throwing

rubbish. The Botanic Gardens is now open at  night,

and when people go there, you do not expect them to

sit on the wet grass. So there is no harm in people

sitting  on newspapers. They forget, of course,  to

bring  the newspapers back with them. But  we  have

gardeners in the Botanic Gardens

the  newspapers but the people who use them.  I  am

sure  he will agree with me that we need more  open

spaces  in  Singapore,  like the  Botanic  Gardens,

MacRitchie  Reservoir and Seletar Reservoir,  where

not  only  the old but also the young can get  away

that  a  cleaner place can be achieved? My question

is  this. A token amount as entrance fee is  to  be

introduced  at the gate. Can the Minister  tell  us

when  this  will be introduced so that  people  can

Gardens, but the main job of the watchmen is not to

watch the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a charge we have been considering whether

or  not  to impose a charge, even though a  nominal

one,  to get the message across that everything  is

not  free  in  Singapore. At  this  stage  we  have

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the time has now come for us

to  look  into  the  efficiency of  the  ambulance

services.  I  believe  that  to  phone   for   the

ambulance  and get it is quite an experience  now.

The  telephone call is received all right, but all

kinds  of  questions are asked; for instance,  who

the  patient is and what he is suffering from. All

kinds  of irrelevant questions are asked and quite

often the person calling for the ambulance is  not

able  to  answer  them. Is this really  necessary?

Because  if  the person asking for  the  ambulance

knows what the patient is suffering from, then, of

course,  he  may not have called the ambulance  in

the  first  instance. It can be quite embarrassing

and  it is also causing a fair amount of confusion

in the minds of the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wish to raise two minor points in respect

of   two   hospitals  in  my  constituency  namely

Middleton  Hospital  and Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital.

When  one  passes  by  these two  hospitals  along

Moulmein   Road,  one  gets  a  very  gloomy   and

unhealthy feeling when one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



sees  the  drab  frontage of  Middleton  Hospital.

There is lalang growing beside the iron bars. I am

just wondering whether some face-lifting cannot he

done  to the frontage of Middleton Hospital.  With

our  present policy of making Singapore  a  garden

city, perhaps that portion of the hospital can  be

improved by planting flowering plants so  that  it

can look more graceful and also take away the drab

atmosphere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago a Member of this House mentioned

his  very  unpleasant experience in a hospital  in

relation  to the rude conduct of  a  nurse.  There

could  have  been  many reasons for  that  nurse's

behaviour. At this juncture, I do not know exactly

the  reason which prompted her to behave  in  that

manner.   But  perhaps  her  behaviour  could   be

attributed  to  the fact that she was  overworked.

Someone has drawn my attention to the fact that in

the   third-class  ward  where  there   are   many

patients,  there are insufficient nurses  to  look

after  them. They are, in fact, overworked. I  had

one  occasion to visit one of the hospitals myself

and  I  observed the conditions there. But  unlike

the  Member  who was unfortunate to experience the

rudeness of a nurse, I found that our nurses  were

in fact very diligent and dedicated. Therefore,  I

was  very surprised to hear the complaint  of  the

Member.  I  have also found that the work  in  the

hospital  is too heavy for the present  number  of

nurses to cope with, I would like to say the other

way  round  about them. If at all we want  to  say

anything about their work, it is that they are  in

fact working very hard and they deserve our praise

instead of criticism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason which has prompted me to have a

very  high  regard  for  our  nurses  is  this.  I

remember  one occasion when I turned on the  radio

and  there  was  a programme called Nurses'  Week.

This is one of the programmes that are put on  the

air  every week. It is a week which the nurses set

aside  as  a dedication to their noble profession.

This  programme shows a number of activities which

focus attention on the nurses' dedication to their

work and the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



nobility  of their profession. Coming back  to  our

own  nurses,  generally speaking,  they  are  quite

aware  of their responsibility and the nobility  of

their  profession. My observation is  that  - and  I

think  many people have also expressed this opinion

-  the  nurses have made valuable contributions  to

the  well-being of the people, and from their  work

in  the  hospitals, we can say that they  have,  in

fact, tried their very best. I would like to pay  a

tribute  to  them. Perhaps the Minister  for  Health

would  like to show some appreciation of  the  hard

work  that  they  are putting in by employing  more

nurses to lighten their load.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first I would like to deal with the

matter  raised by the Member for Bukit Panjang.  He

says  that  whenever  a  telephone  call  for   the

ambulance  service is made, a number  of  questions

are asked by the person in charge of ambulances. He

says  that these questions are irrelevant. At first

sight, they may appear to be irrelevant, but  there

is  a  reason  for  asking  the  questions.  It  is

essential  to  have  certain  information  when  an

ambulance  is called. First, we must establish  the

identity  of  the  person who is  calling  for  the

ambulance in order to determine the genuineness  of

the call. There have previously been numerous false

ambulance  calls and the asking of these  questions

has reduced them to some extent. The reason why  it

is  necessary to know where the patient is and what

he  is  suffering  from is that  the  call  can  be

answered  by the ambulance nearest to the  patient.

For  example, the  Thomson Road  General  Hospital

provides  a 24-hour ambulance service, and  if  the

patient  is nearer to that hospital or around  that

area,  it will be faster if an ambulance is  called

from  that hospital. Therefore, the question asking

for  that  information is certainly not irrelevant.

If  a patient is suffering from an injury caused by

an  accident, then the call is directed to the Fire

Brigade ambulance. Of course, one question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



which  is  usually asked is, "May I  know   who  is

calling?" Sometimes the person who is in charge  of

the telephone may not ask it in a polite manner. He

may  ask, "Who are you?" We have issued a directive

to  all  persons in charge of the ambulance service

to  be  polite to members of the public  when  they

call for an ambulance.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Moulmein, he said that

whenever  he  passed  the  two  hospitals  in   his

constituency, he had a gloomy feeling about  it.  I

do  not  know whether it is the appearance  of  the

hospitals  or  whether  it  is  because  they   are

hospitals. I agree with him that it is good to make

hospitals attractive. But the trouble is that these

two  hospitals  in his constituency  are  very  old

buildings, and a lot of money is needed to  do  any

form of face-lifting. But whatever can be done will

certainly be done to make them more attractive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which the Member made concerned

the  behaviour  and  work  of  the  nurses  in  the

hospitals. He did take the opportunity to pay  them

a  high tribute. That, of course, is welcome and  I

shall   convey   that  message   to   the   nurses,

notwithstanding the fact that the Member himself is

a trade unionist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case of rudeness was brought up by the Member

for Punggol. In this respect, may I say that in any

organisation there is bound to be a black sheep. Of

course,  the  rude  behaviour of  the  black  sheep

should not necessarily reflect on the good work  of

the majority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the medical services in our country can be

considered as one of the best in South-east  Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



acknowledged fact of which the people of Singapore

can  be  proud. The medical services have improved

in  many  ways recently, but there is  still  more

room  for  improvement. For  instance,  we  should

expand and improve the services of the Outram Road

General Hospital casualty ward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often I have been around this casualty ward

and  I see that it is very busy and crowded. There

are  many  patients, and many  of  those  who  are

injured have to wait for more than an hour or  two

before  they  are admitted. If the  Minister  says

that this is due to inadequate staff, then my view

is  that  perhaps they lack efficiency. I hope  he

will  do  something to improve the  efficiency  of

this  casualty ward, so that our medical  services

can become even better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of

all, may I thank the Member for Thomson for saying

that  our  medical services have greatly  improved

recently.  May  I also add that I agree  with  him

that there is always room for further improvement.

He  mentioned the Emergency Unit as a place  where

there could be more improvement. He also mentioned

that  whenever  he visits it, he finds  it  rather

crowded. May I give him the reasons?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have only two Emergency Units for the whole

Hospital  and  the  other is at the  Thomson  Road

General  Hospital.  There are  normally  only  two

doctors  manning the Emergency Unit and in certain

hours  it  is reduced to one doctor at the  Outram

Road  General  Hospital Emergency  Unit.  Formerly

there was only one doctor on duty at all times. So

there is improvement in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time taken to attend to an emergency case

depends  on  how busy the Emergency  Unit  is, in

cases  of  dire emergency, the patient  is  rushed

through  as  quickly as possible, cutting  through

the queue of waiting persons. However the majority

of cases which go to this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



Emergency Unit are not really emergency cases.  In

the  past year there has been an increase  in  the

number   of  non-emergency  cases  attending   the

Emergency Unit. Therefore, it invariably takes  up

a  good  deal  of the staff's time to  screen  and

examine them, and, as a result, the time spent  in

attending  to them has taken away the  time  which

should   be  devoted  to  truly  emergency  cases.

However, the problem is under constant review  and

we  have  made certain other improvements  in  the

organisation of the Emergency Unit. We  have  made

more  space available so that more doctors can  be

put on duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another solution to this problem which I have

stated  before is to direct persons who  come  for

non-emergency  treatment to  the  nearest  private

practitioner who opens after office hours. A  list

of these clinics has been supplied to the Ministry

by  the  Singapore  Medical Association.  However,

there  is  no complete solution to guarantee  that

persons attending the Emergency Unit will not have

to  wait.  There  must be adequate facilities  and

sufficient medical staff. There must also  be  co-operation between doctors in private practice  and

the  Government  service  and  the  public  should

understand  the  actual  role  of  the   Emergency

Service, i.e. if the cases are of a non-emergency

nature,  they should not go to the Emergency  Unit

and clog up the work of the doctors there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is hoped that with the taking over

of  the British Military Hospital at Alexandra  in

1971,  the pressure on the Emergency Service  will

be decreased and consequently the waiting time can

be brought down.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, everyone is

aware  that  in  order  to provide  better  medical

services   for   the  people  of   Singapore,   the

Government   has   set   up   out-patient   clinics

throughout  the  island. These out-patient  clinics

are  set  up with the money derived from the  taxes

that Government collects from the people, and these

clinics belong to the state. They are owned by  the

people  of  Singapore. However, certain doctors  in

these  out-patient clinics treat these  clinics  as

their  own  personal property, totally disregarding

the public interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on one occasions some members

of  the  national volleyball team and I went  to  a

certain inoculation centre for inoculation. It  was

about 1.30 p.m and there was a slight drizzle. Many

people  were queueing up for inoculation in a  very

orderly  manner  in  front of  the  porch  of  this

clinic, to shelter from the rain. They were waiting

for  the arrival of the doctor. He arrived  in  his

car.  However,  when he saw them  standing  on  his

parking  lot, he sounded the horn to warn  them  to

clear out. But because it was raining at that time.

it  was unreasonable of him to ask them to get  out

of  the  porch. At first I intended to reason  with

him,  but  before  I could approach  him  I  saw  a

signboard  fastened to the pillar with  the  words,

"Private Reserved Parking Space". So I gave up  the

idea.  But I still am of the opinion that all these

inoculation  centres are set up by the  Government,

and the porches at these centres are also built  by

the  Government. They are not built by the  doctors

themselves. How can they abuse their privilege  and

monopolise the use of the porches? It is common  to

see  doctors making use of these porches  as  their

parking  lots.  Even in the MacPherson  Out-patient

Clinic,  which  is  in  the  constituency  of   our

Minister, that is no exception.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



6.30 p.m



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures does the Minister intend to take to

deal with this kind of conduct?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point relates to the attitude of the

nurses  at  the out-patient clinics.  Just  now  my

colleague,  the Member for Moulmein,  paid  a  fine

tribute to their work. However, I cannot agree with

him  on this point. I spoke at great length on  the

attitude of the nurses when the Budget was  debated

last year. There are still some nurses who are very

contemptuous  of  the  patients.  I  have  received

complaints  by  the  residents  and  I  myself  had

occasion to witness an incident. It was like  this.

An  elderly woman who was very ill was taken to the

MacPherson  Outpatient  Clinic  for  treatment.  On

arriving  there she vomited and dirtied the  place.

At  that  very moment a nurse came along.  She  was

quite  beside herself. She screamed and shouted  at

this poor woman. This elderly woman was very ill and  probably the fact that she had travelled a  long

distance on bumpy roads to the clinic caused her to

vomit.  This particular nurse by not rendering  any

help  to  her  was  already  making  a  very  grave

mistake;  but  to show callousness towards  such  a

patient  was to add insult to injury. Many patients

at the clinic were very unhappy about this incident

and  tried  to argue with the nurse.  She,  with  a

scornful look, walked away. Since she dared to show

her  insolence and rudeness before so many  people,

you  can  imagine  what more she  could  have  been

capable of. I wonder whether the Minister has noted

such rudeness and irresponsibility shown by some of

the nurses and, if so, what measures he intends  to

take to deal with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Moulmein paid a tribute

to the nurses, but now I am doing the contrary -  I

am criticising them. I would like the Minister to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



convey  to  the nurses who work in his Ministry  my

feelings  of  dissatisfaction  with  them  and   my

criticism of them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed

in  a  very  interesting position! The  Member  for

Moulmein has asked me to convey his tribute  to  my

nurses, and now I have been asked by the Member for

Paya Lebar to convey to them his criticism of their

rudeness  to members of the public. I shall  convey

both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are altogether 27 out-patient

dispensaries scattered all over Singapore to  serve

the public. For the year 1969 there were 47 doctors

and   83   nurses  working  in  these   out-patient

dispensaries. The total number of out-patients seen

and  treated was 1,573,171 in 1969. But the  number

of  complaints regarding rudeness received  against

the  doctors and nurses in 1969 was only  six.  The

two instances of rudeness which the Member for Paya

Lebar has narrated to this House were not, however,

among these six complaints of rudeness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the out-patient dispensaries, the doctors and

nurses  are  in constant contact with  the  public.

Large  crowds  are seen there daily,  and  in  such

large  crowds  there are bound to  be  patients  of

different temperaments, and some of them  may  make

unreasonable  demands. When their demands  are  not

met,  they do sometimes make rude remarks and lodge

official complaints. However, the staff of the out-patient  dispensaries have frequently been reminded

to  be courteous to members of the public. This  is

done   by   routine  inspections   of   out-patient

dispensaries    by   senior    members    of    the

administrative office of the Out-patient  Services.

Whenever a complaint is received, a visit  is  made

to  the  particu1ar out-patient dispensary  and  an

investigation is carried out. The officer concerned

is  asked  to  give an explanation  and  a  written

report  of the incident. He is also called  up  and

interviewed. If it is felt that there is still room

for  improvement in his conduct, then he is warned

and advised to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



less  abrupt and more helpful in his dealings  with

the  public.  In  general, the staff  of  the  out-patient  dispensaries have been told to  be  always

polite to the people and to be sympathetic to their

requests. But in dealing with such a large crowd of

patients,  there  are likely  to  be  instances  of

frayed  tempers,  and  these are  investigated  and

dealt with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now, out of the six complaints

received,  every  one of them was investigated  and

was found to be unsubstantiated. Unfortunately, the

Member for Paya Lebar did not see fit to submit his

complaint  to  me. If he had done  so,  the  matter

would  have  been  properly investigated.  It  will

greatly assist the work of my Ministry to provide a

courteous  and  efficient medical  service  to  the

public  if  Members can give specific instances  of

rudeness  by  the staff of the Ministry immediately

upon  their occurrence either to me or my  Director

of  Medical  Services, and not  bring  them  up  in

Parliament.  Of  course, if we did  not  adequately

deal  with the complaint, the Member could air  the

matter  in Parliament. Unfortunately, this was  not

done.  What we need is a specific complaint, backed

by  witnesses if necessary, so that the complainant

can  assist the Ministry in identifying the officer

concerned and the case dealt with properly. As  you

know, in any incident there are always two sides to

the story. It is only fair that both sides must  be

heard and considered. However, if the complaint  is

substantiated, disciplinary action  will  be  taken

against  the officer concerned. As Members know,  I

am  not  a person who will flinch from taking  firm

and  drastic  action  against any  officer  who  is

guilty  after the case has been fairly  and  justly

considered, whatever the consequences. A vague  and

general  allegation will certainly not help  us  at

all.  As  a  matter  of fact, my Ministry  welcomes

substantiated complaints, not only from Members but

also   from  members  of  the  public.  We   regard

substantiated complaints as a means of intelligence

report that tells us whether the operations of  the

Ministry  have  been  carried out  efficiently  and

successfully.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has no less than 20,000 members - about 10,000 in the Hospitals Division and 10,000

in  the  Public Health Division. Unless we  have  a

system  of  feed-back  by members  of  the  public,

including   Members,  who  can  make  substantiated

complaints,  there is no good way in which  we  can

know  whether  every one of the 20,000  members  is

working  efficiently.  I  myself  can  make   field

visits, which I often do, but the snag here is that

when they know that I am coming, everything appears

all right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in any organisation there are

bound  to  be a few black sheep whose bad behaviour

brings  a  bad name to the whole organisation.  Our

problem  is to identify these few black  sheep  and

take  tougher action against them. With a  view  to

making it easier for members of the public not only

to  identify these few black sheep but also, on the

other  hand,  to  commend those  officers  who  are

courteous   and   efficient,  I  have   last   year

introduced  a  system whereby every officer  in  my

Ministry has to wear a name tag. This is to  ensure

that these few black sheep should not get away with

their  anonymity  and  mar the  good  name  of  the

majority of our doctors and nurses who are working,

in the words of the Member for Moulmein, "very hard

to  maintain the best medical service in this  part

of the world."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised by the Member for Paya Lebar is

about  porches  being used by doctors  for  parking

cars.  Of  course, they are used for that  purpose.

The Member asked whether patients should be allowed

to  take shelter under the porches if it rains.  Of

course, to a doctor who has humanity at heart, I am

sure  that  irrespective  of  directives  from  the

Ministry,  he will allow human beings, rather  than

his car, to take shelter under the porch.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I am not very satisfied with the reply given by the

Minister.  For  example,  in  the  MacPherson  Out-patient  Clinic, there is a big compound. At  least

30  cars can be parked in the compound. Why  should

the  doctor  attached to that clinic park  his  car

under  the porch and not in the compound and  allow

the patients to stand in the sun or in the rain?



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot

understand the point of the Member for Paya  Lebar.

If  it  is a porch for a car, then it must be  used

for  a car. Is the Member suggesting that the porch

be  used  as a waiting place for patients and  that

the  car should be parked elsewhere? If that is his

suggestion, then we will look into it. But  as  far

as I am concerned, there has not been any complaint

that  there  is  insufficient  waiting  space   for

patients in the clinic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that the Minister for Health

told this House during Question time on the 22nd

of December, 1969 [cols. 175-6], that the work of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



the  Industrial  Health Unit will be  expanded  to

include the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to assess the occupational health problem in

Singapore  by selected examinations and evaluation

of the working environment of our workers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to study and draw up preventive measures

appropriate to local conditions;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to formulate procedures for periodical

medical  examinations  as a control  on  hazardous

occupational groups;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) to undertake factory inspection of working

environmental   conditions  and   enforcement   of

relevant  sections of the Factories Ordinance  and

related    occupational   legislation,    normally

administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Labour,  with

reference to the health of the workers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) to advise and give information on

occupational health to industries;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) to prepare codes of practice and

modifications    to   present   legislation    and

subsequent implementation;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) to undertake research and teaching in

connection  with  the primary  objectives  of  the

occupational health programme in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure workers at large do welcome the

Minister's  concern for their health and  welfare,

and would be grateful if all the objectives of the

Industrial   Health  Unit  could   be   fulfilled.

However,  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  it  is  hard  to  be

convinced  that the health of the workers  can  be

well  taken  care  of  by the proposed  Industrial

Health  Unit. The proposed plan provides for  only

one  senior health officer, while I consider  that

more  than  one  doctor will be required  to  look

after  the  industrial  health  of  around  80,000

workers   in  the  manufacturing  industries.   An

authority,   the  President  of  the  Society   of

Occupational Medicine, in an article reproduced in

a



souvenir  magazine commemorating a public forum  on

"Health,  Labour and Productivity", in  conjunction

with  World  Health Day, estimated  that  at  least

five  doctors  would be required to  run  the  Unit

efficiently, besides being adequately  staffed  and

equipped. The differences in the reckonings of  the

Ministry  and  the  President  of  the  Society  of

Occupational  Medicine are too wide apart  to  make

both  right. One must be terribly off the  mark.  I

am   convinced  that  the  Industrial  Health  Unit

requires more than one doctor to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



function  satisfactorily.  Will  the  Minister  for

Health make a categorical statement that one doctor

will  be  sufficient to achieve fully the programme

laid out by him?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine the dramatic changes that have

been  brought  about  by the Minister  for  Health.

Instead  of an ad hoc inter-departmental industrial

health committee, we have a permanently established

Industrial  Health  Unit within the  Public  Health

Division.  Instead of having a doctor shuttling  to

and  from  the Ministry of Health and  the  Factory

Inspectorate on two mornings each week, we  have  a

full-time  senior health officer  attached  to  the

industrial  Health Unit. In addition, there  is  an

inspector  of  Factories pinched from  the  Factory

Inspectorate.  There  are  also  going  to  be  two

trainee  public health inspectors and  two  student

nurses   at  the  earlier  stages,  if  I  presume

correctly.  Without casting any aspersions  on  the

incumbents  of  the two latter mentioned  posts,  I

would  like  to say that this is the  biggest  joke

ever  played by the Minister for Health so far.  It

will  take  a  couple of years  more  before  these

trainee public health inspectors and student nurses

qualify  and  gain  experience  in  the  field   of

industrial health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that the Minister for Health had the

greatest audacity to announce in Parliament on  the

22nd of December 1969, that there were going to  be

a  full-time medical officer - this is granted now -

an   industrial   hygienist  with  an   engineering

background, and eight other professional  and  non-professional staff. It is agreed there will be  one

stenographer,  one general clerical assistant,  one

watchman  and  one  office boy.  The  Minister  for

Health  knows  as well as I do that the  Industrial

Health   Unit   does   not  depend   so   much   on

stenographers,  clerks, watchmen and  office  boys.

Where are the professional staff that he knows will

give  adequate industrial health services? I  think

the  Industrial  Health Unit is  under-staffed  and

rickety  and  will  be unable to  realise  all  the

objectives  laid  down  by the  Unit.  I  hope  the

Minister for Health will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>



able to assure this House that the Industrial

Health Unit will not be like some bogus insurance

companies that we can find in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what has gone wrong between 22nd December,

1969, and now? If I have my finger at the right

point, I think it is the Treasury boys who are

against the plan of the Ministry of Health just as

they were against the upgrading of the post of

Chief Inspector of Factories and the stepping up of

the expansion of the Factory Inspectorate. Probably

the Treasury bureaucrats who sit in their cool,

clean and comfortable offices are not very

convinced that Singapore's economic progress

depends partly on the health of the workers. The

Minister for Health will be rest assured that all

workers and thinking people are behind him in his

fight, if he makes it his fight, with the Treasury

to get a bigger allocation for the Industrial

Health Unit. I would have been able to thank the

Minister for Health heartily if he had set up the

Industrial Health Unit on a more sound basis. I

hope the Minister for Finance will take note that

it is important to safeguard the health of the

workers in the course of industrialising the

country, for here lies the future of Singapore.

Industrial Health Unit appears to be a very

favourite subject of the Member for Kallang. He

appears to have a lot of knowledge of what is

going on. May I just tell him that Rome was not

built in a day and so is our Jurong industrial

estate? It takes time to build up the Industrial

Health Unit. As he has admitted, progress has been

made because formerly we only had an ad hoc unit

and now we are about to establish a full unit.

Certainly it should have given him much pleasure to

know that progress has been made. May I also say

that a medical officer will be immediately

appointed to head the Industrial Health Unit? A

second medical officer will be sent on a one-year

World Health Organisation fellowship to be trained

in industrial health in the United Kingdom in

initial   period  of  familiarisation  with   local

factory  conditions, he will be sent  overseas  for

specialised  training. The 1970-71 Estimates,  into

which  I am sure the Member for Kallang has looked,

also  provide  for  the recruitment  of  subsidiary

technical   staff,   i.e.,   two   Public    Health

Inspectors,   one  Inspector  of   Factories,   two

industrial nurses and clerical staff. More  doctors

will be recruited if experience shows that this  is

necessary.  In  other words, the Treasury  has  not

been that uncooperative.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

not  apologise  to the Minister for Health  for  my

great  concern  for the health and welfare  of  the

workers.  After  all,  I am a trade  unionist  and,

being  the people's representative in Kallang which

has factories and where the residents go to work in

the  factories, naturally I must show some concern,

if  not  serious concern, for the health and safety

of  the  workers. However, since the  Minister  has

assured  this House that he proposes to expand  the

Unit  as  time  goes  by, and I  believe  that  the

Ministry  of Finance has shown greater co-operation

and  probably will show greater co-operation in the

future, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr J. F. Conceicao)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is realised and generally agreed that we

must  industrialise rapidly. I  hope  that  in  the

course  of  industrialisation,  we  do  not  forget

problems arising from industrial activities. One of

these  problems is that of water and air  pollution

caused  by  refineries, steel works, cement  works,

foundries, quarries, power stations and other forms

of  industrial  undertakings. Sir, ten  years  ago,

before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



we  began  to  industrialise, the problem  did  not

cause much concern. Even the Ministry of Health did

not   reckon  that  the  problem  required  special

attention  and  forward planning,  as  was  in  the

Annual Report of 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote one instance where the

Ministry  of Health has failed the people  in  this

direction.  The  Ministry seems not  to  have  been

bothered  in  the  least about  the  health  hazard

caused  by  cement  dust to the  health  of  school

children  and  teachers at Towner  School,  Whampoa

School,  Balestier Mixed Boys and Girls School  and

also to the health of the residents staying at  the

Government  quarters along McNair Road  and  Towner

Road.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents, out of concern for the health of the

school  children,  teachers  and  themselves,  have

complained  about the dust which they have  had  to

breathe almost 24 hours a day for many years past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this cement factory has a fleet

of  tracks  which run at intervals of approximately

ten  minutes and, in the course of transporting the

cement,  have to pass along the schools and  houses

along  Towner  Road  and McNair  Road.  When  these

trucks  pass by, a thick dust of cement  fills  the

air.  It  covers  the houses, cars,  furniture  and

other  household effects. Washing  is  made  dirty.

Health becomes endangered. The residents waited and

waited  for some form of action to be taken by  the

Ministry of Health. It is my understanding that the

Ministry of Health had proposed some measures,  but

they  were ineffective because there were no built-in  dust trapping devices. However, the factory was

allowed to continue its operations during all these

years.  How  long  more will the residents,  school

children and teachers in the area have to  suffer?

The residents, frustrated at having to wait for the

Ministry  of  Health to do something positive,  re-directed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



their  complaint  to  the Prime Minister's  Office.

This may be a surprise to the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It is no surprise to me.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

cement factory is not the only factory causing  air

pollution.  However, I am glad that the  Government

will be taking measures to combat the pollution  of

air   and  water  in  Singapore.  I  think  we  are

fortunate in having a Prime Minister who  does  not

like  smoke  to  such an extent that  he  will  not

address  a group meeting if there is smoking  going

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the issue under consideration,

Sir,  I  am informed by the Prime Minister's Office

that  the  cement  factory  will  be  relocated  to

another  site  as  soon  as  negotiations  for   an

alternative site have been finalised.  Four  and  a

half months have passed since the representation to

the  Prime  Minister's  Office  was  made.  If  the

Minister for Health is so concerned - I hope he will

be   concerned  about  this  problem - he  will   do

something  quickly to solve this problem  which  is

affecting the health of the people staying in  that

part of Kallang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, air pollution in Singapore is

caused at the present moment more by vehicles  than

by  factories.  In spite of what  the  Registry  of

Vehicles and the Police may have boasted they  have

done,  they  have been total failures in  punishing

culprits  responsible for air  pollution.  I  think

more   drastic  measures  must  be  taken  by   the

authorities  as  a  whole in combating  atmospheric

pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health may want to believe that

the  problem  of  air  pollution  is  but  a  minor

nuisance.  But I do not think so. I  do  not  think

that  the  condition  of  our  public  and  private

vehicles can compare more favourably than  that  of

the  public  and private vehicles in  other  places

where  the  density of population is comparable  to

that  of  Singapore. The maintenance  consciousness

among vehicle owners in Singapore is truly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



shocking. One can witness hundreds of cars, lorries

and buses emitting black fumes and smoke, and still

the  drivers and owners get off scot-free. It  must

be  realised  that petrol engines  also  cause  air

pollution.  According to some studies made  in  the

U.S.A. and  Australia, petrol vehicles cause  some

60.6 per cent of total air pollutant in the air and

emits  92.9  per  cent  of  total  carbon  monoxide

emitted by all sorts of air pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the Minister for Health to

press  for  legislation to make  it  necessary  for

vehicles  to  undergo a stringent test  every  five

years.  The owners of such vehicles should be  made

to  rectify all faults before the vehicles could be

allowed on the road again. Any owner who uses  such

a   vehicle   against  the  instructions   of   the

authorities   should  be  brought  to   book,   and

persistent  offenders should  have  their  vehicles

confiscated  and condemned, and no vehicles  should

be  auctioned  by the Government itself  until  the

faults have been rectified. It must not try to make

a quick profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, those who market bulk petrol should

be  made to reach an agreement among themselves not

to  market lead added fuel. I have received  advice

from  some  competent authority  that  if  all  oil

companies do not compete with one another by adding

lead additives, we would probably make some headway

to reduce air pollution. One other measure which we

can  take  at  this stage is possibly  to  make  it

necessary  for  ships  to fit  anti-smoke  devices.

Factory  chimneys should be made  tall  enough  and

anti-smoke and dust traps should be installed.  For

factories discharging effluence, properly  designed

traps should be installed to minimise discharge  of

harmful effluence into the sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I hope the Minister will

accept  my suggestion that in order to keep an  eye

on  the  problem of air pollution, a council should

be  set  up as soon as possible comprising  doctors

and  engineers from the Industrial Health Unit, the

Environmental Health Division, the Public Utilities

Board, the Public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



Works   Department,   representatives   from    the

industry,  the Automobile Association of Singapore,

and  other  relevant bodies who can  co-operate  in

this  respect.  I do not think any kind  of  inter-departmental   committee  composed  of   Government

departments   will  be  able  to  make   a   proper

assessment of this problem and combat pollution  of

our atmosphere.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

responsibility  for  environmental  health  is  one

which  everybody should shoulder.  This  point  has

been   made  abundantly  clear  during  the   "Keep

Singapore Clean" campaign.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> We have just heard the Minister

underlining this point. But there is one aspect  of

environmental degradation about which there has not

been sufficient arousal of public concern. This  is

in  respect  of  atmospheric and  water  pollution.

There  are  already rumblings in the air  regarding

the  danger of industrial pollution. We  have  just

heard  some  rumbling from the Member for  Kallang,

and  I would like to rumble in consonance with what

he has said!



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member mean fuming!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, no one can deny that

industrial waste contributes to bad air. We must be

alert  at  all  times to see what can  be  done  to

filter  the noxious fumes that emerge daily out  of

our industrial chimney stacks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned, there is gathering an

accumulation of concern about this problem.  But  I

think that the same concern, if not more, should be

expressed  over air pollution caused by  automobile

fumes.  In an article written for the 1969  edition

of the Britannica Year Book entitled Agenda for the

future,  the recent President of the United States,

Mr Lyndon Johnson, speaking on air pollution said,

'...the  automobile  is  probably the  greatest  single

poisoner of the air.' I am quoting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



from page 42 of the book. I think more positive and

firm  action  should be taken with regard  to  this

form of chemical warfare, which in the long run  is

being  directed  against  our  children,  for   the

effects  of  this pollution are slow and  insidious

and  may  not  be fully felt except by  the  coming

generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with pollution from motor vehicles,

Sir,   I   say  that  the  Health  Ministry  should

investigate  and decide what are the  standards  of

emission  of  smoke  that may be  permissible,  and

sternly enforce these standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Ministry of Communications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Good, there should be co-operation

between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry  of

Communications. It is somehow a happy  coincidence,

Sir, as I was looking through the latest edition of

the  London  Times dated 19th March, 1970,  in  the

Members' Room today I came across a letter  to  the

editor  from a public health inspector  urging  the

limitation  of  air  pollution  caused   by   motor

vehicles. The relevant point that I would  like  to

bring out from this letter is that in America there

is, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...a minimum standard whereby the emissions of

hydro  carbon  and  carbon  monoxide  are  limited.

Further it is expected that other controls will  be

introduced in the near future.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I learned from the same letter that in

Belgium there are standards enforced in relation to

pollution  from  diesel  engines.  What   are   the

standards, if any, that we set? I hope that  we  do

not  lag  behind in this respect. Just as  we  have

mobilised public concern for the cleanliness of our

city  with  regard to garbage disposal, litter  and

the  mosquito menace, in the same way  we  have  to

secure the active participation of our citizens  in

keeping our atmosphere clean. Moreover, Sir, I  say

it  is the Ministry of Health's duty also to awaken

the different relevant sectors of our Government to

their particular responsibility where air and other

forms of pollution are concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from air pollution, there is also the

question  of  contamination  of  our  streams   and

beaches.  The  Singapore River and the  beach  area

bordering  the  "Golden Mile"  frequently  exude  a

stench  which is offensive to our sense  of  smell.

Cannot something be done about this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in relation to atmospheric pollution,

there  is  the  question  of  noise.  In  the  same

newspaper which I quoted from, there is an  article

on  the danger of excessive noise to health. I will

certainly  not  bother with too many excerpts,  but

there is one point which I would like to bring out.

It is this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The financial loss from inefficiency and damage

directly or indirectly caused by noise has been put

at  something  between £1,000  million  and  £2,000

million.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is as far as the United Kingdom is concerned.

Of  course, there is the health aspect of noise  in

that  laboratory investigations have revealed  that

although  a person cannot hear a particular  volume

of  noise in his sleep, there is some effect on the

registration of his brain waves, and although noise

seems to be tolerable to the human ear, it has some

deleterious  effect  on the  animal  ear.  This  is

certainly an indication that noise has an effect on

our health. But somehow or other, I feel that there

is  no  adequate legislation to ensure that  people

show respect to each other with regard to noise.  I

have  had members of my constituency coming  to  me

and  saying  that they had lodged complaints  about

excessive  noise being emitted by certain  concerns

near their dwelling places, and all that the police

said  was  that  they  would  have  to  inform  the

development-control people, and that was  all  that

came of it. I think the Minister, with his staff of

able  helpers, should be able to find out  in  what

way we can control this problem of noise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, air and

water  pollution is again another favourite subject

of  the  Member for Kallang. I notice also that  it

has  become  a favourite subject of the Member  for

Katong! I do welcome their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



speeches  very much, because they do indicate  that

not only Members of Parliament but also members  of

the  public  are  beginning  to  be  aware  of  the

deleterious  effects  of air and  water  pollution.

Members of Parliament have expressed concern  about

the  problem of air and water pollution that we are

facing  today. May I say that I am equally, if  not

more, concerned about this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first say something about water pollution

in  Singapore? This is caused by the  discharge  of

untreated trade and domestic wastes as well as  the

throwing  of  refuse into open  drains  and  water-courses.   Water   pollution  control   accordingly

requires that such liquid wastes be discharged into

the  sewerage  system  and, where  sewers  are  not

available,  to pre-treat such liquid wastes  before

discharging  them  into  open  drains  and   water-courses.  Measures are now being taken  to  improve

water  pollution control. These include the phasing

out  of  all bucket latrines and the use, in  their

stead,  of  water-seal latrines  or  septic  tanks.

Where sewers are available, quicker connections  to

the   sewerage   system  are  being   made,   while

extensions  of  the sewerage system into  unsewered

areas are being continued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, gully-traps will be provided to drain all

liquid  wastes  from markets, hawker  centres,  and

refuse-bin    centres   of   multi-storey    flats.

Industrial   waste  waters  from   new   industrial

development   projects  will  be  required   to   be

pretreated  before discharge into  open  drains  or

watercourses,  and action will be taken  to  induce

the  management of existing trade premises to start

pre-treating  their  liquid trade  waste.  In  this

respect,  a  United Nations expert was  invited  to

study  the  water pollution problem from industrial

waste  and to advise on more effective measures  to

be taken. His assignment has been completed and his

official report is expected soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, water pollution control measures require

active    participation   by   various   Government

departments  and  statutory  boards,  besides   the

Public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



Health  Division  of  the Ministry  of  Health.  Of

course,  as  has been rightly pointed  out  by  the

Member  for Katong, the co-operation of members  of

the public must also be included.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to announce here that a working

committee,  with  my  Permanent Secretary  (Special

Duties)  as Chairman, has been formed to coordinate

and  supervise the efforts made to implement  water

pollution  control measures. This,  in  effect,  is

(Drainage  and  Marine), both of  the  P.W.D.,  the

Senior   Public   Health   Engineer,   the    Chief

Administrative  Officer (Jurong Town  Corporation),

and  representatives from the Ministry of  Finance,

together   with   a   member  from   the   Economic

Development  Board.  In other words,  progress  has

been made on the question of water pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now say something about air pollution,

which  has  been  touched on by  two  Members?  Air

pollution  is a relatively new problem in Singapore

and  has  been  brought about by the present  rapid

rate  of  industrial development. This  problem  is

aggravated by the exhaust gases from cars and taxis

and  on diesel fumes from buses and lorries, as the

two  Members  have mentioned. A W.H.O. expert,  Dr

Graham Cleary, has been requested by my Ministry to

assist,  and he has just completed a study  of  our

air  pollution problem. As a result, steps are  now

being  taken to form an Air Pollution Control  Unit

and,  based  on  his  advice  and  recommendations,

regulations to implement control measures  will  be

introduced.  Officers  will be  sent  overseas  for

training in air pollution control, after which they

will staff this new unit which is being formed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the problem of air pollution in

Singapore has not yet become critical, we are fully

conscious of the need to tackle this problem  early

as  this  will  save us a lot of effort  and  money

later    on    should    the    situation    become

uncontrollable. There again, much progress has been

made within a short space of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the specific issue of the cement

mixture  plant at McNair Road which the Member  for

Kallang  brought up. I am certainly  aware  of  the

problem  created there. Perhaps to the surprise  of

the  Member, I myself have visited the  place.  The

problem  is  to find an alternative  site  for  the

plant.   There   has  been  disagreement   on   the

alternative  site  and, as a result,  notices  have

been  sent  to the plant to comply with our  health

requirements.  If  these notices are  not  complied

with,  I  can  assure the Member for  Kallang  that

prosecution action will be instituted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> What about the problem of noise?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> This again is a new problem

which  has come about as a result of close  living,

because  of  our high-rise flats. This  is  also  a

matter  which  we will consider, and perhaps  after

due thought and consideration, legislation will  be

introduced.  But,  as Members of this  House  know,

whatever laws we promulgate, unless we get the  co-operation  of our citizens who live in these  high-

rise  flats, I do not think they will be effective.

I  hope  the Member for Katong - I believe part  of

his constituency has high-rise flats - will be able

to  persuade his constituents to accept the idea of

more gracious living.

attending to the other problem! Anyway, I will give

him a chance. If nothing is done, I shall

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1601.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, Sir, I want to express my disgust over

the appalling condition of our public conveniences,

and  the inadequacy of this provision. Perhaps  the

Minister can enlighten the House on whether he  has

any  intention to improve the situation, especially

in  view  of  the  fact that tens of  thousands  of

tourists  yearly visit Singapore and at some  stage

or  other of their wandering about town they  might

have to make use of such conveniences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I cannot agree with the

Member  for  Katong  more  on  this  point:  it  is

important   that   we  see  to   it   that   public

conveniences  are  clean,  particularly  those   in

eating  houses  or coffee shops. I agree  that  the

lavatories in some coffee shops are not nice places

to go to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that regular inspections of eating

houses  are  being  carried out  by  public  health

auxiliaries of this Ministry. Where the toilets  in

any  eating  house  are  found  to  be  dirty,  the

management  is required to clean and maintain  them

in  a  sanitary condition. Prosecutions  have  also

been taken against repeated offenders, much to  the

protest  of certain Members of Parliament in  whose

constituencies these eating houses happen to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that the number of public toilets is

inadequate  in our city. Therefore, action  is  now

being taken to remedy the situation by:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) requiring hotels and cinemas to make their

toilet facilities accessible from the outside, by

day and by night for users of car parks and members

of the public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) making the provision of public lavatories a

prerequisite  in  respect of applications  for

approval  to  put  up car  parks  for  hotels,

cinemas,  restaurants and petrol kiosks.  This

is   a  new  regulation  which  we  have  just

introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to all this, the provision of

more   toilet  facilities  is  being  planned   for

incorporation  in our urban redevelopment  schemes.

The Housing and Development Board has undertaken to

provide   permanent   public  toilets   in   newly-constructed  restaurants and eating houses,  hawker

centres,   bus   termini, etc.,   where    people

congregate.

unfortunately missed the opportunity  to  speak  on

probably I might again miss the opportunity to move

this amendment but it seems I have the time to move

it.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon and Mr Ho Kah Leong)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I know from the Minister for Health how many

constituencies  have been cleared for  resiting  of

hawkers  and how many are uncleared? In the cleared

constituencies,  the hawkers have  to  pay  licence

fees, and for any small offence, they have to pay a

line. They are also restricted to small pitches  in

the  resited  areas,  resulting  in  some  loss  of

business.  In  the  uncleared constituencies,  some

hawkers  do not have to pay licence fees  and  they

are   not  fined  for  small  offences.  I  am  not

objecting   to   the  hawkers  in   the   uncleared

constituencies enjoying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>



better  privileges, but I wish  to  point  out  the

difference in treatment given to the hawkers in the

uncleared constituencies.



I  understand  there  is a shortage  of  space  for

resiting  hawkers in the uncleared  constituencies.

However, I am not pressing that immediate action be

taken    to    resite   the   hawkers   in    these

constituencies.  I  would  like  the  Minister   to

consider withholding action against hawkers in  the

cleared  areas until all constituencies  have  been

cleared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the Ministers attention to

the  hawkers, particularly in Palmer  Road  in  the

back-lane behind the Central Provident Fund office.

These  hawkers have been shifted to a back-lane  in

Enggor Street, which is very narrow, and next to it

there  is a carpenter shop which lets off a lot  of

sawdust  flying about. The hawkers  who  depend  on

their  stalls for a living are complaining of  lack

of  business. I would therefore like to  know  from

the  Minister whether these hawkers can be  allowed

to do their business in Sambau Street instead of at

their  present  site,  and  whether  they  will  be

allowed to go back to Palmer Road later on when the

present reconstruction work there is completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that a hawker near a bus-stop

in  Keppel Road has been asked to shift his  stall,

whereas  another hawker further down the same  road

and near another bus-stop is allowed to do business

there. I presume this constituency has not yet been

cleared  for  resiting hawkers.  Generally  in  the

uncleared areas hawkers are free to ply where  they

like. Can I know why this hawker, who is also in an

uncleared  area, should not be allowed to  continue

doing  business  there? With  due  respect  to  the

Minister, may I ask him if he will reconsider  this

case   and  allow  the  hawker  to  continue  doing

business there?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise a point

about  the collection of hawkers' licence fees.  We

all know that except for a small minority



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



of  hawkers, the great majority of them lead a very

poor  life. Most of them work hard during  the  day

and  can only earn just enough to keep their family

alive.  Very  few of them have savings.  Previously

the  authorities  allowed them to  pay  their  fees

monthly.  However, as from January this  year,  the

hawkers' licence fees have been increased, and  the

new  regulation is that they must pay three months'

fees  in advance, that is to say, they must pay  at

the beginning of the month the licence fees for the

next three months. Vegetable hawkers previously had

to  pay only $6 per month, but now they have to pay

$15.  Also, they have to pay three months'  licence

fees,   i.e.,  $45,  in  advance.  Hawkers  selling

provisions  had to pay $45 per month previously  as

licence  fees. Now if they are also selling  canned

food,  they  have to pay $180 as licence  fees  for

three months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just said that the great majority of the

hawkers  are  poor and their daily income  is  just

sufficient for their livelihood. If we ask them  to

pay  their  fees for three months in one lump  sum,

are  we  not bringing hardship on them? Also  those

hawkers  who  cannot afford to pay their  fees  for

three  months in advance have to borrow,  and  they

will have to pay interest on their loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand why the authorities found it

necessary   to   change  the  system   of   monthly

collections to quarterly collections. I am not sure

whether  this  is  to  reduce the  work  of  public

servants.  If  it  is so, I think we  have  thereby

increased the hardships of the hawkers. This  is  a

most inappropriate action. I hope the Minister will

reconsider  this collection of quarterly  fees.  We

must  remember that some hawkers cannot  afford  to

pay  such  a  big sum of money and we should  allow

them to pay their fees monthly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also like to take this opportunity to

ask  the  Minister about the taking-over of markets

by  the  Housing and Development Board. All markets

are  at  present  under  the  Hawkers  Department's

control. Now the Housing and Development Board  has

also built many hawkers' centres and these are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



under  the  control of the Housing and  Development

Board. In these housing estates, chaos exists.  For

instance, in the same area, there are two types  of

hawkers'  centre. There are two organisations  with

different  systems of management. People often  get

confused,  and  this  is likely  to  give  rise  to

misunderstanding.  As far as I  know,  the  Hawkers

Department  intends  to hand over  the  control  of

these  markets to the Housing and Development Board

in  order  to centralise the administration.  These

two  bodies have carried out negotiations  on  this

matter.  I  do  not know whether the  Minister  can

inform  the House what decision has been  taken  on

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been some improvement of

the   hawkers'   situation   recently,   but   this

improvement  is only seen in some areas.  In  other

areas  it has deteriorated. In constituencies where

the   Members  of  Parliament  are  Ministers,  the

hawkers' situation is deteriorating. If you  go  to

the Kreta Ayer area, you can see that the situation

is  very bad. If you go to some other area under  a

Minister's  control, the situation  there  is  even

worse.  For  example, if you go  to  Dr  Toh  Chin

Chye's constituency, the situation there is just as

bad. Therefore, the Minister for Health should  pay

attention to those constituencies where the Members

of Parliament are Ministers. In other words, hawker

inspectors dare not go to constituencies where  the

Members of Parliament are Ministers. They only dare

go    to    ordinary   Members   of    Parliament's

constituencies. This discrimination by  the  hawker

inspectors is no good. I represent the people and I

voice their feelings here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Annamalai market, 6th m.s. Bukit Timah

Road, there was an Indian man selling food. He  was

charged  $25 for dropping some rice grains  on  the

floor after washing his dishes. On another occasion

a  vegetable hawker was fined unreasonably. He  was

fined by a hawker inspector simply because some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



of the vegetable leaves fell on to the ground after

the  customers  had selected their vegetables.  The

hawker inspectors are behaving like bulls and  that

is  why  they are called "earth bulls" in  Chinese.

Maybe  the Minister will say, "This is not done  by

me  personally."  But  when soldiers  kill  people,

their  commander  must  be  responsible  for  their

deeds.  I  hope the Minister will pay attention  to

this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the constituency of the Minister for Law and

National Development, the hawkers are hawking along

the  streets. This is really a shameful  sight  for

tourists to see. Yet we talk about making Singapore

a  garden  city.  The  Minister should  immediately

remove  this  awful sight if we are going  to  make

Singapore a garden city. He should go and  see  for

himself the places where the hawkers' situation  is

unsightly.  There are many places where  he  should

take  action. He should emulate the example  of  my

constituency.  What  is  the  use  of  building   a

hawkers' centre at a cost of $300,000 or even more?

We should build as many markets as possible for the

hawkers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I will deal with the Member

for  Ulu  Pandan first. He has paid what I consider

to be a compliment when he says there has been some

improvement  since he last spoke  on  the  hawkers'

situation. He says that the hawkers' situation  has

improved  only  in ordinary M.P.s'  constituencies,

because our hawker inspectors dare to go there  and

enforce  the  law, whereas in constituencies  which

have  Ministers  as  Members  of  Parliament,   the

situation has deteriorated.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that this is a gross misrepresentation

of  the  actual conditions, because we deal equally

with every constituency, irrespective of whether it

has  a  Minister  or  an ordinary  Back-bencher  as

Member of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lee Teck Him</B> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, let me finish first and

then  the  Member can have his say. That  is  being

democratic,  is  it not? To put it ironically,  the

Member  for  Ulu Pandan should be very grateful  to

the Ministry of Health when he says that inspectors

visit  his  constituency to see that the  place  is

clean,   and  I  am  wondering  why  he   complains

about that. The Member says that hawker  inspectors

are  like "bulls" and they are not welcome  in  his

constituency.  Perhaps whenever he  sees  a  hawker

inspector, he sees red. I think I have sufficiently

replied to what he has said about hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the Member for Tiong Bahru? He

has  told us a sad story of the hawkers' hardships.

I beg to disagree with him. First of all, may I say

that  the new rates of fees for hawkers which  came

into force on the 1st of January, 1970, only revise

and   standardise  licence  fees  for  the  various

categories of hawkers which had remained  unchanged

for  over 20 years. I think I dealt with them quite

adequately  in Parliament in answer to  the  Member

for  Anson  on the 17th of this month. In  general,

the  fees  for hawkers have not been raised  except

for  itinerant  hawkers and wall show-case  hawkers

whose  fees  have been brought into line  with  the

rates payable by pitch hawkers. I admit there is  a

marginal  increase  in fees in respect  of  hawkers

conducting business in the immediate vicinity of  a

market.  Perhaps  the instances  which  the  Member

quoted just now about the increase in fees could be

in respect of hawkers who have stalls or pitches in

the immediate vicinity of a market. Their fees have

been  brought  into  line with  their  counterparts

inside  the  markets.  This was  done  for  obvious

reasons  in order that we can encourage hawkers  to

ply their trade inside markets where they can enjoy

better facilities, i.e., proper cover from weather,

supply  of  pipe-water, etc.  Experience  has  also

shown  that if fees outside the markets were  less,

hawkers prefer to ply outside them as they can  get

more customers since they are able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



to  sell  their goods at a cheaper rate.  This  is

certainly  unfair  to the stallholders  within  the

markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the hardship of hawkers, may I say

that, in general, hawkers may not appear to be well-dressed but they are generally making good money. I

know that an ice-cream vendor on good days can sell

$100 worth of ice cream and make a clear profit  of

$30.  Some ice-water sellers earn, on the  average,

$40  to  $50 a day and I know of some food  hawkers

who  even  own  houses  for  rent  and  send  their

children  overseas for higher studies.  Almost  all

hawkers do not pay income tax. This is because  the

Comptroller of Income Tax has no means of assessing

the  hawker's  income, short of sending  a  man  to

stand  by  his stall and jot down his receipts  of

payments,  which  proposition is not  feasible.  Of

course, I do admit that there are a few hawkers who

do  not  earn  that much money. But these  few  who

cannot  make  a  living out of hawking  should  not

continue hawking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our rapid economic growth, we are now

experiencing  a  shortage  of  labour  in   certain

fields.  Members must have heard the  Minister  for

Finance  say  in  this House that there  is  now  a

shortage of skilled and semi-skilled labour for our

booming  industries. We are also short  of  certain

categories of unskilled labour. I must tell Members

that  the  Ministry of Health is  also  finding  it

difficult to recruit cleansing workers and  garbage

truck  drivers. Members are also aware that  it  is

difficult nowadays to get domestic servants even if

you  are  willing to pay $120 to $150 a month  with

full  board and lodging plus Central Provident Fund

contributions. There is also a shortage of  workers

in  our building industry. I know of many instances

of  hawkers who have been offered steady  jobs  and

who  have turned them down because they frankly say

that working in a Jurong factory is too irksome and

they   do  not  make  as  much  money  as  hawking.

Therefore, the recitation by the Member  for  Tiong

Bahru of the hardship experienced by the hawkers, I

am  afraid,  sounds like a familiar tune  emanating

from an old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



gramophone record which might have been  valid  two

or three years ago but which is certainly not valid

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the specific complaint of the Member

for Tiong Bahru about payment of licence fees three

months in advance, I say that this is necessary for

administrative reasons and also for the convenience

of  the hawkers themselves. The monthly payment  of

fees  as  in  the past not only meant  a  waste  of

manpower,  time,  money and paper  work,  but  also

resulted in laxity, which in turn resulted in  loss

of  revenue. The present procedure is also for  the

convenience  of hawkers who have to make  only  one

trip to the Hawkers Department or collecting centre

for  the  payment of fees once every  three  months

instead  of  every month. Sir, may I  say  that  no

other  Ministry  collects fees on a monthly  basis,

and  it is not proposed that the Ministry of Health

should  continue  to do so. For example,  motor-car

licences and taxi licences are all collected  on  a

yearly  or  six-monthly  basis.  However,  adequate

provisions  exist  to assure the Member  for  Tiong

Bahru  that  we  allow  the Superintendent  of  the

Hawkers  Department to permit monthly  payments  of

fees  only  in  respect of hawkers  in  receipt  of

social  welfare aid and others who can  prove  that

payment  of  fees  three months in  advance  causes

undue hardship to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the Member for Anson. He wants

to know how many constituencies are already cleared

of  hawkers. Although hawkers have been  completely

resited  in  five  constituencies,  and  these  are

called  "cleared constituencies", there are cleared

areas  in  no  less  than 17 other  constituencies.

Furthermore, most of the hawkers who  used  to  ply

along major roads and thoroughfares throughout  the

island  have  been cleared, resited  and  licensed.

Most  of  them  have been resited in backlanes  and

open  areas where they do not cause obstruction  to

vehicular and pedestrian traffic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws relating to the cleanliness of the

environment are enforced equally stringently on all

hawkers,  be  they  in cleared or uncleared  areas.

That is what
