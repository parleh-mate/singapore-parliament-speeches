away,  the  Japanese Consul-General saw  the  Deputy

Prime Minister regarding a gesture of atonement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



to  be  made  by  the  Japanese  Government.  As   I

understood  it, the view of the Japanese  Government

was  that,  since it was a gesture of atonement,  to

talk  in terms of a specific sum of money would  not

be  conducive  to  a settlement.  This  was  what  I

understood from the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said, however, that they would consider a

donation for a project like a cancer research centre

or an indoor stadium or such like public amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be seeing the Chinese Chamber of Commerce

Committee in charge of this matter shortly and  will

thereafter see the Japanese Consul-General.

the  Director  of  Public Works had  already  served

notices  on  the frontagers of Mergui Road  and  Joo

Avenue of his intention to make up these roads under

section  143 of the Local Government Ordinance.  The

roads will be made up and will also be provided with

street  lights. Street lights were already installed

at  Kampong Chia Heng on 6th July, 1961.  No  doubt,

the  residents  of Starlight Road and  Kampong  Chia

Heng  will make their views known to me when I visit

to be nominated as candidates for election as

enable  Government officers to retire with  pension.

gratuity or allowance before their retirement is due

provided  it  has the overwhelming support  of  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think gestures such as this are usually made once

in  the history of a people, and that is just before

the  rest  of the financial year till December  1963

under  the  provisions of Standing Order 18  (1),  I

seek  leave  to  ask the Prime Minister  a  question

without notice to whom I wrote this morning at  very

short  notice referring inadvertently to Annexure  I

that  I  think  is apparent, from the  copy  of  the

letter  you  have, is Annexure F. In Annexure  F  of

Cmd. Paper 22 of 1963, a reference is made -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. As is required, the hon. Member

did  give  me  prior notice of his request,  and  it

appears  to  me that a question of this nature  does

not  strictly come under the provisions of  Standing

Order 18 (1)  which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A question shall not be asked without notice,

unless  the  Speaker or in his absence  the  Deputy

Speaker  is  of  opinion that it us  of  an  urgent

character, and relates either to a matter of public

importance or to the arrangement of public business

and  the Member has obtained the permission of  the

Speaker or in his absence the Deputy Speaker to ask

it.'



<br><br>I say it does not come strictly under Standing Order 18,  because  I think the opportunity  will  present

itself  to  the  hon. Member to  ask  that  question

during the course of the debate.

proceeded with. I beg to move the motion standing in

my name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House will have noticed, my motion has been

phrased in several parts:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pursuance of the resolution of this House taken

on the 10th June, 1963 that there should be an early

settlement fair and just to both sides on the  basis

of  the terms of the White Paper (Paper Cmd.  33  of

1961) and mindful of the long and arduous battle for

merger, this House



<br><br>WELCOMES  the  successful  outcome  in  the   final

agreement reached in London on 9th July, 1963  which

agreement contains the terms in the said White Paper

with  amendments  made  on a  quid  pro  quo  basis,

Singapore  getting a Malaysia Common Market  written

into the Constitution in return for a percentage  of

Singapore's revenue of national taxes instead of  an

annual lump sum as contribution for Federal services

in Singapore, and -



<br><br>This is of some importance, Mr Speaker, Sir, and  I

would like to underline these words -



<br><br>TAKING  COGNIZANCE of the exchange of  memoranda  on

the  financial arrangements as in Misc.  4  of  1963

which sets out the basis on which the Singapore  and

percentages and the component parts thereof, and -



<br><br>I would also like to underline these words -



<br><br>SUBJECT to the fulfilment of the conditions set  out

in  the  exchange of letters between  the  Singapore

Government  and  the Federation Government  and  the

Singapore  Government  and  the  British  Government

contained in Paper Misc. 5 of 1963, this House



<br><br>ADOPTS  the constitutional provisions and amendments

contained in Paper Cmd. 22 of 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to underline first. Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  this adoption is subject to the fulfilment  of

the  conditions set out in the exchange of  letters.

As  Members may be aware, some of the conditions and

terms  agreed to between the British Government  and

ourselves   and   the  Federation   Government   and

ourselves are - the British Government with regard to

Service  lands  and  $10  million  for  the   Second

Infantry Regiment, and, from our point of view, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



reclamation of land in place of land retained by the

British Government for the bases; and in the case of

the Federation Government the other items set out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, may I apologise, Mr Speaker, Sir, for the

somewhat  lack  of  melody in my voice,  hut  I  can

assure  the  House that I will try  my  best  to  be

audible,   to  be  simple  and  be  straightforward,

because  what  is  required  now  is  some  straight

talking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know if Members have received copies

of our proposed amendments -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is a paper intituled "Malaysia

Agreement Paper Cmd. 22 of 1963 Corrigenda",  and  a

convenient  if  this Corrigenda be marked  as  Paper

Cmd.  23  of 1963, and later on, at the end  of  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this debate,

which will end on Thursday evening, marks the end of

an  era.  That  era began in 1945 when  the  British

troops  returned to Malaya and, by a unilateral  act

of  the  British Government, Singapore  was  severed

from  the mainland. The struggle went on inside  and

outside   official  bodies,  the  then   Legislative

Council both here and in the Federation, until  1948

when the M.C.P. launched its armed revolt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reached a turning point in the year 1957, August

31st,  when  the  British decided  to  grant  Malaya

independence,  but  not  Singapore.  Singapore,   it

seems,  was  ordained  to remain  forever  in  semi-tutelage  with  internal  self-government  but  with

supreme  authority  in matters of  defence,  foreign

affairs  and, for that matter, internal security  in

the hands of the British Raj.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to detail an account of the years

1945  to  1948 or, even more unpleasant,  the  years

1948 to 1957. Suffice it to say that this unilateral

division  of the country was never accepted  by  the

peoples  either of the Federation of  Malaya  or  of

Singapore.  In Singapore, for the purposes  of  this

debate, the last few chapters began with 1955,  when

the  first semi-elected Assembly assumed office with

elected Ministers working with British officials  in

charge of Home Affairs and Finance. Year by year  we

went  back  to London with more or less  greater  or

lesser  results.  And for us, the  last  chapter  to

merger  really began with 1959. Then for  the  first

time power, other than defence, foreign affairs, and

internal security which were shared with Malaya  and

the  British,  was bestowed on a completely  elected

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the history of Singapore and indeed the

history  of  South-East  Asia  may  well  have  been

different had we decided any other way. In  1959  we

were quite convinced, even before we assumed office,

that  there  was  no  other way. The  nexus  between

Singapore and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



Federation   was   so  complete  that   to   perform

dissection  would  have  taxed  the  skill  of   the

greatest  political surgeons who ever  existed,  and

certainly  there were none either in  Malaya  or  in

Singapore   or,   for  that  matter,   in   Britain.

Singapore,   it   was  generally   recognised,   was

dependent on Malaya for many things. 40 per cent  of

its  entrepot  trade, nearly three-quarters  of  its

water  supply.  And  it  was believed  that  with  a

friendly  Government  in the  Federation,  Singapore

could  be kept indefinitely a military base in  semi

independence. In 1956, the Member for Anson, to whom

history  has given a few lessons  - or he  has  chosen

not to learn from them  - led an All-Party delegation.

It  failed, partly because he did not understand the

circumstances in which Singapore was placed and  the

determination of the then British Government that it

should remain in semi-tutelage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urged the then Secretary of State for the

Colonies,  a  very able and forceful character,  who

decided  to  give  independence to Malaya,  that  he

should, despite the advice of his officials, tie  up

Singapore  with the Federation, for  there  was  too

much  at  stake.  As it was, the  talks  failed.  We

returned, and the British, in a completely empirical

manner,  true to their traditions, played  for  time

and  played  their hand out for the last few  years,

from  1956 to 1959. We went back each year, in 1957,

to  reach agreement in principle; in 1958,  to  sort

out   the  constitutional  details.  By  then,   the

Secretary of State for the Colonies had accepted the

fact that if Malaya was lost to the Communists, then

Singapore could not be held. Indeed there was  every

danger  that the Communists would be more successful

in  finally  capturing this area if the  territories

were  kept  apart than if the territories were  kept

together.  But it took another two years - from  1959

to  1961 - before the British were convinced  of  the

next step of the argument: that if Singapore was not

in   Malaya,   then  Singapore  and   Malaya   would

ultimately  be lost to the Communists.  The  British

had  hoped that the Government that would come  into

office in Singapore would be satisfied with what the

former Chief Minister (the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



for  Anson)  described as "the sensation of  power",

the Prime Minister, the Ministers of the Government,

and even one Infantry Regiment to do it honours. But

real  power  resided  with them.  They  expected  an

elected  Government, i.e. us, to  keep  their  bases

viable.  In  order  to do that,  the  anti  colonial

struggle  must  be  muted and the  Communist  menace

crushed  from time to time as it manifested  itself.

And indefinitely we went on as a semi-colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a full two years before we brought the

British  Government  round  to  the  view  that  our

conclusion  was  correct. If played that  way,  both

Singapore  and  Malaya would  be  lost.  Slowly  the

unpleasant  and brutal facts were placed before  the

Federation Government. What had been publicly  known

was that Malaya was vital to Singapore, but what  we

did not emphasise, lest we offend our friends across

the  Causeway, was that Singapore was vital to their

survival.  Quietly  over the golf course,  sometimes

even  across the poker table, and sometimes  over  a

meal, a friendly discussion always came. It had  one

theme  song: merger is inevitable, either by consent

or  by force of one territory over the other. Let me

say,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, that  the  possibility  of

Singapore  overwhelming  the  Federation  is  not  a

possibility to be altogether dismissed.  Being  what

we  were,  having regard to the susceptibilities  of

our friends in the Federation, the line was put over

softly,  gently, and politely. Finally  a  note  was

struck in the hearts of the Federation Ministers. On

the  17th  of  May, the Tunku came down to  announce

that  he  had decided that there should be a  closer

political and economic association of the Federation

of   Malaya,   Singapore,  and  the   three   Borneo

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of that is recent history. Suffice it to

say,  on  3rd  June I responded. On  10th  June,  my

colleague  the  Deputy Prime Minister  stated  terms

which  were  basic and fundamental to  a  successful

merger,  terms  on  which merger could  be  achieved

between the Federation and Singapore. Autonomy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



in many matters, including Labour and Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the real fight began. For the first time,

after  shouting and denouncing the British  for  all

these  years since 1945, the Malayan Communist Party

did  a  right-about-turn. They denounced merger  and

Malaysia  as a piece of neo-colonialism. Sir,  I  do

not know whether they really believed in it. Perhaps

they  have  shouted it for so long  that  they  have

bemused  themselves into believing that it is  true.

But  today I will tell part of the story.  I  cannot

tell   the  whole  story  because  sometimes  recent

history  should  be allowed to pass without  comment

for time to mellow judgment. I know enough and I can

disclose enough of recent history to prove  that  it

is  not  a  colonialist  plot.  It  took  a  lot  of

persuasion and argument to bring the Tunku around to

merger.  And  he  only wanted merger with  Malaysia.

Sir,  I  do not blame him. Being what he is  - anxious

to  preserve what he thinks are the valuable  traits

in  the  Federation, a stable rural population  that

provides security and ensures the continuance of the

Alliance Party in power  - he was reluctant to  embark

on  a  project  the  result of which  he  could  not

foresee. Without the Borneo territories, the Chinese

would outnumber the Malays and, with it, the logical

consequences of its effects on the balance of power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the British encouraged the Tunku to believe

that  eventually he could get the Borneo territories

because  it was a good idea and generally it  was  a

good thing. You will remember, Mr Speaker, Sir,  in

November/December 1961 there was  a  little  bit  of

argument  as to the future of the defence  bases  in

Singapore. The argument was presented as  a  problem

of   defence  bases.  But,  in  truth,  it  was  the

reluctance   of  the  British  to  give   up   their

territories in Borneo. That was a backwater  - silent,

calm,  placid - and their rule could have endured  for

another decade or more. The Governor of Singapore  - a

gentleman of no mean talent  - felt that he had served

his  penance  in Singapore, as Chief  Secretary  and

then  as Governor when he had to govern through  the

then Chief Minister. He governed. He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



was  not  anxious  to  upset North  Borneo  and  its

peoples; neither was the Governor of Sarawak. But  I

give this compliment to the British, as I give to an

adversary  whom I respect, a compliment  not  to  be

lightly dismissed. Competent, capable, with a  great

deal  of  knowledge  of the ways  of  men,  like  an

electronic computer with an immense amount  of  data

fed  in,  data  of over 400 years of  governing  and

manipulating human beings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two years they tried to manipulate us into

doing  what  they  thought  was  the  role  of   the

Singapore  Government  - keep the bases viable,  break

the  Communists up from time to time, and carry  on.

For two years we resisted. Then one day they decided

that  it just could not go on. And the fight  began.

The   greatest   ignominy  that  had  befallen   the

Communists  was  the fact that a Scottish  feudalist

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- in their terminology, I do not call him a feudalist

as  I think he is extremely competent in his own way

as  a representative of an Empire, persuaded a group

of   highly   suspicious  and   security   conscious

Communist-front operators to come out into the open,

and  the  fight began. The Communists  were  playing

hide  and  seek   - for  the Government,  against  the

Government, sometimes for so long as it is  for  the

benefit  of  the  people,  as  they  say,  sometimes

against.  The Tunku was not contemplating merger  or

even Malaysia for that matter. What he wanted was  a

clean-cut decision, then he would take over security

for  both Singapore and the Borneo territories.  And

he  wanted  no  more  than security.  It  is  partly

because  of  these historic beginnings that  we  had

such an immense amount of trouble subsequently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Anson, we had that motion of confidence in

this  House one night, and the break was  final  and

irrevocable. Then we talked business with the Tunku.

There  was no pre-arranged or pre-conceived plan  as

they  thought.  They were bemused and  deluded.  The

British  arranged  in the midst  of  the  Anson  by-election   to   bring  their  Governors   over   for

unnecessary    consultations   to    arouse    their

suspicions,  put  them in a state  of  fright.  They

panicked and broke away. They came out from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



the  bushes and made a bid for power, an action they

will  always  regret. Their policy  was  the  united

front.  If  they cannot unite with nationalists  who

are  democratic socialists, who on earth could  they

unite  with?  So  they have found themselves  in  an

ignominious  alliance  with the  Liberal-Socialists,

the United Democratic Party -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> The

Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Anson. They even

tried to inveigle the Member for Hong Lim. But there

was  no more cover. It was a bit of nylon for a  fig

leaf   and   when  the  rains  came,  it  was   most

embarrassing. All this was a tortuous  process,  and

what   was   required   was   absolute   and   utter

determination and the nerve to see it through.  Even

right  now, it needs nerve to see it through to  the

31st  of  August. Not me, just one man, because  one

man  cannot  see this through. It needed  sufficient

resolution  in the whole group of men.  I  am  proud

that it has been the privilege of my colleagues  and

myself to have played a part in this. We settled the

terms.  Because  the  Tunku was  fearful  of  labour

troubles,  general unrest, instability in  Singapore

and  possible bankruptcy, he was anxious to have  as

little as possible to do with us as he could. But he

knew he could not afford to give away security. What

he  wanted was the police, army and foreign affairs.

The rest we can run ourselves -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Prisons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, prisons. I beg your

pardon.  Thank  you. My colleague has just  reminded

me.  The three of us - the Minister for Culture,  the

Minister for Finance and I - brought the wrath of the

Communists  on  us because we went up there,  played

golf,  talked over dinner and lunch. They  hated  us

more  than the others because we forged this  thing.

We  put  in  civil  aviation and  telecommunications

because  we  think it makes nonsense of a federation

for  us  to have to make a trunk call every time  we

want to go to Johore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the White Paper was agreed, the basis of which

was that we should have 15 seats in Parliament. This

is  a  few seats less than what we would be entitled

to  in a complete merger. In return for this, we ran

our  own State. Mind you, at that time, Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the  general  impression  was  that  we  were

bankrupt   because  there  were  strikes,   banners,

protests,  marches and a whole host of other  things

which   made  Singapore  appear,  on  the   surface,

financially  an  unattractive proposition.  But  all

that  time  when we were drafting that  White  Paper

together, the Finance Minister knew that  he  had  a

surplus  each  year, calculated and designed,  meant

for development - a surplus of over $100 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the Cobbold Commission because the Tunku

stood  firm  that  he  would not  go  ahead  without

Borneo.  So through the months of argument,  debate,

the open encounter, which ended with the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the moment we settled that, new problems began. For then some very unwise politicians in the M.C.A. in Kuala Lumpur thought that since all was agreed now, was passed, then they could not only eat their cake, but also have it. So you see in Paper Misc. 4 of 1963 a curious exchange

of memoranda. Sir, they have to be published because

at  the end of 1964 a review must take place. In our

computations, even at its inflated best,  even  with

confrontation  and the Army and Navy and  Air  Force

doubled  and  internal  security  for  Singapore  no

longer  the responsibility of the British, but  four

battalions must be raised locally, we do not believe

that  money can be spent, nor indeed will be  spent.

Because   to  get  $1.80  from  us,  the  Federation

Government  has to spend $8.20. So I  do  not  think

they will spend it. Knowing the Finance Minister and

his colleagues, I do not think they will spend $8.20

just  in  order to do us in by $1.80.  That  is  the

ultimate figure we have arrived at.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, you will see in Document I, the first proposal

by  the Federation side. Meanwhile the officials had

been meeting. We met the Ministers for the first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



time on the presentation of the paper dated 21st  of

March,  Document  I. There was the  proposal.  I  am

sorry  to  have to go into this, but it is necessary

to   place  this  on  the  record.  The  Member  for

Cairnhill says this is all a lot of eye-wash.  These

documents speak for themselves. There was a proposal

that they should collect our money, contrary to  the

terms  of  the White Paper. They wanted  to  collect

because  by then they had discovered that, far  from

being  bankrupt,  we  were a prosperous  State  and,

therefore, if they collected and doled and paid  for

our  expenses, they would collect a surplus of  $110

million each year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Document II is our counter. We said we were

prepared briefly to give them a share of Singapore's

prosperity,  provided  the Federation  ensured  that

Singapore prospered. And it could only prosper if it

had  a Common Market on terms which would allow over

a  period  of  time  an  adjustment  of  Singapore's

economy.  Any sudden cataclysmic change  would  have

been  disastrous.  That paper was  rejected  by  the

Federation side in Document III. The only concession

they  made was they were still to collect, but  they

would  keep  only half the surplus. Not unnaturally,

my  colleagues and I were not greatly  impressed  or

grateful  for  such  a  suggestion.  Then  the  long

wrangle - part of it on the golf course, part  of  it

in the conference room, part of it over the luncheon

table.  Finally  we  got down to  calculations,  and

Documents  IV and V are projections of  revenue  and

expenditure for 1964, based on actuals for 1961  and

on provisional actuals for 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Document VI, on 10th of June, I made a statement

to  this  House.  I was convinced, and  so  were  my

colleagues, that merger was inevitable.  But  I  was

not convinced that the success of the new Federation

was  inevitable, and it was our duty to ensure  that

in  so  far as is humanly possible it should have  a

good  start. To plunder Singapore, which Document  I

would  have  done, would have been a  bad  start.  I

would  not have put my money on it if we had  agreed

to  Document I. Because then over the years, as  the

people  realised the financial implications  of  the

terms on which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



we were absorbed by the Federation, bitterness would

rancour  in  their hearts; and without a  successful

Singapore, Malaysia could not succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Document VII, Mr Speaker, Sir, is what is known in

the  newspapers as "the ultimatum".  I  saw  in  the

newspapers   the   Member  for   Cairnhill   waiting

patiently  outside  while the  ultimatum  was  being

considered  inside the Cabinet room. I do  not  know

whether he was for Singapore. But even if he was,  I

wondered  whether  that was the  way  to  fight  for

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an extremely complex situation. If you

fight too harshly and too hard, then you bring about

bitterness  that is bound to endure  into  Malaysia,

and  make  the sense of unity and purpose and  amity

between  the peoples less likely. If you  yield  and

give way, then you will be raped and plundered,  and

that  makes  Malaysia a certain failure. So  between

the  two extremes, a balance has to be struck. I  do

not  want  to  deal  in detail  with  the  financial

arrangements.   My  colleague,  the   Minister   for

Finance, who bore the brunt of the detailed work and

the argument with his counterpart in the Federation,

will   do  so.  If  I  know  him,  he  will  do   so

competently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Document VIII was our reply. It is not easy, Mr

Speaker, Sir, - no, Document IX, I am sorry, the point-by-point  reply.  Document VIII was  the  ultimatum.

Document IX was the reply. On the 22nd of June, on a

Saturday, we sent a letter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Malaysia was a neo-colonialist plot, all this

would  have  been unnecessary. The British  had  the

power  constitutionally and in actual fact to  bring

this  about.  But  I think they  were  wise  in  not

exercising  that power. They allowed free  and  open

negotiations leading to a voluntary and satisfactory

conclusion. If Malaysia was a neo-colonialist  plot,

today  Brunei would be in Malaysia. For  the  Sultan

exists  and  survives by leave and  licence  of  the

British  Army.  But they are also sufficiently  wise

and  prudent  to understand that the ruler  has  the

support  of the large bulk of his people, sufficient

for even Azahari to treat him with some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



respect to leave well alone. But I am quite sure too

that  the gradual process of attrition, the wearing-down process of argument day in day out will finally

ensure  that  fair  and just terms  are  agreed  and

endorsed by the peoples of Malaya and Brunei.  I  am

not  unhopeful of the future. I have read  what  has

been said in the papers, and sometimes I think it is

wiser   not  to  say  some  of  these  things.   But

nevertheless, I think the Sultan was deeply hurt  by

many  things that happened in Kuala Lumpur. I  think

also  some  of  the Federation Ministers,  in  their

state of anxiety, were unnecessarily severe in their

expressions to the Sultan. I am also convinced  that

this  electronic computor which has  learnt  how  to

handle  chieftains, revolutionaries and revolts  and

mutinies over 400 years, even though getting  a  bit

old  and  not quite as good as it used to  be,  will

bring  its  whole  force  to  bear  on  this  little

sultanate  and eventually Malaysia will  triumph  by

reason,  by argument, by logic, and not by force.  I

can pay no better tribute to them than the fact that

in  the  last round they really beat us  in  London.

Sir,  we  had them, as the expression goes,  by  the

neck. We had settled with the -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> By

the throat!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sorry. By the throat. We had

settled with the Federation. We had not settled with

the  British.  We  had put in our claims.  All  W.D.

lands  with  no  title to be returned  forthwith  to

Singapore.   Consternation,   Mr   Speaker,    Sir.

Meanwhile  the Secretary of State had joined  forces

with the Federation to coerce us into getting us  to

cough up for Borneo. Finally, $100 million, interest

free  for  5  years. Originally,  it  was  almost  a

hundred  per  cent  labour, Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  All

labour which cannot be found in Borneo must be taken

from  Singapore.  The Tunku intervened.  But  before

that,  the  moment  it  looked  like  settling,   we

presented  the  claims. Then the British  said  they

would cough up the lands. But only part of it. So we

said  $20  million must be paid as compensation  for

lands  which are retained. I am quite sure  that  if

only we had waited another 24 to 48 hours



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



we would have got the money. But for various reasons

the Tunku believed that 8th July was a lucky day  by

the stars. The British knew this and they worked  on

him because they could not work on us and get us  to

give  way.  We lost because the Tunku said  we  must

sign  on  that  night and so the  signing  began  at

quarter  to  twelve on the 8th of July. I  think  it

ended about 12.10 in the morning of the 9th of July.

And we had to give up. From $15 million we agreed to

$10 million. Was this a neo-colonialist plot?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic factors were there, and the moment the

U.K.  Commission here drew the Communists  out  into

the  open, their days were doomed. They allowed  the

fight  to  go on. In the last resort the  gun  would

have to be used, but they left it alone. Very wisely

too.  They made a decision in 1957, when the  Member

for  Cairnhill was the Chief Minister, and again  in

1958 - he did not make the decision; the Governor did - that  the P.A.P. shall go on. The then Director  of

Special  Branch, when he saw the way  the  elections

were going in 1959, decided to hop it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> What does that mean?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That means scoot! If they had

their way, they would have done the stupid thing, as

they   always  do,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  They  never

calculate.  They always play poker, as  I  often  do

with  the  Member for Cairnhill and with the  Tunku,

just to pass the time of day in order to get one  or

two odd points in. I always lose. I never win. I  am

no  good at bluffing. It is true, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

The  game  of  bluff  is one which  I  find  a  very

unprofitable and a very hazardous thing to do. I  am

telling  him right here and now. There are no  cards

closed; five cards in hand: changing - pretending  to

change  two, keeping three. None of that.  My  cards

are  on  the  table. It is within the power  of  the

Opposition to block this. If it does so, Malaysia is

postponed: there will be general elections. But I am

confident, because the bits and pieces on the chess-board have been calculated. Even if he wanted to,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



U.M.N.O. cannot do it. They cannot go  against  the

signature of their own Tunku. And this is  what  the

bundle  of documents handed in means. The Tunku  has

agreed,  and unless they want to disavow  their  own

parent   organisation,  they  must  vote   for   it.

Therefore,  it  will go through. And  I  speak  this

knowing  the bits and pieces on the chess-board,  as

we  always  try carefully to calculate the  possible

moves and counter-moves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at last we have reached almost the end. Another 30 days. Midnight of 30th. One second past midnight, I hand over security, police, prisons, Army. I will no longer have an Infantry Regiment to salute me. They will only line up outside this Assembly by leave and licence of the

Deputy Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaysia.

But  as against that, I will no longer have to  look

and care for the safety of the Members opposite.  So

it  is not such a bad exchange. We are going to keep

72 to 73 per cent of our revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calculation varies according to the projection.

It  is  between 72 and 73 per cent. Of course,  even

before the agreement was signed, they denounced  it.

They  have always denounced it. The noose is  around

their  throats  and they know it.  And  those  whose

hearts  are  guilty must be unhappy at  nights.  And

that is as it should be. They have 30 days left. All

I want is peace, quiet, tranquillity for the next 30

days. And I mean it. Whilst I am in charge, it is my

duty  to  see  that law and order is maintained.  If

anybody breaks it, he meets the consequences of  the

law. It is quite simple. There are the courts. We go

in  accordance with established practice. The Member

for  Thomson complains bitterly. He got  the  Member

for Cairn-hill to side with him. As I have said,  he

does  not  know which side he is on, except  that  I

know he is always on his own side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The wrong side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In this case, I think he is on

the wrong side, as my colleague has said, because if

he has been going around, he will know that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



there is a great deal of feeling about this. A blunt

unthinking act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, the broad agreement - the

financial terms which for two weeks really  occupied

so  much of our time and tested our nerves.  We  are

giving  27 per cent of our total revenue, or 40  per

cent of national taxes, not giving it away free. All

the  police officers will be paid by the Federation.

We  have  5,000 officers as against the Federation's

20,000, i.e. 25 per cent is in Singapore, to be paid

for.  Prisons - we have got two. We are now going  to

build  a new one and knock down the old one. I  have

said  it  will not be my responsibility,  but  I  am

quite prepared to forward any memoranda on the shape

and size of the windows for sunshine and whether the

bedsheet  should  be on the left-hand  side  or  the

right-hand  side  of the wall. The people  who  have

tried to ruin the country ought to be grateful  that

no  worse  fate  is  in  store  for  them.  Prisons,

Telecoms,  Post Offices, Civil Aviation, the  Courts

and Judiciary -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Meteorological offices.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Even the Meteorological office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Make rain this time!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We will make rain. Do not

worry.  Singapore always forges ahead, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  despite  everything. We innovate.  We  started

T.V. We started rain-making. We will start a lot  of

other things. That is in the nature of things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in return for this we have a Common Market. I

expected  this  to  be received at  least  by  right

minded  men  who  are not Communists with  rapturous

applause and praise for the Tunku, if not for me, at

least  for  generosity of the Tunku and his  Deputy.

But  the  Member for Anson has again  gone  off  the

beam. I read in the newspapers that he has denounced

it  as  a sell-out: that we in four years have  done

more  damage than the British did in over a  hundred

years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Than the Japanese.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Than the Japanese. I do not know

whether he knows that this is the end of an era.  It

will  not be unfair to put it in this way:  that  as

things  get  tougher - and things  will  get  tougher

because,  as  I  have said, we are not  showered  by

congratulations as we come into being (very far from

it)  - we have to be on the lookout for enemy agents.

I  mean "enemy" in the proper sense of the word,  in

war.  And those who aid and abet the enemy  will  go

down with him, and we will suffer none in our midst.

This,  I  am sure, reflects in a very mild  way  the

views  of  the  two Ministers I met last  week  - the

Deputy  Prime  Minister of the  Federation  and  his

close colleague, the Minister for Internal Security.

I  saw them with regard to the matters in the letter

which  I  have  tabled  in  this  Assembly.  I  also

discussed  a few other things about the transitional

provisions on the 31st August. I can tell  them  and

the  Members on the other side that although we have

our  quarrels  with the M.C.A., we  have  none  with

either  the  Deputy Prime Minister of the Federation

or   his   colleague,  the  Minister  for   Internal

Security.  That  is  because  we  did   a   lot   of

calculation. I can tell them that knowing  them  for

what  they  are, they are not likely  to  shirk  the

responsibility to use their strength - and they  have

strength,  Mr Speaker; the Opposition  to  Malaysia

should  believe  me  when  I  say  that  they   have

strength;  do  not  believe that  all  these  little

upheavals in Penang and Taiping are going  to  upset

Malaysia.  No. They have real basic ground strength,

and  they  have no hesitation in using that strength

to see that Malaysia remains secure, prosperous, and

progressive. We are with them on that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has criticised the Common

Market.  I  will leave the details to my  colleague,

the  Minister for Finance. All I would say is  this:

eight wise men, learned in these matters, came  from

the  World Bank. They are men who drafted or  helped

to  draft some of them, the Treaty of Rome, on which

the  prosperity  of the European Economic  Community

was based. The report has been published. Annex J of

Paper Cmd. 22 of 1963 sets out all the main



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



terms  of  this Common Market. I quite  believe  the

Member for Anson is an intelligent man. In fact, the

then  Colonial Secretary in 1956 said, in  a  rather

patronising  way, that he was quite  an  intelligent

fellow. But the trouble with him is that he  is  too

clever.  I am prepared to put my reputation on  this

matter   on  the  side  of  eight  learned  experts,

practical men of the world, whose business  is  high

finance and economics as against the judgment of the

Member for Anson. I am quite happy and satisfied  to

test  public  opinion  by  the  expressions  of  the

Chinese  Chamber  of Commerce, whose  President  has

welcomed  it, and who is, in fact, in the  midst  of

setting up a few factories, and very wisely too - why

not,  and miss the opportunity? - the Indian  Chamber

of   Commerce,  the  British  Singapore  Chamber  of

Commerce.  These are men of commerce  and  trade  is

their  lifeline, and they say, "This is good."  Five

years   of  complete  free  port  status  while   we

industrialise product by product. For the next seven

years, we gradually harmonise. And we can refuse  to

put  on any tariff but pay them a percentage of  the

taxes  which they would have got had we put a tariff

on.  In other words, we have 12 years in all. If  we

cannot  succeed in 12 years, then I say, we  do  not

deserve  to succeed; we really will perish.  And  it

will  be  because  of the evil machinations  of  men

opposite, and their smiles will be wiped off  their

faces when the moment of brutal truth dawns on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is literally the end of this era, Mr Speaker,

Sir  - three more days (today, tomorrow, and the  day

after),  then  we  adjourn sine die.  When  we  meet

again,  it  will  be under the new Constitution.  We

shall  probably miss some old friends and  some  old

enemies,  and maybe the country would be the  better

for it. I make no bones about it. We have fought and

put  our  lives in our hands, and our necks  on  the

chopping  block. For two years we have fought  them.

And I will fight them for another 30 days, and never

flinch  from it. I beseech the Member for Queenstown

not  to misjudge the situation. Twice he has already

made an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



error   of  judgment,  now  leading  to  a  lot   of

inconvenience  - flying out counsel - to  himself  and

his  colleagues. I would much rather that  they  led

more  quiet and peaceful lives. They nearly  started

one  in  the  Harbour Board with 100-odd  hard  core

chaps. I say, the Fire Brigade is ready. Let us have

no  arson  before  the 31st of  August.  After  31st

August  if they want to take on the Malaysian  Army,

Navy,  Air Force, together with the P.K.I. on  their

side,  it is up to them. Good luck to them.  I  have

not  the slightest doubt of the outcome and if  they

are in doubt, they should have their heads examined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, repent? I say no. I should not say this

because I would like them to sleep well of nights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, merger always has been a historical necessity

and   those   who   oppose  it  will,   in   Marxist

phraseology, be buried by history. My colleagues and

I  on  this  side have read enough of Karl  Marx  to

understand  their thinking. Buried by history,  Sir,

is a phrase which means you are a fool. I mean "you"

metaphorically.  You went against  the  current  and

inevitable process. My colleague says it is not  too

late. Well, good luck to them. Maybe if they change,

go  to  church and pray, or kneel down, count  their

heads, there is still time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the battle really began in 1945, 18

years ago. But for the last four years, the dramatis

personoe   have  been - (1)   the  British   (2)    the

Communists  (3)   the Federation Government  (4)   the

Singapore Government. Four principal actors. Not all

ad  idem, Mr Speaker, Sir. From time to time,  each

finds   his   interests  affected  and  shifts   his

position. I will give you a simple illustration.  In

London  when the British wanted us to cough  up  for

Borneo, they were with the Federation side squeezing

us  to  make us pay; they suggested a free  loan  of

$150  million, free of interest for 10 years. I  was

so  astounded  by the suggestion, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that I bit my lip. I calculated and I said that  was

$80  million.  I got the shock of my  life.  So  the

matter  was  dropped. We were kept awake at  nights.

Mind  you,  so  were  the  British  team.  But  they

sustained themselves with pots of - I saw some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



hot  milk being boiled, while they offered us whisky

and  soda,  which I thought was a very friendly  and

hospitable  way  of  doing business  - abstemious  on

their  part,  hospitable to  those  who  were  their

guests.  They only gave up one night or  rather  one

morning. I think it was Thursday morning before  the

Monday  we  signed, when they sent a  representative

and banged on our Committee Room. We said we were in

session  and in popped the Deputy U.K. Commissioner.

He  found  us  sitting down with  a  typewriter  box

stacked  with  sandwiches and  all  other  necessary

condiments and sustenance for the battle. Then  they

gave  up.  Because he knew we could go on well  into

breakfast  time and it would still be $103  million,

five  years free of interest, labour from Singapore.

Then they gave up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the moment we put the claims on the British, an

immense  transformation took place.  The  Federation

Ministers,  three  of  them,  suddenly  became   our

allies.  They became our great friends and supported

us  in the claim to get the land back and get a  lot

of  money. Because, not unnaturally, the more  money

we  got, the more money we were likely to give them.

These were the strains and stresses between the four

principal parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as a good Marxist, if I were the Member

for    Queenstown,    I    would    exploit    these

contradictions.  There  was a contradiction  between

the  Members on the Front bench opposite and us over

the  15  seats. He could have exploited  it  to  his

advantage. He threw it away. He will never know what

a  ghastly  error  it  was. Here  we  were  all  for

Malaysia.  We  were  all for a  non-Communist  - they

wanted  an  anti-Communist, we want a  non-Communist

Malaysia - never mind. Anyway, no Communist. But  for

various reasons, we wanted 15 seats before Malaysia.

They  had  a chance to prove to the world  that  the

people  of Singapore, if ever they believed  in  it,

were  against Malaysia. They say the referendum  was

rigged. Here was the chance of a contradiction to be

exploited, but it was thrown away. Alas,  what  poor

Marxists they were!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, what happens after? I have given a fair

resume  of  what has taken place. Of  course,  there

were  some  side characters - clowns, court  jesters,

general  retinue.  The Member for Anson  played  his

part, a useful sounding board. From time to time  he

comes  in  like one of these Punch and  Judy  shows.

Suddenly  the lion roars, dashes across  the  stage,

vanishes.  The  Member for Cairnhi1l,  the  faithful

follower and retinue, defended by the Alliance,  who

said he was only taking orders as is his duty if  he

wants to survive. Then there was Dr Faust - Dr Lee,

the Member for Queenstown. He was Dr Faust. He went

to  Medical College and he never read this  book.  I

went  to  Raffles College and I read a  little  book

called "Dr Faust". A man. Marlow, wrote this  book.

He  said Faust sold his soul to the devil. He bought

time  and  had a wonderful time in the `process;  he

did  everything he wanted. What a glorious time - the

leader  of  the masses. What did he say  over  T.V.?

Eighty-thousand people, he said, turned  up  at  his

May  Day  rally  last  year  and  this  year  40,000 - braggadocio.  This  year  we  counted  there   were

12,000. Last year we counted there were 30,000.  But

nevertheless,   tumultuous   applause;    systematic

applause,  Sir,  the rhythmic clap  is  a  wonderful

thing; it is a thrill that only those who have  been

on  the platform with the microphone can understand;

the  sensation of power - ecstasy. "But the time  has

come,"  says Mephistopheles. "Your time is up."  And

so it will be. Thursday night, the end of an era - as

you  leave  the  Chamber, if you do not  mind,  Sir,

after  you  have left the Chamber, for old  friends'

sake,  Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot - Auld  Lang

Syne.  We  meet again under a new flag. The  British

Union Jack is down. No nonsense about all this  neo-colonialism. Everybody who says that the  Federation

Parliament is a neo-colonialist one, will  be  dealt

with in a summary manner, and quite rightly so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been others. The Member for Hong Lim and

his famous resolutions. He plays a curious role, Mr

Speaker, Sir. He is like a vulture waiting  for  our

friends in the Barisan to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



disappear.  The Barisan has got a flag dashing  into

battle with slogans on it. He has the same flag with

the  same slogans. He is hoping that when that  flag

is  burnt up, the followers will take the lead  from

his  flag, and so he inherits the 25 per cent  blank

votes. But he is clever enough not to get too close.

If he is too close, then when the fire is opened, he

might   get  killed.  So  he  leaves  a  respectable

distance  between the Barisan flag  and  himself.  I

would say that he could be Mephistopheles if he were

born in a different age, because he had the kind  of

approach  for it. I was reading the papers.  He  was

exhorting  us to massacre the Opposition.  "Ah,  ah,

here  is another swipe coming." Waiting for  it,  he

says.  "If  only  these chaps  will  disappear."  No

leaders left. He has the same slogans. Whatever they

say, he says one day afterwards. One day afterwards,

he  comes  out  with the same slogans. Sometimes  he

makes a mistake, but he quickly retracts because  he

is wise enough to see he does not get into trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three cheers for Azahari," said the Barisan. One

day  later,  the  Member for Hong Lim  said,  "Three

cheers for Azahari." One week later, he said,  "Down

with Azahari because he is anti-Chinese." And by the

time Azahari got to Jakarta, he said, "Down with the

whole  Brunei revolt." He was in favour of Singapore

helping  to  keep down the Brunei rebels.  He  is  a

vulture   of   no  mean  intelligence   hut   rather

superficial.  He  also never calculated  beyond  the

brink.  What happens after the abyss? I  say,  quite

frankly, in the new era, those who wobbled along the

brink  will  find it a bit gusty and  windy.  It  is

better to come hack safely to land, abjure all these

things,  denounce  Communism and  adventurism.  They

have  denounced  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  as  an

opportunist  in their publication. I  have  it  here

with  me. The word they use is "opportunist" in  the

Plebeian.  I say that the biggest opportunists  were

the 13 of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Fourteen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, 14 of them. They thought

they  were  going  to win. I am not interested,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in who wins or loses. I am determined

to  see  that  Singapore  survives  as  a  coherent,

sensible and happy society. I have a stake in  this,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir. I  do not  sell  the  Tunku  De

Havilland aeroplanes or try to build airports. I  am

not in the contracting business. But I have a family

here rooted, unable to run away, and I am determined

to  see  that Singapore remains a happy and sensible

place where nobody is slitting each other's throats,

shouting  mass slogans and ending up  in  chaos  and

anarchy. There will be a new play when we next meet.

After this Session, we will prorogue. There will  be

a  recess,  a  new  Constitution, and  new  dramatis

personae.  But we will be deluding ourselves  if  we

believe  that the Communists have been  disposed  of

just  by  merger and Malaysia. We will  be  deluding

ourselves  if we believe that by scrubbing  out  the

Barisan  or knocking out a few of the front  leaders

the  ground  position will be resolved.  The  ground

position  has improved not because the  Barisan  has

been  scrubbed out but because they have  been  left

there to make mistakes and to expose themselves  for

the  lot  of  political adventurers and opportunists

that  they were - anti the people. Finally,  that  is

what they came to. They who talked of the masses ran

away from the masses that night in Hong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever our shortcomings - I do not make any

pretence;  we  have  quite a  number  - there  is  no

anaemia amongst my colleagues. We do not suffer from

leukemia. We have enough red corpuscles to  see  the

country  through. Yes, we lost Hong  Lim  two  years

ago. We will go back and fight again. They booed  us

at  the referendum. They got booed back. They  booed

us  at  Jalan Besar. They were booed back, and  they

nearly ran away too. But that night at Hong Lim  one

week  ago,  was  poetic  justice.  All  I  did,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, was to draw the attention of the crowd

to  the  fact that here were people who were moaning

the fact that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



country  was  going  into a haven  of  security  and

prosperity.  And  they got so frightened  that  they

switched  off  the lights, ran down the  stairs  and

scooted. [Interruption in Mandarin] The camera  does

not  lie. They are always afraid of the camera. They

go   round  like  bandits  tying  handkerchiefs  and

covering  up  their  noses. Why?  Are  these  really

heroes of the revolution? Did Lenin do these things,

stay  in  his  Party headquarters and send  pregnant

women  into battle? Really, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  am

not  bothered and concerned with the front  leaders,

but  I  am bothered and concerned with the gentlemen

that  I  have met whom the police cannot  find,  and

they are men of no mean calibre. Yes, I concede that

we have never made the error of under-estimating our

opponents' capacity for harm, and they have enormous

capacity  for  harm. With a small group  of  people,

they can mount an enormous offensive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last rally in Shenton Way for the

referendum, they were really good, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I  can  only think of the Catholic Church as equally

well  versed in these things - the expertise. I  was

watching  the Coronation on television in Europe  as

it  took place by Teistar linkup, and Pope Paul  was

`crowned not inside St. Peter's but outside  in  the

Square with 500,000 people watching. It was a really

massive  demonstration and an  emotional  experience

not  likely to be forgotten by those who took  part,

and  on  television for the world. I am  quite  sure

they  must  have  studied some of  these  things.  I

happened  to be in St. Peter's when the  first  Pope

appeared   on   television  and  it  was   quite   a

fascinating  experience. I have  said  this  before,

without  irreverance, that I admired  and  respected

the  technique. The Pope came out in  his  palanquin

shouldered by chaps with scabbards and hats  and  so

on  with  due pomp and panoply. As he came down  the

aisle,  I  heard shouts of "Viva il  Papa"  and  the

crowd underneath shouted "Viva il Papa" and nuns and

other  devotees went into an ecstasy. Then I  looked

up  at  the pillars and at each pillar on the  aisle

was a set of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



choir  boys. They knew how to do it. They  triggered

it  off  with "Viva il Papa" and there was a  ground

reaction  of "Viva ii Papa". It was very  good,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir. When 1 saw that Coronation,  I  said,

now  that  was the way to install a Government  - not

this silly business. We tried to do that in the City

Hall  but  it was not quite as good. Next  time,  we

will do better. We live and learn. Oh yes, we always

learn. Never make the error of believing that we are

obtuse,   obstinate  and  obdurate.  When  we   make

mistakes, we admit them and we learn from them.  The

old  Ministers used to be sworn in inside Government

House  - a little private cosy party - and then  they

drank  sherry  with each other.  But  the  Pope  was

there.  There  were 500,000 people  in  St.  Peter's

Square  packed like sardines and everybody who  took

part in it would remember it to his dying day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they tried to do something like that in Shenton

Way.  We  watched it. We sent chaps to  watch.  Five

hundred  chaps will suddenly walk off and then  walk

round the block and come back the other side. So you

get a feeling that lots of fellows are coming to the

meeting. In fact, they are the same chaps - the  same

30,000  fellows. That was what they had  there  - the

maximum.  But they were good - the clapping  and  the

cheering. They were trained and they made a  lot  of

noise  for  30,000 chaps. But then the ballot  boxes

were opened that night, the Member for Nee Soon  - he

has  lost interest now in life generally or  lie  is

fed up with all politics and quite rightly so. If  I

were   him,   I  would  be  fed  up  with  politics.

[Interruption]  Yes, his survival  instinct  is  the

best of them all. He is the most intelligent chap of

the  lot. That is why he cannot be bothered with all

this.  Why  should  he? This is all  leading  to  an

impasse,  a  confrontasi  from  which  there  is  no

retreat. And he does not want to be in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us never forget that the battle goes on. We

will  be  deluding ourselves. And I want  to  stress

this because sometimes in jest one says things which

are taken seriously. I do not believe you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



can  resolve these things by just chopping off a few

heads.  It cannot be done that way. It can  be  done

- we  have demonstrated that it is possible  - by  two

concurrent  weapons.  One  is  economic  and  social

progress, an expanding economy, a rising standard of

living and rising expectations. We turned the  tide,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  when we  built  houses,  homes,

schools,  clinics and community centres.  There  was

the  tangible evidence of a better life. That is the

first  arm and that was why we were determined  that

we should keep our money to provide amenities to the

people even if it meant no merger. But it would have

brought merger anyway because there was too much  at

stake.  Even if for the moment, let us  say  it  was

postponed for six months or for one year,  it  would

have  come hack because the basic factors  have  not

changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other arm is the open argument. They lost out

on  the open argument. They were telling lies to the

people  that they were sold out on citizenship.  The

Member for Anson, who was with them, suddenly  right

about   turned   and  bit  them   and   said,   "Oh,

miraculous."  Now  he has decided  that  he  has  no

chance to cash in on the pro-merger support.  So  he

goes  hack to anti-merger. What he lacks is a little

bit  of  ballast in him, otherwise he would  not  be

doing  these things. He is like a straw in the wind.

He  is  a  bit erratic. As I have said, in that  one

year  when he was Chief Minister, never was so  much

humbug enacted by so erratic a Chief Minister in  so

short  a time. I have to crib Churchill for that.  I

think that was what I meant. [Interruption] No, Sir.

I will not be so unkind as to say that. One makes up

one's  mind  where one stands. Everybody  recognises

after  a  while;  it  may take  sonic  tune.  People

thought  we did sell out Singapore and so  on.  They

were  spreading the lie to the people. They  thought

that with their cadres on the ground and signing all

these  petitions  and organising and,  according  to

them,  98 per cent of Kreta Ayer was against merger.

So they said. When the ballot boxes were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



opened,  they  got the shock of their lives  because

Kreta  Ayer  had the least of the blank votes.  What

was it - three per cent, four per cent? Three or four

per  cent.  They were clever people. They  were  not

like our Alliance friends. Our Alliance friends were

waddling  around not knowing what it was all  about.

But  they had 14 chaps. They knew that we wanted  to

know  where  their support was. They  did  not  know

which constituency was on which table; but we had to

have 51 tables for 51 constituencies. I concede when

my  opponent intelligently beats my plan. They  knew

that  if we wanted to know the result we must  count

table  by  table. And so into the ballot boxes  they

threw in the ballot paper and the polling card which

showed  the  constituency. It  was  very  clever.  A

submarine device; an anti-submarine mine.  The  next

time they go there, they will find that we will also

put in polling cards of many constituencies all into

the  same  boxes. They will then have to  think  out

another way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the men behind them are intelligent. They never

did  this.  I wanted to do this the intelligent  way

because  I  know  the battle goes  on.  So  I  said,

"Fifteen  seats, fight it." No power is attached  to

the  15 seats. This is important. But the men behind

are  intelligent. They never did this. For with  the

15  seats we could have proved to the world that the

people  of  Singapore  were for Malaysia  definitely

beyond  any doubt. We could also have found out  how

much their support has been whittled down in the one

year.  Yes. And if anything goes wrong, it does  not

matter because it is a controlled experiment. It  is

only 15 seats. No power. 15 in 159 seats. There  was

a  long-stop. The wicket-keeper, long-stop. But I am

thinking of obtuse gentlemen now. A forced 51  seats

before  March next year. They probably thought  they

could get an advantage, an edge over us. We had also

taken  that  into  account. Hence the  back  of  the

envelope says "delegation of powers to detain secret

society gangsters." That is one of the amendments in

Paper  Cmd.  24. There will be no gangsters  running

around at election time. They have also learnt. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



live and learn. If chaps switch sides, the next time

they  will go out of this Chamber. Why not?  Anybody

who  comes  into this Chamber on the  basis  of  his

Party's symbol, when he backs out from the Party, he

leaves. Yes. We must be prepared to live, learn  and

innovate. And I say we will do it. What is more,  if

we are intelligent, we will succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go into the constitutional

provisions - I will take probably 45 minutes to  draw

Members'  attention to the important parts - I  would

like to place on record my appreciation and that  of

my  Government  for  the dedication  of  a  band  of

officials who were not only able but who also worked

very  hard.  They went beyond the normal  bounds  of

duty.  They fought for what was right for  Singapore

to  do the right thing by the Government they serve.

I  would  like to say to them that their effort  was

appreciated.  It  made a big difference  because  it

saved  me  from having to read every single document

from  cover to cover. I have to peruse them. But  it

does help if we know that some sharp intellects have

been  through them, marked up the parts which looked

dubious or spurious and left me to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem, over the years, as the enemy

underground    increases   in    intelligence    and

experience,  is  to  find more and  more  people  of

ability on our side, because ultimately this  battle

can only be won if there are enough men of integrity

and ability to run the democratic system. Two things

are  fundamental. If there is no integrity the whole

thing  is a humbug. If it is self interest, then  it

will  go down in corruption, decadence and disarray.

If  there  is  integrity,  piety  and  goodness  but

without  the  ability to give it the drive  and  the

dynamism  that it requires, then it cannot  go  very

far. That is our problem, both in the public service

and  in  public  life generally. And  as  we  secure

stability  in  Malaysia, it is more likely  that  we

will  draw  men  out. More and more  are  taking  on

duties    and    responsibilities    beyond    their

professional lines, as members of public boards  and

statutory  corporations.  More  and  more  will   be

convinced that they have a duty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



and  a  role to society if they want the good things

that  they know and the good features of this system

to endure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now may I run through very rapidly the

important provisions? I have not the slightest doubt

that  they will be attacked by Members on the  other

side.  I  am not the slightest bit concerned because

they are honourable terms. They can be defended  and

justified at any time and every time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, if they will turn to what is the most

important  section - page 73 of Paper Cmd. 22.  There

in  Part  II,  Members will see our local  autonomy:

Education,  Medicine,  Labour and  social  security,

Pensions,  Factories. Concurrent  List  - List  IIIB.

These  are  all  under  the  control  of  the  State

Government.  I  think  I  would  like  to  draw  the

attention of Members to item 20 at page 74:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Until the end of August, 1968, and thereafter

until  Parliament with the concurrence of the  State

government   .... elections  to  the   Legislative

Assembly.'



<br><br>And so all this humbug that the Singapore Government

cannot be trusted to conduct the elections will  now

cease.  This  is  what the Tunku signed  and  agreed

upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one section for which an amendment

will still have to come. There will still be several

amendments. One is the authority for prosecution  by

the State Advocate-General. That will be made by  an

amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code. We are not

quite  sure yet how best to do it. The parliamentary

draftsmen  in  Kuala Lumpur and our State  Advocate-General are in consultation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, if I may run quickly - page 98 of the Federal

Constitution. Article 131 provides for appeals  from

the Supreme Court to the Federal Court. Then at page

35,  Article  50 of Command 22 of 1963: Audit.  Then

pages  213 to 231, minor amendments to the  customs,

excise  and  income  tax laws  under  the  financial

agreement. Members know that this was a vital matter

in  issue. Who collects'? This is a matter  of  very

great importance. I am happy to report that we  have

resolved  it.  We  will collect  and  the  power  is

delegated  to us irrevocably, and the  only  way  in

which it can be revoked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



is  if the Singapore Government is unable, unwilling

or  incapable of collecting, and whether it is or is

not,  it  is  a  matter which can be tested  in  the

courts. That is provided for in the Annex, page 230;

paragraph  10.  "Disputes as  to  interpretation  or

application of this Agreement." In other  words,  it

is  a  justiciable issue, not one which is  for  the

Finance Minister of the Federation to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadcasting and Television - page 232. Members will

see   that   we   are  in  charge  of   the   staff,

administration  and  the day-to-day  programmes.  We

will  have,  as we expand, the right  to  have  more

radio frequencies and channels for transmissions  of

television programmes. Any over-all policy  will  be

of pan-Malaysian application unless, for some reason

of  national interest or of national importance,  it

should be applicable in the rest of Malaysia but not

in  Kuala Lumpur. In other words, what was agreed in

the White Paper is now enshrined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 137, Article 8: Cabinet to exercise general

control, direction of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 19, Article 23: Citizenship. I do not know

what  the Member for Anson is complaining about.  He

said that it was miraculous in August last year when

we  all became Malaysian citizens. Now he says it is

second-class citizenship because we are not  allowed

to  vote in the Federation. I just do not understand

it,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir. He knew that  there  is  no

change  in the position. It was as stated.  What  is

enshrined  here was what was stated in the  exchange

of  letters in July and August last year. I may  add

that  the  voting  disability  is  reciprocal.  They

cannot come here. We cannot go there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common Market and Tariff Board, page 34: Article 48

(c). The constitution of this Tariff Board and rules

cannot  be altered without our concurrence.  Sir,  I

want   to   make   this  point.  All   these   State

responsibilities  -  religious  freedom,  education,

labour,   Tariff  Board  - I  think  there  is   some

misunderstanding, particularly with the Church,  and

I had to make a statement on freedom of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



religion. No government can bind all governments for

all  time. It is not in the book of law to do  that.

What  we can do is to hind ourselves. If some future

State  Government  gives  the  concurrence  to   the

Federation to alter this, then these things  can  be

altered.  They  are alterable with consent.  It  may

well  be that 50 years from now, when we become more

homogeneous,  more united, I think in the  long  run

perhaps  quite a lot of these other items should  go

to the centre. But it must be done on a quid pro quo

basis. If more goes to the centre, then as we put in

more   money   to   the  centre  to  discharge   its

responsibilities in the centre, so  we  should  send

more  representative to the centre. But the point  I

would   like  to  make  is  this.  All  these  State

privileges which are safeguarded are safeguarded  to

this extent: that the Constitution cannot be changed

without  the consent of the Singapore Government.  I

think  lawyers understand this. But I would like  to

stress  it  for  the  purpose  of  the  lay  reader,

particularly to the newspapers and other mass media,

that   a  future  State  Government  which  is   not

committed to this policy can change it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw your attention also to page 26, section 32,

"Liaison as to citizenship". They have to inform  us

of  naturalisation, and I think they must  be  on  a

concurrent  basis. They are going to  naturalise  as

Singapore  citizens and other citizens - sections  31

and 32.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on pages 38 and 39, the Singapore branch of

the  Public Services Commission, section 55  (1)   to

(8) .   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  you   will   find   the

Constitutional  safeguards in page 47,  section  69,

the most important paragraph of which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No amendment shall be made to the Constitution

without  the concurrence of the Governor [`Governor'

here  means  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara]  if  the

amendment is such as to affect the operation of  the

Constitution in relation to Singapore as regards any

of the following matters -',



<br><br>and  one of them is religion in the State. In  other

words, there can be no legislation. As I have stated

publicly, I am not a supporter of immorality, but my

Government   does  not  intend  to   introduce   any

legislation  regarding khalwat  (I  think  it  means

"found in close proximity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



under suspicious circumstances"), and other offences

connected with the Muslim law, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then page 30 - there is now an amendment which will

be  included in page 30, for delegated power to  the

Singapore  Government to detain for  secret  society

activities.  The  C.P.I.B. - I think  this  is  a  very

important section - is contained in the first  of  the

letters in Paper Misc. 5, at page 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sixthly, it is agreed that because of the interest

of  the  Singapore Government in the  prevention  of

corruption,   the  organization   of   the   Corrupt

Practices Investigation Bureau and the powers of the

State Advocate-General in relation to the prevention

of  corruption  under the Prevention  of  Corruption

Ordinance.  1959,  will not be altered  without  the

consent of the Singapore Government.'.



<br><br>Sir, I  have  tried  to get  that  point  into  the

Constitution, but I am afraid time was  so  pressing

on  the 8th of July that we had to leave it only  in

this exchange of letters. I would like to point  out

that  where  there  is a response  in  reply  to  an

exchange  of  letters,  then  that  goes  into   the

Constitution. For the others, they are covered in my

letter  of the 22nd of July where there is  just  an

agreement. But it is open to a subsequent Government

in  the  Federation  - I  do not  think  the  present

Government will go back on its words - if it is a non-Alliance Government, to go back on it if it desires,

because  the C.P.I.B. will not be enshrined  in  the

Constitution.  But the fact that  it  continues  and

will continue with civilian investigators will be  a

very  powerful  deterrent  to  keep  in  check   the

excessive use or any abuse of power of officials  in

all  departments  of the State.  If  I  may  mention

particularly  those  departments  who   think   that

because  the  Central Government is far  away  - like

Police  and  Immigration which will  pass  into  the

hands  of  the  Central Government - 260  miles  away,

therefore,  they might get away with it.  Therefore,

it  is  useful that we should have these  powers  to

prosecute locally through the State Advocate-General

and civilian investigators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elections is at page 63, section 95. There you will

see,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  provision  made  for  the

Singapore Government to conduct the first elections.

These 15 elected representatives will go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



on  beyond the general elections which will be  held

in  the Federation after Malaysia Day. Our intention

then  was  that  elections  should  be  held  before

Malaysia  Day  and  then the 15 elected  would  take

their places in the Federal Parliament, and when the

Federal  Parliament dissolves, as it must under  the

Constitution   in   the  middle   of   1964,   these

representatives will remain Members for the life  of

the  second  term;  in other words,  for  the  first

Parliament elected throughout Malaysia. However, our

plans  are  somewhat  altered now  in  view  of  the

decision  taken by the Opposition, and  I  think  we

shall    have    51   Members   here   before    our

representatives   will   appear   in   the   Federal

Parliament.  There  may  have  to  be  some  interim

provision    for    a   token   representation    by

representatives. I do not propose  to  have  the  15

elected  from  this House. It may well  be  that  we

might  send  two  or  three Ministers  to  represent

Singapore   until   the   elections   for   the   15

representatives take place, which  I  hope  will  be

done not so very long after Malaysia now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fundamental liberties are all enshrined in

the  Federal  Constitution - for easy reference,  the

second edition of the Federal Constitution (Articles

5  to  13)  can be found in pages 28-32. And  it  is

subject to section 60 of Paper Cmd. 22 at page 4l-2,

which  says  that  so long as we  have  autonomy  in

Labour  and  Education, there will be power  through

Education   and   Labour  laws  to  prevent   double

enjoyment.  Sir,  I  made this  quite  clear  in  my

statement to this House which was published  in  the

financial arrangements, Paper Misc. 4 of 1963,  when

I  stated that this provision had been agreed to.  I

think it is Document VI, at page 50 of Paper - sorry,

Mr Speaker, Sir, it has not been flagged but I will

give the reference later and I do not think I should

take  the  time of the House. I made it quite  clear

then. I will give the reference at a later date, and

I  think  it  is also in Hansard. You may  remember,

Sir, that there cannot be double enjoyment. It is as

much   in  our  interests  as  in  the  Federation's

interest,  because  if either side  introduces  free

secondary education - let me put it in a neutral  way

- ahead  of the other, then there is bound  to  be  a

drip of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



students  from  one territory to the  other  seeking

that  free education. And since tax is paid  by  one

territory - it is only paid by the residents of  that

territory - then the enjoyment of the rights  of  free

education should only be limited to people  of  that

territory.  By  way  of example,  if  we  give  free

secondary education, then we would want to have  the

right  to  prevent  students from other  territories

coming into our schools and vice versa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in the first phase of factories in

Jurong,  we may, not unnaturally - and I do not  want

to  over-emphasise this point because we want to  be

flexible about it - want to have the right to  ensure

that  only  Singapore citizens are employed  in  the

factories. And similarly if a steel mill were put up

in  Johore next to an iron mine, they may - not  that

they  will  - require as part of the terms that  only

citizens of Johore are employed. And so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free port status, Mr Speaker, Sir, page 226, sets

out  the  Common Market arrangements and the gradual

erosion of the free port over a period of 12  years,

right up to 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The franchise of Singapore citizens is set out in

page  26,  Article  31.  The  reciprocity  is  there

- citizens  and nobody else vote here, and  Malaysian

citizens who are not Singapore citizens cannot  vote

here.  We will have to decide later on on the  basis

of reciprocity, the residence period required before

a man decides to be one or the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial Arrangements - Annex J. Financial Review

- page  229, paragraph 8. I think that is a matter  of

some importance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The arrangements specified in paragraphs 6 and 7

above  shall remain in operation until31st December,

1964.  The  two Governments shall then review  these

arrangements and shall decide upon any amendments to

be  made  to them in respect of the two year  period

commencing  1st  January, 1965.  There  shall  be  a

similar review in respect of each subsequent  period

of  two  years. In default of agreement between  the

two  Governments,  any issue  in  dispute  shall  be

referred   to  an  independent  assessor   appointed

jointly  by  the  two  Governments.  In  default  of

agreement between the two Governments on the  choice

of an assessor, the Lord President of the Federal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



Court, after   considering  the  views   of   both

governments,  shall appoint an assessor  from  among

persons  recommended by the Inter-national Bank  for

Reconstruction  and  Development  as  being  persons

enjoying an international reputation in finance. The

recommendations of the assessor shall be binding  on

both governments. Such reviews shall have regard  to

all relevant factors.'.



<br><br>Hence, the importance of Paper Misc. 4, for, in  our

contention, as you will see from the papers that  we

have put up, even on the basis of their full Defence

expenditure being, in fact, extended, which we doubt

and  I  do not think they will do it just to  spite

us,  because,  as I have said, they  have  to  spend

$8.20 to $8.30 to our $1.70 to $1.80 for which  they

have  to spend the rest of their $10 from their  own

pockets,   and  they  have  to  take  into   account

donations  made  by  the British or  other  friendly

governments  to  us for Defence.  I  would  like  to

restate  or  state again our position. Our  view  is

that on their figures, we say it is 34.3 per cent of

national  taxes or 23 per cent of the total  revenue

of  Singapore. We have agreed to 40 per cent because

of  the importance of the 8th of July and because we

wanted to make a concession in view of the fact that

the   Common  Market  was  agreed  to  be   in   the

Constitution. But after 31st December,  1964,  there

will be a review and what is important is this: that

although  we may be only a State Government,  if  in

the  review  we  do not agree, then  an  independent

assessor has to be appointed. And if we do not agree

on  the assessor, then it must come from a panel  of

persons put forward by the World Bank. So there  can

be no question of bias in these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress this particular point for

the information of Members because one of the points

made by the Opposition is that we have given away  a

lot  of  money which is quite untrue. Three-quarters

of  what  we  have  given  away  will  be  spent  in

Singapore  itself, which we  are  now  spending  in

Singapore       - Police,      Prisons,       S.I.R.,

Telecommunications,  Civil Aviation,  Meteorological

Office,  and  the extra one-quarter is for  internal

security  and defence expenditure which we now  have

to  incur because we are part of the Federation.  We

also  pay  part of foreign affairs which we  do  not

have now, and part of Parliament, the 15



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



seats   which   will  be  warmed  in   the   Central

Parliament;  somebody has to  pay  for  the  leather

being worn out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of movement, I mentioned this yesterday,

Mr   Speaker,   Sir.  This  is  another   important

provision at page 42, section 60 (1) . You will  find

that  in  sub-section (3), we  are  adding  in  this

amendment now:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`any such restriction shall apply reciprocally to

the States of Malaya and the State of Singapore'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should really be in "the States of Malaysia". I

think the draftsman has forgotten this. It should be

the  States of Malaysia. We may not wish to take any

person  from  Malaya and I have already mentioned  a

few  of  the gentlemen who used to give us a lot  of

trouble. There are two types - political undesirables

and  secret society elements. We have the  right  to

request  that  such  a person shall  not  enter  our

State,  just as the Federation will have - I  saw  in

the   newspaper   today  someone  mentioned   "Sheik

Azahari".  It was not Sheik Azahari I had  in  mind.

What  I  had  in  mind was Said Zahari,  the  former

editor of Utusan Melayu, who is a Singapore citizen.

He   came  back  to  Singapore  and  he  found   the

Federation causeway blocked against him and he never

went  back. Well, in the same way, we have  quite  a

number  of gentlemen, Mr Speaker, Sir, who  do  not

add much to the prosperity of Singapore and, who, in

fact,  increase the general police expenditure,  the

C.I.D. expenditure of Singapore. They can  well  be

looked after by the State from where they came.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;House of Representatives, 15 seats, page 13,

Article  9.  Judicial and Legal  Service,  page  37,

Article  54  (3);  appointment of judges,  page  17,

Article 17. Then, languages. In this Assembly  (page

46)  it  will continue as it is, which is the  point

Members  on  the  other side from  Barisan  Sosialis

ought   to  remember.  If  the  country  had  chosen

Alternative  B, complete merger, they would  all  be

disqualified even from this Assembly because many of

them  cannot speak English or Malay, even after four

years of free tuition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the definition of "Malays" will now include

Malays  born  in Singapore, and that is included  in

page 77, right at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



the  bottom - Article 160 (interpretation). It  means

really that all the special privileges which a Malay

can  get  in  Malaya will now be  available  to  the

Malays  born in Singapore. I would like to make  the

point  that in Singapore the position remains as  it

is.  In  other words, there is no ratio for licences

or  other profits, Government patronage and jobs  in

the  civil service on the basis of race. We  believe

in  the principle of open competition that has  been

accepted  by  the  Federation and it  will  continue

after Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim religion, page 137, section 6. The Agong

will be the Head of the Muslim religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturalisation to be with the concurrence of the

Singapore Government, page 23, section 27 (7) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Permanent Secretaries and State Advocate-General to continue as they are, page 139, Articles

18 and 19.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, police officers, page 56. Sir, may I pause

with  police officers? There is a certain amount  of

disquiet. I have had to discuss this matter with the

Deputy  Prime  Minister in the  Federation  and  the

Minister for Internal Security because there is some

unhappiness at the contemplation of the police  here

losing  their  present salary scales  on  promotion.

What  it provides therefore is that no person  shall

lose  anything after Malaysia. Sir, I am  advised  - and  Members will have seen my letter to  Tun  Razak

and Dr Ismail, and they have agreed to confirm this

in  a letter - that nobody will lose. The problem is,

what  happens  on promotion? Grade  for  grade,  the

Federation pay is slightly less than ours. According

to   some  officers,  it  is  appreciably  less.  My

officials,  my  Permanent Secretary  and  the  State

Advocate-General, advise me that section 85 (2)   (a)

"shall be employed on terms and conditions not  less

favourable  than those applicable to him immediately

before   Malaysia  Day"  means  that  his  promotion

prospects also cannot be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to press this matter too hard on

these  matters which have been agreed, but  I  would

like  to point out that what may happen will be that

if  the  Police Force insists on that  and  gets  an

interpretation of this Section by the Federal Court,

very few promotions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



or  new  designations  may be created.  One  problem

would  be, supposing the establishment were  reduced

for  each  of  the grades and then  new  grades  are

created,  something, something Pegawais  instead  of

A.S.P., is put on the Federation post. Therefore, my

point  is  that it is not profitable to  pursue  the

legal  argument to the end. They may  well  win  the

legal argument. I can see the merit of the argument.

But  it is much better to go on the substance of the

case.  We are paying to the Federation the full  sum

of money we are paying the police; that is included.

We are paying a sum of money with projections on the

basis   of  present  salary  scales.  That  is   the

important  point, Mr Speaker, Sir.  Projections  on

present  salary scales. In other words, if they  cut

down salaries on promotion, then our contribution to

the  Federation will go down. If they do that,  then

we  must  press for it on the review on 1st January,

1965.  I cannot hind the future government, but  for

myself I will be trying to press that very hard  and

take  the  savings from that and give  allowance  to

officers  serving in Singapore. We are  doing  that,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, in the case of  the  Judges.  In

fact, we are doing more than that in the case of the

Judges.  There  will  be a Bill  put  through  on  a

Certificate   of  Urgency  to  settle  the   Judges'

salaries and that of the State Advocate-General. You

will find it in my letter to Tun Razak. They will go

on  to the Federation Judges' basic, which is higher

than  ours. But for the present officers, that  will

mean  they will lose in the allowance from  $400  to

$120.  So  the State will make up the difference  of

$280,  and other perks will be carried on the  State

Budget.  In  other words, the Judges  will  get  the

benefit.  We are paying the Federation the full  sum

of  money  which they will have to pay  our  Judges;

that  is included in the 40 per cent. And on review,

that will also be taken into account. They will have

to  pay  the Judges. The lawyers will appear on  the

State  budget, I think. We will carry over and above

that  the sum of $280 to make tip for the fact  that

they  should not lose the allowance. It is,  on  the

whole,  a  fair and reasonable solution to  what  is

after all a difficult establishment problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like once again to make the position clear

to  the  Police Force - and this applies also to  the

Army  - that nobody will lose anything; and  I  would

say  they have a very strong case to take the  total

gross take-home pay, even on promotion, as what they

have  today, because we are paying for it.  I  think

the  argument is invincible. There is no gain-saying

the  fact that since we pay for it, we ought to  get

it. The standard of living in Singapore is high, and

that  is that. I think it is unconscionable for  the

Central Government to make the State Government  pay

what  it is now paying and then to reduce the salary

and  keep the balance. I am quite sure that  is  not

the  intention of the Federation Government. I would

like to give the police officers the assurance of my

Government that we shall try and resolve this  in  a

way  which  will be conducive to a unified Malaysian

Police  Force.  There are problems  of  a  Malaysian

Police  Force, because if the Malayan and the Borneo

police  were  to  come up to our level,  then  their

budgets  will really go up very high, because  their

scales, particularly those in Borneo, are much lower

than  ours. But then their cost of living  is  lower

than ours -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Prime Minister is going

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No. May I just finish the

constitutional  point, and  then  I  will  wind  up?

Because I have only got another 10 points to make.

and it cannot be altered without our agreement. That

is  section 10. The authority is irrevocable  unless

the State Government shows it is unwilling or unable

to  discharge this function sufficiently. I  do  not

think  anybody can accuse the Singapore  Income  Tax

Department  or the Singapore Customs and  Excise  of

being either incompetent or unwilling -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensions liability, page 147, Article78.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then page 46, Article 68. I would like to read

this  one.  Sir, this is a matter of some importance

to  draw  the  attention of Members  to.  These  are

points  which  would have been lost  in  a  complete

merger:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in clause (2) of Article 8 or clause (1)

of  Article  12  shall prohibit  or  invalidate  any

provision  of  State  law  in  Singapore   for   the

advancement of Malays;'.



<br><br>This is in order to allow us even after Malaysia  to

give  Malays  free education, right from  school  to

university. The Federation Government is  unable  to

do  this  because their Constitution prohibits  them

from discriminating in education between races.  But

as against that is the clause that there shall be no

reservation  for Malays in accordance  with  Article

153  of positions in the public service to be filled

by   recruitment  in  Singapore  or  of  permits  or

licences  for the operation of any trade or business

in  Singapore; in other words, free competition into

the public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress this point, "to be filled by

recruitment  in  Singapore" includes  posts  in  the

Federal  service  recruited in Singapore.  In  other

words,   the   Police  Commissioner  for   instance,

recruiting policemen in Singapore will not be  bound

by  any  four  to one ratio. They are  posts  to  be

recruited in Singapore and there is no question of a

four to one ratio being applied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Even in the Federal service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Even in the Federal service. If

the  post  is  recruited in Singapore, even  in  the

Federal service there will be no restriction. Let us

assume,    for    instance,    the    Director    of

Telecommunications,  recruiting  several   technical

assistants; then the Director of Telecommunications,

Singapore,  recruiting  in  Singapore  will  recruit

regardless of race. In other words, opportunities on

the  basis  of  free competition, with  the  special

position  of Malays in education, Malay settlements.

If  they  want business licences, then I  am  afraid

they  will have to go to Johore or some other State,

because that has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



agreed  with  the  Federation Government  that  that

shall be so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General - page 139 of Paper

Command 22 of 1963, Article 18 to 19. Secondment  or

voluntary transfer - page 167, Article 102. Sir,  the

point here is that the position of any person who is

seconded  to  the  general  public  service  or  the

Judicial and Legal Service of the Federation, as the

case  may  be, is safeguarded here. He  can,  if  he

likes, opt to go into the Federal service or remain

on secondment as he wishes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in page 144 - I read in the newspaper

something about some Opposition Parties thinking  it

is  not  a good idea, but I would like to point  out

that  this has been agreed - section 30 (2)  (b)  (this

is the State Constitution) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(2) The seat of a Member of the Legislative

Assembly shall become vacant -



<div align="center"><h4>* * * *</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if he ceases to be a member of or is expelled

or  resigns from the political party for which

he stood in the election;'.



<br><br>In other words, any person winning an election on  a

Party  symbol, if he quits the Party or  is  sacked,

loses his seat. I think that is as it should be,  to

provide  stable  governments between elections.  For

five  years  between elections,  there  is  no  more

musical  chairs  in this Assembly.  The  Member  for

Queenstown  does  not like the  P.A.P.  He  won  the

elections on the P.A.P. ticket. He will have  to  go

back  to  the electorate of Queenstown and fight  on

his  own  symbol.  That  has been  agreed  with  the

Federation of Malaya. Members will have noticed that

in  my  letter to Tun Razak and also on the envelope

signed by the Tunku.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara - page 135, Article 1, a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the

question  of citizenship, you will remember  that  I

reported  to the House that I had agreed that  there

should be no double enjoyment, and I thought it  was

in  the  Miscellaneous Papers. I was  mistaken.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,It is in Hansard, Vol.  20,  No.  2,

Friday. 5th of April, column 25. "Progress Report of

Constitutional   provisions   for    Singapore    in

Federation  of  Malaysia in  accordance  with  White

Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961". It reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Another point is the spelling out of State

autonomy  with  the  consequential  provision   that

Malaysian  citizens who are also Singapore  citizens

cannot  have double enjoyment of both State autonomy

in matters like education and labour and at the same

time  have  full enjoyment of education  and  labour

rights in the other State.'



<br><br>The  section  which I am quite sure the  Member  for

Anson  is  going to raise a hue and cry about  is  a

reciprocal section. In other words, it does not mean

that we will exercise these rights, but it does mean

that if either the Federation of Malaya or Singapore

has  free secondary or - let us say for the  sake  of

argument  - free university education, we could  stop

students  from the other side coming over. Similarly

with  the  factories, we could,  if  we  wanted  to,

restrict  the  factories  to  employment   of   only

Singapore   citizens.  This  is  the  constitutional

position. I do not think in the long run that it  is

conducive to a united federation to do this. We have

done this, because the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



Borneo  territories have sought to keep  our  labour

out for the time being. H is a concession we have to

make  to  them, because there is a genuine  fear  in

Sabah  and Sarawak that they will be overwhelmed  by

more  energetic and more sophisticated  technicians,

merchants and bankers, and so they have put in  this

provision.  Therefore  we  have  also  put  in  this

provision  purely  as  a  reciprocal  safeguard  and

ultimately I think as a bargaining counter. If  they

put  their fences down, we will put our fences down.

To   give  a  simple  illustration,  there   is   no

university in Borneo and they will either have to go

abroad   on  Colombo  Plan  scholarships   or   seek

admission  to the University of Singapore  which  is

nearer  than  the University of Malaya  in  K.L.  We

accept  them in the Polytechnic, the University  and

all  the  technical  schools as  a  rule.  Even  the

Nanyang  University has Borneo and Sarawak  students

and  we  would  like to continue that practice.  But

constitutionally speaking, as long as  they  have  a

fence  up against our workers going there; in  other

words,  so  long  as  there is a certain  amount  of

exclusiveness on their side and, for that matter, on

the  Federation side, so we must have the  right  to

exclude  if  we wish. I emphasise that in  the  long

run, these barriers must go. As the Federation grows

in  unity, particularly under the threat of external

pressures,  it is inevitable that we will  all  grow

closer to one another, because our problems are  the

same.  We share a common fate, and the chances  are.

if  one  part of the Federation goes under, so  will

the others. But I would like to make this point.  It

has  often been referred to by the Barisan  Sosialis

Members  and also the Member for Anson has taken  up

the cry of second-class citizens. I say in Malaysia,

far  from  being second-class citizens, I  would  be

proud  to  be  a  Singapore citizen.  And  it  is  a

privilege  to  be a Singapore citizen,  because  you

have  public housing which you do not have in  other

parts  of  Malaysia  to the same  extent,  you  have

educational  facilities  which  you  have  not   got

anywhere  else in Malaysia, and the possibility,  if

our  rate of growth is maintained, of free secondary

education for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



everybody  - not just for Malays - by the third  year,

by any Government which comes into office. The money

is  there, the expansion is there; and the right  to

social   welfare  benefits  - unemployment  benefits.

These  are  privileges accorded  only  to  Singapore

citizens of Malaysia, not to Malaysian citizens  who

are  not  Singapore citizens. As  against  that,  of

course,  there are the prohibitions that  we  cannot

vote in the Federation nor can they vote here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was attracted, Mr Speaker, by an argument put

forward  at  the  Prime  Ministers'  Conference   in

September  last  year, and whilst we  all  make  our

bargaining positions as strong as possible, we  have

at  the  same time to look at the future  where  our

destinies converge. And one Prime Minister  - a  very

able  speaker  - said he was against Britain  joining

the Common Market. He was from one of those European

dominions.  He  said that if Britain  joined  Europe

then  it  was sheer humbug to say - well, he did  not

actually use the word "humbug", but he said it would

be  a  pure pretence to say that it would not really

become  slowly  part of the political structure  and

eventually  the  military structure of  Europe.  Its

already  military structure had become  an  economic

and  political union. He said in his experience  -he

has got experience of federal constitutions and as a

student  of history - "A federation goes one  of  two

ways:   either   the   force   is   centrifugal   or

centripetal.  In other words, either  the  bits  and

pieces  break  up  or they come  closer  and  closer

together.  I cannot envisage Malaysia splitting  up.

It  must come closer and closer together. It must be

centripetal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless we should have every bargaining

counter. Charity is a desirable characteristic  but,

in  these circumstances, it is a luxury for  us.  We

like to be generous to the rest of Malaysia and  you

will  see  from  the  exchange of  letters  that  we

offered  two  per cent of our national  taxes,  both

Income  Tax and Excise, as a component part  of  the

prosperity  index for Common Market. It  is  not  an

amount  to be despised - two per cent, three per  cent

- it  is  $6,000,000 now; it will grow to $12,000,000

in five



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



years'  time and $20,000,000 in ten years' time.  In

the  Constitution is written out, in so far as human

ingenuity  can provide in legal documents,  all  the

safeguards and all the bargaining counters.  We  had

quite  an  ingenious team on our side, Mr  Speaker,

Sir, with sharp intellects. We had the smallest team

in  London,  two Ministers, against the Federation's

six:  even Sarawak came with a delegation of  seven.

Seven  chaps, seven honourable gentlemen signed  the

document. North Borneo -  six. But there were only two

of  us.  And our officials were only five,  plus  my

personal  secretary  who  acted  as  secretary   and

stenographer.  But I would say there was  no  point,

not  even  half a point, which we unwittingly  threw

away.  If we gave away a point, it was because there

was some concession, some generosity of approach  on

the other side. I would not like to pretend that  it

has  been  otherwise. It would be dishonest  because

the  letters  clearly  show, and  I  am  afraid  the

attitude  of  certain gentlemen in Kuala  Lumpur  in

high places continues to show, a degree of aloofness

and lack of understanding of our problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot govern Singapore on the basis that it is

a  small State and that you can squat on it. This is

the  vital heart of a throbbing region, a region  in

the  midst of flux and turmoil and revolution.  This

is  the centre - a big market-place, and now with the

Common Market, the industrial base. Nothing can take

away  our  natural harbour, our airport, the  Jurong

complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if Members have read hard-headed

businessmen's appraisal of Singapore after Malaysia.

Share prices, land prices, land values bear it  out.

The  Member for Farrer Park will know. There  is  no

gainsaying  this. And we are prepared to  share  all

this  with  Malaysia  provided  gradually  over  the

years, as we throw more into the common pool, so our

voice  in  national matters must increase. That  is,

the   gradual  process.  On  certain  matters,  like

education, it will be difficult - for 50 years, maybe

even  more  - to  quite  fit in with  the  Federation

pattern  or,  for  that  matters,  with  the  Borneo

pattern.  It  is  one  of  those  things  that  have

happened in history.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



The  British made a decision in 1945 to separate  us

without  knowing  the immeasurable  consequences  of

that act which led to a whole series of events which

culminated  in  riots, strikes, civil  disobedience,

and only ended - I mean, really we turned the tide on

education  when the boycott failed. Sometime  before

that  we convinced the Chinese that nobody was going

to   kill   Chinese  education,   let   alone   this

Government. The Member for Queenstown has a  son  in

an   English   school,  whilst   the   Parliamentary

Secretary  for  Education  has  his  children  in  a

Chinese school. How could it be? There is no  answer

to  that. There can be none. And so I say, far  from

being ashamed of being a Singapore citizen, it is  a

prize  to be gained in Malaysia, one which  we  will

not lightly give away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the financial arrangements, I want to make

three points. First, about the entrep�t trade. There

will  be a lot more talk of selling away the  birth-right   of  Singapore  and  all  the  rest  of   it,

particularly  from the Member for  Anson  -  he  has

already shot that line; it will be difficult for him

to  retract. Apart from eight competent expert minds

from the World Bank, having been brought to bear  on

the  matter, I would like to add this: that our  own

team  in the Economic Development Board - for  we  do

not  embark on something on the basis of a guess,  a

leap  into  the  dark. That is not  the  way  we  do

things. It has been carefully worked out. Two-thirds

of  our entrep�t trade is on primary products,  like

rubber,  copra,  pepper, coffee. And  the  principal

markets for these products lie outside Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members will look at the exchange of documents,

there  is one signed by the Finance Minister of  the

Federation.  It is on the fourth page  - letter  from

the  Finance  Minister.  The third  letter.  "Common

Market."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Federal Government undertakes not to impose

export  duties  in Singapore in respect  of  primary

products, other than minerals including oil produced

in Singapore.'



<br><br>In other words, on our present statistics.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



two-thirds  of  our  entrep�t  trade  is  unaffected

- rubber, copra, pepper, coffee. They will go  on  as

usual.  No need for bonded warehousing and the  rest

of  it.  Bonded warehousing comes in in the case  of

tyres,  by  way  of example, if and when  tyres  are

manufactured. Tyres are now n1anufactured  in  Kuala

Lumpur.  I have not the slightest doubt that Dunlops

will apply for protection in the Common Market. Sir,

this is another point that I would like to make.  We

may  be  one-fourteenth of Malaysia, but we have  40

per  cent  of the purchasing power of the  total  as

against 60 per cent in Malaya. Purchasing power. Any

advertiser of consumer goods can confirm that. It is

borne  out by the statistics, the sales - radio  sets,

transistors, nearly 100 per cent of T.V., apart from

Johore  not  paying for licences  hut  getting  free

entertainment from Singapore. I would say we have  a

strong   bargaining  position,  and  we  intend   to

exercise it. Let us say tyres are included.  Once  a

commodity  is protected, then it can be manufactured

anywhere  in Malaysia. The protection is not  for  a

particular  factory, but for a particular commodity,

and  `or  that reason Bridgestone is opening  up  in

Jurong.  That is as it should be. If, in  fact,  the

proximity of rubber estates to Dunlop factory  makes

a  difference in cost as against taking rubber  from

South  Johore  to  Jurong, then  Dunlops  will  beat

Bridgestone.  If  it  is  not,  then  in   the   end

Bridgestone  will  sell probably  in  South  Malaya.

Singapore  and  Borneo, because  it  is  cheaper  to

export  tyres  from here to Borneo than  from  Kuala

Lumpur  by  rail  - Klang to Kuala  Lumpur,  down  to

Singapore   by   ship,  handling  charges, freight

charges,   and  so  on.  This  is  a   point   worth

remembering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Customs, Excise and Income Tax will remain

State Departments. In other words, we ourselves  can

ensure that there will be as little inconvenience as

possible caused to the commercial community. This is

covered  in Article 5 of Annex G. Sir, if  one  will

look at the financial arrangements, one will see  In

the  ultimatum at page 61 - I do not think it was  an

ultimatum, Mr Speaker. Sir; it was somebody in  the

Finance Ministry who lost his temper and decided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



to  write a tough letter, requesting a reply  within

48  hours  - "Powers to be reserved  to  the  Federal

Government:  The  power  to  prohibit  imports   and

exports  of any class of goods;". Sir, we could  not

agree   to   that  because  it  means  putting   our

lifeblood,  our trade, into the hands of  a  Federal

Finance  Minister  who may not be  as  sensitive  to

Singapore  economy  as we are.  For  instance,  they

banned  South  African goods. I do  not  approve  of

South Africa and apartheid. But it is very difficult

when  a ship comes in - you are a big port - and, say,

part  of the cargo is South African and so you  will

not  work the cargo, for political reasons, to  show

sympathy  for  the struggle of the  African  people.

That  has been done in the Federation. We share that

sympathy,  but  we  are sufficiently  aware  of  the

realities,  the practical difficulties, n  which  it

will  involve us. Therefore, we are not a  party  to

that. That means we will go on as we are. That is  a

point  worth  remembering, Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  Also

Chinese  textiles have been banned in the Federation

for  various reasons. I do not think we want to  get

committed  to these policies. We are a  big  trading

area.  We trade in the world's goods, with the  rest

of  the world. And that way, is the best way for all

of  us.  And now this power cannot be exercised.  If

one  were to look at Annex G, Members will see  that

it  is  only  with  the  consent  of  the  Singapore

Government that this power can be exercised. So when

the  Member for Cairnhill says it is all  bogus,  he

must have been unaware of these difficulties. He  is

probably  either  not in the inner conclave  of  the

Alliance  in  Kuala Lumpur, or perhaps he  was  just

shooting  an  election  line.  There  were   serious

differences   which   - very   fortunately   patient,

prolonged - sometimes tortuous, sometimes bitter - but

always    determined   negotiations   - provided    a

conclusion in the end, a successful solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the other point is this: unlike the

Federation,  the  law  on foreign  banks  - owned  by

foreign   nations  - will  not  apply.   Banking   is

concurrent.  Prohibition in the  Federation  on  the

Bank  of  Indonesia, Bank Negara, and  the  Bank  of

China - will not apply in Singapore. We will continue

as we are.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity at this

last sitting of the Assembly, with these powers  - as

I  have  said,  when  we meet  again,  I  will  have

discharged  my responsibilities, I hope,  completely

and successfully, without a blot on my copybook.  No

riots,  no  revolution, no  arson.  30  days  to  go

- actually  29 because the 31st August is  no  longer

our  responsibility, but nevertheless we will always

do  our best to ensure - and the Singapore Government

has  valuable experience in these matters  - to  give

advice  if  it is sought by the Minister responsible

in  the  Federation. We would not like to shirk  our

responsibilities because if through insensitivity or

other  reasons  some wrong policy  were  instituted,

then we in Singapore and Malaysia would all suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to compare the end of our first term

of  office with that of the last Government  led  by

the Member for Anson and the Member for Cairnhill. I

hear  the Member for Cairnhill is raring for  blood,

coming  in  for the kill, finishing off  the  P.A.P.

Government. Sir, whether he does or whether he  does

not,  whether we are returned in the next  elections

to be held sometime before the end of the year, even

though  we  have the right to go on till March  next

year,  I  give  an  undertaking that  we  will  have

elections  before that, as I think  the  Member  for

Cairnhill wants it. That was one of the reasons  why

he  postponed the 15 seats in order that there  will

be  accommodation made, so there will  be  a  better

chance for the Alliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I have been accused of arrogance,

ineptitude,  stupidities. Sir, whatever our  faults,

we leave the country at the end of our first term of

office  in  a  healthier state  than  we  came  into

office. The last days of the last Government  was  a

pathetic  sight.  I have read of the  last  days  of

Nanking before the Kuomintang fled - papers strewn on

the  office floor, Ministers packing away gold bars,

secretaries packing away valuable furniture  to  fly

out  to  Canton, then to Taiwan, and  there  was  an

atmosphere  of  decay.  This  was  a  newspaperman's

account  of what took place in Nanking. And  in  the

last  year,  particularly the last few months,  that

was the state of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



country  and the Government and the officers.  Morale

had  collapsed.  It was a Government  that  was  only

interested  in its own survival. When we  took  over,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I had no office; no provision  had

been  made  for  an office. That is a  fact.  It  was

agreed already before the Chief Minister went out  of

office  that he would vacate his office and  give  it

hack  to  the Assembly, and I took office without  an

office  having been prepared. The then Chief Minister

never  expected to be returned; so he did not  bother

about  it.  Why  worry about the stationery  and  the

office?  But I say, Sir, whoever takes over from  us,

we will give a full inventory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we are proud men, because we are proud to do

the  decent thing by the country. We have brought  it

to  security  and  we have brought it  into  harbour.

Whatever happens, the ship is safe and sound, and the

Members  on  the other side, particularly  the  three

Members  in  U.M.N.O.,  know  that.  Whoever  assumes

office after the elections will find $400 million  in

the  kitty which was not there, will find development

plans  which  will carry on: it has a  momentum  that

will  carry on into the first three years of the next

Government.  The  United Nations team  on  urban  re-development  is enthusiastic over our prospects  - the

finances,  the  revenue  and  the  possibilities   of

rebuilding.  Plans  are afoot to  knock  down  Outram

Prison  in spite of the difficulties about the  Pulau

Senang riots; and they will proceed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came in and found things at a standstill. The

former Financial Secretary was an expatriate. He  had

decided that the time had come for him to retire  and

he  left.  There were no plans in hand for  anything:

there was very little money left in the kitty either.

Amongst  other things, if ever, if it is the will  of

the  people, so be it; let some other government take

over  if  it  can do better; but it will  find  every

office  in  every Ministry ticking. In  my  Ministry,

Sir, it will find that there are two typists who know

how  to  do  Japanese  flower  arrangements  - a  very

important  factor.  It  shows  that  somebody  cares.

Flowers are being grown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



in  the Botanic Gardens; a car comes down on its  way

to  pick  me  to  office and picks  up  the  flowers.

Somebody  in the office gets a $10 allowance  to  put

the flowers and arrange them nicely.

of  the best aquariums in this part of the world  and

it, who is a specialist in aquariums.

parabolic curve is so arranged that no fish can  hide

behind  a corner, and yet you do not see the  corner.

You have never had the privilege of having seen them -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose that does relate to

the Malaysia Agreement!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That, Mr Speaker, Sir, is part

and  parcel of whoever runs Singapore under  the  new

Constitution.  He will inherit that  -something  that

ticks. We have been asked, and I, in particular, have

been  asked,  what  is my personal ambition?  I  have

twice  answered this question in the last  few  days,

and  I  was intrigued to see the Member for Choa  Chu

Kang  trying to cause trouble with the Tunku.  He  is

very  good in this, Mr Speaker, Sir,It is  all  set

out: The Three Kingdoms is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



a  very good book to read - over 1,000 tales in which

every human situation imaginable and conceivable  is

recited and recorded. Treachery, cowardice, bravery,

love,  hatred,  trickery,  roguery,  rascality,  are

recounted  in the analects - over 1,000 of  them  - and

this  comes under "How to cause trouble among people

who  are  against  you, cause  them  to  fight  each

other."  Somebody  asked me - I cannot  remember  now

- whether  I would be the Prime Minister of Malaysia,

and  I  said,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we  are  realistic

enough to acknowledge that in the foreseeable future

there  can  be no P.A.P. Prime Minister of Malaysia.

The  Member  for Choa Chu Kang still wants  to  try.

They  say among the P.A.P. members, the cadres, when

they  meet,  "Ah, do not worry; in 10 or  15  years'

time the Tunku will be out. I will take over. I will

be  the  Prime Minister of Malaysia." Sir, I do  not

know about what will happen in 10 or 15 years' time.

I  hope  we  will  be a united people  and  a  still

prosperous  and developing society, and I  would  be

ashamed  of  myself if I did not make a contribution

in  that society. I would say that he is a fool  who

believes  that  he can govern Ma1aysia  without  the

support of the Malays. I can envisage the P.A.P. in

a  Government of Malaysia at some date in the future

working  in  conjunction with Malay leaders,  but  I

cannot imagine a Singapore P.A.P. spreading out only

into  the towns and capturing the majority of  seats

and controlling the destiny of Malaysia. That is not

possible, and I will explain why, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

Whatever   the  Tunku  may  be  to  the   Communists

- although  he is, in many ways, straightforward  and

he  prefers the simple approach - he is a realist and

understands the mechanics of power. That is why when

he  met my two other colleagues and we discussed the

White Paper, he said, "Look, I want the Police, Army

and "Prisons." [Interruption] This is not a laughing

matter.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  He  understands   the

mechanics of power and, brought up in the shadow  of

the  throne of Kedah, he knows how to govern,  which

was  something the Member for Anson never knew.  The

Member  was  chased from pillar to post; he  changed

his mind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



every  five seconds. When the Tunku says,  "No",  it

will  take a long time to get him to say, "Yes",  as

it  took  us. In 1955, we wanted merger;  we  waited

until 1963 before we got merger. He meant "No" for a

very   long  time.  It  was  only  because  of   the

inevitability  of  it, the awful alternative  of  no

merger  leading to what he himself said North versus

South,  that we got merger by consent: otherwise  we

would have merger by force; it must be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have an army and the Police, and what is more

an  Administration.  In  Singapore,  it  will  be  a

completely free for all administration. But we  must

be  realistic  enough  to realise  that  no  Malayan

Government can ever carry its people, if it abandons

anywhere  in  the immediate future  a  four  to  one

policy on the key jobs. In other words, even if by a

fluke,  by  some  chance, a  wrong  distribution  of

seats,  one Party won the majority of seats  in  the

Parliament,  do  they  think they  will  govern  the

country?  The Administration is solid; the  Army  is

solid,  the  Police  is solid. There  is  the  Agong

- symbol  of the monarch. It has happened  the  whole

world  over,  Mr Speaker, Sir. Ayub Khan  moved  in

from  Field Marshal; he was General, then he  became

Field  Marshal, and he is now President. General  Ne

Win,   President.  Nasser,  now  President,  was   a

colonel:  somewhere in some military  college  there

may  be a young Nasser. But I hope that that is  not

the  future  of  Malaysia. I  say  it  will  be  the

stupidity  of the Chinese Communists in  Malaya  who

will make that happen, if ever it happens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have our way, we will bring the people

together  more  by exhortation and example  than  by

force,  because  force  is  not  possible  in   this

situation,  by persuasion, example, exhortation  and

co-operation, and that is what we are out to do.  At

the  same time, we understand our strength. No Party

in  Malaysia  after the first 10 years  when  a  new

generation  grows up and all are Malaysian  citizens

- not  now, now half are immigrants who do  not  have

citizenship in Malaya, and some in Borneo  too  have

not  got  citizenship; but nearly all  in  Singapore

have - in 10 years' time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



the proportion, the distribution is such, the racial

components  are  such that no Party  can  govern  by

relying on only one race. The Chinese cannot  govern

just  by Chinese votes. And I say it is so with  the

Malays and with the Indians. There are about 41  per

cent Chinese, 44 per cent Malays, Dyaks, Dusuns  and

Muruts.  10  per cent Indians and so on.  Therefore,

there  must be a partnership, or we will perish.  We

will  slit each other's throats. This is cold logic.

If  there is to be a partnership, it must be on  the

basis of equality. I cannot just find a Malay stooge

and dub him as a Malay leader and say, Here you are,

I  appoint you Prime Minister." I then shake him  by

the  hand and create him as a Malay leader. This  is

not  possible. And vice versa, Mr Speaker, Sir,In

other words, you cannot have a tame Chinaman and say

he  represents the Chinese and shake him by the hand

and  say, "Here you are, your leader." That  is  not

the  way  the Chinese are - just like the Malays.  By

definition, a leader means he leads; he  fights  for

the nation and for the section of the community that

he represents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my case, it has been my privilege to tight for

the just rights of Singapore in Malaysia. Therefore,

we  have  a  role to play in Malaysia, not  to  take

over, hut to co-operate. We understand the mechanics

of  power  too. We are also sufficiently  acquainted

with the respective power positions and the ploy  of

men in power. As long as the Tunku is there, he will

he  the  leader  of  Malaysia,  and  to  everybody's

advantage, because whatever one can say of  him,  he

is not a communalist, which is a very great thing in

this country. If he were, and he tried to stymie  or

obstruct  the activities of four million Chinese  in

Malaysia out of ten million, then he would  go  down

the  drain,  just  like a few other countries  have.

Riots  took  place recently in some countries.  They

burned  Chinese lorries and shops; now  they  cannot

get the vegetables from the country to the town; the

price of vegetables has gone up in the town, and the

chaps  in  the  country have suffered  because  they

cannot sell the vegetables. There is a great deal to

keep the people together. Whoever follows



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



him must find like-minded persons to work with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, the next generation will be

brought  up in the same schools and under  the  same

conditions.  Then race will cease to  matter  as  we

speak one common language; we begin to feel one.  It

may not be in my lifetime, but I hope it will be  in

the one that follows me. But in my lifetime and that

of  my  colleagues,  whatever happens,  we  are  not

running  away  from  here. We  have  no  gold  mines

stashed  away,  or  bullion stacked  into  suitcases

ready  to  climb into an aeroplane. If  the  country

perishes, so will we. But what we are determined  to

see  is  that  it  does not perish,  either  through

wickedness  by  those  who  manipulate  the  Barisan

Sosialis, or through stupidity and greed, like  some

who  try  to  loot  and no doubt will  try  to  loot

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are lots of pickings in Singapore. I am told

that  an  estimate of three million lottery  tickets

can  be  sold  every month. Just think  of  it,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir!  I  mean  you  and  I  tied  to   our

emoluments  on  the  vote and here  they  can  print

lottery  tickets. Through printing the tickets,  you

make  money.  They  estimate  they  can  sell  three

million  tickets in Singapore alone; they have  been

watching the Turf Club. Through selling tickets, you

make  money. When chaps win prizes, they feel happy;

they give you a percentage; so definitely all round,

you win. There are other things too which they tried

to  convert  and put into the centre: licences  - the

lifeblood of Singapore - free trade, tenders and they

did not get it. They tried to. They sent a document,

Mr  Speaker, Sir. They will not get it. And  I  say

the  people  of  Singapore will have  the  sense  to

reject  them.  If they choose to elect a  Government

that  will do these things, then I say we  have  all

lost  because that is the first step towards  chaos,

anarchy,  a  military dictatorship followed  by  the

Communists when all breaks down. It is our  duty  to

keep  it that way. In other words, what my colleague

said  on  Sunday  when we went to  Siglap  together,

there are two things required of anyone who wants to

inherit the right to spend this $400 million stashed

away  for  the  country to carry  out  the  building

plans,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



the industrial projects in Jurong, nearly completed,

harbour,  rail road, water and power.  Absolute  and

utter  integrity that can stand the closest scrutiny

at  any time., And the other is determination to see

that  right is done. I do not know whether this same

Assembly will meet again. Mr Speaker, Sir,I am not

in a position to tell my opponents these things, but

I   hope  in  the  next  Assembly  we  will  find  a

Government worthy of an industrious and able people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

for  over three hours we have been listening to  the

usual  blustering, humbug and posturing of a man  on

his  way out, [Interruption] of a man going down but

still wanting to put up a bold front, telling of his

brilliance, how he calculates this thing, how clever

he  is and how he anticipates making every move over

the  chess-board. For more than half an hour, he was

praising   and   defending  the   British   colonial

Government,  telling  us how Malaysia  is  not  neo-colonialist.  He knows how to talk. He  talks  about

the  electronic  machine, the  electronic  computer.

Yes, he talks of his own brilliance, forgetting  all

the  time that the British colonial Government  with

hundreds  of  years' experience behind them  is  the

real  electronic computer in the whole  business  of

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister even went so far as to say that he had the British by the throat or by the neck. I remember reading in the newspapers that he said he almost got Mr Sandys down on his bended knees, or something to that effect. Yet what happened? Getting the British to go down on their bended knees, and yet he gives $150 million away! How does he work it

out?  This is a new type of logic, P.A.P. logic,  to

which we are now getting quite used to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks of his calculations, but all the time he

forgets that it is British, the master mind, that is

really  directing operations behind the  scenes.  If

only  he will look at himself in the mirror, he will

realise  that he was merely being pushed  around  by

the British without himself knowing it. No wonder he

pays tribute to the British, because he knows



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



in actual fact that it is the British who are behind

the  whole  scheme. But the British have been  doing

things  so very subtly that the P.A.P. stooges  are,

in  fact,  more  eager promoting Malaysia  than  the

British  themselves. Of course, the P.A.P., thinking

only  of  their  own selfish selves, began  to  link

their  own  personal fortunes with  the  success  or

failure of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Assembly, Sir, the P.A.P. always put up a

bold front when they are only 25 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thirty-eight.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister still talks

as if he is the master of the whole situation. But I

think  he regrets not having been present the  other

night, and I am sure he must have had some hot words

with  his  Deputy who came out boldly  to  say  that

elections would be held before the end of the  year,

because  we  see  in the newspapers that  the  Prime

Minister,  during his constituency tours,  has  been

trying  to condition the minds of the people to  the

fact that after all elections might be in March. Why

can  they  not say categorically, since  the  Deputy

Prime Minister, as Leader of the House, has said  in

this very House, that general elections will be held

before the end of the year?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, if you

will  remember, I said that general elections  would

be held after Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir, after Malaysia, but

also before the end of the year. Of course, that  is

the whole idea. They want to put up a bold front but

they  also want to cling to power. They are  afraid.

Their power is like ivy now; they cannot cling to it

any  more;  it is slippery. Their days are numbered.

You can see their faces, all longish. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is very difficult for me to

ask  the  Government Benches to keep  quiet  if  the

Member  for  Queenstown  excites  their  revelry  or

laughter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Well, we in the Barisan

Sosialis have been exciting them all the time.  They

cannot  see  us  having the mass support.  When  the

Prime Minister goes round and shouts merdeka, two or

three  hands  go  up. Even nowadays  on  television,

whenever  the  Prime Minister shouts  merdeka,  they

make  sure that the public will not see the  two  or

three  hands  going up. They are afraid.  The  Prime

Minister  was  telling  us  about  "Viva  il  Papa".



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What? I do not know what he is

saying. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not know what that is.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Member for

Queenstown could now address all his remarks to  the

Speaker and the Speaker promises not to laugh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And today the Prime Minister

has admitted that in spite of the rigorous schooling

and rigorous tutoring, somehow or other all the Work

Brigade boys and some from the community centres  do

not  as  promptly put up their hands when the  Prime

Minister shouts Merdeka. Of course, everybody  knows

that  the Prime Minister, when he speaks in  any  of

these  rallies, makes sure that there is  already  a

crowd,  though that crowd is there not to listen  to

him  but  to see a show. Either there is  a  variety

show or a wayang, and in between scenes Lee Kuan Yew

comes out to perform. That is what actually happens.

The  people just cannot help but listen to him under

those  circumstances, not that they really  want  to

listen to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Prime Minister's posturing - he said he did

not  know  how to bluff and even said  that  he  was

astounded when the proposal came from whoever it was

that  they  should cough out $150 million,  he  even

said he bit his lip. Well, I do not know. If he  had

really  bitten his lip, I am a doctor. But what  did

he  do? Just biting his lips. Did he fight back? Did

he roll up his sleeves and say, "Come on."? No, Sir,

he sat in his room eating sandwiches.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Earlier on the Member for

Queenstown started off by saying the Prime  Minister

was   posturing.  May  I  suggest  that  he  is  now

posturing before this Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, while he talks of

biting his lips, being astounded, he was also merely

taking  sandwiches, taking whisky. He tells  us  all

this  and  then he ultimately surrendered.  Why?  He

quotes Dr Faust, but I think he quoted wrongly.  He

should  have  quoted Machiavelli,  the  Prince.  The

Minister  for  Finance is very good at  quoting  the

Prince.  He recommended that book to quite a  number

of  people,  and  I also have read it.  I  am  daily

learning  of how the P.A.P. always puts  on  a  bold

front, stuff themselves with cotton wool -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Where?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - wherever it may be. You see,

Sir,  the  P.A.P. today  is  in  a  very  difficult

position.  In 1959 because of their good  posturing,

because they managed to shout anti-colonial slogans,

they  had the support of the masses. After they  had

climbed into power they started to play the game  of

tight-rope walking by playing on their line  of  so-called  indispensability. They  know  they  had  the

support  of the masses and they wanted to  tell  the

Left, "Look boys, I am the only chap who can prevent

you  from being napped and therefore you jolly  well

help  me."  But  that type of bluff  did  not  carry

weight.  The P.A.P. was exposed and the support  has

been  taken away from them. They are every day being

exposed  and now they are completely naked in  every

way.  Today  knowing  that they  do  not  have'  the

support of the Left, they still want to walk along a

tight  rope. How? This time, instead of  playing  on

the  Left, they play on the British. They  tell  the

British  "Look, the P.A.P. Ministers  are  the  only

people who can look after the Communists." They tell

the whole world they are better fighters against the

Communists then the ex-S.P.A. Government.  They  say

that  if the British want to contain the Communists,

they must keep the P.A.P. in power. And knowing that

the Federation Government and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



British  have  this phobia, they keep  playing  this

phobia  on  their minds. Every time they  bring  out

this  bogey. Anything that they have done  badly  or

wrongly,  they  put the blame on the Communists.  If

they  want to take some drastic action against their

political  opponents,  again  they  label  them   as

Communists.  Under  those  circumstances,  Sir,  the

British  will not be able not to support them.  They

say,   "Well,  since  you  are  going  against   the

Communists, we will therefore give you a  chance  to

carry  on."  The  P.A.P., realising  all  this,  can

therefore afford to act tough. Because they have the

British  behind them, they therefore  dare  to  take

tough  action.  If  they did not  have  the  British

behind them, they would have crumpled up. They would

not  dare do a thing. See what is happening to  this

lands  affair.  The  Prime Minister  says  it  is  a

wonderful  gain  and  a  prize  for  the  people  of

Singapore.  Is  that true? The letters  reveal  that

that  is not the case. I will come to that later  on

in my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole policy of the P.A.P. has been based on

the calculation - no - miscalculation of the fact that

they  are indispensable. They always play one  force

against  another and thereby hope to keep themselves

in  office and enjoy all the facilities that go with

that office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is this bit about Malaysia not being neo-colonialism. I will touch more on that a little

later,  but  all of us know that Article  6  in  the

Malaysia  Agreement is the essence of  Malaysia.  If

there  was no Article 6, there would be no Malaysia.

Malaysia  after all is only the political aspect  of

the  British  Far East Unified Command which  covers

exactly the same five areas in Malaysia. If they say

that it is not neo-colonialism, all they have to  do

is  to  ask the British to walk out. They will  then

see  whether  or not there is Malaysia. The  British

will  not  only fight back but will also help  crush

and knock the P.A.P. out. Realising this, of course,

the  P.A.P. wants to play the game for the  British.

Incidentally, even the United States is  now  coming

out  openly  in  support of Malaysia  and  has  even

threatened,  as  I  see in the papers,  to  withdraw

financial aid to Indonesia if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



Indonesia  does  not stop the confrontation  against

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. always likes to use the Communist

bogey  to frighten the people. They know that we  in

the  Barisan Sosialis are their main opponents. They

hope by linking and identifying the Barisan Sosialis

with  the Communists, they can use that as an excuse

to  knock out the Barisan Sosialis. But as the Prime

Minister himself too realises, they cannot knock out

the  Barisan  Sosialis. They may gaol  some  of  us,

because today they have State power in their  hands,

but  they  will  not be able to take away  the  real

strength of the Barisan Sosialis, because we  are  a

Party,  unlike the P.A.P., that is really rooted  in

the  masses. Ask the P.A.P. to hold a rally anywhere

and we hold a rally anywhere. We do not have to hire

buses to cart people there. The people will come and

listen  to us. If the P.A.P. were to hold a  similar

rally,  they would not be able to have a  couple  of

hundred  people  unless they gave  instructions  and

specific directions to the Work Brigade boys  to  be

there  waiting  to  give a clap whenever  the  Prime

Minister appeared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister keeps on talking about open confrontation. I do not know what he means by open confrontation. Today Indonesia is also having open confrontation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You support it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> While, on the one hand, they

talk  of open confrontation, on the other hand, they

deny us a chance to confront them. Now, as you know,

we  have asked for permits to hold rallies on  three

Sundays and each time the permits have been refused.

Why   are   they   afraid?   If   they   want   open

confrontation,  why  do  they  have  to   guillotine

debates   for  example?  Why  do  they  not   really

confront?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of the referendum, it is clear proof that

they  dare not have open confrontation with  us.  If

they  really want to depend on the open argument  to

convince  people, they do not have to  arrest  their

political  opponents. All this clearly  proves  that

although the P.A.P. talk of open confrontation, they

themselves are very much afraid of it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talk of being buried by history. Yes, it will

not  be very long before they will be buried.  Their

days are numbered. The writing is on the wall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Then start counting!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The whole strategy of the

P.A.P. in all that they have been doing for the last

couple  of  years  consists  in  just  fighting  for

survival.  Whenever  any straw  appears, they  just

grasp  at  the straw and hope that this  straw  will

keep  them afloat. And therefore they use all  their

ingenuity  and devote all their energy  towards  the

grasping  at straws. The Prime Minister has admitted

that the referendum counting was done in such a  way

as  to  allow  the P.A.P. to know their strength  in

particular  division. We mentioned this  many,  many

times  before.  Now, we hear them  openly  admitting

that what we said is true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly on the Federal elections. We also pointed

out that the whole idea behind the Federal elections

was  to allow the P.A.P. to find safe seats. We have

an  open admission now from the Prime Minister about

this  fact.  They call it the controlled experiment.

Of  course, it would be very well controlled by  the

P.A.P. and  I think that is why perhaps  the  other

Members  of the Opposition are also opposed to  this

type of legal rigging of elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I am very glad that the Prime Minister has

admitted very, very many things that we had said  in

1961. We had said, for example, that he had to go up

and  persuade the Tunku, and he went up to tell  the

Tunku stories. He has also confirmed that it is  the

P.A.P. that offered civil aviation, telecoms and all

things,  confirming in every detail of what we  said

about the sell-out of the P.A.P. - a sell-out of  the

interests  of the people of Singapore by the  P.A.P.

At  that time we pointed out that the P.A.P. wanted

this  merger as a diversion, in order to divert  the

attention   of   the   people  from   the   P.A.P.'s

incompetence  and  moral bankruptcy.  Now  realising

that the British electronic computer is at work, the

P.A.P. should forget all talk



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



of  their  own brilliance, of their own  cleverness,

and consult the people of Singapore in whatever they

do.  Sir,  the  present Malaysia  Agreement  is  the

direct result of P.A.P. haughtiness and arrogance in

the  way  they go about things. They fail to realise

that although the British did not openly suggest the

Malaysia  Plan,  the British had  in  fact  arranged

things in such a way that it is the P.A.P. that  had

to  go along peddling selling the plan all over  the

world, helping to promote British interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned a little while back that Article V1 is

the  essence  of the whole Malaysia Agreement.  This

Article VI also explains how the people of Singapore

will  be  asked to pay a lot of money towards  armed

expansion and towards defence, not of the people  of

the five regions but of British vested interests  in

the  region. They do not shout anti-colonial slogans

nowadays.  In fact, the Prime Minister  equates  the

importance  of  Singapore, so far as the  people  of

Singapore  are concerned, to the importance  of  the

base. The base is important only to the British. But

to  the  Prime Minister, that is the most  important

aspect of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the other day the Deputy Prime Minister said

that  the main function of the Singapore Airport  is

to  serve the British as a jumping-board to suppress

the national liberation movement in Brunei.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the few hours of talking by the Prime Minister

he,  in  fact said very little. All his talking  was

directed  at  propaganda to  help  defend  his  weak

position.  In  fact,  I  remember  when  the   Prime

Minister  came  back  from London  he  sounded  very

apologetic  in  his T.V. speech. He just  could  not

stand up to the occasion which was prepared for  him

by  the  P.A.P. propaganda machinery in  Singapore.

They  wanted to bill him as a hero, but he knew that

he  was not a hero, and therefore in everything that

he  said on that day he sounded very poor. He  could

not put his points across.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the few preliminary remarks which I want

to  make before I go into my main speech. But before

I really go on, Sir, I wish to protest at the way in

which the P.A.P. Government has treated this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



whole   debate.  The  Prime  Minister  offered   his

apologies to the House yesterday, but I do not think

that  was any consolation for us who have to  debate

this  very  important motion. As the Prime  Minister

himself has admitted, the motion before the House is

a  very important one. It refers to documents  which

run  into  hundreds of pages. If we  are  to  debate

these  documents fully, it is only right and  proper

that we in the Opposition be given adequate time  to

study  them.  Then we would be the  better  able  to

contribute our hit towards the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject material for debate today conies from

three official papers issued by the Government.  Two

of these documents were made available to us only on

the  late  evening  of Friday, 26th  July,  1963.  I

received  Misc. Papers 4 and 5 of 1963 at home  well

past 9.30 p.m. that night. Since then I have managed

to  run through these two papers. But the third one,

the  Malaysia Agreement, which runs into 232  pages,

was  only  sent  to  Opposition  Members  on  Sunday

afternoon,  27th July, 1963. I received my  copy  at

home   at   12.35  p.m. on  Sunday.   Under   those

circumstances, Sir, there is not enough time for  us

to run through these bulky documents. In fact, there

is  no time to do anything else other than to merely

read  through  them.  This  late  delivery  of   the

important  documents to us is, of course,  meant  to

delay us or deny us the time and the opportunity  to

study them carefully and minutely. I wish to protest

and  say that this is a highly irresponsible way  of

doing things. The adjournment of the debate to today

does  allow us in the Opposition more time to  study

these  important  documents, but this  is  done  not

because the P.A.P. has any consideration for  us  in

the Opposition. It is my guess, Sir, that because of

the  late  hours the Prime Minister  keeps  and  the

frantic   electioneering   campaign   he   is    now

conducting, in his tours, he himself has  not  found

time to prepare his own speech in this House. So the

postponement yesterday was not to allow us  time  to

read  the  documents but to allow  himself  time  to

prepare what he wanted to say. He could very  easily

have got the documents ready for us many days before

Sunday. The London Agreement was signed on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



9th of July. It is how the 30th. The documents could

have  been made available to us long, long ago. But,

of  course, that did not suit the Government. So the

documents were handed to us late and it was in  fact

meant  to deny us, the Opposition, a chance to study

them carefully. Our position is very clear. Whatever

it  is  we  fight back. We shall always do our  best

under all circumstances - whether it be one day, two

days  or three days in which to debate. And we shall

do everything possible to expose the P.A.P. and show

the  dangers  to  the  people of  Singapore  in  the

present sell-out Malaysia Agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I say anything further. I might also

say  a  few words about the Press in. Singapore.  We

know  the  local Press is under heavy pressure  from

the  P.A.P. Government. But the Press has  also  its

responsibility  to the general public.  This  is  an

important debate before the House. We understand the

papers  have  to give a lot of space to  the  P.A.P.

documents and to what the Ministers have to say, but

the  views  of the Opposition are just as  important

and  should therefore be given adequate coverage  in

the  newspapers.  This does not  mean  that  we  are

asking  publicity for ourselves, but in view of  the

importance of this debate, the newspapers,  if  they

still  want  to  claim  that  they  are  independent

newspapers,  must shoulder their responsibility  and

place all the facts and all aspects of the issue  at

stake  before  the people. It is only when  all  the

facts  and  aspects of the issue  have  been  placed

before  the people that they will be able to  decide

for  themselves  on the matter. The  people  have  a

right  to have all the facts placed before  them.  I

ask  the  newspapers not to forget  their  duty  and

responsibility  to  the  general  public.  This   is

especially  so today when the P.A.P. is  doing  its

best to shut out Opposition news and to deny to  the

Opposition  the  basic rights of assembly  and  free

speech as well as the right and opportunity to  have

direct contact with the masses in mass rallies.  The

P.A.P. fears   exposure.   It   talks   of    open

confrontation  but  is  scared  stiff  to  have  it.

Anyway, the time is not too distant when the  P.A.P.

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



be  no more. Sir, in these four years of P.A.P. rule -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was saying. Sir, in the four

years  of  P.A.P. rule you, as well as the staff  of

this  Assembly, have seen the abuse of parliamentary -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown must

not  by any means whatsoever involve the Speaker  or

the staff in this debate or any other debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have no intention of doing

so, Sir. This is only in passing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I cannot accept the statement just

made.  That is why I say, leave out the staff, leave

out the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Outside this Assembly, Sir, the

people have seen the direct effects of the death  of

parliamentary democracy in Singapore. There is  fear

of  P.A.P. repression and ruthlessness all over  the

island.  There  is  fear of the  secret  police  and

P.A.P. informers. Singapore, in fact, is  a  police

State.  But very soon all of us will be relieved  of

this  P.A.P. arrogance, haughtiness and over-hearing

attitude. The P.A.P. recently mobilised the whole of

the  Government machinery and the State of Singapore

into giving the Prime Minister a hero's reception on

his return from London. P.A.P. branches were ordered

to scrap all available men for an airport reception.

But  as usual the hulk of the reception and audience

for the Prime Minister came



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



not  from the masses but from the Work Brigade  boys

and from the community centres. School children were

ordered to line the route as in all the constituency

tours of the Prime Minister. And because there was a

delay in the plane's arrival on that day, the school

children  had  to stand waiting by the roadside  for

three hours. All in order to give the Prime Minister

the  opportunity to deceive the outside  world  with

his so-called popularity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received a letter the other day, Sir, from a

school child in a school in Siglap and he complained

that  he was asked, in fact directed, to stand at  a

certain  place and to wave his flag when  the  Prime

Minister come along on Sunday and he asked that such

fact  be made known to the public in Singapore. This

is  only one example. Sir,I do not intend to  waste

the time of the House quoting letters and complaints

from  people  all the time, all over the  place.  Of

course,  Sir, this billing of the Prime Minister  as

the  star of this P.A.P. Gilbert and Sullivan  opera

was  meant to cover up the public resentment against

the P.A.P. sell-out in London, and as part of a huge

P.A.P. conspiracy to turn things  upside  down  and

black into white, a traitor of Singapore was crowned

the  champion  of  the interest  of  the  people  of

Singapore.  Indeed, Sir, it would  be  difficult  to

find  a  more  ridiculous and  absurd  situation  in

P.A.P. topsy-turvy land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has talked a lot about

citizenship.  He  has  said  that  he  is  proud  of

Singapore  citizenship. I agree with that statement.

But very unfortunately he has turned the good first-class Singapore citizenship into an inferior second-class  citizenship. Since 1961, Sir, we have pointed

out, both inside and outside this Assembly, the sell-out arrangements in the White Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961.

The  White Paper does not give us genuine Federation

citizenship.  Neither does it  give  the  people  of

Malaya,  that  is, Singapore and the  Federation,  a

common  political  life.  Singapore  citizens   will

become second-class citizen. In an effort to deceive

the  people,  the  name  "Federation  national"  was

changed into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



"Malaysia citizenship (Singapore)". But as  we  have

pointed  out, this is only a change in nomenclature.

There is no change in content. The Singapore citizen

is  politically confined to Singapore. The Malaysian

citizenship (Singapore) is good only for the  island

of   Singapore.  Whereas  Malaysian  citizens   from

Sarawak  and  Sabah  will  be  able  to  go  to  the

Federation  to  vote  and stand  for  election,  the

Malaysian citizen (Singapore) will still not be able

to  go  to  the  Federation to  vote  or  stand  for

election.  This  at once, Sir, shows the  difference

between   the  citizenship  of  Singapore  and   the

citizenship  of  the Borneo territories.  The  Prime

Minister  says  that  the only  value  of  Singapore

citizenship  lies in its right to have  housing  and

educational  facilities  which  are  not  given   to

citizens in other parts of Malaysia. This is a  very

irresponsible  way of talking about citizenship.  It

only   shows   how  far  the  Prime   Minister   has

degenerated  in  his  political  bankruptcy.   There

again,   Singapore  does  not  have  anything   like

proportional  representation. With a  population  of

1.7  million,  Singapore will  get  only  15  seats,

whereas  Sarawak with a population one-half that  of

Singapore  will  get  24 seats,  and  Sabah  with  a

population  only one-quarter that of Singapore  will

get  16  seats.  We have pointed out that  with  the

inadequate    representations   in    the    Central

Parliament, Singapore will not be able to  safeguard

its  vital interests, especially when the Federation

will  have overall financial control over Singapore,

and  there  was no talk at that time  in  1961,  and

subsequently too, even of a common market. The whole

of  the White Paper, therefore, is completely to the

disadvantage of Singapore. All one sided as admitted

by the Prime Minister himself only three months ago.

All  this  talk of autonomy in labour and  education

becomes  nonsense when control of internal  security

will  allow  the  Federation  to  interfere  in  the

running of these two departments in Singapore as and

when  the  Federation politicians feel so  inclined.

The  White Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 was passed  in  the

Legislative Assembly after a walk-out of the Barisan

Sosialis,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



the  United  People's Party and the  Workers'  Party

Assemblymen.  This White Paper was subsequently  put

to  the  people  in  a  undemocratic  and  dishonest

referendum.   Through  the  use   of   threats   and

intimidation  the  P.A.P. coerced  the  people  into

voting  for this White Paper. The P.A.P. has  always

claimed  that since the White Paper had been  passed

in  the Legislative Assembly and later voted for  in

the  sham referendum, so it represents the  will  of

the   people.  We,  on  the  contrary,  have  always

maintained that the P.A.P. referendum never did  and

never  could  reflect the will  and  desire  of  the

people freely expressed. But since the P.A.P. always

prefer  to stick to the so-called legality  of  that

matter  and say that the White Paper has the support

of  the  people  because it has been passed  in  the

Legislative Assembly and has been "approved" by  the

people  in  the sham referendum, let us now  examine

the  London Agreement on this basis and see how  far

the  Malaysian terms, or P.A.P. merger terms, signed

in  London are at variance with the White Paper that

has  been  passed  in the Legislative  Assembly  and

"approved" by the people in the sham referendum. The

P.A.P. has repeatedly emphasised in its bold,  tough

posturing that, in the financial talks at one stage,

everything has already been agreed to in  the  White

Paper and in the exchange of letters between him and

the  Prime Minister of the Federation. "If there was

anything  to be altered in the terms of  merger,  it

would   have  to  be  renegotiated,  redebated   and

reendorsed."  That  was  what  the  Prime   Minister

himself said not so very long ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first see what the Malaysian citizenship

(Singapore) means in this Malaysia Agreement  signed

in  London  on 9th July, 1963. May I refer  to  Cmd.

Paper 22 of 1963, clause 23, sub-clause (3), at page

20, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Citizenship of Singapore shall not be severable

from  citizenship of the Federation, but a Singapore

citizen  by the loss of either shall lose the  other

also (subject to the provision made by this Part for

the  enrolment of a Singapore citizen as  a  citizen

who is not a Singapore citizen).'



<br><br>What does this mean, Sir? This means.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



in  fact,  that deprivation of Malaysia  citizenship

(Singapore),   that   is,   Singapore   citizenship,

automatically   means   deprivation   of   Singapore

citizenship.    Clause   64   of    the    Singapore

Constitution,  on  page 153, the clause  talking  of

"Termination of citizenship of Malaysia" reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where a person who is a citizen of Singapore has

renounced  his  citizenship  of  Malaysia  or   been

deprived  of  his  citizenship of  Malaysia  by  the

Government  of the Federation such person  shall  be

deemed  to  have renounced or been deprived  of  his

citizenship of Singapore under this Constitution and

such   person  shall  cease  to  be  a  citizen   of

Singapore.'



<br><br>Sir,  the  citizen of Singapore, with such  valuable

rights  according  to the Prime. Minister  a  little

while   back,  after  becoming  a  Malaysia  citizen

(Singapore)   now  automatically   loses   his   own

Singapore citizenship once he loses his second-class

Malaysia citizenship (Singapore). It is a ridiculous

situation. In other words, our citizenship that  has

been  won as a result of many years of anti-colonial

struggle  and  sacrifice can now be lost  through  a

stroke  of  the pen of some politicians  miles  away

from Singapore. Our citizenship now becomes entirely

dependent on the whims and fancies of politicians in

the Federation. The Singapore citizen is controlled,

kicked  about  like  a football  by  people  outside

Singapore. The Malaysia citizen (Singapore)  is,  in

fact,  the  Federal national on which we debated  at

length in the merger debate in 1961. We have pointed

out  that  the  Federal national has duties  but  no

rights.  For example, he has duties to be taxed  and

to  be called up as a soldier. His only right  as  a

Federal national or Malaysia citizenship (Singapore)

is the right to hold a Federal passport, and nothing

else.  This second-class citizenship is not a  gain.

On  the  contrary, it brings with it  the  extremely

grave   danger   of  loss  of  our   own   Singapore

citizenship.    Without    the    present     merger

arrangements,  the Singapore citizen needs  fear  no

one  outside  Singapore. Now if he should  displease

the  Federation  politicians who are  in  power,  he

might  well lose his own citizenship. Is it  not  an

ironical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



and  absurd situation - to become a Malaysian citizen

(Singapore),  a pore citizen gains nothing?  On  the

contrary,  he  stands to lose. This is  now  clearly

stated in the proposed Federal Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you, Sir, to clause 27 (7) on page 23.

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A certificate of naturalisation as a Singapore

citizen  shall not be granted without the occurrence

of the government of Singapore.'



<br><br>This  sounds  as  if  the Singapore  Government  has

certain  powers.  But it, in fact,  means  that  the

Singapore Government has already lost its  power  to

grant   naturalisation  certificates  to  its   twin

citizens.  The  power  now has  been  given  to  the

Federation  and  the Singapore Government  can  only

concur   with   the  decision  of   the   Federation

Government  Even the registration of  citizens  must

have  the  concurrence of the Federation Government.

This  can  be  seen  in clause57  of  the  Singapore

Constitution  at  page 150. At the  bottom  of  that

page,  it reads that such registration can  only  be

registered with the concurrence of the Government of

the Federation as a citizen of Singapore. This is  a

loss  of power of the Singapore Government. In fact,

it  means  a  loss o, the basic rights of  Singapore

citizens  to pressure their own Government for  more

democracy  and  freedom. The citizens  of  Singapore

until  today  are still ruled by the United  Kingdom

Government, thousands of miles away, a Government in

which  the  people of Singapore are not represented.

Now  Singapore  citizens are similarly  ruled  by  a

Government far away in Kuala Lumpur, a Government in

which  the people of Singapore do not have  adequate

representation and influence. And the people who try

to  increase  this representation and influence  run

the  grave  risk  of  losing  their  citizenship  in

Singapore. Therefore, the Government in Kuala Lumpur

is  no  different  from the imperial  Government  in

London,  so  far  as  the people  of  Singapore  are

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have repeatedly pointed out. Sir, that the

P.A.P. merger proposals will only make Singapore  a

colony  of  the Federation. This is clear  proof  of

what we have said.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you, Sir, to page 23, clause 28 (1) and

(2) ?  Here  it  lays down that in  the  granting  of

Federation citizenship to Singapore citizens and non-Singapore  citizens, the Federation Government  does

not confer any advantage on the Singapore citizen as

against the foreigner. In other words, the status of

a  Singapore  citizen is no better than  that  of  a

foreigner.  For  example, Sir, if you,  a  Singapore

citizen,  and  another non-citizen  both  apply  for

Federation  citizenship and  both  applications  are

treated in the same way, then it in fact means  that

being   a   citizen  has  given  you  no   advantage

whatsoever,   both   are  treated   exactly   alike.

Singapore  citizens,  therefore,  are  treated  like

foreigners and are no better than foreigners in  the

present merger arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I again refer you, Sir, to clause 56 in page

150?   There  it  lays  down  a  large   number   of

conditions, (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), which a  person

has  to  fulfil before he can become  a  citizen  of

Singapore.  We want to point out that this  is  mere

eyewash   and  nothing  else.  It  gives   a   false

impression  to  the  people  that  with  all   these

conditions  it  is  just as difficult  to  become  a

Singapore  citizen  as it is  to  become  a  Federal

citizen. But, and the rub is here, who would  bother

to  change a citizenship that is of h4gher value for

a  citizenship that is of lower value? Nobody  would

care to change his own first-class citizenship for a

second-class citizenship. Therefore, although  these

conditions  are  written down in  the  Constitution,

they are there merely to give a false impression  to

the people concerning the value of this second-class

citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go back again to page 22, clause 26,

paragraph (d).  Here  it  lays  down  the   language

qualification  in  citizenship by  registration, it

says  Malay,  English, "or any  native  language  in

current  use in Sarawak". For example. Iban  can  be

used  as one o, the languages if they want to accept

it  as  a  language to test a person  who  wants  to

qualify for citizenship. Sir, my complaint is  this:

there  are many languages in common use in Singapore

and in the Federation itself, e.g. Tamil, Chinese,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



and other languages. But they are not recognised  as

suitable for use in such language tests. This  shows

most  clearly  the unfair and unjust  discrimination

against  Chinese and Tamil. Moreover,  there  is  no

such  thing  as the waiving of the language  barrier

for  the first year as in the original Constitution.

This   shows  the  discrimination  that   has   been

practised against the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4 of the Singapore Citizenship Ordinance

admits  the principle of jus Soli, i.e. every person

born in Singapore becomes a citizen of Singapore  by

birth.  Sir,  this is our basic inherent  right  and

this principle is recognised in almost all civilised

countries  of the world. Yet clause 54 (2)   (c), at

page 150, says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A person shall not be a citizen of Singapore by

virtue of clause (1)  of this Article if at the  time

of his birth -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) neither of his parents was a citizen of

Singapore  and neither of them was a permanent

resident in the Federation:'.



<br><br>In  other  words, Sir, a person born of parents  who

are  not permanent residents in Singapore will  lose

his  right of citizenship by birth. Am I reading  it

correctly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Do you not know?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If we have not got it correctly,

surely  they can explain to us. If that  reading  is

correct, then it means that in future babies born of

non-citizens  in  Singapore will  no  longer  become

citizens of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

<br><br>That  is  no consolation to anybody. Sir.  The  fact

remains  that  this right of jus soli is  now  being

taken  away  from  the  people  of  Singapore.   The

Federation  Government  put  in  this  amendment  in

January  or  February last year  and  it  caused  an

uproar.

person  horn  in  the State after  the  coming  into

operation of this Constitution shall be a citizen of

Singapore by birth.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the principle of jus soli be taken away

when every person born in Singapore after the coming

into  operation  of  this  Constitution  will  be  a

Singapore citizen by operation of law?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this taking away the right of jus so1i is a

real  step backwards. I hope the P.A.P. will rectify

this before they get out from government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer you. Sir, to section 8 (3) of the

Singapore Citizenship Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



It  lays  down that a woman may be registered  as  a

citizen  of  Singapore if she is  properly  married,

according  to  law, to a Singapore citizen.  But  in

Cmd. Paper 22 of 1963, page 151, clause 57 (2), lays

down   two   further  conditions   for   citizenship

registration in Singapore:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) that she has resided continuously in the State

for  a period of not less than two years immediately

preceding the date of the application: and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that she is of good character.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are most unreasonable conditions,

especially  the condition of this "good  character".

What  is  a  good  character  and  what  is  a   bad

character?  Front the way the Federation politicians

look  at  things, any person who opposes the  ruling

Party in the Federation can be deemed to be a person

of  bad  character.  Well, the Prime  Minister,  who

sells  Singapore  down the river to the  Federation,

might  consider himself a person of good  character.

But  with  the increasing acrimony in the open  feud

between the P.A.P. and the M.C.A., it might well  be

that,  if  Khaw Kai Boh, for example, should  become

the Internal Security Minister -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> God help you!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the Prime Minister himself will

not  be  considered a person of good character.  And

then  what happens? The Prime Minister himself  will

lose  his citizenship because he is no more a person

of  good  character. [Laughter] It may well be.  Why

should  this  kind of conditions  be  put  down?  We

consider all this very unreasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then. Sir, in page 153, clause 65, which deals with

deprivation  of citizenship and the cancellation  of

the enrolment of any child of that person. This,  to

our  thinking,  is  another unjust and  unreasonable

provision.   It  has  been  a  universal  principle,

accepted  in all civilized countries, that the  sins

of  the  father should not be visited on his  child.

But  this  provision  wants us to  uphold  something

diametrically opposed to this universal principle. I

remember,  Sir,  this  provision  was  added  as  an

amendment to the Federal Constitution early in 1962.

Now  we are asked to have the same amendment in  our

Singapore constitution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



This  is  a shame and it is  a  most  unfair,

unreasonable, unjust, illogical provision  that  has

been  accepted by the P.A.P. Government. We say  all

these  provisions are unjust. The PAP, now talks  of

logic  and  cold  reason. Fair and just?  Are  these

provisions fair and just to the people of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me summarise all these new blessings of

Malaysia for the Singapore citizen:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Singapore citizen can now lose his

citizenship  if  he is deprived of his  new  second-class Malaysian Citizenship (Singapore).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Singapore loses its power to grant

naturalisation certificates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Singapore loses its power to grant registration

certificates.



<br><br>7.43 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. A person born in Singapore loses his basic right

of citizenship by birth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The child of a Singapore citizen can lose his or

her  citizenship  if  the  parent's  citizenship  is

cancelled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Definition of "good character" of a person in

Singapore  now depends on the whims and  fancies  of

politicians  in  the Federation,  that  is,  outside

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The wife of a Singapore citizen needs further

residential  qualification to become  a  citizen  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we see from all these amendments? We see

in  them proof of what we have repeatedly said  time

and  time  again. We have seen in them  clear  proof

that the Singapore citizen has been converted from a

first-class citizen into a second-class citizen with

the   P.A.P. merger.  Singapore  citizens   become

Malaysian Citizens (Singapore). Sarawak citizens and

Sabah citizens also become Malaysian citizens,  just

like  all  the  Federation of Malaya  citizens.  But

Sabah  and Sarawak citizens have no chop on them  as

Singapore  citizens have. Whereas Sarawak and  Sabah

citizens  have  the  same rights and  privileges  as

Federation  Malaysian citizens,  Singapore  citizens

will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



isolated and not given these equal rights. Sabah and

Sarawak  citizens can go to the Federation  to  vote

and  to  stand for election. The Singapore  citizens

are  denied  these rights. Why should  this  be  so?

Where  is  equality? Where is the Malaysian  citizen

being  saved for Singapore? it is clear  proof  that

the  Singapore citizens, are second-class  citizens.

The  law  makes  it difficult still  for  people  to

obtain  Singapore citizenship. But the P.A.P. merger

has  now  made  it very easy to lose  it.  You  gain

nothing,  but you lose a lot. I must point out  that

these   new  citizenship  laws  for  the  State   of

Singapore were not debated on in the merger  debate.

They  are  all new additions and the Prime  Minister

has  no right, no mandate, from this House to change

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper and the later exchange of letters

state  that Singapore citizens will become Malaysian

Citizens  (Singapore). But the  White  Paper  states

- may  I  refer  you, Sir, to the White  Paper'?  The

White Paper states on page 4, section 14:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All Singapore citizens will keep their

citizenship...'.



<br><br>And  in  the  last line of the first  paragraph,  it

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore citizens will continue to enjoy their

State rights and privileges within Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in the White Paper debated and "endorsed"

by the people in the sham P.A.P. referendum. Now, we

see  that the Singapore citizen will not be able  to

keep  his  citizenship. Neither will be continue  to

enjoy   his  State  rights  and  privileges   within

Singapore,  if at any time he displeases the  bosses

in the Federation. The Singapore citizen, therefore,

is  now  sold hook, line and sinker. What right  has

the  P.A.P. to  change  all these  provisions?  The

people of Singapore have thought all along that they

would continue to enjoy their citizenship rights and

privileges.  The P.A.P. repeatedly said this  during

the  1961 merger debate, during the Chinese  Chamber

of  Commerce forum, and later during the  referendum

campaign. Why has the P.A.P. not told the people  of

Singapore  all  this  before?  Why  did  the   Prime

Minister say one thing and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



now  agree to another? Is it not a sell-out  through

and  through'! Has he not become the traitor? Is  he

not  the traitor? Of course, he is. Selling out  all

our  rights.  Let the P.A.P. inform  the  people  of

Singapore  why  the Prime Minister signed  away  all

those rights of Singapore in this manner. Now it  is

truly  a  sell-out, signed in London. All  Singapore

citizens  are  in  great  danger  of  losing   their

citizenship   rights  if  at  any  time   Federation

politicians  feel like exercising their rights.  For

this,  we  must  thank  the  P.A.P. and  the  Prime

Minister, the traitor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, Sir, to refer to another subject. I wish to

refer  to  the question of the powers of the  State.

May  I  refer you to page 29, clause 39, sub-clause

(1), which deals with emergency Jaws? It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In Article 150 of the Constitution (which makes

special  provision for legislation in the  event  of

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Agong being satisfied  of  the

existence of a grave emergency whereby the  security

or  economic life of the Federation or of  any  part

thereof is threatened, whether ...'



<br><br>And now these are the important words, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... by war or external aggression or internal

disturbance)  there shall be omitted in  clause  (1)

the words "whether by war or external aggression  or

by internal disturbance"'.



<br><br>What does this clause mean? It means that when there

is   no  war  or  external  aggression  or  internal

disturbance,  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong  or   the

Federation Government or the U.M.N.O. Alliance  can,

at  any time, according to the whims and fancies  of

the  Federation politicians, proclaim  an  emergency

and impose a dictatorship over the whole Federation.

It  means that at any time the politicians  who  are

now  in  power, when they feel so inclined, can  use

the   State   powers  to  suppress   all   political

opponents. It means that even in time of peace  when

there is no external aggression and when there is no

internal disturbance, the Federation Government  can

subject the lives of the people to wartime emergency

restrictions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are very important powers. They should

not be lightly given, because these powers mean,  in

fact,  that, the very limited freedoms that  we  haw

won    through   such   hardships,   sacrifice   and

unremitting struggles all through the years -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What sacrifice have you made?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - can, with one stroke of the

pen,  he  taken away and military and  Fascist  rule

imposed  on  the people. Do we want to have  such  a

state  of affairs? The power to use these Emergency-Law  provisions lies with the ruling Party, and  the

people are in no position to prevent misuse or abuse

of  such powers. At any time, emergency restrictions

can  take away the basic freedoms of the people,  of

association   and   assembly,   free   speech    and

publication. May I ask what safeguards then have  we

of  the  limited democracy that we have  today  - the

limited democracy that has been won after all  these

years  of  hard  struggle?  This  is  an  outrageous

provision.  We  can  understand the  British  and  a

reactionary  ruling Party wanting such a  provision,

because  it  enables a colonial  and  a  reactionary

government  to  ride roughshod over all  opposition,

but  for the P.A.P., that has claimed to be  at  one

time a socialist Party, to agree to such a provision

is incredible. Why? How can the Prime Minister still

claim  that  he has the interests of the  people  at

heart?   By  actively  promoting  such  a  Malaysian

Agreement,  he  now  shows  to  all  the  people  of

Singapore  that he is truly a hundred per cent  out-and-out  colonial stooge. How does he hope to  fight

for  a  more  equal and just society by agreeing  to

such   a  provision?  Overnight,  all  anti-colonial

stalwarts and socialists can be put into prison  and

a military dictatorship imposed. Sir, this provision

must be removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you to page 27, clause 35, sub-clause

(1)  of the Malayan constitution Documents? It refers

to  "appropriate supplement to List II".  Before  we

talk  of  this,  let  me refer you  to  the  Federal

Constitution. Article 76, subsection (4)  on page  60

allows the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



Federation Parliament to legislate for the State  in

certain, cases. Article 91, subsection (5), on  page

70  relates  to  control  of Parliament  over  State

lands, mining, agriculture and forestry through  the

National Land Council. Article 95, subsection (1)  on

page   73  of  the  Malayan  Constitution  Documents

relates to the inspection of State activities by any

Federation officer. And Article 92 relates to powers

given  for the National Development Plan. All  these

relate  to  financial control contained in  Articles

108, 109 and 111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Article 75 deals with the inconsistencies

between the Federation and State laws. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any State law is inconsistent with the Federal

law, the Federal law shall prevail and the State law

shall to the extent of the inconsistency be void.'



<br><br>Now,  let me refer you back again to clause 35, sub-clause  (1)   of  Cmd.  22 of  1963.  There  it  says

"appropriate supplements". What are the  appropriate

supplements? Do they refer to labour and  education?

In  actual  fact,  in  Part II  of  the  List  II.B.

Education, Labour, Medicine and Health are listed as

State lists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, remembering all this, let me now refer you to

clause  42,  sub-clause (1)   on  page  30.  This  is

important,  because once you know all  the  previous

powers of the National Development Council, then you

can understand how this new clause works. Clause  42

sub-clause (1)  allows Singapore and the three Borneo

States  powers to exercise their State  rights,  but

sub-clause (2)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Article shall cease to have effect in the

case of Singapore if Parliament with the concurrence

of the Governor so provides.'



<br><br>In  other words, what power has been given  in  sub-clause (1)  now gets taken away in sub-clause (2)   so

far as Singapore is concerned. And therefore Article

76  in  the  Constitution  will  apply  in  toto  to

Singapore. Article 76 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Parliament may make laws with respect to any

matter enumerated in the State List.'



<br><br>Through this Article, the Federation Government  can

nullify whatever autonomies there are in labour  and

education in Singapore. If the Federation Government

can  use these Articles to act, then, of course, the

autonomies will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



be only autonomies in name, and this is exactly what

we  have said long, long ago. It merely proves  that

the autonomy is a false one, because at any time  if

the  Federation Government chooses to  exercise  its

powers,  the  autonomy can be  interfered  with  and

restricted in all sorts of ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 43, sub-clause (1) on page 30 allows the

Federation Parliament to have control over the State

in  agriculture and forestry. I see that  the  Prime

Minister  has  an  amendment  on  this  very  clause

itself.  But sub-clause (5)  of clause 43 allows  the

Federation  to  sidestep the  Singapore  Legislative

Assembly  in  matters of land, etc, in the  case  of

Sabah, it is different. Sub-clause(5)  (a)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Clause (2) shall cease to apply as regards Article

91,  to Singapore if Parliament so provides with the

concurrence of the Governor.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, as long as the Governor approves,

any  law  which  the  Government in  the  Federation

decides  on,  need not have the concurrence  of  the

State  Legislative Assembly. It means that  although

Singapore  is supposed to have autonomy in education

and  labour,  and although Singapore has  its  State

powers  over land, forestry, agriculture  and  other

matters  of  local government - and such  departments

are  listed in List 11, that is, the State List,  of

the  Ninth  Schedule - there are  now  provisions  to

ensure  that the Central Parliament can nullify  the

State  powers  of  Singapore  whenever  the  Central

Parliament  so  desires. The  State  Governments  of

other  States  shall not be required to  follow  the

policy  formulated by the National Land  Council  or

any other National Council for local government; and

the Central Parliament must have the concurrence  of

the  State Legislative Assembly in all projects that

affect  departments in List II, that is,  the  State

List. But, and this is a very important `but',  Sir,

in  the  case  of  Singapore,  it  is  going  to  be

different. The Central Parliament can, at any  time,

sidestep the State Legislative Assembly. The Central

Parliament  need  only have the concurrence  of  the

Governor of Singapore. What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



happens  to  the  powers  of the  State  Legislative

Assembly? The Singapore State Government is supposed

to be in charge of all State departments as put down

in List II of the Ninth Schedule. And in the case of

Singapore, they are education, medicine and  health,

labour  and social security, factories, electricity,

itinerant hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Central Parliament, through the National

Land   Council,  can  easily  interfere   with   the

development projects of education and labour. It may

well  even be that the building of a new school will

not  be  allowed.  Now,  all sorts  of  preposterous

situations can arise, and the Federation can  easily

control  any  expansion of the Education  Department

and  education services in Singapore. The Federation

already   controls  the  Education   Department   of

Singapore  through internal security. Now  there  is

further indirect control in clause 42 and clause  45

of  the proposed Federation Constitution. Where then

is   the  autonomy  in  labour  and  education   for

Singapore? As far as we can see, it is autonomy only

in  name,  and it is only autonomy so  long  as  the

Federation Government does not want to interfere. If

at  any  time the Federation Government  decides  to

interfere,  then  the  autonomy  goes.   These   new

provisions make the partnership arrangement  into  a

complete merger arrangement without the compensatory

granting  of  citizenship  rights  and  proportional

representation to the State of Singapore, and  under

those circumstances it becomes most unfair and  most

unjust to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you, Sir, again to Cmd. 22 of 1963,

pages  41  and 42? I refer to clause 60  sub-clauses

(1),  (2)  and (4). All of them refer to restrictions

on  the right to form association conferred by other

clauses,  and they may even be imposed  by  any  law

relating  to  labour and education.  Clause  60  (1)

already  talks of restrictions on the right of  free

movement throughout the Federation, It can only mean

that  there  will be no unification  of  the  labour

movement  in  the area, and it can  only  mean  that

student   travel,   cultural   exchange,   will   be

restricted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister talks of reciprocal powers, hut that has no meaning when we refer to the Prime Minister's slogan for merger. He used to say, "National unity through merger." With this restriction, how can he talk of national unity when people in one part of the Federation cannot go to another part of the same Federation! The rights

gained  through all the years of hard struggle  - the

rights  and  freedoms  of  speech  and  publication,

association   and  assembly  - will  be   immediately

interfered with Clause 60 (4)  empowers Parliament to

pass  legislation to restrict association of workers

and students. We can see from this that there is  no

autonomy   for   workers  and   unions   and   civic

Organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now one more, may I refer to page 47, clause 69

(1)  (a)  and (c)? Here it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No amendment shall be made to the Constitution

without  the  concurrence of  the  Governor  if  the

amendment is such as t affect the operation  of  the

Constitution in relation to Singapore as regards any

of the following matters -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) citizenship of Singapore, and the restriction

to citizens of Singapore of the right to be  a

member  of either House of Parliament  for  or

from  Singapore,  or to be  a  member  of  the

Legislative Assembly of Singapore, or to  vote

at elections in Singapore;'.



<br><br>According  to  the Prime Minister,  this  clause  is

supposed  to  safeguard  all  the  rights   of   the

Malaysian citizens (Singapore) after the coming into

being  of Malaysia. This, to our reading, means  the

possible  interference of the  rights  of  Singapore

citizens, but since the Prime Minister has moved  an

amendment  to this clause I will refer to  it  again

later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from all that I have enumerated, we can see

that  the provisions that have been provided for  us

in  this proposed Constitution are completely to the

disadvantage of Singapore. There is no true autonomy

in  education  and  labour  Federal  Parliament  can

control all activities of the State of Singapore. We

arc  particularly against the granting of  emergency

powers  to the Government when there is no  external

aggression and when there is no civil disturbance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



This  in  fact  allows  the  Government  to  have  a

military take-over for a fascist dictatorship.  This

is entirely contrary to the interests of the people,

whether  of Singapore or of the Federation.  And  we

will   always   fight   against  such   undemocratic

provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now refer to the recent financial

talks and arrangements that have been arrived at  in

London. We already see how the White Paper has  been

mutilated  on the question of citizenship.  We  have

also seen how the P.A.P. has deceived the people  of

Singapore   at   every  stage   of   the   financial

negotiations. In order that we may more clearly  see

the P.A.P. sell-out, let us refer to what the P.A.P.

had  originally said. The P.A.P. had told the people

of   Singapore   during  the   merger   debate   and

subsequently during a forum sponsored by the Chinese

Chamber  of  Commerce and then during the Referendum

campaign,  the  following aspects in the  sphere  of

finance.  On  finance, the P.A.P. said,  "Singapore

will  pay  only for Federal services in  Singapore."

The  Minister for Finance explained, "Singapore will

only  be  paying  to defray the cost of  maintaining

certain  departments  of  the  Singapore  Government

which will be administered by the Central Government

after merger. These departments are the Police,  the

Post  Office and Telecommunications, Civil Aviation,

Prisons,  Audit  Office  and the  Singapore  Defence

Forces."  The  Prime Minister said  the  same  thing

again  only  a  little while ago. The  Minister  for

Finance  gave the explanation at the Chinese Chamber

of Commerce forum. He said in 1962 that the Annually

Recurrent   Expenditure  of  these  six  departments

mentioned  amounted  to only  $62  million  and  the

Development  Estimates  over  the  four  years   was

estimated at $35 million, namely, it would  only  be

$8  million annually. He further said, "In addition,

Singapore will only be making a contribution for the

maintenance  of pan-Malayan (not Malaysian)  Defence

Force.  The Foreign Office of the Malayan Government

and  certain  other State institutions such  as  the

Central Legislature,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



the  Head of State and so on. This expenditure  will

be   shared  by  all  States  including  the  Borneo

territories after merger." The Minister for  Finance

estimated  that Singapore's contribution  for  these

services would be around $8 million a year, which is

about   2   per  cent  of  our  annual  expenditure.

Following  this, the Minister for Finance  explained

and   stressed  that  Singapore's  real   additional

expenditure would be around $8 million a  year,  and

since the contribution is for specific purposes,  it

is  not  related to possible deficits in the Central

Government's  budget. Accordingly, the  contribution

will not be increased by the Central Government even

if  it  incurred a deficit," and, according  to  the

Minister  for Finance, "the actual amount  Singapore

would  pay  to  the  Federation would  be  only  $62

million  plus $8 million plus $8 million equals  $78

million,  and  Singapore  would  be  paying  to  the

Federation  for  Federal services in  Singapore  one

lump sum of $78 million." That was what the Minister

for Finance said in reply to a question in the forum

sponsored  by  the Chinese Chamber  of  Commerce  in

early  1962.  This is what the P.A.P. has  told  the

people  of  Singapore. "About 20 per  cent  only  of

Singapore's revenue will be given to the  Federation

which  will  be  spent  on  services  provided   for

Singapore by the Central Government, and the  amount

given in one lump sum comes to only $78 million." We

have seen what has happened. Has the P.A.P. kept its

promise made to the people during the merger  debate

and subsequently, that it would only be $78 million?

All   these  are  words  solemnly  said  by   P.A.P.

Ministers, but they are all forgotten. We  all  know

that  we are now asked to pay a sum which is  double

that amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. had been exposed in all its twists and

turns  on  the  question of citizenship  during  the

merger  debate.  Let  us  now  see  how  the  P.A.P.

similarly twists and turns in its last shameful  act

of  sell-out  of  the interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore.  As  late as 6th April, 1963,  the  Prime

Minister is reported to have said - and it is in  the

Straits  Times,  front page headline  - "Merger  Cash

Deal. Singapore will keep all her revenue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



including tax collections after merger but she  will

have  to  pay the Federation a yearly lump  sum  for

Federation services." This is only three and a  half

months ago - one lump sum for Federation services and

Singapore  will keep all her revenue  including  tax

collections.  Then  on the 13th April,  it  was  the

Straits  Times,  back page, column 4,  paragraph  4.

During   the  so-called  merger  crisis,  (headlines

again)  the Prime Minister even put the  sum  to  be

paid for Federation services in Singapore as low  as

$50  to $60 million a year. That is what he told the

people  of Singapore and he further stated that  the

annual  revenue of Singapore is $400 million and  he

would  agree  to share with the rest of the  Malayan

territories  only  if, only if. Singapore's  revenue

was  more than $500 million and above annually. Now,

this is what the Prime Minister said. He would agree

only  if  Singapore's revenue  was  more  than  $500

million and above annually. But we have seen what he

has  given away when the revenue is much, much  less

than  $500 million. On that occasion, Sir, he listed

four  factors  for the working out  of  a  financial

arrangement  with the Federation, the  four  factors

being  (1)  the number of seats Singapore has in  the

Central Parliament: (2)  the area to be defended; (3)

the population ratio of the area to be defended; and

(4)   the  prosperity index including  common  market

arrangements. Now. Paper Misc. 4 of 1963, Section 22

lists only three factors. This type of talk at  that

time   sounded  pretty  tough  and  no  wonder   the

newspapers  were  misled into describing  such  talk

with  words like "impasse", "deadlock" and  whatnot,

hut of course such tough talks have turned out to be

a  mere  sham.  The Prime Minister, as  always,  was

merely  posturing because facts have  already  shown

that  we  are not going to pay just $60 million,  as

said  by  the Prime Minister on the 13th April,  but

two  and half times to three times that amount, that

is, more than $150 million. What then are those four

factors listed by the Prime Minister as reported  in

the  Straits Times on the 13th April, 1963?  We  can

see  that (1)  the number of seats Singapore  has  in

the Central Parliament has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



not increased. It still remains at 15 seats; (2)  the

area  of  Singapore has not increased  in  size  and

remains 224 square miles. In fact, I would say  that

it  has  shrunk in size. I will explain that  later;

(3)   the  population  has possibly  increased  by  a

fraction since 3� months ago, but not much more than

that; and (4)  the prosperity index according to what

we  can see in the P.A.P. common market arrangements

is  not going to work to the advantage of Singapore.

I will go further into this -



<br><br><!--Mr John Mammen(Deputy Speaker)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> Order. I  suspend

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was speaking about the four

factors  which  the  Prime Minister  listed  in  the

working-out  of  a  financial arrangement  with  the

Federation,  and  we  find that although  he  listed

those four factors, namely, the number of seats, the

area  to  be defended, the population ratio and  the

prosperity index, there is, in fact, no increase  in

the  number  of seats, no increase in  the  size  of

Singapore - in fact, there is a decrease - there is no

big  increase in the population of Singapore and yet

the  Prime  Minister  has given  away  millions  and

millions  of  dollars  of the wealth  of  Singapore.

Under those circumstances, we must ask, why has  the

P.A.P. to   increase  the  amount  of  Singapore's

contribution to the Federation? What type  of  logic

is  this?  Is  this not the sell-out  logic  of  the

P.A.P.? Sir, on 15th April, 1963, the front page  of

the  Straits  Times listed "We stand Pat"  and  that

meant that the Prime Minister was putting up a  very

firm stand, in fact, a very unexpectedly firm stand.

He  said on that occasion, on the back page  of  the

Straits  Times  of  15th April,  that  taxation  and

representation are closely related. "Since  we  keep

most of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



our  taxes  we, therefore, reduce our representation

of the Central Parliament by several seats." What do

these  words  mean? Firstly, Sir, they confirm  what

the  Barisan  Sosialis has been  saying  all  along,

namely,  that  Singapore does not have  proportional

representation and that she has had a  raw  deal  in

the  P.A.P. merger proposals. Secondly,  they  show

that  the Prime Minister himself realises that there

must be no taxation without representation. Now,  he

knowingly,  consciously, voluntarily  and  willingly

signed away millions and millions of dollars of  the

people's  money  without adequate  and  compensatory

representation. Sir, simple logic tells us  that  if

more  money is given away, naturally the  number  of

Central  Parliament  seats  for  Singapore  must  be

increased. If giving away $78 million could get  for

Singapore only 15 seats, surely giving away 2� times

that  amount  should entitle us to 2� times  15,  or

round  about  37  seats in the  Central  Parliament.

Since the number of seats remains at 15, is this not

clear  evidence therefore of a P.A.P. sell-out?  Is

this not proof, right from the horse's mouth of  the

Prime Minister, that he has given away money without

adequate representation? Of course, money earned  by

the  sweat  and toil of the people of Singapore,  as

was  so often stressed by the Prime Minister on  his

constituency tours, is regarded by the P.A.P. as  of

minor  and  secondary importance. The  Minister  for

Finance  has  said, "What is a few millions  between

friends?"  What he really means, in  fact,  Sir,  is

what is a few millions of the people's money between

the P.A.P. Ministers and their friends? Is it not  a

nice  way  of  saying  things?  The  people's  money

between  the P.A.P. Ministers and their friends!  We

can  see concrete examples of this P.A.P. philosophy

in   the   step-by-step  P.A.P. surrender  to   the

Federation   in   the   financial   cost.   In   the

negotiations  with  the Federation,  the  P.A.P. is

willing  to change from payment in one lump sum  and

payment  only  for Federal services in Singapore  to

payment  by percentage to the Federation and payment

for  Pan-Malayan services. This is a big jump,  Sir.

Why this change?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, on the one hand, giving the impression to the

people  of Singapore that he was fighting to  retain

every cent of the money for Singapore, he agreed, on

the  other  hand,  to give more money  away  to  the

Federation.  If  this  is not pure  deception,  then

there  must  be something radically wrong  with  the

heads of the P.A.P. Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until 25th May, 1963, the Prime Minister had been

deceiving  the people with talks of surpluses  which

he  claimed  are  the result of a prudent  and  good

government. We say, Sir, it is nothing of that sort.

The early surpluses in Singapore were the result  of

downright  inefficient  and incompetent  government.

The  P.A.P.  Government has been  too  busy  playing

politics. It did not have the time to use the  money

of  the  people of Singapore and voted for  in  this

Legislative  Assembly  on construction  projects  to

help  the  people  of Singapore. Surplus  means,  in

actual  fact,  under-expenditure and under-use  and,

therefore, it means inefficient and bad government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to come back, Sir, to the question we were

discussing.  The  Prime  Minister  was  telling  the

people  that  the  Federation  had  wanted  half  of

Singapore's  surplus,  but, of  course,  this  is  a

surplus of another character. This is a surplus, not

the   result  of  under-expenditure  of  the  P.A.P.

Government over the last three years - $88 million  in

1960,  $125 million in 1961 and $93 million in 1962,

making  a  total  surplus of $304 million  in  three

years;  negligence of $304 million  in  three  years

- but  the  estimated result of an estimated increase

in  revenue  in the years ahead. Let us  follow  the

development of events. May I refer to Paper Misc.  4

of  1963? On page 45, Document III tells us that the

Federation on 5th of April, 1963, proposed  for  the

purpose  of determining the apportionment  that  (1)

any surplus of Federal revenue after meeting Federal

services  in  Singapore will be  used  to  meet  the

shortfall of Singapore revenue; (2)  to meet  central

Federal   expenditure  such  as  defence,   internal

security,  external affairs, Parliament,  etc.;  and

(3)   any  balance will be apportioned 50/50  between

the two Governments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it goes on to explain that having determined

the amounts from the Federation revenue that will go

to  the  Federation  Government  and  to  the  State

Government, the ratio of the amounts should be  used

as  the  ratio for future apportionment.  Since  all

calculations  are  based on  the  1961  revenue  and

expenditure, and since the ratio calculated  on  the 1961  Federal revenue is 60 per cent Federal and  40

per  cent State, so apportionment will be Federation

60  per  cent  and State 40 per cent in all  Federal

revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very revealing Document and it shows

how  the  Federation Government has been  trying  to

soak  Singapore  all the way. And indeed  the  Prime

Minister  made  use  of  this  fact  to  create  the

impression that he was fighting for the interests of

Singapore. He went from constituency to constituency

telling  the people how he was resisting the demands

of  the  Federation Government, and all the time  he

talked of "surpluses" by which he sought to give the

impression  to  the  people of  Singapore  that  the

Federation  was asking for surpluses that  had  come

about  as a result of underspending by the politics-playing  P.A.P. Government in 1960, 1961  and  1962.

And  this  game  of  Lee  Kuan Yew-hero-playing-and-creating  went on until 25th May, 1963,  when  in  a

letter  to the Straits Times Mr Abdullah Bin  Ayub,

Deputy  Controller  of  Supply  in  the  Federation,

revealed that the negotiations were, in fact, on the

percentage payment of Singapore Federal taxes to the

Federation. He said that once the percentage payment

has been fixed, each Government would be responsible

for  its  own budget and the question of deficit  or

surplus  does not arise. Sir, this was a great  blow

to  the  P.A.P. This letter, in fact, says that  the

Prime  Minister had not been telling the people  the

truth,  because all the time it should have  been  a

percentage but he was talking and telling the people

that  it  was  a  matter  of surpluses.  After  this

Federation  broadside, the P.A.P. had to  completely

shut  up  on  the  question of  surplus.  The  Prime

Minister, therefore, had to turn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



to  new  pastures in order to exploit the situation.

The payment on a percentage basis was soon confirmed

on  30th May, 1963, when both Governments agreed  in

principle to set up a Common Market. This, so far as

we  can  see,  is  a  great retreat  for  Singapore,

because a percentage payment brings with it a built-in  increase  year  by year. This  is  most  clearly

explained  by no other than Mr Jek Yuen Thong,  the

Political  Secretary to the Prime Minister  himself.

In  a letter to the Straits Times of 27th May, 1963,

Mr  Jek  Yuen  Thong pointed out that the  built-in

increase  lies in three directions: (1)   by  natural

increase  in consumption and so increasing  revenue;

(2)   by  spread of the number of taxes over a  wider

range  of commodities as times goes on; and  (3)   by

increasing  in actual level of taxation  over  which

the Central Government has legislative authority. We

see,  therefore, that this percentage payment  is  a

great  disadvantage to Singapore,  however  you  may

look at it. It means, in fact, an added extra burden

on  the people of Singapore which increases year  by

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister himself realised this. He also said there was a difference between 25 per cent of $400 million and 25 per cent of $500 million. He said this on 2nd June, 1963. In his visit to the Punggol Constituency on 3rd June, 1963, he pointed out that one per cent would mean $3 million after Malaysia, $5 million after 5 years, and $8 million

after  10 years. Considering the fact that he  knows

how  to  calculate in this fashion, he  should  also

have known what the giving away of extra millions of

dollars  means to the people. One would have thought

that  he  would indeed have looked after the revenue

of  Singapore  and sought all means  to  reduce  the

percentage  payment to the Federation. If  this  had

been  done, he would indeed have been able to  claim

that  he had fought for the interests of the  people

of Singapore. Facts unfortunately prove otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Prime Minister had got the backing of the

people,  he would have the full confidence  and  the

strength of the people behind him, and he would have

been  able  to  put  up a really tough  fight.  But,

unfortunately, as is evident



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



to  all  the people in Singapore, he does not  enjoy

the  backing  of  the people, and, consequently,  he

does  not  have the confidence and strength  of  the

people behind him. Therefore, he could not have  put

up  any  real fight. He knows that he is  already  a

discredited politician on his way out. He  had  gone

on  bended knees to the Tunku and it is unlikely, in

the  circumstances, that he would be able to get the

Federation   to  reduce  the  figure  of  percentage

payment to the Federation. On the contrary, and  not

unexpectedly, the Prime Minister had to increase the

percentage figure all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in spite of all this, events apparently came to

a head over the Federation demand of the $50 million

grant from Singapore and the so-called Common Market

terms. Some of the facts were first revealed at  the

last  sitting of the House on 10th June,  1963.  The

newspapers called it drama, and drama followed drama

until  a Federation ultimatum of Malaysia - "With  or

Without Singapore" - as reported in the Straits Times

on  21st  June,  1963, was handed to  the  Singapore

Government.  We  all  can still remember  the  tense

moments of the deadlock in the financial talks.  The

P.A.P. on  its  side had played its hand  well  and

through   full  use  of  the  Government  propaganda

machinery  had  tried to create the impression  that

the Prime Minister was fighting a stubborn rearguard

action  every  inch  of  the  way.  He  gave   Press

interviews,  spoke  over T.V. informing  the  people

that  Singapore  must have the Common  Market  terms

written  into  the Constitution. He also  said  that

Singapore is too poor to play Santa Claus  with  $50

million.  What  a  heroic  posture  for  the   Prime

Minister!  If only he was really and truly  fighting

for  the  interests of the people of  Singapore  - if

only,  I  say.  But,  of course,  this  was  only  a

posture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events have proved that the Prime Minister was

merely putting up a front, an act, a performance  to

spotlight  his return from London in a  Gilbert  and

Sullivan  traitor-turned-hero farce.  After  he  had

been  summoned by his imperial master to London,  he

again staged a prepared comic opera in the London



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



stage.  There  was news of how he  had  fought,  and

tonight  he  was  telling us how he fought.  He  was

reported to have negotiated right through the  night

and he was even reported to have used anti-Communist

methods against Tun Razak and Tan Siew Sin.  To  use

anti-Communist methods - I do not know what he meant.

But   from  what  the  Prime  Minister  himself  has

revealed  in  this Chamber tonight, we knew  he  was

eating  sandwiches  and he was drinking  whisky  and

brandy. And then there was news of how very near  it

became  a complete breakdown before there was  final

accord.  And  to some people, Sir - only some  people

- it  appeared that Lee Kuan Yew was really  fighting

for  their interests. Those who do not know  of  the

contortionist  agility of Lee Kuan Yew  and  company

for  twists and turns might have thought that he was

really lighting every inch of the way. But when  the

bare  essentials of these financial terms were  made

known  to  us in Singapore at that time,  it  was  a

great shock o all. All were shocked and amazed  that

the  Prime Minister should have accepted terms which

are  so  patently disadvantageous to  Singapore  and

entirely advantageous to the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going to London, the Prime Minister had

already  told  the  people  in  Singapore  that  the

Federation  demanded  40  per  cent  of  Singapore's

national  revenue. He informed the  people  in  T.V.

broadcasts  that  - and he repeated  the  same  thing

again tonight - according to Singapore's calculations,

payment  to the Federation should amount to only  34

per  cent of Singapore's national revenue. But  - and

we  can  see  the difference between the  Federation

Government  and  the  Singapore Government  on  this

- while the Federation demand had remained at 40  per

cent  - no change whatsoever - the P.A.P. had  already

given way and increased the payment from 34 per cent

to  37  per  cent.  This, Sir, is  now  revealed  in

Document  VII on page 55 of Paper Misc. 4  of  1963.

You will see in paragraph 3, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Siew Sin is asking for 40% of our national taxes

whereas our calculations show only 34.3% is  due  to

him, but we are prepared to split the difference and

settle at 37%.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



This  letter was written on 11th June. We know  that

this 37 per cent was subsequently further raised  to

39  per  cent, and then in London the Prime Minister

went  one step further and increased the 39 per cent

to  40 per cent - the 40 per cent originally demanded

of Singapore by the Federation. We can see from this

alone  how  the  P.A.P. has been  surrendering  the

rights  of the people of Singapore step by  step  to

the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said that he was pressured both by the United Kingdom and the Federation Governments. But then what else can a stooge do but carry out the instructions of his imperial master? Did he fight back? Did he say that the interests of the people are paramount? No. He just surrendered. Only a matter of percentage, according to the P.A.P. Ministers. And yet this evening, the Prime Minister himself tells us that not even half a point has been given away. From what we can see 34 per cent to 40 per cent is 6 points - not half a point; many points. One point means a lot of money too. I will come to

that later. Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal in London, therefore, and I quote the

words  of  the Prime Minister himself, is  all  one-sided  to the advantage of the Federation Government

and fair and just only to the Federation Government.

When  the  Prime  Minister  talks  of  fairness  and

justice, he never thinks of the Singapore people. It

is  not  fair and just to Singapore. It is fair  and

just all right to the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on an annual national revenue of $310

million  - and  this was quoted by Mr Tan  Siew  Sin

when  he  came back from London - one per cent  works

out  to  $3.1 million, and 40 per cent works out  to

$124  million. But, of course, to the Prime Minister

the percentage is not important, and this is what he

said  in a letter to the Tunku on 22nd June - Document

IX on page 63. In his letter to the Tunku, the Prime

Minister  said  the percentage is not  important  - I

stress,  is  not important. I do not  know  what  is

important to him. One per cent, as far as  we  know,

is $3.1 million. If we work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



all  our lives, we will never get one-tenth of  that

amount  of  money.  But to the Prime  Minister,  the

percentage of the money of the people earned through

their  sweat and toil, as so often stressed  by  the

Prime  Minister, is not important.  The  only  thing

important is the P.A.P.; that is all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing how the P.A.P. has sold out the rights

of  the people of Singapore step by step, we can now

see  the difference between the White Paper and  the

present  Malaysia Agreement in London  on  this  one

item  alone. What was originally a lump sum  payment

to  the Federation of only $78 million per year  for

Federal  services in Singapore - and which was  stated

by  the Prime Minister himself to be as low as  only

$60 million recently - has now become a payment of 40

per  cent  of Singapore's national revenue amounting

to  $124  million  per  year and  for  Pan-Malaysian

defence  - no  more a matter of Malayan defence,  but

now  of Pan-Malaysian defence. This amount increases

year  by  year,  and  this  is  but  the  beginning,

because, as we shall see, there is more to  pay  for

Singapore. We know that although the Prime  Minister

says,  on the one hand, that Singapore cannot afford

to   give   a  $50  million  grant  to  the   Borneo

territories, yet, on the other hand, he is  in  fact

giving  more  than  that amount  away  in  the  $150

million  loan  to  the Federation. $100  million  of

which  is  interest free for the first  five  years.

anti  this interest-free period can be extended  for

another  live  years.  It  means,  of  course,  that

Singapore  is giving away an interest-free  loan  of

$100 million to the Federation for 10 years, because

if  it can be extended, then, of course, it will  be

extended. The power does not rest with the Singapore

Government. The Federation Government has the power.

And any agreement which says that it can be extended

in  fact  means that it will be extended. Therefore,

the  interest-free period, in fact, is ten years and

not  five years, as has been explained by the  Prime

Minister.  Simple interest on $100 million  at  five

and  a half per cent would amount to $55 million  in

ten  years,  i.e. $5.5 million a year. The  compound

interest will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



amount  to much more than that. It is, therefore,  a

loss of $55 million in ten years and this becomes  a

double  loss  of  $100 million if Singapore  has  to

borrow money and pay the same or higher interest  on

the loan borrowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might at this point remind you, Sir, of the $45

million  World  Bank  loan given  to  the  Singapore

Government  for the power station project.  In  that

loan  given to Singapore by the World Bank, all  the

most   humiliating  terms  are  exacted   from   the

Singapore Government. Singapore has to buy  all  the

materials through the World Bank; Singapore  has  to

employ a super engineer who will probably, as far as

I  understand, earn a salary of $6,000 a  year,  and

Singapore   has   again   to  employ   supplementary

personnel to help this super engineer, again through

the  World Bank, and, on top of that, has to  assure

payment  of an interest of at least eight per  cent;

at  the  same  time  mortgaging  all  the  Municipal

properties of Singapore to the World Bank for a mere

pittance of $45 million. All our Singapore Municipal

properties,  worth much more than that, millions  of

dollars, all mortgaged to the World Bank. Why do  we

have  to  borrow all that money when  Singapore  has

$400  million  in  the kitty?  We  have  asked  this

question  many times. The Singapore Government  - the

P.A.P.  - has not been able to answer that  question.

We hope they might provide an answer and we will see

what they have to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me come back to this $150 million loan to

the Federation. This is a completely new item and is

not found anywhere in the White Paper. But, as I was

saying,   what  is  most  puzzling  and   completely

inexplicable to the people of Singapore is that,  on

the  one  hand, the P.A.P. has to borrow $45 million

for the power station project from the World Bank on

such  humiliating terms, and even to borrow  another

$70  million for the Johore River project,  probably

on the same terms; on the other hand, the P.A.P. can

loan $150 million of the people of Singapore's money

to the Federation, $100 million of which is interest

free. If it is found necessary that Singapore has to

borrow, then elementary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



logic tells us that Singapore cannot afford to lend.

So  what type of reason and logic says that although

we  have to borrow, we still can afford to lend?  Is

this  the  logic of the Finance Minister  who  says,

"What is a few millions between friends?", or is  it

the  logic  of  the Prime Minister  who  says,  "The

percentage is not important."?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many people who openly say that this

loan is an eyewash. They say, it is not a loan.  The

word  "loan"  is  only an euphemism  for  the  words

"outright  gift". The Member for Anson  has  pointed

out  that when the time comes for repayment  of  the

loan,  Singapore will not be in a position to demand

such  a  repayment.  The  loan,  is,  therefore,  in

effect,  a  gift,  a tribute from a  vassal  to  his

overlord.  The vassal, in the person  of  the  Prime

Minister of Singapore, has to pay a tribute  to  his

overlord, the Prime Minister of the Federation,  for

helping the Prime Minister of Singapore to crush his

political opponents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister claims that he has not given away $150 million in an outright grant. But has the Prime Minister really saved the money as he has claimed? To us, money is only meant for use for development to raise the living standards of the people. Money invested abroad is of no use to all of us in Singapore. Put to proper use, however, the

$150  million  loan  is worth  more  than  the  $150

million  outright  grant. This is confirmed  by  the

World  Bank  and by no other person than  the  Prime

Minister himself in his letter to the Tunku on  22nd

June. 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you, Sir, to Paper Misc. 4 of 1963,

Document  IX, page 63? In the fourth paragraph,  the

last sentence reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`And loans from Singapore for North Borneo and

Sarawak's development up to $150 million will give a

greater impetus on their economic growth.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was referring to why he did not want to give the

$50  million grant. But, in comparison, he says  the

$150  million  loan will give a greater  impetus  on

their  economic  growth. This is an  open  admission

that  he  has  given  away, in  fact,  more  to  the

Federation than the $50



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



million which he said he was trying to save. So  how

has  the  P.A.P. saved any money for the  people  of

Singapore?  He  is  merely  pretending   to   refuse

payment.  He  is only saying, "No", with  one  hand,

when in fact he gives more generously away with  the

other hand. The Prime Minister knows how to say that

the  $150 million can be used to build 13 blocks  of

Selegie House and can be used also to metal all  the

roads  and  to  light  up all  the  rural  areas  in

Singapore.  So, why does he not keep back  the  $150

million for development in Singapore? Why is it that

Singapore  has  to loan the money  to  others,  when

Singapore itself needs to borrow more and more money

for  its  own  development? Since 1963, five  loans,

totalling  nearly  $250 million in  all,  have  been

floated  in  Singapore. This  was  revealed  by  the

Finance Minister only last week. Why float loans for

the development of Singapore on the one hand and yet

loan   money  away  for  the  development  o   other

territories on the other hand? Is this not absurd?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already the P.A.P. has invested our money abroad to

help develop other already developed countries.  Can

the  P.A.P. explain why a poorly developed  country,

like  Singapore,  must use its  own  money  to  help

develop  more  advanced countries,  like  Australia,

Canada,  England? Why? Is this the logic the  P.A.P.

has  talked about? Is it logical to give money  away

when   the  people  of  Singapore  need  the   money

themselves?  Is this not the logic of traitors?  And

does  the Prime Minister know what the $110  million

lost in the interest-free loan mean to the people of

Singapore? I will just quote a few examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Singapore can easily use the money to

buy  over the Singapore Traction Company. This  will

immediately stop further exploitation of the  people

of  Singapore by foreign monopoly capital.  It  will

stop  all  remittances of profits from Singapore  to

areas outside Singapore. Why does he not do that? it

does  not even cost $10 million. Why give away  $110

million in interest-free loans?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, to quote another example, with this $110

million  we can allow 100,000 families to stay  rent

free in $20 per month housing units for six years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, another example: free secondary education for

300,000  students at $4 per month for  eight  years.

Yes, the $110 million can be used for quite a lot of

things  besides  building Selegie  House,  metalling

roads, installing lights. We can reduce the rents in

the  Housing Board flats in Singapore. We  can  give

free  education to our students. We  can  give  more

scholarships.  Oh, so many things.  If  we  were  to

think  of our taxi-drivers, trishaw-riders,  hawkers

and  market stall-holders, we could give  them  free

licences  for  hundreds of years.  For  hundreds  of

years,  they will not have to pay licences.  In  the

case  of  the Harbour Board, for example, with  that

money,  Singapore can easily give $100 increase  per

worker  per  month  to  the 10.000  workers  in  the

Singapore  Harbour Board for ten years.  The  P.A.P.

does  not  have to wait until now, after 4 years  of

non-recognition, before promising to pay $2  million

to  the  S.H.B. workers and  call  it  a  so-called

Malaysian  bonus - that has not even been given  yet.

So  you can see, Sir, what the P.A.P. Government has

been doing to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every stage the P,A.P. has surrendered to the

Federation  the  basic interests of  the  people  of

Singapore.  Let  me  now touch on  the  question  of

financial  control. At one stage  of  the  financial

talks, the Prime Minister took a strong stand on the

matter of control of Singapore's finances. On  this,

the  Prime  Minister said on 7th March,  1963,  that

Singapore  must  keep  all  her  revenue.   And   he

explained  that "the word `keep' does not  mean  get

back  from  Kuala  Lumpur." He further  stressed  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`How can Singapore, as agreed in the White Paper,

pay a contribution for Federal services, if she does

not collect and keep it in the first instance?'



<br><br>When  I first read that, it sounded very logical  to

me,  and I was wondering what the Prime Minister was

up  to.  Undoubtedly,  those  words  had  given  the

impression to the people of Singapore that the Prime

Minister was going to stand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



firm  on this question. Being a lawyer, he knew what

he  was talking about. On 23rd March, 1963, he  went

even  one  stage  further to stress that  "Singapore

must  collect,  keep  and pay."  Therefore,  on  the

question of who is to control the machinery for  the

collection of revenue in Singapore, as was posed  by

Mr  Tan Siew Sin, our own Prime Minister here tells

the  people  that  it is Singapore  that  must  have

control  of  the  money collected in  Singapore.  Of

course,  later on, as is typical of P.A.P.'s  twists

and  turns,  the Minister for Finance  said  in  the

Straits  Times  on  17th  April,  1963,  that   "who

controls  the  revenue  of  Singapore  is   not   so

important."  By  this,  already  the  Minister   for

Finance  admits that the Federation has  control  of

the  revenue of Singapore. But this did not  prevent

the  Prime Minister from saying something completely

the  opposite.  In an interview televised  over  the

B.B.C.   Panorama  on  6th  May,  1963,  he   stated

categorically:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have got to collect the revenue to be able to

spend it in the way we want.'



<br><br>These  are  very firm words, Sir. And  when  he  was

asked the question: "So control over finance will be

a   minimum  condition  for  your  going  into   the

Federation?".  The Prime Minister  said,  "Oh,  yes,

absolutely basic." That is what he said, "Absolutely

basic.  Control  over  finance  will  be  a  minimum

condition for going into the Federation, and that is

absolutely  basic."  What  has  happened   to   this

"absolutely   basic"   control   over   finance   in

Singapore? As far as we can see, it was not  even  a

puff of smoke. It was gone with the wind even before

it  came into existence. This financial control  was

only a fiction conjured up by the Prime Minister  to

allow him to deceive the people. It served him as  a

false   front   in  his  horse  trading   with   the

Federation. Are we not now controlled in toto by the

Federation?  Are  we not going into  the  Federation

bound  hand and foot? Or is this another example  of

P.A.P. logic  and cold reason? From the  absolutely

basic  and  minimum  condition for  going  into  the

Federation, as laid down by no other person than the

Prime Minister himself, he is now willing to act



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



only as the Federation's revenue collector. This  is

a  complete  P.A.P. surrender to  the  Federation's

ultimatum  of  20th June, 1963. To  save  face,  the

P.A.P.,   in  the  Singapore  paragraph-to-paragraph

reply to the Federation Government's proposals,  may

I refer you, Sir, to Paper Misc. 4 of 1963, page 65:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Singapore Government agrees in principle with

the proposal to delegate authority in respect of the

collection of Customs and Excise duty and Income Tax

to  the  Singapore  Government  in  accordance  with

Article 80 (4)....'.



<br><br>He agrees to it straightaway, although all along the

P.A.P. has been saying that control over finance  is

absolutely  basic  and  that  this  is  the  minimum

condition for going into the Federation. But  if  we

were to go further down, the P.A.P. also says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, this delegation of authority should be

stated  in the Constitution that such delegation  of

authority  shall not be revocable except  by  mutual

agreement.'



<br><br>I do not know about "shall not be revocable". Let us

see  what  the Federation reply is to  that.  It  is

contained  in paragraph 5 of Annex J on page  75  of

Paper Misc. 4 of 1963 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of the Annex to this

Agreement,  executive authority in  respect  of  the

collection in Singapore of customs duties and excise

and  income tax shall be delegated to the  Singapore

Government.'



<br><br>Yes,   "delegated  to  the  Singapore   Government".

Correct:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Federal Government may revoke this authority

[that is the point, Sir] if the Singapore Government

fails to comply with any direction properly given to

it  by the Federal Government for the collection  or

protection of these taxes or shows itself  unwilling

or unable to discharge these functions efficiently.'



<br><br>There you are. It even goes further to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This authority may extend to customs duties and

other   charges  collected  in  Singapore  on  goods

exported  from  or  to  be  imported  into  Malaysia

outside Singapore.'



<br><br>That  is  to  say,  Sir, Singapore can  collect  the

revenue  only  at  the pleasure  of  the  Federation

Government. If at any time the Federation Government

feels  so  inclined, it can take over the collection

of   all   Federal  revenue  itself.  The  Singapore

Government collects only if the Federation allows it

to   collect.   That   is  all.  Absolute   control,

therefore, is in the hands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Federation, and Singapore is now  only  the

office-boy or rent-collector of the Federation. What

of  the  brave words of the Prime Minister  when  he

said,  "We must collect and keep and pay."?  Is  the

P.A.P. logic to talk tough and surrender  abjectly?

Is  this  P.A.P. logic not the logic of stooges  and

slaves'?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the main items which are manifestly

disadvantageous  to Singapore. The only  consolation

to  Singapore  for the loss of control  of  its  own

revenue  is  an  agreement that  all  Federal  taxes

collected in Singapore will be paid into a  separate

fund and this fund would be divided annually between

the two Governments in the proportion of 60 per cent

to Singapore and 40 per cent to the Federation. This

is  mentioned in page 57 in Document VIII dated 20th

June,  1963,  in a letter from the Federation  Prime

Minister   to  the  Prime  Minister  of   Singapore.

Paragraph 3 (a)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All taxes collected in Singapore, other than those

specified  below, will be paid into a separate  fund

and  the fund would be divided annually between  the

two  Governments,  or more frequently  by  agreement

between the two Governments in the proportion of 60%

to  the  Singapore Government and 40% to the Federal

Government.'



<br><br>This  is meant, in fact, to save face for the P.A.P.

on  its  stand on the question of financial  control

where the P.A.P. has completely given in. There  are

also comparatively minor items like profits from the

Currency   Board  and  the  Federation  and   Borneo

contributions  to Singapore for common  services  in

Singapore. These are referred to in pages 19 and  20

of  the same Paper. Paragraph 51, on page 19,  talks

of  the  Federation  and Borneo in  respect  of  the

payment  to  Singapore  for  common  services;   and

paragraph  52, on page 20, talks of the  profits  of

the  Currency  Board which amount to $10  million  a

year.  Singapore, therefore, has in fact now  waived

its  claim  to monies from both these sources  which

amount to more than $12� million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 49, Sir, at the bottom - Apportionment

Percentages. No. 3 says: "...currency profits  of  $10

million."  Therefore, the P.A.P. has  gone  yet  one

step further and it is now ready to pay for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



a  share of even Pan-Malaysia expenditure. The final

arrangements  will come into operation  on  the  1st

September, 1963. The promise of a review on the  1st

January, 1965, and subsequently every two years will

not  be able to safeguard Singapore's interests,  as

hoped for by the Prime Minister. He will not be able

to  safeguard them because the independent  assessor

will  always  place the interests of the  Federation

first and those of the State second. It is a natural

course  of  events. It is bound to  be  so.  So  the

assessor, however independent, will not be  able  to

safeguard the interests of Singapore. In every  way,

therefore, Singapore will be at a disadvantage.  All

the  lifeblood  of  Singapore  will  be  subject  to

Federation overall control, and it is quite  obvious

that  the people of Singapore has the worse  of  the

bargain in every respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first summarise the results of the financial

merger talks:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What was supposed to be a lump sum payment for

Federal services in Singapore in 1961 has now become

a  percentage payment for Pan-Malaysian services  in

1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What was calculated by the P.A.P. Government as

payment  to  the  Federation  of  34  per  cent   of

Singapore's  national  revenue  has  now  become   a

payment of 40 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What was originally a lump sum payment of only

$78  million  per  year  now  becomes  a  percentage

payment  amounting to $124 million  which  increases

year by year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The P.A.P. says Singapore cannot afford to give

a  grant  of  $150 million, but finally  the  P.A.P.

gives  a loan of $150 million, $100 million of which

is  interest  free. The $150 million is  worth  more

than the $50 million grant in development planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) From a bold stand of "must collect, and keep

and  pay", the P.A.P. is now willing to be only  the

office boy and rent-collector of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The P.A.P. says categorically that the free

port  status after merger would remain. Now the free

port  status will be confined to Blakang Mati  after

12 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) With the free port status reduced to the size

of Blakang Mati - I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



I  have  got the summary ahead of time. I will  keep

this  little back, and I will come back to it again.

Let  me  first deal with this common market and  the

free port status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having been exposed that it has surrendered

to  the Federation on every issue, the P.A.P. plays

up  the  common market as a special prize  that  the

P.A.P. has  got  for the people of  Singapore.  The

P.A.P. claims that the interests of the  people  of

Singapore have been safe-guarded and that the common

market  terms are all written into the Constitution.

The  P.A.P. claims  that  with  the  common  market

Singapore  will prosper, the jobless will get  jobs,

and all the problems of Singapore will be solved and

everyone will be happy. Is this true? What  are  the

facts?  A  first  glance tells us  that  the  common

market which the P.A.P. has got for Singapore is the

most  unusual  and uncommon common  market,  and  it

practically writes "finis" to the entrepot trade  in

Singapore, the lifeblood of our people for the  last

150  years. From the very beginning we have  pointed

out  that  the  P.A.P. merger  terms  did  not  even

provide  for  a common market between Singapore  and

the  Federation.  The P.A.P. had not  been  able  to

answer this during the time of the merger debate  in

1961.  Repeated questions inside the Assembly  later

merely extracted from the P.A.P. Ministers equivocal

answers which were neither here nor there. The Prime

Minister raised the Common Market terms only because

of our constant criticism. Only on 13th April, 1963,

was  this question of the Common Market revealed  to

the  public  for  th.3  first time.  The  Federation

Finance Minister confirmed that this was an entirely

new  item,  never discussed before in the  financial

merger  talks  between the Federation and  Singapore

Governments. This only proves that what  the  P.A.P.

chooses to consider as the most important comes only

as  an  after-thought as a result of our  criticism.

However, this Common Market question soon became  an

item of major importance in the financial talks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 30th May, 1963, it was reported that both

Governments  had agreed in principle on  the  Common

Market, and on the following day the Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



announced with a guilty conscience that "this is not

the  end of the free port status in Singapore." What

are  the  facts?  Let us see what  Annex  J  of  the

Malaysia Agreement says. Section 1 (1)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Federal Government, .... shall progressively

establish a common market in Malaysia....'.



<br><br>And  it is envisaged that the Common Market will  be

fully established at the end of 12 years. By the end

of  that  period, the free port status of  Singapore

will  have  disappeared. At  present  the  whole  of

Singapore is a free port, i.e. all 224 square  miles

of Singapore is a free port. What does the free port

status of Singapore mean? It means, as explained  by

the  Finance Minister a couple of years  back,  that

apart  from  revenue duties on tobacco,  liquor  and

petroleum,  goods  can  be imported  into  Singapore

without  any import duties, and these have benefited

Singapore   in  two  ways.  First,  the  people   of

Singapore  are able to buy more goods  cheaply;  for

instance,  there  is  no duty  on  textiles,  shoes,

foodstuffs, and so on. The prices of such goods will

be   cheaper  in  Singapore  as  compared  with  the

Federation of Malaya where there are import  duties.

The  second benefit is to our traders. Much  of  our

imports   are   re-exported  to   the   neighbouring

territories, e.g. the Federation, Sumatra,  Sarawak,

Borneo. Without the import duties our merchants  can

buy  cheaply and sell to these territories  cheaply.

This   is  how  our  entrepot  trade  prospers.   It

therefore  follows  that when  any  import  duty  is

levied  in  Singapore,  the  free  port  status   is

affected. Similarly, import duties can be levied  on

all   sorts  of  consumer  goods,  e.g. toothbrush,

toothpaste,  shoes, polish, pencils, and  so  on.  A

free  port  status means a cheap cost of living  for

the  people. Now in 12 years or less all  the  cheap

living will become things of the past.



<br><br>Section 4 (2)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Revenue duties in force in Singapore on 1st July,

1963,  and the corresponding duties in force in  the

Federation of Malaya shalt be harmonised as soon  as

practicable.'.



<br><br>In  other  words,  Sir, revenue  duties  on  petrol,

liquor, and tobacco will be harmonised. The price of

petrol is the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



on  both sides of the Causeway today. But the prices

of diesel oil, alcohol and tobacco are higher in the

Federation than in Singapore today. This, therefore,

means  that  the prices of diesel oil, alcohol,  and

tobacco will be raised, and cost more for the man in

the  street in Singapore. The taxi-driver,  the  bus

traveller, will have to spend more money in order to

go  about  their daily work. The earnings  of  taxi-drivers will correspondingly decrease. Where  a  man

could afford three pints of beer before -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Like the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, like the Prime Minister,

will be able to afford only two pints. A smoker will

have  to spend more on his daily smokes and he  will

have  correspondingly less money for  house-keeping.

This  is  what will happen when Singapore loses  its

free  port status. Is this what we want? Where  else

had  the  P.A.P. said about the free port status  in

1961  and  1962? It is laid down in the White  Paper

(first paragraph of section 17) that "the free  port

status  of Singapore ... will not be changed  without

the   concurrence  of  both  the  Federal  and   the

Singapore  Governments."  In  the  Merger  and  Your

Future  leaflet put out by the P.A.P.,  which  is  a

Ministry of Culture publication No. 1/62 printed  by

the  Government Printing Office, Singapore, it  says

here  under  the  heading "Your Right  and  Benefits

Before  and  After Merger", the item is  "Free  Port

Status  for Singapore" and under the column  "Before

Merger"  it says "Yes", and under the column  "After

Merger", it also says "Yes". Therefore, there should

be  no  change  so far as the free  port  status  of

Singapore is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in another Merger and Your Rights leaflet,

also from the Ministry of Culture, No. 5/62, it says

here on the back page:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Business Opportunities: Singapore retains her free

port status after merger.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a forum sponsored by the Chinese Chamber of

Commerce  on the 13th January, 1962, a question  was

asked,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



"If  after merger the Central Government of the  new

Federation  by  levying taxes affect the  free  port

status   of   Singapore,  what  measures   can   the

Government  adopt  to face the  situation?"  A  very

simple  question. The question was, "If after merger

the  Central  Government of the  new  Federation  by

levying  taxes  affect  the  free  port  status   of

Singapore, what measures can the Government adopt to

face  the  situation?" And the Minister for  Finance

answered,  "The  Central Government cannot  do  this

without  the  agreement of the Singapore Government,

of course. The situation envisaged by the questioner

does  not therefore arise." What a wonderful way  of

answering a question. The logical interpretation and

implication  of  this  answer  is  that  the  P.A.P.

Government  would  not agree to  any  measures  that

would  affect  the  free port status  of  Singapore.

Anybody reading an answer like this must come to the

conclusion that the Singapore Government  would  not

change the free port status of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have pointed out, the P.A.P. further

confirmed  this  with  stout  assurances  that   the

present  free port status will remain after  merger.

Thus  we  can  see  that the P.A.P. have  repeatedly

given  assurances  that  the  free  port  status  of

Singapore  will  remain. But what is happening  now?

According  to  the  Malaysia  Agreement  signed   in

London,  Singapore will not continue to  be  a  free

port.  And  by the end of 12 years, if the agreement

is  really  put into effect, the only free  port  we

will  have  in  the  domain  of  Singapore  will  be

confined to the island of Blakang Mati. A free  port

status  of  224  square miles of Singapore  will  be

reduced  to  658 acres of Blakang Mati.  658  acres,

does it come to any square mile?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also this referendum leaflet given out by

the  Government of Singapore - again it is a Ministry

of  Culture  publication, No. 8/62.  And  concerning

free port, it says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What does Alternative A mean? It means Singapore

will continue to be a free port.'



<br><br>That  is what it says here in this leaflet. Is  this

not  deception?  Has  the P.A.P. not  deceived  the

people?  Surely, the people did not  - even  assuming

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



they really did vote for Alternative A - vote for what

is now in the Malaysia Agreement. Then we might ask:

What will happen to our free port trade? The tourist

trade  flourishes only in a free port. If  the  free

port  status  is  reduced to the Island  of  Blakang

Mati,  then  the  tourist  trade  will  have  to  be

confined to Blakang Mati.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rueff Report in page 78, paragraph 196,

estimates  that the tourist trade in  Singapore  can

amount to anything like $100 million a year. It says

here in the last sentence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is impossible to estimate the value of these

transactions;  but, on the basis of the  indications

obtained  from  the  trade, it is  likely  that  the

unrecorded transactions taken as a whole may  be  as

high as M$100 million.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another $100 million gone down the drain. Then what

of  the small traders and shop-keepers who depend on

this  tourist trade? It does look as if the  traders

in  High Street, South Bridge Road, Change Alley and

even  Raffles  Square  will have  to  look  for  new

sources of income. They may even have to close down.

Those gainfully employed may find themselves without

jobs  in  the not too distant future. All thanks  to

the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 sub-clause (3) of the Malaysia

Constitution  says that until 31st  December,  1968,

that is five years from now, no new revenue duty can

be  imposed  without the consent  of  the  Singapore

Government. But in the second five-year period, that

is,  from  the 1st January, 1969, to 31st  December,

1975,  Singapore  can  refuse to  agree  to  heavier

duties only (and this is a very important thing)  on

payment  of compensation on non-imposition  of  such

duties  in  Singapore. After the 31st  of  December,

1975,   that  is  after  12  years,  the   Singapore

Government cannot withhold consent to imposition  of

whatever duty the Federation may wish to impose.  In

other  words,  duties  will be imposed  on  consumer

goods  after  five years at any time the  Federation

Government chooses to do so. If the duties  are  not

paid for directly by the individual consumer or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



the trader, then the duties will have to be paid for

indirectly  from  Government revenue,  which,  after

all, is also collected from the people of Singapore.

Therefore, either way, the people of Singapore  will

have to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what of the protective duties? Protective

duties  already imposed are not very many in number.

Well-known  examples are protective duties  on  soap

and  paint. But there are protective duties on  many

items  of  goods  in  the Federation.  For  example,

medicines, tyres, batteries - you can name any number

of items. Those who have travelled from Singapore to

the  Federation will know how much it costs them  in

ordinary  day-to-day goods. We get cheaper medicine,

for  example,  in Singapore. Once you  go  into  the

Federation,  you have to pay, and pay  through  your

nose  too.  It  is, I think, a 20  to  30  per  cent

increase  in price and naturally therefore the  cost

of  living of the people will correspondingly go  up

with  the imposition of these new protective duties.

Of course, this will not affect those who are in the

front row of the PAP. Government - they are well  off

enough. All of them have new cars. But to those  who

already  find it difficult to make both  ends  meet,

this extra duty on consumer goods will mean an extra

burden  and greater hardship. Is this what we  want?

Moreover,  any  increase  in  price  on  goods   and

products  in every-day use will have its  effect  on

other  connected  goods,  thus  creating  a  vicious

circle  leading  to  increased cost  of  living  all

round.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see, therefore, that after Malaysia is pushed

through the free port status of Singapore will  very

rapidly diminish. The free port of Singapore will be

shrunk  in  size from the whole island of Singapore,

224  square  miles, to the size  of  the  island  of

Blakang Mati, which is only 658 acres, about half  a

mile  from Singapore. In order that the poor  people

may  get  a cheaper living - if they still want  that

cheaper living - they will have to go to Blakang Mati

and  stay  there.  Otherwise they  will  not  get  a

cheaper  living.  If  a person  from  the  Singapore

mainland goes to Blakang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



Mati  to  buy  cheaper goods, he will  have  to  pay

duties  on  those same goods on return to Singapore.

That  is  what it means. Everybody's cost of  living

will increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say, the P.A.P. Front benches do not have to

worry;  they have enough money. There are  not  many

people  who  have so much money. The Prime  Minister

says  he will build bonded warehouses in the Harbour

Board  area  and  in  Telok  Ayer  Basin.  But   how

practical  is  this  proposition? Already  Singapore

businessmen  are complaining that this  will  hinder

the  trade  of  Singapore.  Building  warehouses  in

Blakang  Mati itself would mean additional costs  in

storage and transport from the Singapore mainland to

Blakang  Mati  and back again from Blakang  Mati  to

Singapore. As pointed out on the 10th of July in the

Straits  Times,  there is also the fear  that  banks

would not guarantee the goods once bonded warehouses

are introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a large portion of the goods for the entrepot

trade  is  kept  in warehouses owned by  the  banks,

which  also  provide the credit facilities  for  the

traders.  Entrepot traders fear that  having  bonded

warehouses would mean taking the goods away from the

banks,  leaving  them nothing for  security  on  the

credit.  So  how  will  the  P.A.P. overcome   this

difficulty? Does the P.A.P. itself intend to provide

the  credit facilities and so take over the role  of

banks  in Singapore? If that is so, then the  people

must  be  informed  about this. P.A.P. philantrophy

with other people's money is now well known. So  let

the  P.A.P. inform the people what it intends to do.

Building  a  large number of bonded  warehouses  and

charging  very  cheap rentals will not  be  able  to

solve  all the problems. First of all, there is  not

enough space in the Harbour Board area. And how many

bonded warehouses are they going to keep? People who

normally go to High Street will not be able to go to

bonded  warehouses to buy things.  And  the  tourist

trade in Singapore will suffer greatly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the P.A.P. says that there is a Tariff

Advisory Board. This Board is meant to advise on the

establishment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



and  maintenance  of a common external  tariff,  but

appointments to this Tariff Advisory Board shall  be

made  by the Federation Government, and that is  the

rub. Singapore will be able to nominate only one  of

three Deputy Chairmen for the first five years,  not

after  that. The whole Board, in fact,  will  be  so

weighed  on the side of the Federation that  in  any

clash  of  interests  between  the  Federation   and

Singapore,  as  there certainly will  be,  Singapore

interests  cannot  but suffer.  Thus,  even  in  the

matter  of  the Tariff Advisory Board the advantages

are entirely on the side of the Federation. This  is

not  going to help Singapore. How will this help  to

promote  Singapore industrialisation when Federation

interests will always come first and Singapore State

interests will always come second?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to protective duties on goods

imported, their Government can also impose a special

production  tax on producers in a low  tariff  state

and   an  export  duty  on  primary  products.  This

production  tax on producers in a low  tariff  state

and  export duty on primary products are, of course,

meant   to  protect  Federation  industries  against

Singapore  industries. An example of production  tax

was  given in our Barisan statement on the  13th  of

July,  1963.  If the production cost of  a  pair  of

shoes  in  the  Federation is,  say,  $1.50  and  in

Singapore  only $1.00, then a production tax  of  50

cents will be imposed on Singapore shoes in order to

protect the shoe industries in the Federation.  That

is  what  production tax means. Everything  produced

cheaply here will have a production tax added on  to

it in order to give the industries in the Federation

a  chance to compete evenly and equally. Of  course,

all  this can only work to the disadvantage  of  the

Singapore industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the production costs, and so

the  selling price of eggs. If eggs sell at 10 cents

in the Federation and only 9 cents in Singapore, for

example,  then a duty of 1 cent will be  imposed  on

each Singapore egg in order to level up the price of

eggs  to  10  cents  in  both  Singapore  and   the

Federation.  This, in fact, puts Singapore  products

at  a  great  disadvantage since the extra  cost  of

transport - this is a new item - will mean



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



that Singapore eggs will sell at a dearer price than

that  of  Federation  eggs  in  the  Federation  and

outside  Singapore. In both instances, it  can  mean

only a rise in the cost of living for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, clause 3 (2) of Annex J allows the

Federation  Government to impose or vary  protective

duties on Singapore at any time, even without  prior

reference to the Tariff Advisory Board. You may have

a  Board, but they do not have to consult the Board.

Whether  they  do  it that way  or  not  is  another

matter,  but the powers are there. They can  do  it.

When  new  protective  duties  are  imposed  in  the

Federation,  clause  3  (3)   allows  the   Singapore

Government to delay the imposition of the  tax,  but

not  reject it, and that only for a period of up  to

12  months,  not  after  that.  After  the  12-month

period, the new protective duties will be imposed on

Singapore,  however  the  people  of  Singapore  may

object and protest. There is nothing we can do about

it.  If  the Federation Government decides to impose

these  taxes on Singapore after the 12-month period,

that  is all there is to it. We may protest  but  we

shall have to cough up. And in addition, during  the

12  months,  when Singapore can delay the imposition

of  these  duties,  the Singapore Government  cannot

grant  any pioneer certificate to any industry which

may  be  affected by the proposed protective duties.

How  then  can Singapore promote her industries?  If

industries  can  be  set  up,  they  will  be   only

industries  that play a secondary role to Federation

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that such terms of the uncommon

Common  Market  which the P.A.P. has  obtained  for

Singapore are not going to help our people  at  all.

Quite   to  the  contrary,  all  the  benefits   and

advantages  are going to be on the Federation  side.

Singapore will receive only the crumbs. The whole of

the  financial control is in Federation hands.  Even

the  issue of pioneer certificates will have  to  be

approved by the Federation Government. This is found

in the Annex to Annex J. In the event that Singapore

wishes  to  establish an industry that  can  compete

with  a similar existing industry in the Federation,

then the pioneer certificates issued



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Singapore Government will not be  approved.

Even if the industry is not yet established but  the

Federation  wishes to establish such an industry,  a

pioneer   certificate  issued   by   the   Singapore

Government will also not be approved. How then do we

hope to promote industrialisation in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Annex to Annex J, the Federation Government

has  powers to fix the rate of tax on the  value  of

goods for duty or for excise purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government has powers also to make

all  regulations in relation to Customs and  Excise.

The  Federation  Government,  in  fact,  has  direct

access  to all documents and records of the  Customs

and  Excise Department, and can issue directions  to

the  Singapore  Government to ensure collection  and

protection of Federation Customs duties and  Excise.

Thus,  Singapore is merely to be the  collector  and

office  boy of the Federation. So what is  all  this

talk  about  Common  Market  giving  the  people  of

Singapore  benefits? What we have  is  only  a  very

doubtful    advantage.   On   the   contrary,    the

disadvantages are certain and plain to see. We  have

repeatedly  told  the  P.A.P. that  without   equal

political  rights  the interests of  the  people  of

Singapore   cannot  be  adequately   protected   and

safeguarded. This bears out what we have  repeatedly

said, both inside and outside the House. So much for

the   Common  Market  which  is  going  to   deprive

Singapore  of  the  free port status  and  does  not

safeguard or protect her industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now briefly summarise the results of the

financial merger talks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. What was supposed to have been a lump payment

for  Federal services in Singapore in 1961  has  now

become   a   percentage  payment  for  Pan-Malaysian

services in 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. What was calculated by the P.A.P. Government as

payment  to  the  Federation  at  34  per  cent   of

Singapore's  national  revenue  has  now  become   a

payment of 40 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. What was originally a lump sum payment of only

$78  million  per  year  now  becomes  a  percentage

payment  amounting to $124 million  which  increases

year by year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The P.A.P. says that Singapore cannot afford to

give  a grant of S50 million, but finally the  Prime

Minister  gives  away a loan of $150 million,  - $100

million  of which is interest free. The $150 million

loan  is  worth more than the $50 million  grant  in

development value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) From the bold stand of "must collect and keep

and  pay", the Prime Minister now is willing  to  be

only  the  office  boy  or  rent-collector  of   the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The P.A.P. said categorically that the free

port  status after merger would remain. Now the free

port  status  will  remain and be confined  only  to

Blakang Mati after 12 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) With the free port status reduced to the size

of  Blakang  Mati, the free port trade in  Singapore

will  suffer  with  the  grave  danger  of  loss  of

employment, and increased cost of living  for  large

sections of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The Common Market terms are weighted entirely

on  the side of the Federation and will not promote,

safe-guard and protect Singapore industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The harmonisation of taxes will mean a rise in

price of consumer goods with a corresponding rise in

the cost of living for the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me come to the question of land and the 50

per cent labour that the P.A.P. Government brags  so

much about, and let us see what they really mean. In

addition to the payment to the Federation of 40  per

cent  of the national revenue of Singapore, and  the

loan  of  $150  million ($100 million  of  which  is

interest  free), the Singapore Government  has  also

agreed  to  pay  for  the  (lay-to-day  running  and

development of departments like Broadcasting,  T.V.,

and others. Clause 7 of Annex J -

Governments shall agree together on projects  to  be

covered  by  this  paragraph which  do  not  provide

predominantly local services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These include, inter alia, Airport development

scheme  and  the round-the-world Commonwealth  Cable

scheme all of which will involve a total expenditure

of more than $20 million.'



<br><br>Let  me  refer you to page 66, paragraph 4 of  Paper

it  out but it says that $20 million will have to be

paid  for  the  airport development scheme  and  the

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Document II of Paper Misc. 4 of

1963.  It  is  paragraph 7 on  page  12.  An  annual

expenditure of $240 million has rightly been  called

a  staggering increase - I use the correct  words,  I

think. It says here, "staggering increase". Not only

will  this wasteful expenditure on the armed forces,

as  stated here, eat into the surplus and reduce the

economic development, but it will also result in the

imposition  of increased taxes. This  is  the  extra

burden which the people of Singapore have been asked

to  pay. Malaysia is, therefore, only going to  mean

heavier expenditure on the armed forces. Such  armed

expansion  cannot benefit the people. It  will  only

profit the foreign monopoly capitalists and the arms

industries.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister and the

Minister for Finance went to London not to fight for

the  interests of the people of Singapore. They went

instead  to  sell out the rights of  the  people  of

Singapore.  There  is not a single  item  which  the

Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance have not

almost  completely  given away in  the  negotiations

with the Federation. Of course, the P.A.P. tries  to

cover  up this sell-out. On the one hand, it  denies

political opponents the right and freedom of  speech

and  assembly to expose them. On the other hand, the

Prime  Minister  uses  the  whole  State  propaganda

machinery to magnify out of all proportion the  sops

and the soothers he received from the United Kingdom

to  help  him  save  face for signing  the  sell-out

agreement in London.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we compare the ultimatum of the 22nd June, 1963,

from the Federation to the Singapore Government,  as

set  out in Document VIII in Paper Misc. 4 of  1963,

and   the  conditions  demanded  by  the  Federation

Government therein, with the final agreement as  set

out  in  Annex J signed in London, we will see  then

that  the Singapore Government has given in  to  all

the  conditions  and demands of the Federation,  and

more.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish! Substantiate that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> (1) The Common Market terms in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Document VIII. All Federal taxes

collected in Singapore are divided between  the  two

Governments  in  the  proportion  of  60  per   cent

Singapore and 40 per cent Federation. The revenue is

merely first paid into a separate fund. That is all.

Is  this again nonsense? The income tax attributable

to  the  Federation but collected  in  Singapore  is

handed in toto to the Federation Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is being done now. Do you

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is being done now. The yield

belongs to them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The income tax attributable to

Kingdom is divided 60 per cent Singapore and 40  per

cent  Federation. Is this nonsense and is also being

done now?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We are not in Malaysia yet.

Cannot you understand that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The provisions in clauses 5 and

6  of Annex J in common language, mean that, what is

the  Federation's  is  the Federation  and  what  is

Singapore's  is also the Federation's. This  is  the

philosophy of the P.A.P. It amounts to what is yours

is  mine,  and what is mine is also mine.  You  lose

everything.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You would give them 100 per cent

income tax in your complete merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> (4) The Singapore Government

also  pays  for  Federal  development  projects   in

Singapore  other than defence and internal security.

This is seen in clause 7 of Annex J.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Again according to the ultimatum, the demand of

the $50 million grant. This has now been changed  to

a  loan  of $150 million, $100 million of  which  is

interest  free.  That  is  the  only  item  in   the

Federation  ultimatum of June 22nd  which  has  been

changed. But as we have already explained, this $150

million loan in development is, in fact, worth  more

than  the  $50 million grant. This is confirmed  not

only  by  the World Bank but also by businessmen  in

Singapore,  and even by the Prime Minister  himself,

as I quoted a little while back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Provide for a review as laid down in clause 8

of  Annex  J. Nothing much there. It is exactly  the

same.  The  final  agreement is exactly  as  in  the

Federation ultimatum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we can see that although the P.A.P. put

up  a  sham  front before going to  London,  it  has

ultimately   surrendered  to  every   one   of   the

Federation's demands as set out in the ultimatum  of

22nd  June, 1963. Every one of them! In fact,  there

was no necessity for the P.A.P. team to go to London

at  all.  The  Prime Minister and the  Minister  for

Finance   might  just  as  well  have  remained   in

Singapore  and signed on the dotted line within  the

48  hours  stipulated  in the Federation  ultimatum.

They need not have wasted all our money. They should

not  have  used  the  people's  money  for  travels,

especially now that the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



pretends to express such concern for the welfare  of

the  people. But, of course, the Prime Minister  and

the  Minister for Finance have other plans in  mind.

The  stage had been set for the comedy and farce  of

turning  a glaring sell-out into a triumph,  and  an

out-and-out traitor into a so-called hero. The whole

Government propaganda machinery had been  geared  to

pave  the  way  for  crumbs from  the  table  to  be

magnified out of all proportion to wonderful  P.A.P.

cakes.  Let us see how the P.A.P. propaganda machine

works. On the 8th July, 1963 -

<pre>

 `Dear Prime Minister,

<br><br>Sir, I do not want to waste the time of the House by

reading  to you what are firstly, secondly, thirdly,

and  so on. Anybody can buy this Paper and read  the

eight  points  listed  by  the  Prime  Minister   of

Singapore.  The  only answer was a  six-line  letter

which,  in fact, says yes to (1), no to (2),  no  to

(3),  (4)   no, (5)  no, (6)  no, (7)  no, (8)   no,  and

lastly  no. This is a real slap in the face  of  the

P.A.P.,  a  real  slap  in the  face  of  the  Prime

Minister of Singapore. There is not even any mention

of  the other seven points. This only means that the

Federation  Prime  Minister has not  agreed  to  the

other  points  raised  by  the  Prime  Minister   of

Singapore  at  the last minute. The Federation  does

not give in so easily as the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister tries to play up on the 1,300 acres of land that he is supposed to have got back from the War Department of the U.K. Government. He wanted to create a picture of himself as a great anti-colonialist, a real anti-colonial hero. He said that he could have made Duncan Sandys kneel on his bended knees. That is what he said, "to get Duncan

Sandys  to kneel on his bended knees". He  does  not

realise - foolish man - that he was being made use  of

by  the  British  all  the  time.  But,  of  course,

everybody  knows  that the laugh is  on  the  P.A.P.

stooge. May I refer you,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to the letter of 8th July, 1963, from Duncan

Sandys  of the Colonial Office to the Prime Minister

of  Singapore?  I will summarise the letter.  Duncan

Sandys  clarified  the  situation  as  follows:  (1)

Blakang Mati will not be released until August 1966,

i.e. three years from now; not immediately but 1966,

and by that time I do not know what will happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> P.A.P. buried.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The P.A.P. will definitely be

buried, of course. This is Blakang Mati!



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Is the letter dated 8th

of July?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, 8th July, 1963.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Will the Member please give

the page number? Is it Paper Misc. 5?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is too long a letter for me

to  read. It is Paper Misc. 5 of 1963. The pages are

not  numbered, but starting from the cover it  would

be page 13.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> There are two letters dated

8th  July.  The  Member is referring to  the  second

letter of that date.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, that is corect. I have

already  summarised that letter. It  says  that  (1)

Blakang Mati will not be released until 1966,  which

is  three years from now. And (2)  land in the  Naval

Base  too  will not be released. The U.K. Government

would  only  have no objection to the  wish  of  the

Prime  Minister that the Crown land now occupied  by

the  British  Military Forces in  Malaya  under  the

Defence Agreement be covered by a 30-year lease at a

nominal rent of $1 per site. $1 per site, Mr Deputy

Speaker, and on a 30-year lease. From this alone  we

can see that the Prime Minister of Singapore has got

really  nothing  very much in this land  deal.  Long

before  the 30 years are out, the Naval Base  should

have been liquidated and the land handed back to the

people  of Singapore and Malaya. Similarly,  Blakang

Mati, which Singapore hopes to use as a free



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



zone  in  the  Common Market arrangements,  will  be

released only after 1966, a long time from now. What

happens to the Common Market before then? From  now,

that  is, from the 1st of September. 1963, to  1966,

where  is  the  "Free Zone" going to be?  In  P.A.P.

land? Then what of the other lands that Singapore is

supposed  to have got back from the United  Kingdom?

The  letter of 8th July from Duncan Sandys tells  us

that the land in Fort Canning will be handed over to

the  Government of Singapore if and when the British

Service authorities no longer need the area. "If and

when"  - and  that  too  only on  condition  that  an

alternative  site is provided for outside  the  City

area plus compensation at current value paid for the

buildings  therein. Where then are the 1,300  acres?

The   lands  that  can  be  made  available  without

condition to the Singapore Government are  sites  in

Changi  and Pulau Brani. The total area is only  176

acres.  The  large  areas  in  Sembawang  and  Pulau

Blakang  Mati will be made available only  on  fixed

conditions. Is this claim of the return of land  not

a sham?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can refer, Sir, to the annex of the letter

from   Duncan  Sandys  to  the  Prime  Minister   of

Singapore.  It is all stated very clearly  here.  So

why  is  the  P.A.P. trying to bluff the  people  of

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. claims that it has obtained from the

U.K.  Government $10 million as payment for  illegal

occupation  of Singapore land. But let us  be  clear

what  the  money has been given for. It is  not  for

rent  or compensation for the land occupied  by  the

military forces. Any rent payable is only a  nominal

rent  of  $1  per site. Mr Deputy Speaker,  $1  per

site.  That is very cheap. Of course, as I say,  the

P.A.P. can  only be tough and can only  take  tough

action against people who have no guns, no arms,  to

fight  back. But when it is a matter of the  British

Government,  the  P.A.P. shrink  themselves  into  a

shell.  They dare not fight. They talk tough to  the

people.   Why   not  talk  tough  to   the   British

Government?  Instead  they  kneel  down  before  the

British Government. But they want to tell the people

of Singapore that they got Duncan Sandys on bended
