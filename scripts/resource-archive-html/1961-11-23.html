<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on Amendment

[21st  November,  1961]  to  Question  [20th  November,

1961].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, whereas it has always been the avowed

objective of all nationalists of Malaya to achieve  the

reunification  of  Singapore  with  the  Federation  of

Malaya and to remove the artificial division created by

the  British by their policy of "divide and rule", this

House affirms and declares that the first objective  of

all   true  patriots  of  Malaya  is  to  achieve   the

reunification of these two territories in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



merger  of  Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.".-

(The Minister for Labour-Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim).



<br><br>Which Amendment was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To leave out from "a" in the second last line to the

end and insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation  as  the

twelfth  state  and with all its Citizens automatically

becoming  Federal Citizens on Merger Day".'-(Dr  Lee

Siew Choh).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to

be left out, be left out."



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  said  yesterday  that  it  would  be

relevant  to  the merger issue to find out (a)  exactly

when  the  Barisan  Sosialis decided  that  the  P.A.P.

merger  plan on the basis of autonomy in education  and

labour should be branded as phoney and a sell-out;  and

(b)  when the puppet masters who manipulate the Barisan

Sosialis decided on the new line of full merger on  the

basic  of  automatic Federal citizenship for  Singapore

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you recollect, Sir, I quoted a letter from Mr Lim

Ching  Siong,  dated 24th June, in which  he  indicated

that merger should not involve a setback for the people

not only in terms of freedom and democracy but also  as

regards  autonomy in labour and education. He  did  not

then  (i.e., 24th June) brand the P.A.P.'s  demand  for

merger on the basis of autonomy in labour and education

as phoney or a sell-out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as we can determine, Sir, the constitutional

stand  of  the  Barisan Sosialis leaders  in  June  was

internal self-government, not merger, because they then

believed,  presumably on the basis of consultation  and

clarification with the U.K. Commission, that the P.A.P.

type   of  merger  would  not  be  acceptable  to   the

Federation  and that, therefore, the P.A.P. would  have

no   choice  but  to  fight  for  full  internal  self-government and the abolition of the I.S.C.,  which  are

the  aims  not only of the Barisan Sosialis, but  as  I

shall   show  later,  of  the  M.C.P.  That   was   the

constitutional  stand of the Barisan Sosialis  in  June

and July.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However on 25th August, the Singapore and Federation

Governments issued a joint statement agreeing to merger

on  the basis of autonomy in education and labour.  The

Barisan  Sosialis prophets and Brains Trust  discovered

that  they had miscalculated - and not for the first time

either.   They   had   miscalculated   in   taking   an

uncompromising stand on the basis of fighting for  full

internal self-government. What they believed improbable

and impossible had happened. Therefore, as I have said,

Sir,  there  was  a  state of befuddlement,  which  was

exemplified,   as   I  indicated  yesterday,   in   the

"Declaration  of meeting of convenors  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis",  dated 3rd September. Things  had  moved  so

fast  that they were not quite sure what was happening.

They  knew there was a race on, but they did  not  know

who  were  in the race or what the race was all  about.

Therefore,  in the declaration under the heading,  "Our

stand on the constitutional future", they decided  that

the safest thing under the circumstances was to back as

many  horses  as possible. So, Sir, under the  heading,

"Our  stand on the constitutional future" they declared

that the way ahead, therefore, for a real reunification

of  our  people  and of our country is in  one  of  two

directions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) immediate full and complete merger with

Singapore  joining  the  Federation  as  a  constituent

State, like Penang or Malacca;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) as an autonomous unit within a confederation with

the Borneo territories coming in when possible."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in June the Barisan Sosialis was not yet formed,

but  it  was  already  a twinkle in  the  eyes  of  its

parents.  In June, Sir, it was internal self-government

minus  the I.S.C. - a negation of merger. But  after  it

became obvious that merger on the basis of autonomy  in

labour and education was possible, the gentlemen of the

Barisan Sosialis did a triple somersault and fell  fiat

on their faces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if they had stopped short of what they suggested

was  one  of two courses - immediate, full and  complete

merger  with  Singapore joining  the  Federation  as  a

constituent State like Penang and Malacca: or (it  does

not  matter  what it is) an autonomous  unit  within  a

confederation  with  the Borneo territories  coming  in

when possible - then we,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



however  much we might have disagreed with the  Barisan

Sosialis, would never have called into question whether

they are for or against merger. We would have said that

at  least,  however badly they miscalculated when  they

left the P.A.P., they did not miscalculate the trend of

political  events  in Singapore. But, Sir,  immediately

after  all  these professions of enthusiasm for  merger

and  confederation, they go on, in the  last  paragraph

entitled "Conclusion", - after a long rigmarole, we  are

now  presented with the "Conclusion". Having said  that

there  are two courses for Singapore - complete  merger,

or  confederation, they conclude - nothing. I think this

is a classic example of how the thinking of the leaders

of  the Barisan Sosialis differs from ordinary mortals.

Having  said that there are two courses open - complete

merger  or  confederation, they conclude,  and  I  will

read, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The immediate task, therefore, is to acquire the

right  of  self-determination and achieve full internal

self-government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the conclusion. The logic is this. The way

ahead  is in one of two directions - complete merger  on

the  basis  of  Penang and Malacca,  or  confederation.

Therefore, we conclude that the Barisan Sosialis should

fight  for  internal self-government.  Full  merger  is

good;  confederation is good; therefore, let  us  fight

not for merger or confederation, but for internal self-government  and  the  abolition  of  the  I.S.C.  This,

perhaps  the  Members  of  the Barisan  Sosialis  would

claim,  is the logic higher dialectical materialism,  a

classic example of progress -

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Yes, Sir. I think the Minister

there are three courses.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If there is any quotation of a

document out of context, then all the hon. Member  need

say  is  that  there is a quotation out of context  and

indicate  how  it is out of context. The Minister  will

then be asked to read



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



the whole paragraph or any other paragraph indicated by

the Member. He is now entering into a debate which,  of

course,  he  will have the opportunity to  do  when  he

speaks.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister's

contention  is  that the first is good, the  second  is

good,  but  let  us  fight for the  third.  That  is  a

misrepresentation of that Conclusion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the Member alleging that the

quotations  are out of context and so have a  different

meaning?  If  he  alleges that, then will  he  indicate

which paragraphs he requires the Minister to read?  The

Member is now entering into a debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I will just ask the Minister for

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Minister please let me

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The "Conclusion" reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The immediate task, therefore, is to acquire the

right  of  self-determination and achieve full internal

the  unity  of  our  people. As a  Left-Wing  political

Party,  we  must join hands with all genuine  Left-Wing

forces.  Only  this way can we satisfy  the  legitimate

expectations of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward with the Barisan Sosialis - Merdeka!'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, as far as I can gather - and as

any  reasonable man can gather - the logic is that there

is  one of two ways: merger or confederation, and  that

therefore  the immediate task is to fight for something

which is opposite of the two, and that is full internal

self-government. This is very much like the  young  and

nervous  lawyer who concluded his speech  to  the  jury

with   the  words,  "Gentlemen,  these  then  are   the

conclusions on which I base my facts." The  Member  for

Queenstown took 7½ hours to tell us the conclusions on

which  he based his facts. We discovered that  when  he

concluded his speech on Tuesday. After saying  that  he

was  for  merger and that he was prepared to sacrificed

not  only Mr Lim Ching Siong but possibly also the  12

or  13  other anxious Members in this Assembly  in  the

cause  of merger, he said. "But if all this fails, let

us  fight  for full internal self-government minus  the

Internal Security Council." So far as we can determine.

on 3rd September, the stands of the Barisan Sosialis on

the  constitutional future were complete merger on  the

basis  of  Penang and Malacca, confederation, and  full

internal  self-government minus  the  I.S.C.  Like  the

Scarlet   Pimpernel, they  were   here,   there   and

everywhere.  They were animal, vegetable  and  mineral.

They  were  atheists, monotheists and pantheists.  They

could  not possibly go wrong - so they thought. The  ways

of mice and men!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st September, one of their stands collapsed. It

had  to be abandoned. This was their stand on full  and

complete merger on the basis of Penang and Malacca. The

tragedy - if I may so call it - occurred in the course  of

a radio



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



forum    in    which   the   Member   for   Queenstown

participated - together with the Member for  Farrer  Park

and.  I  believe,  the Member for Hong Lim - prompted.  I

have no doubt, more by valour than discretion. There he

discovered  to his horror that merger on the  basis  of

Penang  and  Malacca would have meant that  only  about

half   of   Singapore's  citizens  would  automatically

qualify for Federal citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, I understand that the Member for

Queenstown  has developed a kind of phobia about  radio

forums. Perhaps it is not the Member for Queenstown  so

much  as  his  colleagues who sweat at the  thought  of

having to let him loose at radio forums.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after this disastrous radio encounter, the

demand  for  full and complete merger on the  basis  of

Penang  and Malacca - I repeat on the basis  of  Penang

and  Malacca - was quietly dropped but was  heard  all

around. Everybody knew. Just as the late Mr Stalin was

disinterred  and  buried outside  the  grounds  of  the

Kremlin, so did this Party pillar vanish from the  hymn

book  of  the Barisan Sosialis. Since then, the Barisan

Sosialis  choir  has rearranged the  merger  music.  We

hear, Sir, more and more about something called Article

22 and, of course, automatic Federal citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a rendering of this new choral arrangement

from the robust throat of the Member for Queenstown for

the best part of 7½ hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So today the new tune, the new line is automatic

Federal  citizenship for all Singapore citizens.  As  I

explained  yesterday,  Sir, this demand  for  automatic

Federal  citizenship is being put forward  not  with  a

view to enhancing the prospects for merger, but to make

sure  that merger does not come about, so that we would

be  forced to adopt the true and only objective of  the

real  leaders of the Barisan Sosialis - a self-governing

Singapore minus the I.S.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Barisan Sosialis leaders are genuinely

determined  to achieve merger, then let them repudiate,

without  any qualification, their objective of internal

self-government for Singapore, because  internal  self-government  is a complete negation of the objective  of

merger. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



they are really for merger, if they claim that they are

interested in the reunification of the two territories,

and  if  they claim that they are in the mainstream  of

Malayan  nationalism, then let them say  that  internal

self-government  is  not  their  objective  under   any

circumstances. If they are prepared to do that, then on

this  side  of  the  House, many people, many  Malayan

nationalists  will not taunt them by saying  that  they

are not sincere when they ask for merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the Barisan Sosialis should really

stick  to  section 5 of the declaration  that  the  way

ahead  for  a  real  reunification of  our  people  and

territories  is  in  one of two directions-full  merger

with  Singapore joining the Federation as a constituent

State  or  a  Confederation. Let them put  forward  two

choices  both  of which would lead to merger,  but  not

three.  Therefore, I propose that the three points  the

Barisan Sosialis should consider are - merger as outlined

in  the White Paper proposals; merger as put forward by

them on the basis of automatic Federal citizenship; and

repudiation of full internal self-government  with  the

T.S.C. abolished. Then the choice will be not  between

merger  and no merger, but between different  kinds  of

merger. That is the true choice. That is the choice  of

anyone  who claims to be a Malayan nationalist and  who

claims to be interested in the reunification of the two

territories.  Scrap  this constant demand  which  boils

down to this: let us have full internal self-government

minus  the I.S.C. In fact, that is a choice which every

Socialist  and  nationalist repudiates  as  unbecoming.

dangerous and anti-nationalistic. Let us therefore  put

forward  the  two  choices  to  the  people  for  their

consideration: merger as outlined in the White Paper -

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - or merger as demanded by the Barisan

Sosialis with automatic Federal citizenship for all. If

that  is the choice - we for our own part believe that

our  proposals will be acceptable to the Federation and

to  the  people  of  Singapore - if the Barisan  Sosialis

believe, as they say, that it is a phoney merger,  well

and good. [Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Let them put forward their proposal

of merger on the basis of automatic Federal citizenship

with no rider, that "If we cannot get merger, then  let

us go back to full internal self-government." Everytime

they say that, they are giving the game away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said yesterday, Sir, there is nothing wrong in

principle  in the Barisan Sosialis asking for automatic

Federal  citizenship, or for more seats in the  Federal

Legislature,  or  for any other conditions  which  they

think  are  favourable and acceptable to the people  of

Singapore, provided these demands are not made  on  the

assumption  that  if  these are not  acceded  to,  then

merger  should be scrapped and we should revert to  the

demand  for  full  internal self-government  minus  the

I.S.C.  By all means let the Barisan Sosialis  ask  for

better  terms for Singapore than are contained  in  the

White  Paper,  for we admit that the proposals  in  the

White  Paper are the result of a lot of give  and  take

between  Singapore  and II other  States.  The  Barisan

Sosialis -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Secret deal!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, talking about secret deals, we

say  publicly without any fear what we think. But  lots

of  gentlemen on the other side vanish round about  tea

time  or  dinner  time; lots of  gentlemen  go  into  a

huddle.  They  even have to appoint I believe  what  is

known  as  "Keeper of the Privy Script". One  gentleman

speaks  and  the other gentleman keeps on  feeding  him

with  scripts. I am using the word "privy". Sir,  in  a

parliamentary sense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by all means let the Barisan Sosialis ask for

conditions  which they think would be more  favourable.

As  I  said,  Sir,  we  concede that  the  White  Paper

proposals  are  the result of a lot of  give  and  take

between  Singapore and 11 other States which constitute

the  Federation. And no doubt the Barisan Sosialis  may

feel  that  we should have given less and  taken  more,

just  as no doubt the Federation feel that they  should

have  taken  more  and given less.  But  what  we  will

resist,  and all Malayan nationalists must  resist,  is

the proposition that if we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



cannot  get merger on the terms demanded by the Barisan

Sosialis,  then  we will fight for full internal  self-government minus the I.S.C.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You don't like freedom, huh!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Interjections are all very well

if  they  are  short  and  not too  frequent.  But  the

interjections coming from the Opposition  Benches,  the

Barisan Sosialis section, are becoming too frequent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In other words, Sir, there is a world

of  difference between putting forward demands  with  a

view  to getting the best possible terms for Singapore,

and  putting forward demands with a view to  sabotaging

merger   and   presenting  us   with   the   disastrous

alternative of a self-governing Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to judge by the speech made by the Member for

Queenstown on Tuesday, the Barisan Sosialis  appear  to

he determined that Singapore should not take the course

of  merger  but  the course o complete  internal  self-government.  For example, Sir, it was reported  in  the

Straits  Times of 22nd November, 1961, that the  Member

for  Queenstown  after a long and passionate  plea  for

merger and after shedding a lot of tears about how  the

two peoples are separated and how our blood brothers in

the  Federation have been inhumanly kept apart  h3  the

British  colonialists - we shall  come  to  the  Barisan

colonialists  later, but, anyway, for  the  time  being

British colonialists - said [22nd November]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"We must therefore reject the merger proposals. But

it'   it   is   possible  for  Singapore  to   form   a

confederation of Malaysia as an autonomous  unit,  then

we shall welcome this advance...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If none of these ways are open to us..."'

<br><br>and  I can assure you, Sir, that lots of gentlemen are

working  overtime to see that none of  these  ways  are

available -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"...then we should, in the discharge of our

constitutional obligations, go to London in  1963  when

the  demand  should  he  for  complete  internal  self-government."'.



<br><br>So,  Sir, there we have it. After 7½ hours of  oration

and consultation, the Barisan Sosialis have reached the

pre-determined  conclusions  on  which  it  based  its

arguments - that if we cannot get merger,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



then  let us reject the White Paper proposals;  let  us

reject  the P.A.P. proposals for merger and bet  us  go

back to internal self-government minus the I.S.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown spent practically all

his  7½ hours telling how terrible things would be for

Singaporeans. Singaporeans, he said, would  be  second-class  citizens. There would be apartheid. Singaporeans

would be treated like social outcastes, not fit and not

allowed  to  mix  with our brothers in the  Federation.

Singaporeans,   he   said,  would   he   treated   like

illegitimate citizens. Singaporeans would be treated as

though   they  were  suffering  from  some   infectious

disease.  And  all  these, Sir, come  from  people  who

believe  in merger! They were saying that merger  is  a

wonderful  thing, but if a P.A.P. type of merger  comes

about,  then there would be apartheid, and Singaporeans

would be treated like social outcastes, not fit to  mix

with their brothers in the Federation, and treated like

somebody suffering from an infectious disease. This  is

the  propaganda  of men who want to sell  the  idea  of

merger. We know, Sir, that it is just the opposite, and

that this fits in with our thesis - that they dread  and

are terrified of merger; not them but their mentors are

terrified  of merger. It is like those matchmakers  who

go  around  and, if they do not want someone  to  marry

someone  else, they say. "Yes, we are not in a position

to  get a very good girl. You know she has false teeth,

a  glass  eye  and  she is wearing a  wig!"  They  say.

"Terrible,  you  know, but it is  a  very  good  thing.

Singaporeans would be treated like outcastes. You would

be  treated  like  somebody who has got  an  infectious

disease. Out with merger! Forward with the Barisan!"



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is your phoney merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I have read and re-read what was

published  in  the Straits Times, but I have  not  been

able  to  acquire  a full, voluminous  version  of  his

script  obviously composed by many hands. All  I  could

gather  was  that  he spent 7½ hours telling  us  that

Singaporeans  would be treated like social  out-castes,

illegitimate citizens, people with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



an  infectious disease. But he did not produce one iota

of  fact or evidence to substantiate in what way  under

the White Paper proposals would Singaporeans be treated

as   outcastes,  as  people  ridden  with  disease,  as

illegitimate  children, and so on. He did  not  produce

one single -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir, I am always willing to be

clarified.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I ask the Minister if that is

the  reason why no mention was ever made of citizenship

over Radio Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Minister understand that for

clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No. Sir, there is no reason to

clarify  that,  because I do not know  whether  he  had

tried  to  compress  into 10 or 15  minutes,  something

which  took  even  him  7½ hours  to  recite  in  this

Assembly.  If certain things were left out, perhaps  we

have  been merciful to the Member for Queenstown.  Sir,

he  did not produce a single argument. In what way  are

we  "outcastes"? Is there anything in the  White  Paper

proposals to suggest that we are going to be treated as

illegitimate children? When merger comes, if the Member

for  Queenstown  should  go to the  Federation,  is  it

likely that his status would be questioned? Would  they

ask  him, "Legitimate or illegitimate?" Sir, he did not

produce  a single bit of evidence to justify his  claim

that  merger under the White Paper proposals  presented

us  with  this terrifying aspect. But the only argument

was  that  under  the White Paper proposals,  Singapore

citizens  cannot  vote or stand  for  election  in  the

Federation.  Therefore. Singaporeans are  illegitimate.

That is the argument, Sir - the Member for Queenstown

cannot  stand  for  election in the Federation  and  it

follows  logically that Singaporeans are  illegitimate:

Singaporeans are disease-ridden.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Sir, if the fact that Singapore citizens

cannot  stand  for  election in  the  Federation  makes

Singapore  citizens outcastes, make  them  second-class

citizens,   then  on  the  same  argument,   Federation

citizens also are outcastes, and second-class citizens.

Therefore,  what  are  the  grounds  that  the  Barisan

Sosialis have for saying that the White Paper proposals

discriminate against the people of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me at this juncture remind Members of the

Barisan  Sosialis that this battle-cry of  second-class

citizens  was  also  raised by certain  people  in  the

Federation  when  the  Federation  was  struggling  for

independence. The same cry was raised. "Let  us  resist

this  new  Constitution granting  independence  to  the

Federation  because  lots of people  are  going  to  be

second-class  citizens." And since the Members  of  the

Barisan Sosialis claim to be on the side of history, to

live with history, to sleep with history, they would do

well  to ponder over the fact that all the hue and  cry

over second-class citizens failed to halt the advent of

Merdeka  in  the Federation. Today not even the  P.P.P.

leaders  find it profitable to revive the  question  of

second-class citizenship, simply because there was very

little  to this cry. So the Barisan Sosialis, who  are

never  original (you can see. Sir, that they even  have

the  same colours as the Party that they left; in fact,

they  have a circle for their symbol but they have  not

quite dared to complete it, so they put a star in)  are

merely repeating the tactics (well, there is no harm in

repeating tactics) which were unsuccessfully  tried  in

the  Federation  in  the hope of halting  independence.

Today  the  Barisan  Sosialis  are  also  committed  to

halting  independence through merger for Singapore.  So

like  the gentlemen who failed in the Federation,  they

too  are  raising  a  hue  and cry  about  second-class

citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the course of his speech on Tuesday, the

Member  for Queenstown tried to create fears and doubts

about   merger   in   the  minds  of  civil   servants,

contractors,  students, businessmen and bus  companies.

This he did, not by saying in what way these categories

of people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



would  suffer under the citizenship proposals contained

in  the  White Paper, but by simply asking a number  of

questions  and  hoping to leave behind  the  impression

that  all  these  people would suffer under  the  White

Paper  merger proposals. For example, in the speech  he

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would not this segregation and isolation of the

people  of  Singapore from the people of the Federation

lead to a further widening of differences that existed?



<br><br>He  did  not  say  that  it would.  But  he  asked  the

question. He did not reply. He did not say, "Yes,  that

would be so." Then he asked,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What would the civil servants gain with merger?'



<br><br>Again a question. No reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would they get more opportunities for promotion in a

wider  service under the same terms existing, or  under

better terms?'



<br><br>Again a question. No answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would bus companies be allowed to operate freely on

new routes in the Federation?'



<br><br>Question - no answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would they be treated equally with others?'



<br><br>Question - no answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would contractors get the same opportunities for

business in the Federation as in Singapore?'



<br><br>Question - no answer. And  he  went on in a similar vein dragging in workers,

businessmen, Nanyang University students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, since he has asked questions -



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Answer them!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> May I ask the Barisan Sosialis what

would  be  the  prospects  for  all  these  people   if

Singapore  accepted the Barisan Sosialis' objective  of

full  internal self-government for Singapore? Would  it

obviate  segregation and isolation  of  the  people  of

Singapore  from  the  people of the  Federation?  Would

civil  servants  be able to get more opportunities  for

promotion  in Federal civil service if we had  internal

self-government?  Would  bus companies  he  allowed  to

operate  a  new route in the Federation if  we  got  an

internally  self-governing Singapore? Would contractors

get opportunities in the Federation if we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



have  full internal self-government for Singapore? Sir,

it  is quite clear what the whole purpose of that  long

series of unanswered questions is. Let me say this - the

Member  for Havelock asked. "Would you please  answer?"

All right. Let me answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have full internal self-government as demanded

by  the Barisan Sosialis (and that actually is the real

objective  of the Barisan Sosialis), the prospects  are

open  for  bitter  economic  rivalry  between  the  two

territories.  Singapore  businessmen,  Singapore  civil

servants, and contractors would not be able to  survive

economically in Singapore, let alone in the Federation.

That  is  the logical outcome of the Barisan  Sosialis'

rhetorical  questions - what will happen  to  this?  What

will  happen to that? But we know what will  happen  to

the  Barisan Sosialis if there is full merger. That  is

the  question to which they themselves do not know  the

answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in any case, let me point out that at the

present  moment Singapore businessmen  can  and  do  do

business   in   the   Federation.   So   do   Singapore

contractors.  In  so  far as there  is  preference  for

Federal  citizens in the matter of Government  jobs  or

contracts, may I point out that in Singapore too  there

is  priority  for Singapore citizens in the  matter  of

certain types of Government jobs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, under the Barisan Sosialis' type of

complete  merger,  I  can provide the  answers  to  the

questions   that  the  Member  for  Queenstown   asked.

Singapore's civil servants definitely will suffer -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - because they will have to accept

the 4: 1 ratio that now obtains in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> So too under the Barisan Sosialis

type   of  merger  they  must  accept  the  policy   of

preferential  treatment for Malays in certain  economic

fields.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Member for Queenstown has really done

without  wanting  to, is to support  the  White  Paper

proposals under which some of the Federation's policies

in  regard to admission into the civil service and  the

granting of contracts would not apply in Singapore when

it becomes a part of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when all is said and done, is the Member for

Queens  town  seriously suggesting that  full  internal

self-government  would wipe out  different  classes  of

citizenship  and  prevent the widening  of  differences

between the two territories?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson occasionally whispers, which

somewhat  drifts across to this side of the  floor.  He

said,  "Yes." And I am certainly very glad to hear  how

the   establishment  of  an  internally  self-governing

Singapore  - if he will listen  to  my  argument.

perhaps he will reconsider his interjection. We contend

that  to fight for internal self-government is but  the

thin end of the wedge -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged to the Minister. I

would   a   complete   merger   prevent   the   growing

He  said  "would  a  complete  merger", not  "would  a

Singapore  with  internal security".  That  is  what  I

suggest too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, perhaps I was not myself. It was

a  slip  of  the  tongue. What I meant  was,  would  an

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the point of order is not

well taken, because we are now talking about merger  as

against  genuine merger, and what is really behind  the

amendment.  I  think all Members have  spoken  in  that

strain.  I  have,  I  admit,  tried  to  draw  a   line

somewhere, although the line is very difficult to  draw

sometimes. Mr Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, I can quite well

understand the anxiety of the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another criticism of the White Paper proposals

is  that  its  citizenship  provisions  deny  Singapore

politicians  the opportunity of shaping the  course  of

national politics. There is this obsession on the  part

of  the  Member for Queenstown and his Barisan Sosialis

colleagues then .somehow they are men of destiny by the

men  whom the regard as God, to lead the people of  the

Federation  into the Promised Land. Somehow  they  feel

that  they  are the saviours. This is an  obsession,  I

think,  which  is well worth studying  by  students  of

psychology. In fact, the Member for Queenstown harped a

great  deal on this aspect of the matter: that  somehow

Singapore  politicians must save  the  natives  in  the

Federation;   that   without  their   guidance, their

benevolent influence, the people of the Federation  are

doomed to relapse into the dark ages. He harped  on  it

for  so long that I got the distinct impression  - and  I

only  meant that it was only an impression - that  there

were  a  lot  of  10-carat Messiahs  dissatisfied  with

having  to operate within the confines of the Singapore

parish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we of the P.A.P. are sometimes accommodating and

we  have  been  considerate enough in the  White  Paper

proposals  to provide opportunities for Messiahs  whose

egos are too big to find expression within the confines

of  a  small  island.  Under our  proposals.  Singapore

politicians  can  help to shape national  politics  and

policies through the 15 seats



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



allotted to us in the Federal Legislature. However, may

I  remind  the Barisan Sosialis Messiahs,  the  men  of

destiny, that there are Messiahs too in the Federation

who  may  not  feel  well  disposed  towards  Singapore

Messiahs with the propensity for a seven-hour sermon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Seven and a half!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In any case, Sir, the attempt by the

Barisan  Sosialis  to  prove  t1lat  Singapore  is  not

getting a chance to shape national politics, because it

has  15  instead  of  25  or 30 seats  in  the  Federal

Legislature, is again based on a fallacy.  Policies  in

the   Federal  Parliament,  or  for  that  matter   any

Parliament, are 1101 decided on a territorial  line-up.

It  is  not  a question of 15 Singapore representatives

ganging up against Penang and Pahang representatives on

any issue. Voting on any issue will be on the basis  of

concord   between   groups  and  individuals   in   the

legislature.  The  15 representatives  from  Singapore,

(and  I have no need to remind you of that, Sir,)  will

not  he more solid on any issue than the delegates from

other  States.  For example. Sir, if we  were  debating

this  merger  issue  in  the Federal  Legislature  with

representatives  from Singapore, the chances  are  that

the  Barisan  Sosialis representatives, ii  there  were

any, would line up with the P.M.I.P. and the P.P.P. in

rejecting merger -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> A clear case of different minds

thinking alike. So the shaping of national policies  is

not  primarily  dependent on how many  seats  Singapore

has,  or Penang has, or Kedah has. National issues are,

in   the   final  analysis,  decided  by  the   Federal

Legislature as a whole. If there are like-minded people

in  the Federation, then the Barisan Sosialis can  line

up  with  their counterparts in the Federation  on  any

issue.  It  is not necessary, say, for the  Member  for

Thomson  to  stand for election in Ipoh to espouse  the

anti-merger  cause. I am sure there will be individuals

in  lpoh  who  think along lines that  the  Member  for

Thomson  thinks. The only difficulty, Sir, I admit,  is

to get him elected.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Get whom elected?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> After all, Sir, the Member for

Thomson was elected on the P.A.P. ticket, and though we

are  told  that  the  people  are  behind  the  Barisan

Sosialis not one of the former P.A.P. members has dared

to  put this unproved theory to the test yet. As far as

I  can  see,  Sir, the Barisan Sosialis' constitutional

stand  is that if we cannot get merger on their  terms,

then  we should go back to the original proposition  of

fighting  for internal self-government. Let  us  accept

this proposition for the sake of argument and find  out

exactly what would be the result of all this. Sir,  the

Barisan  Sosialis  reject  the  White  Paper  proposals

because   they  confer  on  Singaporeans  a   Singapore

citizenship and a Federal nationality. These, they say,

are  extremely humiliating. It reduces Singaporeans  to

lepers, to outcaste. This is the status of inferiority.

That is their contention. All right. What would be  the

status  of  Singaporeans  under  full  internal   self-government? They would still be Singapore citizens. But

instead  of  being  Federal nationals,  they  would  be

British nationals -



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

British subjects.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - or British subjects. So here we

have   the  great  anti-colonialists  of  the   Barisan

Sosialis  put in a position of saying that  they  would

rather  Singapore  citizens be British  nationals  than

Federation nationals. They would rather be subjects  of

an   alien   colonial  power  than  nationals   of   an

independent Federation. That is the position  to  which

the logic of internal self-government reduces the great

anti-colonialists.  They  are  ashamed  and  feel  like

social  outcastes, because, "There you are, we will  be

Singapore  citizens  with  a  Federation  nationality."

Therefore, as great anti-colonialists, mind  you,  they

are  going  to  fight  for the status  of  a  Singapore

citizen carrying a British passport and saying, "I am a

British   subject."  That,  Sir,  is  the   irrefutable

humiliating  logic to which the great anti-colonialists

of the Barisan Sosialis are reduced.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, under our proposals, foreign affairs and

defence would be in the hands of the Federal Parliament

in  which  we would have representation and, therefore,

would  play  some part in shaping defence  and  foreign

policy.  But the great anti-colonialists of the Barisan

Sosialis   would   rather  fight  for  internal   self-government so that foreign affairs and defence  can  be

in British hands in the shaping of which they will have

no  say.  We  of  the P.A.P. have not quite  heard  the

Member for Havelock say that we are playing the British

game.  Here,  Sir, you have the logic of full  internal

self-government. In rejecting merger and  posing  self-government   as  the  alternative, the   great   anti-colonialists of the Barisan Sosialis find themselves in

the  ludicrous and humiliating position  of  having  to

admit publicly - that is, not yet but soon they will have

to  - that they would rather be British nationals  than

Federation  nationals;  that  they  would  rather  have

British  control over our foreign affairs  and  defence

than  that  of  the Federation, their  blood  brothers,

their  kith  and  kin, for whom they  feel  such  great

concern.  Here  then  is the logic  of  internal  self-government.  Sir,  you can imagine  the  laughter  that

would  resound  in anti-colonial Asia and  Africa  when

they  learn  that  in  Singapore we  have  great  anti-colonialists   who   prefer  British   nationality   to

Federation nationality, who are fighting to ensure that

the  control of foreign policy and defence  remains  in

British hands rather than be transferred to the Federal

Parliament in which Singaporeans would be represented -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes. I was just wondering where the

Minister for Culture got that bit that he ended up

with, by saying that we would rather prefer -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is obviously not a point of order.

It is an argument.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I would rather the Minister quote the

portions that he is referring to, because the way he

is going about it, he gives a distorted picture of

the views expressed by the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Surely it is an argument. I do not know

whether the Minister is quoting from a hook or a

speech out of notes of his own. Mr Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, these are inferences which I

draw from the logic of what would happen if we followed

the policy of internal self-government. Let me say here

that there will be a time when the gentlemen concerned

would be forced as anti-colonialists to say publicly - and I shall be glad to wait for that day - "We will be

British nationals or work towards a situation where we

will continue to be British nationals rather than

Federation nationals." That day will come, Sir, as many

things have come to pass which the Members of the

Barisan Sosialis did not expect. Anyway, I am just

trying to save the few anti-colonialists who are still

left in the Barisan Sosialis. To follow the policy they

advocate of full internal self-government, the logic of

events must inevitably lead them - as it has already led

them, as their speeches have indicated; the Member for

Queenstown spent a great deal of time yesterday and the

day before saying that we were going to be social

outcastes and lepers - to Singapore citizenship with British nationality;

that Singapore citizens prefer that defence and foreign

affairs should be run by the British without Singapore

citizens having a say in determining foreign policy and

defence. But under our proposals which they regard as

phoney and which they say are terrible, at least we

become Federal nationals, the same as our brothers in

the Federation. We have a say in determining defence

and foreign policy. Sir, that then is the position to

which they must inevitably drift. They will have to put

themselves in the humiliating position of appearing, in

the eyes of anti-colonial Asia and Africa, to fight for

a situation where they will have to ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



that they would rather that the people of Singapore

continue to the British subjects and Singapore

citizens, than be Singapore citizens, and Federation

nationals. I can imagine, Sir, Lumumba, Lenin, Marx and

Stalin turning in disgust in their graves.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b>

Stalin has got no grave now!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the Barisan Sosialis leaders are

in this humiliating predicament of having to get cover

behind the British, just as it became necessary for

them, at a critical phase in recent months, to run to

the U.K. Commission for consultation and clarification -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We never go there!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Simply because they are holding on to

an untenable and illogical position in resisting

merger. To put it more bluntly, Sir, the real and only

objective of the M.C.P. is to secure the abolition of

the Internal Security Council so that Singapore can be

converted into a base for Communist operations in this

part of the world. Merger frustrates this plan. Merger

denies them this opportunity. Therefore, merger must be

resisted, but without giving the appearance of

resisting merger, and this is not an easy thing to do,

simply because the motive force behind merger is the

powerful and irresistible force of Malayan nationalism,

and by an unhappy combination of circumstances in

Malaya, the M.C.P. has been put in the position of

having to combat not colonialism, but the force of

Malayan nationalism. We do not know, Sir, whether this

is the decision of the top brains of the M.C.P. or only

of its sergeant-majors, but whoever made this decision,

the fact remains that the Barisan Sosialis have been

manoeuvred into an untenable position of having to

resist the irrestible force of Malayan nationalism. It

may be that many Members of the Barisan Sosialis may

not he aware of this. But two facts should make it

clear to most of them, that in embarking on a trail of

strength with the force of Malayan nationalism, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



have  chosen the wrong opponent. The first fact is that

though  the  real leaders of the Barisan Sosialis  have

made  every  effort  since June to stop  the  drift  to

merger,  they have failed. Let them ponder  over  that.

They  have  used  every device from betrayal  of  their

comrades to attempts to capture the government and  yet

they have failed. Let them ponder over this. Why?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Federation, the M.C.P. thought they could

capture the place. They came quite close to it, but the

day   that   the   British   granted   the   Federation

independence,  the  M.C.P. leaders  became  wise.  The

M.C.P. decided  that  they were taking  on  the  wrong

enemy -  Malayan nationalism - and so for the  time  being

they abandoned the terrorist war. They knew that anyone

who  fights  the force of Malayan nationalism  must  be

crushed.  The  colonialists discovered it.  The  M.C.P.

leaders  discovered it. There were a lot of  people  at

that  time  who said that it was a phoney  independence

and  that  Tunku  Abdul Rahman  was  a  stooge  of  the

British. But do you remember, Sir, the question put  by

the  Tunku to Chin Peng, "Do you regard me as a British

stooge?"  The  answer was, "No, I  regard  you  as  the

leader  of Malayan nationalism." Immediately after  the

Baling talks, the M.C.P. armed revolt -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of order. I wonder if the Baling

talks are relevant to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not surprising perhaps that the

Minister  is  going further and further away  from  the

amendment.  I expect he will come back quickly  to  it.

Mr Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, perhaps in my anxiety to help

the  Members  of the Barisan Sosialis to resolve  their

difficulties,  I may have overstated my  case.  I  will

come back to the main trend of my argument, though that

should  not  prevent them from cogitating over  what  I

have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, in embarking on a trial of strength

with  the force of Malayan nationalism, the Members  of

the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis - or  at least those who direct its  destinies - have  chosen  the wrong opponent and that explains  why

after making every effort - betraying the trust that was

placed  in  them - they have not been able to  stop  the

drift  towards  merger. Those of  them  who  have  read

today's  newspapers must realise that they are standing

in  the way - and here I am quite sure that there  will

be   no   interjection - of  what  Lenin   called   "the

locomotive of history". Sir, Lenin - would I be straying

from  the  point?  - a man who happened to  have  written

books  (the others are people who only read  the  front

pages  of  his  books) said that  there  are  times  in

history when what he called "the locomotive of history"

gets  into motion, and you can determine it by  knowing

whether  the  force which is going forward  is  on  the

ascendancy  or  not. Sir, those of  us  who  have  read

today's  newspapers will know that the fateful  day  is

coming nearer and nearer. We are now coming on to 1962.

The drive for merger is not P.A.P.'s or anybody else's,

because  it  is  part  of  history - "the  locomotive  of

history".  Any  gentleman who  stands  in  front  would

perhaps  be  unrecognisable  when  "the  locomotive  of

history" has passed on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Except the British!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Another evidence of the

miscalculation of the Barisan Sosialis is the  stand - as

I  said  earlier -  which leads them to favour a  British

national  status  and  British  control  over   foreign

affairs  and defence. How is it that they  are  put  in

this false position? It is simply because their initial

assumptions   were   wrong.  They  have   based   their

calculations  and efforts on the wrong  force - a  dying

force - in resisting merger. Merger is of the future. But

the  Barisan Sosialis are trying to preserve  something

that  belongs to the past. Therefore, because  of  that

and  not  because  of the P.A.P.'s  cleverness  or  the

Tunku's  cleverness. (we are with the tide of  history)

that  they have picked the wrong opponent and they have

taken  the wrong stand. Therefore, they find themselves

in  this  predicament of having to humiliate themselves

by saying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



publicly, "I would rather be a British national than

a Federal national." We are not saying that you are

fighting for it. They have fought into that

situation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Speaker is never a fighter.

He listens. Mr Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I referred to you by proxy, but I was

not fighting you, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, it is my contention that the Barisan Sosialis

have   miscalculated  for  the  reasons  which  I  have

indicated.  They may believe otherwise. Today  in  this

debate  it  will  be possible for the  Members  of  the

Barisan Sosialis to dismiss them as fairly tales.  They

can dismiss our contention today - it may be tomorrow: it

may  be  the  day  after  tomorrow - that  the  Barisan

Sosialis is lighting the M.C.P. battle against  Malayan

nationalism  as  a fairy tale. They can  laugh  it  oil

today. But there will come a time very soon when merger

is  finally realised and the M.C.P. gives the signal to

launch  a  do-or-die offensive. The signs  of  such  an

offensive  are already here. When that time comes,  the

battle  lines will be clearly drawn. There will  he  no

equivocation  then, because there will be no  no-man's-land.  There will only be a thin red line dividing  the

forces of Malayan nationalism from the anti-nationalist

forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1959, when we were fighting the British

colonialists, there was a vast stretch of no-man's-land

because the light then was between the pro-colonialists

and  the anti-colonialists. The ideological lines  were

blurred and therefore there were rescue parties to  let

out of gaol those who had made false moves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, this is 1961 and not 1959. The battle is of

a different kind -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Anti-Communist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is not a battle

between the colonialists and the anti-colonists hut

between nationalists and anti-nationalists, between

those who are for merger and against merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this battle comes, there will be no rescue

parties, because all the contestants will be in the

battle-field taking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



position on this or that side of the line. Then  it  is

not  words but deeds which will decide who is on  which

side  of the thin red line. Those who oppose merger - and

the  time has come when merger obviously can be opposed

not by words but by deeds - then cannot say that they are

really  nationalists  at heart. They  must  take  their

chances,  as  I  said, Sir, against "the locomotive  of

history".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, people can opt out of the battle in the

nick  of time, provided they get their timing right.  I

understand,  Sir, that some people are already  passing

the  word around that they may cease being students  of

politics to take up law or medicine abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate, Sir, that our basic opposition to

the  Barisan  Sosialis  is not  over  the  question  of

automatic   Federal  citizenship  for   all   Singapore

citizens. If they can persuade the Federation  and  the

people of Singapore to accept their type of merger,  we

of  the  P.A.P., though we stand by  our  White  Paper

proposals, would be only too happy to doff our caps  to

the  Barisan  Sosialis, whatever our  differences  with

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in so far as they sabotage merger and attempt to

fight  for full internal self-government for Singapore,

then  in  our view the Barisan Sosialis is no  ally  of

Malayan  nationalism and will be fought to the  bitter

end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I end remarks on a happy and hopeful note? I

remember seeing an anti-war film called "On the Beach".

In  that film, the whole world is devastated by  atomic

radiation. All forms of life have ceased to exist.  The

last  shot  in  the  film shows  dead  leaves  and  old

newspapers  being  wafted over  and  a  Salvation  Army

banner  fluttering in the breeze. Sir, it reads, "There

is  still  time,  brother". But in case  it  should  be

suggested  that  I am making use of religious  appeals.

may I say. "There is still time, comrade."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final piece of hopeful message. May I refer to the

Member  for  Queenstown who told us a great deal  about

the  rising  Barisan 'Star'? I took the  precaution  of

looking up the Free Press to read what the Stars had to

say. Perhaps it is a very inappropriate reading. If the

Star



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



happens  to be Virgo, it says, "Be thankful  today  and

join  others  in a spiritual recognition of  the  day's

meaning."  But. Sir, if it is Capricorn, it says,  "Let

down  tensions and enjoy a day of rest and  relaxation.

You could use it."

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you

have  repeatedly  remined us that  the  issues  we  are

debating  are  of  the  gravest character - perhaps  the

gravest;  in  fact, the gravest that this Assembly  has

yet debated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For myself, Sir, I shall seek to deal dispassionately

with  the  facts  and  the law. I  am  in  a  curiously

independent position in this House. I do not belong  to

the  three P.A.P. factions who are sitting facing  each

other  across this House, nor do I belong to the  major

communities  whose interests may well be  reflected  in

the  speeches  you have heard. I have listened  to  all

that  has  been said. As to whether I am  going  to  be

dispassionate is for others to judge. I  can  only  say

that I shall honestly seek to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I look at the original motion as it stands in

the  name  of the Minister for Labour, and I say,  with

respect  to  him, that in the context of  today  it  is

blasphemy.  You  remember the Third  Commandment,  Sir:

Thou  shall not take the name of the Lord in vain. Many

of  us  in  the political field feel as deeply  and  as

fervently about merger as those who are religious  feel

about  God.  And  I say to you, Sir,  to  us  the  word

"merger"  means ultimate peace. In this motion  it  has

been  degraded. What is sacred to our people  has  been

cheapened  and misrepresented. It is an  abuse  of  the

word.  To  me  it  is  as though in this  House,  while

debating  about shipment of monkeys and their treatment

on  planes, suddenly the Minister for Labour  stood  up

and   said,  "I  move  a  motion  of  respect  for  our

ancestors."



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim):</b> So

what?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> They may be yours, not mine. I beg your

pardon, Mr Speaker, Sir, I withdraw that. I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



wish to be personal, and I hope they are not provoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Minister for Finance, Sir, has reminded us of

the  propaganda  abuse  of  the  word  "socialist"   in

Communist countries. He has pointed out truly  that  in

Russia  and  in China the word "socialist" is  made  to

mean  Communist. I myself have experienced yet  another

word that is grossly abused in Communist countries, and

that  is the word "democracy". The Communist countries.

both  Russia and China, make the word "democracy"  mean

the   dictatorship  of  the  few  over  the  terrorised

hundreds  of  millions. In the  United  States,  Sir  a

modern  civilised  western  democracy, the  capitalist

Press has so vilified and filthied the word "socialist"

that  to  many  Americans it evokes a  picture  of  the

dripping  fangs of Communism fastened on the  quivering

flesh of capitalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., recognising to what extent propaganda can

abuse  the  word, have decided to get on the bandwagon,

and  they have taken the most sacred word in our  local

political dictionary and turned it off its meaning  and

are  making it apply seemingly to a colonial  transfer.

It  is  in this manner. Sir, that the word "merger"  is

being used in the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister thought he was clever - and often he is clever - and instead of permitting us to debate, as we should have, the motion of thanks to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on his speech and the amendment thereon, and thereafter to debate the White Paper, had brought in this totally irrelevant motion in the context of today, because he hoped to - what was the Minister for Finance's word? - zugzwang us into voting

for  what, on the face of it, appears honest, but  what

in  the  context  of  its  introduction  is  false  and

misleading. The Leader of the House, Sir, informed  the

Opposition   in   one   of   his   letters   that   the

constitutional proposals constitute merger  because  we

will  be  voting  for representatives  in  the  Federal

Parliament.   The  Finance  Minister  says   that   the

proposals constitute merger because, in his words,  "We

will share a common political life with our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



brothers  across  the Causeway." And the  Minister  for

Culture  recognises the illogical stand and  speaks  of

P.A.P. merger. But the Prime Minister  uses  the  word

"Merger", "Merger", "Merger", incessantly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the House to turn its eyes away from the Front

Bench  and  to  see what the Federation Prime  Minister

said, Sir, - I am quoting from the Straits Times - I shall

be handing in these papers, Mr Speaker -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is, of course,

not  necessary  to  hand in the paper  if  it  is  made

available in the Library, and any Member who wishes  to

look at it may do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker. Sir,

for your guidance. They are all available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quotation is from the Straits Times, 17th

October,  page  9,  column  2,  the  Federation   Prime

Minister to his Parliament on the Malaysia motion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But one thing is certain, and that is that we cannot

take  Singapore  with us in complete merger  without  a

great  deal of unhappiness and trouble, and so we  must

find a middle course.'



<br><br>"We  must  find a middle course", that  is  to  say,  a

middle    course   between   separation   and   merger.

Furthermore,  Sir, as has already been pointed  out  to

you  in  this  House,  at  the  Press  conference  last

Thursday, the Prime Minister of the Federation with his

typical  honesty and frankness said to the Press,  "No,

you  can't call these constitutional proposals  merger.

It  would be more correct to say a form of every  close

association."  Mr  Speaker.  Sir,  I  have  known  the

Federation  Prime Minister for some ten years.  I  have

watched  him closely in his public utterances  for  the

last  seven  years, and  I can  say  to  you,  in  all

sincerity, that I have never known the Federation Prime

Minister to make one statement that was false. That  is

a  pretty  fine  record. And though, as  a  citizen  of

Singapore,  I am ashamed to confess it, I will  say  to

you, Mr Speaker, that when it comes to our Government,

our Prime Minister and our Deputy Prime Minister,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



the Finance Minister, the Minister for Culture, and any

of  the  others,  saying one thing, and the  Federation

Prime  Minister  saying something different,  I  accept

without  hesitation, though ashamed, the truth of  what

the  Federation Prime Minister says. It is  unfortunate

for  our  people  that  our Government  and  our  Prime

Minister  seem constitutionally incapable of  achieving

even  to  some  degree the integrity and the  frankness

with  his people that the Federation Prime Minister  is

capable of. If our Government had had but a modicum  of

the  decency  and  the frankness which  the  Federation

Prime  Minister has always had, we would not have  had,

Sir,  this  motion before us, a motion which,  whatever

the  motives  of  the  Government,  is  calculated  and

calculated  only to mislead the people. We  would  have

had  a  Government come to say to us, "  Look,  in  our

view, merger is impossible. We have achieved some  sort

of closer relationship. This White Paper is that closer

relationship.  We urge you to accept  it."  That  would

have  been  clean;  that would have been  honest;  that

would  have been the decent thing to do. But  it  is  a

P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I may not accept the White Paper. But the point

is, if they had come to us in this fashion, I would not

and I could not criticise them. Though I tried with all

my heart, I failed. And they have, in failing, achieved

more than I have succeeded in achieving. So I would  be

the  last man to have criticised them if they had  come

to  us quite honestly and said, "This isn't merger.  Of

course  not. We can't achieve merger. But this  is  the

most  we  can do. How about accepting it?" No. Sir,  we

are  not  permitted  even in these fateful  matters  to

debate  the truth without seven veils of filth. Instead

of  a motion which, we could have understood, which  we

could  have  debated, we have this  totally  irrelevant

motion in the name of the Minister for Labour - not  that

I  am  blaming  him, Sir, I know he has to  accept  his

master's voice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the context of what the Federation Prime

Minister has told us, that this is not a merger, as  we

can see for ourselves, but a form of closer relation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



we  can  understand the Barisan Sosialis' amendment  to

this motion, an amendment which seeks to restore to the

word  "merger" its true meaning. In fact, Sir, it is  a

misnomer  to  call  it  an  amendment  except  in   the

technical   sense,   for  it  is   no   more   than   a

clarification,  an  attempt  to  restore  to  the  word

"merger", as for the word "socialist", the meaning that

honest people give it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture, if I may say so

without seeming to be patronising, has indicated  quite

clearly  his  recognition of the  inappropriateness  of

that  word  and  has  sought to change  it  to  "P.A.P.

merger". Sir, you just cannot take a word which belongs

to  everybody and make it a P.A.P. property and give it

any  meaning you like. But he has not talked of merger.

He  has said, however, something that surprises me  and

disappoints me. Until I heard him, I had believed  that

the  P.A.P. all genuinely wanted complete merger,  but,

not being able to achieve it. Sir, were bringing us the

best they could. But the Minister told us categorically

yesterday,  Sir, if you will remember, that the  P.A.P.

does  not  believe  in  a complete  merger,  because  a

complete  merger  with Singapore as the  twelfth  State

would be harmful to Singapore. Well, of course, Sir, if

that  is  so, I can understand them voting against  the

amendment, and I should expect them to vote against the

motion. If you do not believe in a merger because it is

going  to  harm Singapore, vote against the motion  and

let us talk about the White Paper.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is right.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I must say, Sir, although he is not

here - perhaps it is better when he is not  here,  since

I  am  going  to compliment him - I heard with  pleasure

the Member for Cairnhill -

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> He is here.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Oh, I beg your pardon - when he said

merger  can only mean merger; it can only mean complete

unification  of our two territories, and  our  citizens

completely identified as citizens of the Federation.  I

say  I could not agree with him more. I agree with  him

whole-heartedly. That is true. That is the only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



honest,  only real, only meaning of the word  "merger".

His   phrase,   "complete  unification   of   our   two

territories, and our citizens completely identified  as

citizens  of  the  Federation". And that  is  what  the

Barisan Sosialis' amendment is seeking to clarify.  But

then, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill went on to say that

he was voting against the amendment. I am puzzled, Sir,

as  in  politics  one is always puzzled.  I  am  not  a

student  even. I am an amateur, and I confess it.  Sir,

if  he  is  voting  against the amendment  which  says,

"genuine   merger   [adding  the  word  "genuine"].with

Singapore  coming in as the twelfth State and Singapore

citizens  being automatically citizens" - but that  is  a

clarification of the word "merger". If you vote against

that,  then you do not want Singapore in as the twelfth

State; you do not want genuine merger; you do not  want

our  citizens as citizens of the Federation. Then  what

are  you voting for when you vote for the Minister  for

Labour's motion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he said. "I am voting against it because it is

tautologous  and  redundant." Lovely  words,  Sir.  But

forgive  me.  I am sure you know it, if I refresh  your

memory   as   to   the  fact  that  "tautologous"   and

"redundant" mean the same thing. And anybody  who  uses

those two words is himself tautologous or redundant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his colleague, the Member for Geylang Serai, put

his  finger  on  it  but  in a curious  and  mysterious

fashion.  He said - this is something I have been  trying

to understand; these are his words



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "Quite bluntly, I cannot vote for the amendment

because it is a political amendment." Sir, does he mean

that just as the word "merger" in the motion is a false

word,  is an abuse of the word, so the amendment itself

does  not mean what it says, but is being false?  I  do

wish,  Sir, that he had expanded that, because I should

have  liked  to understand him. Sir, to say  "political

amendment" - of course, the motion is political. I  mean,

we  are discussing a political issue in that motion - the

political issue of merger - so the amendment is naturally

political from that point of view. I repeat, I do  wish

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Geylang  Serai had assisted  us  a  little

further, because let me say this quite frankly, Sir,I

cannot look into the minds or the hearts of the Barisan

Sosialis.  I heard some terrible allegations  from  the

other  side  of the House about them. I have  not  even

spoken to them. In so far as I am aware, they were  too

terrified to speak to me! But I do not know.  I  cannot

judge. All I can judge is from the amendment they  have

brought  iii, and to me it looks an honest,  reasonable

and  proper  amendment to restore to the word  "merger"

its true meaning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that amendment to me is like somebody moving a

motion  that this House believes in the institution  of

marriage,   and  somebody  else  moving  an   amendment -

"marriage  according  to law". It is  a  clarification.

They  do not mean a common law marriage, but a marriage

according  to law. I do not see how anybody can  object

to the clarification of the word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the S.P.A. - I trust you will absolve

me of any suggestion of patronage which I do not intend

to indulge in, Sir - said in the best speech I have heard

him make in this House (and I have heard him make many,

Sir,  which other Members have not), and I believe him,

Sir;  I believe he was sincere, Sir, - he said, "We want

complete  merger for Singapore. But we cannot have  it,

and we think that this White Paper is the best possible

because, with the P.A.P. in Government, they could  not

get  anything better than we could." Let us  leave  the

controversial  aspect apart. Let us just  look  at  the

first  part  of  that sentence which he enunciated.  He

said,  "We want complete merger for Singapore."  He  is

speaking for his Party. Sir. Is it not exactly what the

amendment  to  the  motion  says?  "We  want   complete

merger."  These  are  the  words,  Sir.  "affirms   and

declares  that the first objective of all true patriots

of  Malaya k to achieve the reunification of these  two

territories  in a genuine merger with Singapore  coming

in   as   the   twelfth   State  and   with   automatic

citizenship." It is a question of principle. This is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



what we want. It is not what we can get. And surely  to

me,  Sir, one can vote for the principle of the  merger

motion as amended and vote for the White Paper. If  you

believe, as he has indicated that he believes, that the

provisions  of  the White Paper are the  best  possible

today, that they are good for Singapore, and  they  go

some  way  towards bringing Singapore to  the  ultimate

realisation of complete merger. That is an honest view.

He is entitled to it. But I am seeking to point out, if

I  might, to the Members on the Opposition Front Bench,

that  it  is  completely logical to vote both  for  the

amendment to the motion and for the White Paper. And it

is  illogical  to  vote against the  amendment  to  the

merger  motion and yet vote for the motion in the  name

of the Minister for Labour.

<br><br>Perfectly true! Completely true! True but harnessed  to

my  pleasure,  in the name of all the parties  in  this

present   a   memorandum  to  Her  Britannic  Majesty's

for  the  Colonies,  in which there appears,  Sir,  now

Command Paper No. 31 of 1956, page 47, paragraph 6.  It

was on April 1956. Sir, I would remind the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We have at all times been conscious that

geographically, ethnically, culturally and economically

the  Federation and Singapore are one entity - ours is  a

common  destiny calling for political unity. No concept

of  parochial  aggrandisement inspires our  desire  for

unity -   we recognise that financially and in our Social

Services we will suffer - but we believe that the  people

of  Singapore  and the Federation, as  well  as  people

beyond  our  shores, will benefit considerably  by  the

stability and stature of a united Greater Malaya.'



<br><br>And, Sir, in case there is any suggestion as to when  I

and My Party began to believe in merger, here is a dog-eared  copy  of  the  very first  and  the  only  party

platform  of  the  Workers' Party on its  formation  in

December  of 1957. In the very first paragraph  and  in

the very first sentence, it says,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The basis and framework of all policy must be

recognition    of   the   fact   that   Singapore    is

geographically,  ethnically, and economically  part  of

Malaya  and  the  only  healthy  ultimate  solution  is

integration  with Malaya on an equal basis  with  other

states...'.

Sir,  it is miraculous that we used that phrase "on  an

equal basis with other states" at a time when there was

no question about it. And we did not have the P.A.P. in

office.  It  is true. We did not suspect any treachery.

We  did  not  suspect that the word "merger"  would  be

abused.  But  perhaps out of caution.  Sir,  which  our

training  sometimes gives us, that phrase "on an  equal

basis"  was inserted in that party platform of December

1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come down, Sir, to recent times, as recently as

the  day  of the Anson election, the major part  of  my

very  short speech at the Victoria Memorial Hall,  long

before  the  two  Prime Ministers  met  to  talk  about

merger, I said - and the quotation is from the back  page

of the Sunday Mail of the 16th July:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tungku, the stars are smiling on you again as they

did  four  years  ago  when you crowned  your  people's

struggle for Merdeka. This could be an historic  moment

not only for Malaya hut also for the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May you and we and the British he equal to our

opportunities, rising above the immediate  petty  fears

and  trivialities to create a united Happy Malaya  that

would  be  a dynamic stabilising force for world  peace

and  a  shining  example  of  genuine  interracial  co-operation.'



<br><br>Sir, in the unhappy atmosphere of perhaps not unnatural

friction  between parted spouses with the wife throwing

all  the  kitchen utensils at the running  husband,  we

have  forgotten the position of Singapore.  Nobody  has

far  put  in  a word about our worth, our  status,  our

value.  We have been reminded by the Government itself,

Mr  Speaker,  in  the  speech of His  Excellency  that

Singapore  is  the  largest port in  Asia.  It  is  the

world's fifth largest port and it is expected to handle

next year 70 million tons of shipping. We have a highly

developed financial and commercial organisation  and  a

tremendous potential for economic expansion. Even under

the  P.A.P. our revenue has been expanding  fast.  Mr

Speaker, this will astonish you. For the year 1960 they

presented a budget that was going to be $14 million  in

deficit. They slashed salaries. I am not talking  about

salaries,  but I want to remind you that  they  slashed

the civil servants' salaries. Then only a few days ago,

Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



I  mentioned to this House that I discovered that there

was  a  $9  million surplus instead of  a  $14  million

deficit, which  made an increase of $23  million  from

what  was  expected. But, Sir, we had  a  supplementary

since  that  day and do you know what our  surplus  for

1960  was?  $34 million. So that there was $43  million

more than they expected. That is the way our economy is

expanding in spite of the P.A.P., in spite of the  fear

which  we all recognise and which they themselves admit

was  created amongst somewhat infantile members of  the

commercial community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1956, when I could obtain facts without

obstruction,  I  was  reliably informed  that  the  per

capita  income of Singapore was four times that of  the

Federation. Spreading our annual income over every map,

woman  and  child  in Singapore, we were  earning  four

times  more  than  an equal number  of  people  in  the

Federation. Singapore is not only one of the wealthiest

States in the world, it is also one of the healthiest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a dynamic and industrious people, who are both

peaceful and friendly, in spite of the attacks from the

Front  Bench as to our so-called Communist leanings  to

which I hope to come in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Singapore is vital for the Federation.

The  Federation is vital to us, and this  is  not  only

economically, but also emotionally and culturally. Sir,

it has been my unhappy lot for long and lonely years to

seek to awaken the people of Singapore to the fact that

if  we cannot get complete merger, then we should  not,

and  I disagree violently with the Barisan Sosialis  on

this, seek internal self-government. But we should seek

independence. [Laughter] Ah, gales of laughter!

curious eccentricity in the immature?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that that expression

was  not meant to apply to any Member of this Assembly,

but  may I remind the hon. Member for Anson that he did

start off by saying he would try to be dispassionate.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suppose the answer is that if the

the laughter is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker, Sir. It

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have ruled.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Indeed, Sir. I was saying, Sir, all

right, nobody agrees with me. It is fair enough. We  in

the  Workers'  Party accept the fact  that  in  seeking

independence we stand alone and we bow to the  majority

will. You disagree with us, Sir, it is fair enough. But

what  I  was trying to point out, Sir, is that  in  our

efforts  to  educate the people as to the  meaning  and

value  of  this approach, we have again and again  come

across  many  who are not only Malays but  Chinese  and

Indians as well, who say "No. If we cannot have merger,

we  do  not  want independence. We do not  want  to  be

separated  from  our people across the Causeway."  Sir,

that is a genuine phenomenon in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merger would mean this - I shall show you to what

extent the people of Singapore have to make sacrifices.

Our  taxes and our income would be in the hands of  the

Federation Government. Our wealth would be in the hands

of the Federation Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had a White Paper tabled which does not

show  the  extent. It says it is going to be  arranged.

The  Prime  Minister, though, when  dealing  with  this

House perhaps he looks upon the Opposition in the light

of  nitwits compared to his gigantic brain and does not

really  feel  interested in telling us the facts  which

are  so  important  to  the  people,  but  when  he  is

discussing   things   with   his   pals,   the   Press,

particularly over Radio Singapore, which has borne  for

so  long  his dreary diarrhoea of words, Sir,  then  we

have some facts. And one of them, which he ennunciated,

Sir,  and which I learnt through the Press is that  the

financial  arrangement with the Federation is  that  we

give  the  Federation one-fourth of our annual  income.

The  estimate  for  1961  is $350  million  and  it  is

growing,  so we are going to give the Federation,  Sir,

$90  million a year. For what? To defend us? But  under

the present treaty arrangements between England and the

Federation, it is the Federation's duty to  defend  us.

$90  million a year income for what? Honourable Members

sitting  opposite -  Health, Education - where  is  Social

Welfare? Absent -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b> raised his head.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Ah, thank you. They must recognise.

Sir,  what a terrible thing this is going to be. It  is

no  exaggeration to say it is lopping off  one  of  our

limbs.  $90  million a year, and we  have  to  pay  for

Federal  citizens and Federal officials who work  here,

Sir -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have promised not to intervene

if  there  are irrelevancies. Perhaps the  Member  will

agree that this could be debated in detail when we come

back to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged.

Mr  Speaker, Sir,In a complete merger,  Sir,  it  may

well  be  that we want it so much that we would  accept

the lopping off of a limb. But, now for what?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people of Singapore, I believe, recognise

that if we want unity, if we want equal privileges,  we

must carry heavy responsibilities. We must recognise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



that   there   can   be  no  reality   of   unity,   no

identification  of the Federation and Singapore  if  we

pursue different policies in education and labour. I do

honestly  believe, Sir, that the P.A.P. errs  when  it

says  that the people of Singapore will not accept that

the  whole  of  Malaya  should be  in  control  of  our

education  and labour policies. I believe that  if  the

issue were put to the people of Singapore, "Do you want

unconditional merger complete or do you want the P.A.P.

White  Paper?" we would have 90 per cent of the  people

voting for unconditional and complete merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his opening speech to Parliament on merger last

month,  the  Federation Prime Minister is  reported  to

have  said  - I  do apologise, Sir, for quoting  from  a

newspaper.  I  have sought and found it  impossible  to

obtain   the   Official  Reports  of   the   Federation

Parliament  Debates because they have  not  as  yet,  I

understand, been printed. I am quoting from the Straits

Times of 17th October, page 8, col. 5:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...time would come when Singapore would ask for and

be  given  independence, and that time is not far  off,

for  new  talks on the Constitution are to be  held  in

1963."



<br><br>And a little later in that debate, the Federation Prime

Minister added:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must prevent a situation in which an independent

Singapore would go one way and the Federation  another.

The  way  Singapore  would go  then  would  be  towards

another  camp  which is hostile to the Federation,  and

this would be quite unacceptable to us."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we see, Sir, that though the Borneo territories,

which  are much smaller in size, population and wealth,

are  being  invited to come in as full  brothers  in  a

Malaysia  family, Singapore is told, "We will have  you

as  a junior partner, so we can keep an eye on you,  so

you don't give us trouble."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the reasons, Mr Speaker, Sir, for this

differentiation  of  approach  on  the  part   of   the

Federation  towards  Singapore and towards  the  Borneo

territories? I know the leader of the Barisan  Sosialis

in  a  remarkable effort did touch on  it,  but,  if  I

might,  Sir, give my opinions very briefly and  perhaps

from a different point of view.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Prime Minister gave three reasons to

Parliament  which were not repeated in His Excellency's

speech to us in the policy statement of the Government.

The  three reasons are to be found in the Straits Times

of the 17th October, page 8, column 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The idea of Kingship, the Malay language and Islam

as   the   official  religion  would  not  he   readily

acceptable  to  people  the majority  of  whom  profess

religions other than Islam and to whom Malay is  not  a

lingua  franca, and who moreover have never had a  King

of their own."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we find in the White Paper that, in fact,

His  Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong will be our King

and I have not heard and do not expect to hear a single

person  complain  or murmur about it. The  White  Paper

indicates  that  Islam  will  hold  the  same  honoured

position  as  in Malacca and Penang. I  am  quite  sure

there  is  not a single person in Singapore  who  would

complain about that, and already, Sir, in Ordinance  52

of  1960,  Malay has by this very Government been  made

the national language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, the three reasons which were not repeated

here have, in fact, disappeared. But this Government in

the  speech of His Excellency gave six reasons  why  we

cannot  have complete merger. Before I refer  to  them,

Sir,  I  would  refer to paragraph 4  of  col.  11.  To

understand it, they put the preface at the end:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people must know that these interests [those are

the six which I am going to retail] cannot he protected

in  a  complete merger as a 12th State like one of  the

other  11  States of the present Federation,  for  then

automatically  all these matters will he controlled  by

the  Central Government and must follow the pattern  of

what happened in the 11 States of the [Federation]."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these matters, Sir, which cannot be

protected in a complete merger? Is that the word?  Yes,

"these  interests  cannot be protected  in  a  complete

merger". Sir, the Minister for Culture is not  here.  I

had  hoped that he, who had stressed so much the  civil

service aspect, would be here at least so that he might

be  able  to assist us. Sir, the first reason given  in

His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



which is to be found in column 10, paragraph 1, is  the

protection  of the civil service from the applicability

of the 4:1 ratio between Malays and non-Malays. Sir,  I

confess  to  a rather dreadful thing, to have  to  make

allegations  that the facts as alleged in so  solemn  a

policy statement as the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech

in   a   short   column  arid  a  half  are  repeatedly

inaccurate. They are simple matters of fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us look at this 4:1 ratio. It arises from

the  provisions  of Articles 153 (2) of the  Federation

Constitution. Ah, the Minister himself! I will be  very

happy to table Federation of Malaya Constitution (L. A.

Sheridan) if any Member wishes to consult it.  Article

153 (2) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, hut

subject  to  the provisions of Article 40 and  of  this

Article,  the Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall exercise  his

functions  under this Constitution and federal  law  in

such manner as may be necessary -'.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must remember

that his speech is being translated.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am glad of the reminder, Mr Speaker,

Sir, and my apologies to the translators:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall exercise his

functions  under this Constitution and federal  law  in

such  manner  as  may  he necessary  to  safeguard  the

special  position  of  the Malays  and  to  ensure  the

reservation  for Malays of such proportion  as  he  may

deem reasonable of positions in the public service...'.



<br><br>Now, Sir, notice, in brackets:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'....(other than the public service of a State)...'.



<br><br>Sir,  the  application of the 4:1 ratio is not  to  the

service  of a State. It is to the Federal service.  Let

me read one more Article, Article 132 (2):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the qualifications for appointment and conditions

of service of persons in the public services other than

those  mentioned  in para. (g) of  Clause  (1)  may  be

regulated by federal law and, subject to the provisions

of any such law, by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong...'.



<br><br>And now, Sir, this is the part:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...and the qualifications for appointment and

conditions of service of persons in the public  service

of any state may he regulated by State Law...'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



The  Government has perhaps the acutest legal brain  in

its State Advocate-General and it is a pity they do not

use him to consult him on some of the legal aspects  of

their  submissions  to  this  Assembly.  Under  a  full

merger,  Sir,  I  say  to this  House  that  all  civil

servants  of the State of Singapore would be  appointed

according  to the qualifications required by the  State

of  Singapore.  The 4:1 ratio would not  apply  to  the

civil  servants  of  the State of Singapore.  It  would

apply  only  to  Federal civil servants.  What  is  the

position,  Sir,  indicated in  the  White  Paper?  The

position  is that the existing Singapore civil  service

will  be retained as a State civil service which  would

apply in any event in a complete merger. However,  Sir,

I  want you to notice that departments which were  Pan-Malayan prior to Merdeka Day will henceforth revert  to

former   arrangements.   They   will   become   Federal

departments  and then the Federal ratio  of  4:1  would

apply.  So  wherein  the distinction  between  complete

merger - I  would not use the words "phoney  merger";  I

know it is short and perhaps sweet to some ears - and the

P.A.P. proposals? There is no distinction in treatment

at  all  between the conditions under which  the  civil

servants  would  work  in  a complete  merger  and  the

conditions as applicable under the White Paper. I  say.

Sir,  that  it  is  not true, as alleged,  that  it  is

necessary for the protection of the civil service  that

we  should have the arrangements proposed by the P.A.P.

instead of a complete merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next reason given by the Government, Sir, is that

Chinese  parents  who  send their children  to  Chinese

schools  want  a  policy  of equal  treatment  for  all

streams  of  education  and  equal  opportunities   for

employment.  Sir,  the  P.A.P. seem  harassed  by  this

Chinese  question, because, in this context, I  do  not

know why it is necessary to say Chinese parents. I have

always  understood in this Assembly since 1956 that  it

is  all parents of Singapore who would like a policy of

equal treatment for all streams of education. It was an

almost unanimous decision, as far as I can remember. On

the question of equal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



opportunities after school - I may be wrong - I  understand

that  equal opportunities to a large extent  do  exist.

There  are  some exceptions including, of  course, the

major  exception of the Federal civil service.  But  on

the main issue of equality of treatment for all streams

of  education, I agree completely with the inference in

the statement in the White Paper that there seems to be

a  radical difference between the policies in Singapore

and those in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that I learned with some surprise and

delight  from the Member for Queenstown that his  Party

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- to me, as far as I can understand, a Party that

represents the industrial Chinese worker, I do not know

about  the  others -  were prepared to accept  Federation

control  of  education policy, and I  say  hear,  hear!

[Interruption].  I  am sorry. Did I misquote  the  hon.

Member?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Perhaps, Sir, I shall refrain from

quoting  from memory. But for myself, I would  like  to

say  this. I do not agree that Singapore should have  a

different   educational  policy  from  the  Federation.

[Interruption] I do not care how much we may  not  like

the  Federation  educational policy. That  is  not  the

point [Interruption]. Ha, ha, ha!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member should

ignore  laughter from that side of the House if  he  is

addressing the Speaker. The Speaker has not even  heard

the laughter, theoretically.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I am but human, but I will

follow your instructions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was saying that for myself and for my Party,

it is our firm view that it is gravely dangerous to the

welfare  of the people of Singapore as well as  to  the

welfare of the Federation that in a merger there should

be  any differentiation of education policy. But though

we  may  not  agree  with their  education  policy,  as

democrats  we accept the rule of the majority  and,  of

course,  we will seek constitutionally to persuade  the

Federation or those who disagree with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



our view at least to come to some modus vivendi, it  is

not the point if we succeed or not. We are prepared  to

accept   unconditionally   Federation   control   over

education policy. But, Sir, the P.A.P. say they are not

prepared  to accept it. All right, they are a  majority

of  one. They are a majority still. So I ask them,  ask

with  respect, "If you do not agree that we should give

the  Federation control over education, then would  you

recognise  that  in  a  complete merger,  all  that  is

necessary is for a Federal Act to he passed which  will

vest  in  Singapore  the  control  over  the  education

policy?" If they can get it under the White Paper, they

can  get it, Sir, by virtue of an Act of the Federation

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is in column 10, paragraph 3 of

Hansard  dated  31st October. 1961. I do  not  want  to

misquote  them and am sure you will check me if  I  do.

The   third  reason  is  that  the  workers  want   the

particular labour policy and legislation that they have

enjoyed  in  Singapore to continue. If  this  were  not

tragic, Sir, I would laugh. But when I am uncomfortable

and  when I feel the tragedy of the moment - unlike hon.

Members on the Front Bench opposite - I do not indulge in

hollow  laughter. The workers did believe in the P.A.P.

They  did believe that the P.A.P. was pro-labour.  That

was  why they voted P.A.P. But since the elections  two

and   a   half  years  ago,  where  is  the  pro-labour

legislation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T.U.C. Bill introduced by the Government, passed

by  the  Government, one Reading, two Readings,  Select

Committee, three Readings, passed; and then they go  to

His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara and they say,

"Stop,  do  not sign." Why? Is it unfair, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  to suggest - and I do suggest - it seems apparent  on

the  face of their conduct that they had hoped by  that

Bill  to  rivet the workers of Singapore to the  P.A.P.

political  machine and that when they saw a possibility

of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



split with their colleagues who are now opposite,  they

decided that maybe the enslavement of the workers would

not  be  to  the P.A.P. but would be to the  Opposition

Parties and they did not want to

risk  it? I do say that. To me, that seems the  obvious

answer.  Their  attitude has been one of the  political

exploitation of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Industrial Arbitration Ordinance. But let

us  face  it and I am only dealing with it en  passant.

The industrial Arbitration Court is good, but it is  no

more pro-labour than it is pro-employer. So, Sir, where

is  the pro-labour policy that the workers of Singapore

have  enjoyed?  is it the conduct of the Government  in

the  recent  strikes  of non-P.A.P. unions?  But  even

assuming that there is such a policy of which I am  not

aware - perhaps of my jaundiced blindness to  the  merits

of  the  gentlemen opposite whose leader has  so  often

angered - where  is the difficulty, Sir,  in  obtaining

from  the  Federation in a complete merger the transfer

of such powers to our local Government? [Interruption]

Not  that  I  want it, Mr Speaker, Sir. Again  for  my

Party  and  for  myself in answer to the  Minister  for

Culture,   I  say  - and  I  trust  if  he   needs   any

clarification   he   will   ask   for   it - we    accept

unequivocally Federation control over our labour policy

with  our constitutional right to seek to persuade  the

Federation  to modify to such extent as  we  may  think

proper  and  as they may be prepared to agree  to  such

policy. But we as citizens and as democrats accept  the

rule  of the majority and the control of the Federation

in a complete merger. Now, Sir, the fourth reason given -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at least my speech

seems  to  have quite an effect in that it has  emptied

the Government Benches. They do feel uncomfortable when

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, holding the fort. Mr Speaker, I

would  like  to correct one matter, Sir, in  explaining

the expanding economy of Singapore. I spoke of the year

1960 and I should like to correct that to 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, when we adjourned, I was pointing out the

six reasons given by Government for not having complete

merger  because these interests could not be protected,

and  I have given three of them. The fourth reason, Mr

Speaker, is that the Singapore businessmen, contractors

and  bus  companies do not want priorities  or  special

rights  for  anybody. Sir, by the word  "anybody",  the

Government  intended us to understand that  we  do  not

want special rights for the Malays. First and foremost,

let  me say that I do not believe that it is true  that

our people do not want to give special consideration to

nursing our Malay citizens to participate fully in  our

economic  life. The Malays of Singapore,  Mr  Speaker,

have  had a very raw deal in the last 150 years.  Their

way  of  life  has  been smashed,  their  culture  deep

frozen,  their  education  neglected.  They  have  been

isolated,   and  we  should  recognise  that.   It   is

elementary justice that special consideration should be

given to our Malay citizens, and special measures taken

to  nurse  them  to full partnership  in  our  economic

community. I do not believe the people of Singapore are

so  selfish as to be unjust, or so mercenary as  to  be

mean.  But even apart from the call of justice,  I  say

that  it  is  unhealthy for our national life  that  an

important   segment   of  our  population   should   be

economically isolated. I say: special encouragement  to

the  Malays in the economic field is good socialism  in

practice.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am heartened to hear, "Hear, hear!"

instead of hollow laughter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And I say that we should, even though

some  may  object,  give special encouragement  to  our

Malay citizens. Such encouragement would invigorate our

economy,  and  it  would  not  materially  affect   the

interest of any other community. Sir, this is the  good

fortune  sometimes of being alone - that I' can at  least

seek  to follow the dictates of justice without  always

being  suspected of grinding a communal axe. But,  Sir,

even  if our people are not just, even if we are  mean,

even if we are blind on larger issues, may I point  out

to  the  Government  that  it  is  not  true  that  the

interests of the contractors, the Singapore businessmen

and   the  bus  companies  cannot  be  protected  under

complete  merger? The special position of  the  Malays.

Sir,  comes under Article 153, section 2 of the Federal

Constitution.  It  is  a matter of  discretion  of  the

Federation  Government, and it is  a  question  of  the

exercise  of  this discretion which in the  context  of

Singapore could be limited to minimum interference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, it makes the most curious and illogical

reading  in  this nightmarish debate, which  is  almost

reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, that,  on  the  one

hand,  this  Government says, "We do not want  complete

merger",  and, on the other, it brings in a  motion  to

urge  merger. On the one hand, it says. "We do not want

complete  merger  because we would then  have  to  give

special  consideration  to the Malays".  On  the  other

hand,  it  presents a White Paper in which the  special

position  of  the Malays is specifically recognised  in

the   new  Constitution,  as  it  should  be.  Do   not

misunderstand  me, Mr Speaker, I agree  with  it.  But

that  paragraph  7 of the White Paper  quite  obviously

envisages  that  a similar protection  for  the  Malays

should   prevail  in  Singapore  as  prevails  in   the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, under the P.A.P. proposals, we have

the position that would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



be  identical with that under a merger. So even if  the

P.A.P. object to special privileges for the Malays, or

say that the people of Singapore object, then I repeat,

that  is not true. Even if they do object though, there

is  no  special  protection for the contractor  or  the

business man, and it is untrue to say, as the speech of

His   Excellency  says,  "that  the  interests  of  the

contractor, of the business man, and the bus conductor,

cannot be protected in a full merger."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth reason given by the Government in His

Excellency's  policy speech is that  the  merchants  of

Singapore  want a continuance of our free  port  status

and maintenance of our trade with the whole world. Sir,

it  is  almost  unbelievable. I refuse to believe  that

this Government is not aware that there is such a State

as  the State of Penang. I refuse to believe that  this

Government is not aware that Penang is a free  port  by

virtue  of  a  small  part  of the  Federation  Customs

Ordinance. I refuse to believe that this Government  is

not conscious of the fact that the free port status  of

Singapore  could  be  fully  protected  under  complete

merger.  So  how is it that they have the  audacity  to

say, in His Excellency's speech, that the interests  of

the  merchants who want a continuance of our free  port

status and maintenance of our trade relations cannot he

protected under a complete merger?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, might I draw your attention to the

White Paper under the fifth head:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the special position of Singapore in relation to

entrepot trade will he safeguarded. Measures to protect

the  interest of Singapore trade overseas will  include

the  establishment  of  a section  within  any  of  the

Federal missions as may he necessary to deal with trade

matters  of  Singapore.  In any  trade  negotiation  or

arrangements undertaken or entered into by the  Federal

Government with another country due consideration  will

he given to the commercial needs of Singapore.'



<br><br>These  are  administrative matters, Mr Speaker,  which

could  and normally would he provided by the Federation

Government.  The Federation need Singapore  as  a  free

port.  It  would  not be helpful to the  Federation  to

destroy  our  free port status. They want to  encourage

our trade because we would he part of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



sinews of the Federation. Here again, Sir, I say to

you, it is completely untrue to say, as has been said

in the Government policy statement, that one of the reasons for not having complete merger is because the

interests of the merchants who want our free port

status and who want our trade with the whole world

protected could not be protected. It is untrue. What is

much more curious, Sir, is, if you look at the White

Paper - you know, we were supposed only to give the

Federation internal security, external defence,

external affairs - under Finance. Mr Speaker, Sir, are

a vast host of items. Who has control? Yes, they know.

We have control, Sir, exclusively for Singapore in

dangerous and in inflammable substances and factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the protection of our free port status and

our trade with the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this topic of our merchants. I do ask this

House to recognise that there is missing perhaps one of

the most important factors which might have induced us

to accept the proposals, and that is the factor of the

common market. Of course, it is not mentioned there,

but as a result of the reply from the Minister for

Finance earlier this Session to my questions, a, reply

which was tabled and which Members have, it is clear

that the new proposals will not achieve a common

market. I do not intend to point to Penang, Sir,

because let us be quite fair, though the Government has

made propaganda hay out of Penang for citizenship

purposes, I do not intend to point to Penang, it has

not got any major industries, but we should face the

fact that under items 7 (h) and 8 (b) of List I on the

White Paper, the Federation will be able to tax any

commodities coming from Singapore, but Singapore will

not he able to tax imports from the Federation. I hope

that sinks in. Today they move against us. We have

something. But taxation will be in their hands. At the

same time, Sir, I think it is fair to accept, At least

in some measure, the implication in the statement of

the leader of the S.P.A. that the closer relationship

which would arise out of an acceptance of these P.A.P.

proposals would bring about a climate where a common

market may be quicker achieved, think that is true,

Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the most crucial of the reasons

given  by  the  Government for not having  complete

merger,  and  one that has so deeply exercised  the

leader  of the Barisan Sosialis. Sir, I can  do  no

better.  The  Minister for Culture,  who  does  not

indulge  in  the  hollow laugh  like  some  of  his

colleagues  when he is uncomfortable,  nevertheless

tried  to elide it on the very good principle  that

attack is the best means of defence. So he counter-attacked.  He said, "Why? Why do you keep referring

to Article 22? Of course, we all know Article 22 of

the  Constitution  permits the  Parliament  of  the

Federation to give you citizenship. Nobody has said

anything  different. Why do you harp on  it?  Why?"

The innocent Minister!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you know that constitutionally the most

solemn  enunciation of Government policy is in  the

form  of  a  speech  which the Head  of  the  State

enunciates  in  the  House  in  the  name  of   the

government  of  the day. I have no doubt  that  the

Minister, however much subservient to his  master's

voice,  had a word in the dictation of this policy,

the  Minister for Culture must have at  least  read

it.  If he did not read it, he must have heard  it.

He  was here when it was read by His Excellency.  I

quote from column 11, paragraph 5:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We do not recommend complete merger because one of

the  most important consequences of complete merger

is   the   application   of  the   more   stringent

citizenship laws of the Federation under which over

350,000  Singapore citizens who were not born  here

will  he  disenfranchised and will have to re-apply

for registration as citizens.'



<br><br>Sir,  with my full sense of responsibility to  this

House,  I  say  this  is - may I say  false,  Sir? - or

inaccurate.  They complained that the poor  Barisan

Sosialis referred to Article 22. Because it is  not

true. It is not true - and it is a terrible thing  to

say  of  the Government - that in a complete  merger.

350,000  Singapore citizens who were not born  here

will  be  disenfranchised. And I shall show  it  to

you,   Sir,   chapter  and  verse.  The  Federation

Constitution nowhere has the power to  deprive  the

citizens  of  a  State of the citizenship  of  that

State,  nor  have the Federation ever tried  to  do

that.  Before  merger there were  subjects  of  the

rulers of Johore, of Kedah, of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



Selangor,  of  Trengganu, all the nine  States.  We

will  come to Penang and Malacca where the  Barisan

Sosialis, having  no  legal  consultant,   really

slipped,  and  the Government made full  propaganda

play.  But  let us for a moment look at the  truth,

Sir.  There were nine out of the eleven  States  of

the Federation which had subjects of the ruler.  On

Merdeka  Day, those subjects of the rulers  became

Federal  citizens  and  remained  subjects  of  the

rulers.  Nowhere was a single subject  of  a  ruler

deprived of his citizenship. It is not true to  say

that  on complete merger there is anything  in  the

Constitution of the Federation which would permit a

citizen  of  Singapore  to  be  deprived   of   his

citizenship of Singapore. [Laughter]. They laughed,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Just for the record, for the

sake  perhaps of clarity, because this is  in  fact

look  at  col.  10  the last two paragraphs, which

perhaps  clarify the matter. I know the Speaker  is

the  position is this. I know that it happens,  for

example,  in  a  prosecution in a court,  everybody

assumes  the  police are right and the  accused  is

guilty.  Of  course, the law must take its  course.

and  thee  when  the  defence brings  facts  which,

disprove  it,  there  is  confusion  at  first  and

disbelief.  Here the Government has made statements

of  fact.  I  repeat. Sir. Nowhere in  the  Federal

Constitution does it provide or can it provide  the

power,  nor has the Federation exercised any  power

which  would deprive the subject of a State of  his

citizenship of that State. And apart from that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I ask the hon. Member to

look at the last paragraph at col. 10?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I will go on to it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The most important interest that will be

protected  in  a merger based on the  principle  of

partnership is that Singapore citizens,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



whether born here or born elsewhere, will keep  all

their  present citizenship rights and, in addition,

acquire  national rights as nationals  of  the  new

Federation.  Nobody will lose any  rights.  On  the

other  hand,  every citizen will gain new  national

status  as  a member of an independent  and  larger

political unit.



<br><br>Yes,  Mr Speaker. I am coming to that. But what  I

am  saying, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that here it  says

that  it  is  necessary in a merger  based  on  the

principle  of partnership only in that merger,  the

P.A.P. merger, is it possible to protect the rights

of  the citizens whether born here or elsewhere, to

keep  their existing rights. I am saying, Sir, that

in  a complete merger, those rights will remain  by

law,  and it is not correct to suggest that, as  is

suggested  in paragraph 5 of col. 11, that  350,000

citizens   who   were  not  born  here   would   be

disenfranchised.

will never say to the Member for Anson that he  is,

in  fact,  confusing. In other words,  that  he  is

deliberately  confusing. I only say that  there  is

confusion mounting on confusion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> All right. I will try again. Sir,

at  the end of my address, I am going to appeal  to

the Government that we should have a constitutional

commission, or at least a consultant, on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



these   matters   in  which   I   am   taking   the

responsibility, in all sincerity, of saying to this

Government that this is not true. In so far  as  I,

according to my light, my training and my work  for

25  years, am concerned, I believe at least we  can

have  an  impartial expert body who can  judge  and

from  whom the people can accept the truth. Let  me

repeat. Sir, that I believe, in accordance with  my

training,  my work and my understanding,  that  the

position  in  a  complete  merger  would  be   that

Singapore   citizens   would   all   retain   their

citizenship,  and that the Federation  Constitution

does  not  permit of any Singapore  citizen  to  be

deprived of any of his rights as a citizen  in  the

State  of Singapore. But, Sir, what has the Federal

Constitution   done   in   the   Federation?    The

Constitution  not only made every  subject  of  the

ruler  retain his citizenship of the State, but  it

made  every subject of the ruler a Federal citizen.

In  a  legally admirable exposition by the Minister

for  Law, apart from one major error, which was,  I

am  quite  sure, inadvertent, he drew our attention

to Part XII of the citizenship of the Federation of

Malaya  provisions under the Federation  of  Malaya

Agreement of 1949, as amended in 1952, Sir. And  he

read,  but  did  not emphasise, that  section  125,

paragraph (a) states:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On and after the prescribed date, the following

persons  shall  be  citizens of the  Federation  of

Malaya by operation of law:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any subject of His Highness the Ruler of any

State;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the citizens of Singapore are in a position

analogous  to  the  subject of a ruler.  Where  the

Barisan Sosialis blundered was in drawing attention

to  Penang and Malacca. Penang and Malacca, Sir, by

virtue  of the fact that they were British colonies

with  no rajahs, had no citizens of the ruler. They

are  the  only two States which had no subjects  of

the  ruler, and consequently to speak of Penang and

Malacca  would  be to invoke not paragraph  (a)  of

section 125 but paragraph (b) of section 125  which

says  that  all those who were born in  Penang  and

Malacca  would achieve automatic citizenship  which

would make, as was quite rightly pointed out by Dr

Goh Keng Swee, 284,000 -

Thank  you. The Minister for Finance. They  pointed

out,  and  perfectly properly, an  error,  but  the

unfair-ness of it was that they did not  go  on  to

say  that,  in respect of the other States,  if  we

came  in  as  Johore,  or  Selangor,  Kelantan,  or

Trengganu,  then, on the analogous provision.  Sir,

the citizens of Singapore would all be citizens  of

the Federation because we would have the comparable

position of being subjects of a ruler.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these issues are in fact academic, and this

is  hardly  a forum for the academic discussion  of

constitutional law; because in truth and  in  fact,

Article  22,  in  so  far as  new  territories  are

concerned, supersedes all other provisions. What  I

was  trying  to  show  was  if  we  came  into  the

Federation  on the same basis as any  of  the  nine

Malay  States, then we would have all our citizens.

But  there is Article 22, and under Article 22,  of

course, it is the will of the Federation Parliament

as  to the provisions for our admission. But  I  do

want  to  point out that it is untrue to  say  that

under a complete merger it would necessarily follow

that   350,000  of  those  citizens  not  born   in

Singapore would be disenfranchised. Sir,  why  this

issue  about citizenship? What is it that makes  it

so  burning  a question? The leader of the  Barisan

Sosialis spoke of second-class citizenship,  and  I

completely agree with the Minister for Culture that

"there  ain't no such animal". Of course, there  is

not.  There is no question of second-class citizenship. But why this complaint?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 8 (2) of the Federal Constitution says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Except as expressly authorised by this

Constitution,  there  shall  be  no  discrimination

against  citizens on the ground only  of  religion,

race,  descent or place of birth in any law  or  in

the appointment to any office or employment under a

public authority or...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is why I ask the Member for Queenstown

to  read that second section when he read the first

one.  Article 8 provides against discrimination  of

citizens only in the Federation. Sir, we would  not

be Federal citizens and we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



could   quite  properly  be  discriminated  against

because  we  have  not  got the  fundamental  right

guaranteed by section (2) of Article 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, look at the next Article if you will, Mr

Speaker,  and that is Article 9. I am not  so  much

interested  in banishment, Sir, because  if  a  man

gets to that stage of being a burden on the country

where  he lives, then I am not interested. But  let

us get to Article 9 (2):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Subject to any restriction imposed by any law

relating to the security of the Federation,  public

order,   public   health,  or  the  punishment   of

offenders,  every  citizen has the  right  to  move

freely  throughout the Federation and to reside  in

any part thereof.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not "every person", but "every citizen", and

therefore, only Federal citizens may move freely in

the   Federation  and  may  reside  freely  in  the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the next article, Article

10:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'every citizen has the right to freedom of speech

and expression;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all citizens have the right to assemble peaceably

and without arms;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all citizens have the right to form associations.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not "every person", but "every citizen", and the

guaranteed  rights  are  the  rights  to   assemble

peacefully, to form associations and to freedom  of

speech and expression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they say and they are entitled to ask, what

is  the  practical  effect of this?  Is  there  any

immigration  barrier  between  Singapore  and   the

Federation? I think one of them already pointed out

that   a  number  of  us  live  and  work  in   the

Federation. So, what is the excitement about?  Sir,

the  position  is  this. We  are  not  second-class

citizens   vis-a-vis   the   Federation.   We   are

foreigners. We are in the position of most favoured

foreigners   and,  by  virtue  of   the   executive

discretion  of the Government as permitted  in  its

immigration  laws, are permitted  to  go  into  the

Federation  without any visas and  work  there.  We

have  the  same law applicable to them.  But  these

rights  are  not  guaranteed by  the  Constitution.

There  is  nothing to prevent the  Federation  from

raising barriers of immigration against us  now  or

under the White Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



Sir.  But  we could today reciprocate whilst  under

the  White Paper, and it is curious to notice  this

omission, but I believe that under the White  Paper

immigration   would  be  in  the   hands   of   the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Sir, the leader of the Barisan Sosialis

used  a  layman's phrase, picturesque  but  legally

inaccurate   when   he  spoke  about   second-class

citizens. The position in law, as I see it, is that

the   Singapore  citizen  is  a  foreigner  in  the

Federation; there by the grace and courtesy and the

goodwill of the Federation Government, but  without

any   constitutional  right.  But  the   Federation

citizen  will  have  a right  to  he  here  and  no

Singapore  Government  can keep  him  out,  for  no

Singapore  Government  will  have  the   power   to

prohibit  by  immigration  laws  or  otherwise  his

entry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Article 47 of the Federal

Constitution  provides that only  Federal  citizens

can  sit  in  the Federal Parliament, both  in  the

House of Representatives and the Senate. Sir,  will

the  people  of Singapore have to vote for  Federal

citizens  to  represent them,  or  is  the  Federal

Constitution   going  to  be  amended   to   permit

Singapore citizens to represent Singapore citizens?

It is possible, Sir, and knowing the Federation,  I

think that they would naturally wish to be fair  in

this  matter. In fairness, I think, though  it  has

not  been  indicated, the arrangement will probably

be  that  the Federal Constitution would be amended

in  order to permit our representatives to  sit  in

the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, apart from that one aspect which no

doubt would be clarified, the true position is that

the  Singapore  citizens will have no  more  rights

than he has today to enter, to live in, to work  in

the Federation or to join any political Parties  or

trade  unions in the Federation. You see,  Sir,  we

have,  for example, branches & the Alliance Parties

in  Singapore, but no Singapore political Party has

branches  in  the  Federation. Nor  under  the  new

arrangement would any Singapore political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



Party  have  any  right  to have  branches  in  the

Federation. Is this, Sir, the position of  Northern

Ireland as has been so repeatedly suggested? is it?

Mr  Speaker,  the answer is "no".  The  people  of

Northern  Ireland have an identity  of  citizenship

with  the United Kingdom. They have every right  to

be  in  England, to work in England and to vote  in

England; not that it is important, Sir, that  vote,

because I do not expect masses of our people to  go

over  to  the  Federation. That I  agree  with  the

Minister  for Culture, that the objection  that  we

cannot  go  and vote in Johore or cannot  stand  in

Trengganu  is in itself trivial. That  is  not  the

point.  The point is that we cannot have  what  the

Minister for Finance has so aptly called "a  common

political  life". We cannot have that,  Sir,  under

this new arrangement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Federation Prime Minister at the Airport

Press  conference stated he could not recommend  to

his  Parliament to grant Federal citizenship to all

Singapore citizens, because Singapore had been  lax

in  admitting citizens requiring in some cases only

two   years'   residence,  whereas  the  Federation

required  eight.  I would like to  point  out,  Mr

Speaker,  that  the  provision  about  two   years'

residence  only applies to Federation citizens  and

to  British subjects. The British subjects involved

are  those  who were born in India. But  the  major

number of those who obtained citizenship under  our

Citizenship Ordinance are those who qualified under

section 9, Sir, eight out of the previous 12 years'

residence in Singapore. This is somewhat similar to

the  Federation provision in Article 17, which  the

Minister for Law read, which requires eight  years'

total  residence.  The provision that  the  Federal

applicant  should be 45 years old and  should  know

the  Malay  language, as was  pointed  out  by  the

Member  for Queenstown, was not made applicable  in

the Federation until one year after Merdeka Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I come back to the last paragraph

on  page  10  [Hansard]. I would  like  to  refresh

Members' memories:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The most important interest that will be protected

in  a  merger based on the principle of partnership

is  that  Singapore citizens, whether born here  or

born   elsewhere,  will  keep  all  their   present

citizenship   rights  and,  in  addition,   acquire

national rights as nationals of the new Federation.

Nobody  will  lose any rights. On the  other  hand,

every  citizen will gain new national status  as  a

member  of  an  independent  and  larger  political

unit.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you have been told, and I will not repeat

it,  that "Federal national" is a phrase which does

not  appear in any part of the Federation. This  is

perfectly true. It was explained to you that  there

was  a  concept of nationalism which is as distinct

as  the concept of citizenship, which is also true.

What  you have not been told, Mr Speaker, Sir,  is

that a Federal national is a British subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry the Minister for Culture is so

engrossed  he did not hear that. I shall repeat.  A

Federal  national is a British subject. That  is  a

curious thing to say. Can I prove it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Article 29 (1) of the Federal Constitution:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In accordance with the position of the Federation

within  the  Commonwealth, every person  who  is  a

citizen of the Federation enjoys by virtue of  that

citizenship the status of a Commonwealth citizen in

common with the citizens of other Commonwealth countries.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by virtue, Sir, of section 1 of the British

Nationality  Act, every citizen of  the  Federation

has  the  status of a British subject. Our  present

position,  Mr  Speaker, is  that  we  are  British

subjects. We are citizens of the United Kingdom and

Colonies, and are also British subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what would happen, Sir, is that we would be

citizens of Malaysia and British subjects under the

new  agreement, because "Federal national"  is,  by

its  own  Article  29  and the  equivalent  British

provisions,  just  a  phrase which  means  "British

subject".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Paper tiger!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Devastating!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I do not want to devastate. I

want  to  persuade. Is it curious that we  question

this relationship which seems to give everything to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



one  side  and  nothing at all to the other?  Well,

what  is  it we want, Mr Speaker, for the Workers'

Party,  for the people of Anson and for myself'?  I

say  that we want a full and unconditional  merger.

We  want  to  accept the same responsibilities  and

enjoy the same privileges. We want to come in as  a

brother,  not  a  partner.  Partnerships   can   be

dissolved  and  can be dangerous.  If  we  talk  of

Ireland,  let us remember the tragedy  of  Southern

Ireland.  We  do  not want even the possibility  of

such a tragedy to occur in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say this quite frankly and very

clearly. What I honestly and sincerely fear in  the

very  marrow of my bones is that an arrangement  of

the  character  envisaged, which gives  our  people

different educational upbringing, gives our workers

different  treatment as compared to the Federation,

would  create  different  types  of  citizens;  and

because  of the overall Federal rule, would  create

friction which would all the time be blamed on  the

Federal Government. There is a very genuine danger,

Sir,I  am sorry to have to put a name  to  it.  I

think  we have to face it. There is a very  genuine

danger  that  such differentiation in  policies  of

education and labour would exacerbate and emphasise

communal differences and would bring about communal

explosion and tragedy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that those of us who are genuine about

merger  must  accept - I repeat  must  accept - Federal

control over our education, labour and our internal

security.  We should not seek to be different  from

any of the other States in matters which affect the

mood and the character of our citizens. We seek  to

build  a  common  citizenship.  The  Minister   for

Education  knows only too well his own  efforts  in

that  direction. He knows only too well the aim  of

any  State which must seek a common culture to have

a  common  loyalty. A differentiation in education,

which  seems to be the basis of the P.A.P. policy,

is  full of danger not only for us but also for the

Federation.  If you ask, would we be better  if  we

were separate - and that is a fair question that  was

asked, I think, by the Minister for Culture -  the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



point,  Mr Speaker, is this, that there would  not  be

the antagonism directed towards the Federation if there

was differentiation whilst we were separate. But whilst

we  are associated, where the blame seems to be at  the

Federation  doorstep  for anything  different  that  we

think  is  not  right  because  we  think  it  is   not

right - whether we think it rightly or wrongly - we  will

always be blaming the Federation. That is something  we

do not want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have experienced here in Singapore already

the tragedy of differentiation of education policy.  We

know  that as a result of the meanness of the  Imperial

Government  which did not want to spend money  for  the

education  of  immigrants - "Leave them in  the  gutter.

Their own people can look after them. We can only  give

education  to fodder for our commercial machine."  That

meanness,    Sir,   has   brought   about    today    a

differentiation  in  outlook  between  our   respective

communities - the Minister for Education knows that; hon.

Members  across  the Floor know that - a  differentiation

which  is the basic tragedy of Singapore today.  Do  we

want  to  perpetuate and accentuate,  to  enlarge  this

distinction on to the Malaysia scene?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to exaggerate. I cannot

exaggerate.  But I shall put it very simply.  In  fact,

Sir, I will be quite frank that if education and labour

were given to the Federation, the White Paper would  be

more  acceptable to me, and I do not care if  it  means

the end of my political career.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I do not care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Say it again a second time!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I will say it again and I mean it.

These  differentiation in labour and education,  in  my

view,  must  ultimately affect  the  stability  of  the

entire Malaysia concept. Singapore is the pivot in  the

Malaysia concept.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Federation Prime Minister informed U.M.N.O.

that  the  Federation Malays fear that  they  would  be

swamped  by our Chinese. That is true, Sir. That  is  a

genuine fear. But there does not seem to have been  any

consistent effort to explain to them that Singapore  in

a   complete  merger  would  have  no  more   than   25

representatives in the House of Representatives and two

representatives  in a Senate of 30  of  Malaysia.  Sir,

many  figures  have  been  given  to  you  - involved

arithmetic in which our Prime Minister excels  - and  I

suggest  that there is a major error which the Minister

for  Law  failed  to  observe when  he  suggested  that

proportionate representation is not provided for in the

Constitution. In fact, Article 116 (3) does provided as

between  a  State  and a country,  whereas  clause  (4)

applies  to the constituencies in a State. Sir,  clause

(4)  is not material in this context but clause (3)  is

material  as between a State and a country. There  must

be  given  to that State a proportion of the  seats  in

accordance  with the proportion of its  voters  to  the

total voters of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one of the Members opposite - it may

well  be  the  Minister  for Law - gave  us  the  latest

Federation  figure as 2,345,000 voters. Sir, assuming - as  he said quite rightly -  that in 1964 the Federation

will  have a House of 100. So the proportion is 23,500.

Now,  Sir,  Singapore has 624,000 voters.  The  Barisan

Sosialis are not so far wrong when they tell you  that,

in fact, the exact number is somewhere about 27 seats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have here with me the

Report  of  the Election Commission on the Delimitation

of  Parliamentary and State Constituencies, 1960. Table

I  of this Report works out the Federal seats State  by

State,  and  it  is worked out in this way.  The  total

Federation  population  is divided  by  the  number  of

constituencies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



which  are  fixed by Article 46. Article  46  fixes

them  at  100.  The total population  is  given  as

6,278,763.  Now that is divided by  the  number  of

constituencies  which are fixed in Article  46.  If

you  divide that figure by 100, then you  will  get

the population quota of 62,787. In the same way, if

you  take  the  total electorate of the  Federation

which  is  2,310,747 and divide that also  by  100,

then  you  will get the electoral quota of  23,107.

They  do  it this way, Mr Speaker, Sir.  (A)  They

divide  the  State  population  by  the  population

quota - just the overall population figure divided by

100.  (B) They take the total voting power  of  the

State  and  divide it by the electoral quota.  They

have  a  formula, Mr Speaker, Sir.  They  add  the

allocation according to the population quota (A) to

twice  the  allocation according to  the  electoral

quota (B) and divide the result by three, State  by

State.  That is how they get the number of  Federal

seats for each State. So that I have also worked it

out  in this way. I checked in the Electoral Office

this  morning and I was told that the latest figure

of  Singapore electors is 619,867. Sir, if you  add

the population of Singapore, which is 1,600,000, to

6,278,763  and  if  you add 619,867  to  the  total

Federation   electorate  of   2,310,747   the   new

population  quota  will  be  78,787  and  the   new

electoral  quota will be 29,306 and  use  the  same

formula,  you  will get the total of  20.87  or  21

Federal    seats    for    Singapore - mathematically

accurate, Sir.

Federation have a population of 6,278,000 and  that

we  have 1,600,000. Now, Sir, that makes us just  a

quarter of them, and my arithmetic of a quarter  of

100  is  25, but of course I do not know the P.A.P.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the P.A.P.

way. It is the method that has been adopted by  the

Electoral  Commission in the Federation  of  Malaya

and  not  by the P.A.P. The same formula  is  being

used. You can blame the P.A.P. when they deserve to

be  blamed, but blame other people if they  deserve

to be blamed and not us, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If going by the Constitution those

figures are correct, I will accept them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I make the figure, Sir, 25. I would like you

to  understand  this. Sir. The  fact  that  we  are

getting less - I am not making any issue of that -

is, to my mind, a minor point. But what I am trying

to  explain is, if the Federation could explain  to

these people that there is no swamping and that, in

fact, if they are worried about 25, we would rather

have  15,  I would gladly concede it. If there  was

really integration, Sir, I will gladly concede  it.

The   Barisan  Sosialis  looked  very   pained   at

me - sometimes I am a hero, and sometimes I  am  not!

But, to my mind, that is the way it works. I am not

unconscious,  Mr Speaker, that the Federation  has

got  its own problems in labour and education which

are  a  headache, and that it fears that  with  the

additions of Singapore it would enhance and magnify

these  problems.  And I would add  that  these  are

legitimate fears. But the real fear, Sir - that could

be  controlled,  I  think, and  could  be  provided

for - was given in a short interjection by the Member

for Geylang Serai. It consisted of three words.  It

was worth a speech. The Member for Queen-town asked

a rhetorical question, "Why does the Federation not

want to accept Singapore in a complete merger?" And

the  Member  for  Geylang  Serai  said,  "Too  many

Communists!" Sir, that is the true reason.  Whether

it  is  right or wrong is not the question. Let  us

face it. People are afraid of putting names to ugly

things. But in this Assembly, I think we should  as

far as possible face the facts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



and  not indulge too much in euphemisms. That is  a

basic  fact.  Now, Sir, are there  really  so  many

Communists in Singapore? I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Plague-carrying rats!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Well, that kind of interjection is

not helpful. What I want to know are facts. I think

what  we all should have are facts. We have  had  a

diarrhoea  of  words and a constipation  of  facts.

What  I  would like the Prime Minister,  whose  pet

hobby  this  is, to do is to tell us quite  frankly

how many Communists there are. My own impression is

that there might be a threat tomorrow. I can see no

threat today. I understand that the total number of

Communists in the whole of the Federation was  some

545 - I may be wrong in my figure, I am quoting from

memory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> How did you get that?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I read very recently, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that they are supposed to be limited  to  the

Thai border. I should like to know and I think this

House  should  be  given the information - since  the

Prime  Minister not only has information  available

to  the  Special  Branch but information  available

from his pals -  what is the number of Communists  in

Singapore?  He  has pointed to, I  think,  about  a

dozen  in  a dozen radio speeches  - which one  could

almost   appropriately   name   as   the   art   of

treachery - how  I  stabbed my  friends  and  double-crossed my colleagues. Even working in the dark  as

we  are,  I would like to ask this question:  would

not  the  Federation be in a stronger  position  to

deal with our Communists if we were fully merged as

it   could   deal  with  them  under  the   present

arrangement? If the Federation cannot, I would like

to  know  why,  Sir,I think we should  have  these

reasons. Some of us are capable of persuasion,  and

I  think it is important that basic reasons and not

the hates passing back and forth should be given to

the people of Singapore. That is one of the reasons

I  would  like  to  hear  it  claimed  why  is  the

Federation  in  a stronger position  to  deal  with

Singapore Communist, who are only Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



citizens,   than  it  is  to  deal  with  Singapore

Communists who are Federal citizens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have tried to read the Constitution, and I

can  see  one reason. That is, if you are a Federal

citizen  by  operation  of law,  then  they  cannot

deprive you of citizenship. And I say, fair enough.

That  is reasonable. Again I am going to be awfully

unpopular, but for myself, I am prepared to  accept

that the citizenship of the people of Singapore  as

citizens of the Federation should be deemed  to  be

registered Federal citizens under the provisions of

Article 17. There is a distinction, Sir. Those  who

are  citizens  by  operation  of  law,  you  cannot

deprive  them  of citizenship. But  those  who  are

citizens by registration, you can deprive  them  of

citizenship. And I am prepared to accept that: that

we  should all have a citizenship that is deemed to

be a citizenship under the provisions of Article 17

by  registration.  So that those  of  us  whom  the

Central  Government  of Malaysia  considers  to  be

inimical  to the welfare of the State by virtue  of

our  activities can be deprived of our  citizenship

in the same way as Federal citizens today under the

Constitution who are citizens by registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wonder whether those who say that Singapore has too many Communists really mean Communists or mean persons who are, shall we say,

sympathetic  to Communism. Because  again,  let  us

recognise  the  basic fact of  our  life  here - many

people  believe,  that a number of  the  industrial

workers  of Singapore are sympathetic to Communism.

Sir,  there has been so much misunderstanding about

the  Chinese. I should like for a very brief period

to give what I understand to be the true position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say it is true that by virtue of cultural

heritage  the  majority of our  industrial  Chinese

have  strong emotional attachments to China. I  say

it is true, in my view, that our idealistic Chinese

youth  are attracted to Marxian concepts of  social

justice.  I  believe it is equally true that  these

youth are learning that social justice can only  be

achieved    by   the   evolutionary   process    of

parliamentary democracy. They are learning that the

Communist procedure of dictatorship,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



of   brutality,   and  of  destruction   of   human

liberties, may have been necessary to restore order

and cohesion in a country of 600 million people who

are prostrate before the carrion-crows, imperialist

commercial  exploiters. But such  a  procedure  and

such  an  ideology is not merely inappropriate  but

retrograde  and  repressive  where,  as   in   this

territory, the democratic process is a fact and the

rule  of  the majority can be achieved by a patient

wait of four years at the most. No one believes the

Chinese  to be fools. They are not. I say  to  you,

they are a practical people and so are their youth,

however idealistic. They are not unconscious of the

terrible   price   in   human   suffering,    human

degradation  and  inhuman  limitations   which   is

exacted  by the Communist dictatorship.  They  will

learn.  We  all,  not only the  Chinese,  Sir,  are

learning   that  human  beings  can  only   develop

healthfully  in  conditions  of  respect  for   the

individual  within the context of the rule  of  the

majority,  with  respect  for  the  minority.   The

blasphemy  of Communism is that it has  no  respect

for the individual. And our people are learning it.

They  know from stories they hear from Chinese,  of

stories  they hear from Hong Kong, that the  people

in  Communist China are crushed into a common mould

producing  men like ants. No one wants  this  here,

Sir. I  know  I  have  heard  sneers - forgive   the

expression, Sir, but they sound like it to me  that

the  Barisan Sosialis want it. For myself, I cannot

see it. For myself, I have talked to the Member for

Queenstown and the Member for Nee Soon,  and  they

seem to me genuinely intelligent people. It is true

I  cannot judge. I cannot look into their hearts. I

do  not  know.  But  I find it  very  difficult  to

believe  that they are not conscious of  the  basic

facts  of  life and the inhumanity of the blasphemy

of Communism.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Let them say so.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am not speaking for them. I am

not  their  spokesman. Forgive me, Sir,  no,  I  am

speaking  for myself. I mean, I do not  know.  They

can  speak  for themselves, but I am sure  when  it

comes to their turn, I hope they will.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some people in Singapore, I

accept,   who  are  so  dedicated  to  the  Marxian

concepts of social justice that they are blind. And

they  blind themselves consciously, and they  plug

their  ears to logic in order to prevent themselves

from  learning  that those methods of  cruelty,  of

violence  to the human spirit, are not the  methods

which  can  bring about social justice.  There  are

such  people. But there are cranks in every way  of

life,  Sir, and in every field of life. I say,  the

mass  of our people do not want the methods of  the

Communist dictatorship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the P.A.P. was returned with 43 seats - a

fantastic  majority -   everybody  said,  "Huh,   the

people  of Singapore are Communists. They  voted  a

Communist Party in." Let us be fair, Sir, I said at

Nanyang University to my political opponent  before

election  day,  "The only vote is  for  the  P.A.P.

because  it is the only Party that today [i.e.,  at

that  time, not today, but in 1959] could offer  an

honest, efficient government." And that is why  the

people of Singapore voted them in, not because  the

people  of Singapore are Left or because they  want

Communists.  Sir, our people want  a  just,  decent

government, want a fair way of life. And they  know

the  only  way  to achieve it is by  the  sometimes

cumbersome,   sometimes   hypocritical,   sometimes

inefficient, but in the long run the only way,  and

that  is  the  way  of  evolutionary  parliamentary

democracy.

valuable lessons. These lessons are being digested.

And  I  say, with patience and, above all,  with  a

just  government, our people of Singapore will come

through  and will come good. Very few of  us,  Sir,

seeing  the  trees only and forgetting the  forest,

want  to raise at this juncture a roar of laughter.

I  shall reserve this on the main motion when  hon.

kitchen utensils across the floor. It is not that I

have not got it now. But I am reserving it, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to say this. Do not let us give

up  hope of complete merger. I will compliment  the

P.A.P. on having got what it has, even though  what

it  has  got  so  far is, to my  mind,  not  merely

inadequate  but,  by  virtue  of  what  it  has  in

reserve,  is  dangerous  and  by  virtue   of   our

financial  contribution is, in a measure, suicidal.

I  would urge, Sir, that we do not give up hope  of

complete merger. We have come a long way. Singapore

is vita] to the Federation. I was reminded, Sir, by

the  gentleman  who  represented  U.M.N.O. at  the

Commonwealth  Parliamentary Association.  He  said,

"Marshall,   you   remember   addressing   U.M.N.O.

Assembly  in Kuala Lumpur in 1956 and you  compared

Singapore  to the thumb of a hand? The  Federation

are  the, four fingers and Singapore is the thumb."

He said, "I have always remembered that." Singapore

is the thumb.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am happy in the interjection. I

am  indebted to the Deputy Prime Minister.  We  are

the  thumb  of  the five States. No. That  will  be

giving  us  pride  of  place  which,  as  a  humble

citizen,  I would not seek. Pride of place  belongs

as of right to the Federation. But we are certainly

a  vital, absolutely vital element, the pivot.  And

the  Tunku who has proved himself a statesman,  not

for  One  year,  not for two years, not  for  three

years  but  over  the  last seven  years  with  his

command of expert advisers, with his treasure-house

of available information, must be all too conscious

of  that.  And I say, Sir, what deters him,  to  my

mind, is that not that he does not want Singapore - I

do  not  know whether he does - but to my mind,  what

deters him is the belief, and I accept that it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



a  correct  belief, that the Federation  of  Malaya

citizens  as  a  whole  would  be  alarmed  by  the

prospect  of  a  complete  merger  because  of  the

constant  denigration by our  Prime  Minister,  the

constant denigration by our own politicians of  our

own    people,    the   constant   cheapening    of

Singapore - Communists,    Communists,    Communists,

lepers, lepers, lepers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> There are lepers.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> There are lepers. How many lepers

are  there in Singapore, Mr Speaker, Sir?  Are  we

all  lepers? So I say, given time, given  patience,

given that the Federation recognises - they are  not

playing  a game of bluff; I do not believe  that  a

bit - but  if  they  can  get Singapore  under  these

conditions,  why  should they  give  us  any  other

condition   which   might  make   life   a   little

politically  difficult?  I  believe  that  they  do

recognise  how vital we are. Given time  and  given

patience, I say I believe that the Federation would

itself recognise its long-term interest. And I mean

the  people  of  the  Federation,  not  merely  the

Government.   They   recognise   their    long-term

interest.  So the people of Singapore  should  grow

the   same  flowers  in  the  same  garden  as  the

Federation; the same educational policy;  the  same

labour  policy; the same people; the same interest;

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> With respect, Mr Speaker, to the

will always be lallang in every garden. But so long

as  the lallang is kept in hand and so long as  the

grass, and the best way of having the same grass is

to  have all under one gardener. Otherwise you grow

lallang  here,  how are you going to  prevent  this

for   two  hours,  that  we  must  have  a   common

educational  policy; we must have a  common  labour

policy; we must have a common central government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only a last matter. Here [make a plea. I

have,  not  without anxious thought, I assure  you,

Mr  Speaker, but with considerable thought, worked

on   these  constitutional  problems  without   any

assistance  because  I sought  assistance  and  was

refused  it. And I shall come to that later  on.  I

was  refused it. I say in all sincerity to you, Mr

Speaker,  and with a sense of my responsibility  as

an  Assemblyman  that  the  reasons  given  in  His

Excellency's policy speech are not true.  In  these

circumstances,  I  appeal  to  the  Government   to

appoint  a  constitutional  commission  which  will

assist   the   Government,   which   will   receive

representations,  which could answer  queries.  The

cost,  if  we  slip up, because the Prime  Minister

thinks he is a wonderful lawyer - he may be; we  saw

the exhibition in the Ong Eng Guan tribunal; he may

be  a wonderful lawyer - but he can slip. I say  let

us  appoint a constitutional commission of experts,

not politicians; international experts with no axes

to  grind  so  that they guide the Government,  the

people  and  the Assembly. I am so heartened,  Sir,

that I had nods of the head from the Deputy Premier

and  it should give me considerable pleasure, after

all the effort, that in fact that is one suggestion

he  has  in mind and he is going to carry  it  out.

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is it a point of order? If it

is  a  point of order, the Member should rise on  a

point  of order. If it is clarification, the Member

cannot speak until the Minister sits down. Is it  a

point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minster sit down?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> remaining standing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> But I shall also direct my

remarks to the real forces that operate behind  the

13 braves opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I shall confine my remarks to problems of

education as are affected by the amendment  to  the

motion before the House, I shall, of course,  deal

with its implications on other aspects of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official beginning of trouble with the forces

behind  the  Barisan  Sosialis  was  the  statement

published  by the six unionists on 2nd June,  1961,

the  eve  of National Day, for full internal  self-government  and abolition of the Internal  Security

Council at the 1963 constitutional talks. These big

six  were  supposedly comrades  of  ours - three  ex-Political Secretaries, the Member for Thomson, who

is  not in the House at this moment, and two others

who are now in the Strangers' Gallery -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister, I think, must

know  that no direct reference can ever be made  to

any  stranger in the Gallery. The Hon. Minister  is

addressing the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I apologise for the slip. Mr

Speaker.  These  forces were quite happy  operating

under  a tolerant P.A.P. Left-wing Government which

ensured full exercise of their democratic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



rights. The Member for Queenstown took great  pains

to  point out that there was nothing in "The  Tasks

Ahead",  i.e. our  1959 election programme,  which

states that immediate merger was a target under the

1959/1964  programme  of the  P.A.P.  Correct.  The

forces  behind the Barisan Sosialis talk of merger;

that,  of course, they support merger; that  merger

is inevitable and the whole singsong. But sheer lip

service  and  nothing else. Their calculations  are

not  for a forseeable merger, but merger which  is

far,  far away like the horizon - always there,  but

never  reached. Conclusion - no merger. They are  not

Malayan  patriots.  They have other  designs.  What

these so-called great anti-colonialists want is  to

continue to live under the British colonialists and

internal  self-government as we have now. The  only

difference?  No  Internal  Security  Council.  Only

those  who  are  security risks fear  the  Internal

Security   Council.   However,   to   make    their

proposition  appear  more  in  accord  with   their

customary anti-colonial pose, they add the  phrase,

"minimum  demands". But I say that  these  are  not

minimum  demands. They have always been  what  they

stood for. The last five months and also after 7½

hours of tedious twists and turns by the Member for

Queenstown,  he  came back to the same  theme  that

under  the  present constitution the Government  is

required to go back to the United Kingdom  in  1963

and there to reopen talks for "minimum demands"  if

the Barisan Sosialis type of merger as expressed in

the  amendment to the motion is rejected. Now, what

is  the  exact implication of the amendment to  the

motion?  It  is  simply a case of a  swing  by  the

Barisan  Sosialis from one extreme  to  the  other,

from  minimum demands to maximum demands, from full

internal   self-government  without  the   Internal

Security   Council,  which  is  what  the   Barisan

Sosialis  really  want, to asking for  unreasonable

terms for merger with the Federation, which neither

the  Government of Singapore nor the Government  of

the  Federation nor its peoples can accept, at  the

stage  of  history,  and  therefore,  to  frustrate

merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis do not want merger despite

pious  statements  made in  this  Assembly  by  the

Member for Queenstown that the Barisan Sosialis are

not  afraid  of merger and not afraid  of  internal

security  being  controlled  by  a  strong  central

government, ad nauseam. They are empty words  which

rung   hollow   to   the  ears  of   true   Malayan

nationalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Minister for Health and Law,

has  already  explained  fully  the  constitutional

position  regarding citizenship, that the amendment

to the motion seeking automatic Federal citizenship

for  all  Singapore  citizens  is  an  unreasonable

demand in that we shall be asking for more favoured

treatment   for   Singapore   citizens   than   the

Federation Constitution is prepared to give to  its

own  local-born  in  the  original  States  of  the

Federation.  The principle of jus soli only  became

operative in the Federation from 31st August, 1957.

In  negotiations, one should know in what  position

one  stands.  It  is  not  a  case  of  a  colonial

Federation  of  Malaya wanting  to  merge  with  an

independent   Singapore,   but   a   self-governing

Singapore  under  British  suzerainty  wanting   to

achieve   independence  through  merger  with   the

independent Federation of Malaya. We must  come  to

reasonable terms with the Federation, and  that  we

have.  We  should  discuss  and  talk  reason,  not

balderdash.  As  elected  representatives  of   the

people,  we  must be responsible and  be  political

realists and not hot air slogan shouters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Member for Cairnhill was correct in

calling for the unanimous support of the House  for

the  motion for merger standing in the name of  the

Minister  for  Labour  and has  asked  the  Barisan

Sosialis  to withdraw its amendment to the  motion,

which  is  not likely to succeed, he tried  at  the

same  time to belittle the White Paper, Cmd. 33  of

1961, as not being a merger at all. We say it is  a

merger because if we see Head 5 of the White Paper,

it  says,  "Singapore will be a  State  within  the

Federation  but on special conditions  and  with  a

larger  measure  of local autonomy than  the  other

States forming the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



Federation."  if  we  turn to the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's speech, that is, Hansard, Vol. 15, No.  1,

col.  11, the first sentence of paragraph 5,  which

the    Member   for   Anson   referred   to   quite

considerably, it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We do not recommend complete merger...'.



<br><br>for  a number of reasons. So perhaps the Member for

Cairnhill - unfortunately   he   is   not   in    the

House - should  at least clear in his  own  mind  the

difference between the words "merger" and "complete

merger"   and  the  motion  before  the  House   is

"merger".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment proposed by the Member for

Queenstown, however, introduces the word  "genuine"

to  merger, which again is different from  complete

merger.  The  Barisan Sosialis  type  of  so-called

genuine merger goes very much further than complete

merger. In the case of complete merger, like Penang

and Malacca, there can be no autonomy for education

and   labour,   which  must  go  to   the   central

government,  and only those born in  Singapore  may

become  Federal  citizens by operation  of  law  if

agreed  to  by the Federation. Those  not  born  in

Singapore  would have to apply to be registered  or

naturalized   as  Federal  citizens,  which   means

disenfranchising  half  of the  present  number  of

Singapore citizens. The Barisan Sosialis type of so-called  genuine  merger means  more  than  complete

merger, because they want all Singapore  citizens,

of  which one-half are estimated to be not born  in

Singapore, to be automatically Federal citizens  on

Merger Day; and not only that but that such Federal

citizenship be irrevocable. The Minister for Health

and  Law has already explained the unreasonableness

of  these conditions. To ordinary people, the  word

"complete"  cannot be qualified. To ask  for  more

than  complete  merger as required by  the  Barisan

Sosialis   shows   a   lack   of   sincerity    and

reasonableness. The term "genuine merger"  used  by

the   Barisan  Sosialis,  therefore,  has  as  much

meaning as counterfeit coins being passed around as

genuine.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why do we recommend merger with autonomy, in

education  and other agreed subjects?  The  Member

for   Queenstown  first  described   our   proposed

autonomy  in  education as a sop  and  later  as  a

source  of  disunity and not unity of  the  Malayan

nation,  because  he said we shall  be  pursuing  a

different educational system from that existing  in

the  Federation, and this received a  Hear,  hear!"

from  a Backbencher, the Member for Anson, who also

has  left  the  House. If the Barisan Sosialis  has

described  the  Federation's  education  policy  as

being  misguided  and,  on the  other  hand,  wants

Singapore  to  give up its autonomy  on  education,

then  to  suggest that we should follow  what  they

consider to be a misguided policy, we have to ask -

what, in fact, are they advocating? My colleague,

the  Minister  for Culture, has asked  the  Barisan

Sosialis - and  that will also apply  to  the  United

People's Party - to indicate categorically to  this

House  that  they do fully support the Rahman-Talib

Report on Education of the Federation with all  its

implications. I shall state the position in full.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, does the Barisan Sosialis accept the

condition that Government aid should not be granted

to  Chinese  secondary schools unless they  convert

them  to  national-type schools?  That  is,  where

Chinese as a language of instruction may be used or

taught up to one-third of the curriculum time,  and

students are to be prepared for public examinations

using the official languages, Malay and English. At

this   stage, may  I,  Mr  Speaker,   with   your

permission, read the English text of the speech  of

the  Federation's Minister for Education, the  Hon.

Inche Abdul Rahman Bin Haji Talib when he moved the

Second  Reading of the Education Act, 1961, in  the

Dewan  Ra'ayat, October, 1961. I managed to  get  a

copy which I shall later on lay before the House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member is

acquainted with the Standing Order which enables  a

Member  to read short extracts from books or papers

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



support  of  his  argument. So  it  must  be  short

extracts.  But,  of  course, there  is  nothing  to

prevent  the  Hon.  Minister from paraphrasing  any

long paragraphs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Thank you. I just thought that

I  should  really use the words of  the  Federation

Minister for Education instead of paraphrasing.  It

is rather an important matter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It should be short extracts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Yes. I will read the last two

sentences at page 8, paragraph 30:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the interest of national unity, therefore,

the   Government   [that   means   the   Federation

Government]  has  decided that  education  financed

from  public funds after the primary stage must  be

mainly through one of the official languages.  This

is not a new decision. It has been the Government's

policy for five years.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I shall put is: Will the

Barisan  Sosialis  support  the  discontinuance  by

Government  of public examinations in  the  Chinese

medium for secondary schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is: Is the Barisan Sosialis

prepared to accept the statement made by the Deputy

Prime  Minister of the Federation of Malaya in  his

address  at  the last Convocation of the University

of  Malaya held at Kuala Lumpur on 10th June, 1961,

published in the University of Malaya Gazette  Vol.

2, No. 3, June 1961, page 8? I shall read the third

paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I would like to add that it is the firm view of

the  Federation Government that any institution  of

higher  education in this country must come  within

our National Structure of Education. The Government

will not allow any such institution to grow outside

the main stream of our National Education system as

it  would  obviously be an obstacle to the creation

and  growth  of  a united Malayan  Nation  with  an

undivided loyalty to this country.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the answers from the Barisan Sosialis to

these  three questions? So far, silence,  except  a

counter  retort, "What do you think about it?"  It

is   because  we  know  what  those  Questions  and

problems mean that we have asked for local autonomy

in  education. We subscribe to the 1955  Report  of

the All Party Committee of the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



Legislative  Assembly  on Chinese  Education  which

first  announced  the principle of equal  treatment

for the four language streams in Singapore. May  we

ask  what is the educational policy of the  Barisan

Sosialis?  Every meeting of the Barisan  Sosialis

is  nothing but a denunciation of the P.A.P. and  a

call   for  a  general  election.  The  people   of

Singapore  and indeed the Federation want  to  know

what they stand for and how they propose to achieve

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to the great credit of the Tunku and his

Government  that  they appreciate the  position  of

Singapore and have full confidence in the sincerity

of  the  P.A.P.  Government to bring about  Malayan

loyalty    and   consciousness   in   its   present

educational  policy. I refer, Sir,  to  Part  2 - The

Tasks Ahead, page 4 - "Spring Source of our Nation",

which  is  the  educational policy  of  the  P.A.P.

issued during the last elections. I shall read just

one paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Since 1955 there has been a considerable change

in   the   political  conditions  in  Malaya.   The

Federation is now an independent country. It has  a

constitution  which recognises Malay  as  the  only

national   and  official  language,   and   for   a

transition  period,  English is  to  be  the  other

official language. If the ultimate independence  of

Singapore, to which we aspire, is intimately linked

with  a  merger  with  the Federation  then  it  is

obvious   our  education  policy  must  also   take

cognisance  of  the fact that we must  also  accept

Malay  as the national language. The case for Malay

as the national language has already been presented

in  detail  in  the P.A.P. souvenir publication  in

November 1958 and again recently in our party organ

"Petir".   Acceptance  of  Malay  as  the  national

language  does not contradict, but on the  contrary

supplements  the recommendations of  the  All-Party

Committee on Chinese education. [It should  be  the

Report of All-Party Committee on Chinese Education.

That  is  a  misprint.]  The  study  of  the  Malay

language  will not only act as a bridge  that  will

span  simultaneously our four streams of  education

but  it  will also help us to cross the Straits  of

Johore into the Federation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. therefore had the political foresight

to  put forward acceptance of Malay as the national

language    before   our   predominantly    Chinese

electorate in the 1959 elections and won by an over-whelming vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only six per cent of the present school

population in Singapore using Malay as the language

medium of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



instruction, the task of making Malay the  national

language  de facto is a herculean task which  needs

both  time and effort to accomplish. Our record  of

work  in  this regard for the past 24  years  bears

testimony  to  our  earnestness in  achieving  this

objective  at  the  earliest possible  date.  Pious

protestations of loyalty are not sufficient. We are

judged by deeds and actions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to avoid all possibility of

misunderstanding  and  unhappiness   over   Chinese

education  in Singapore that we insisted  on  local

autonomy for education in our merger proposals. The

Member  for Queenstown, in criticising our proposed

autonomy  in  education, referred to the  wholesale

influx  of  Chinese from the Federation  coming  to

Singapore  to  join our schools in  order  to  take

examinations  in the Chinese medium, but  expressed

regret   that  these  certificates  would  not   be

recognised outside of Singapore. The moral to  this

is  clear.  Those  in Singapore who  are  currently

agitating   against   the   Government   with   the

mischievous  allegation that "Chinese education  is

being  eliminated" when Singapore is the only place

in  the  whole of South-East Asia to give it  equal

treatment, should ponder why many Chinese from  the

Federation  have  come  and  are  still  coming  to

Singapore to join our schools, if Chinese education

is  really  being eliminated, would people  migrate

here?  Only  those  who feed on lies,  distortion,

misrepresentation and who go out of  their  way  to

bring about misery and unhappiness pursue this line

of action, and they are evil men indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown asked whether there

would  be a ban on the entry of Federation students

to  Singapore. This does not arise. We admit to our

schools   children   of  permanent   residents   of

Singapore. As for our examination certificates,  we

cannot  force  others to recognise the certificates

we  issue.  But  so  long as we  maintain  adequate

standards   in   the   conduct   of   our    public

examinations, it is, I consider, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

reasonable  to  assume  that  friendly  governments

would  accept the worth of certificates  which  the

Singapore Government is prepared to recognise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



That is why we pay so much attention to the maintenance

of  academic standards in our educational institutions,

and  we  allot one-quarter of our Budget for education,

because Singapore has no natural resources and our only

assets  are human resources to be educated and  trained

to the highest pitch possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown, before he ended his

marathon  speech - for  length  of  speech  and  not  for

quality of contents - proudly announced the rise of a new

star  in the political firmament. Mr Speaker, Sir,  in

the  late thirties, the world was enthralled with Edgar

Snow's  account of "Red Star over China".  Perhaps  the

Member  for  Queenstown has visions of seeing  his  Red

Star  over  Malaya. I say the Red Star of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  is an evil star and bodes ill for  those  who

follow its reckless course. On the same note, I say the

amendment proposed by the Member for Queenstown  should

be rejected.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I rise

to  support our Party's amendment to this motion.  This

amendment  is  as  important  as  the  action  we  have

taken - to  quit from the Government side.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  the  country would have no peace if one  side  is

trying  to  exploit the other side trying to take  away

the interests of the people, such as the case of merger

between  Singapore and the Federation proposed  by  the

P.A.P.  Singapore citizens cannot automatically  become

citizens   of   the  Federation.  Mr   Speaker,   Sir,

exploitation  is  made by man, made by  the  privileged

class  against the under-privileged class and the  non-privileged  class. That is why the world has  no  peace

for the last few thousand years. These no-peace periods

in our world are still existing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, citizenship is the fundamental

right  of the people. Without citizenship, there is  no

necessity   to  talk  of  other  rights,  powers   and

interests. Merger can only take place if the interests,

rights and powers of the people are safeguarded. It can

only take place



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



with  the  people's consent. There will be  no  consent

whatsoever if their basic rights are not protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our demands are clear - we want all Singapore citizens

to become automatically citizens of the Federation once

merger  has  taken  place. We also  want  proportionate

representation  in the Central Government  between  the

two  territories. These are our minimum demands. If the

people  are to be united, we cannot have two  types  of

citizens in one country. If such a thing happens, there

is  sure  to be a conflict between the two territories.

Instances  can  be cited. Sir. Racial conflicts  always

happen in the U.S.A. and South Africa and in some other

territories. These instances should have taught  us  to

change our minds and bring splits to unity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today in every corner of Singapore,

we  can  hear people talking about merger, and  at  the

same  time and at the same place they are scolding  the

P.A.P. Government. It is very interesting, Sir, to  sit

in the coffeeshops and at hawker stalls on the roadside

and hear the people gossip about merger. Although it is

gossip, they mean it. They talk so frankly that we know

they  care very much for this merger issue. Why,  Sir?

Because  they care for their livelihood. They care  for

their  future generation. They care for the welfare  of

the  majority of the people in Singapore. They care for

the  destiny  of our country, unlike the  P.A.P. which

just cares for her own interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of merger, the people are worrying

about the interests of our country. But the P.A.P. only

cares  for  the  interests of the  Party.  Perhaps  the

interests  of the P.A.P. are above the people,  because

the  P.A.P. comes from the people. Those who  dare  not

fight  for  the interests of the people on this  merger

issue  are  fools. If they are not fools they  are  co-wards. They always bow to something for nothing. But  I

would  like  to tell them that the people of  Singapore

will not bow to a ruling clique for nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not forcing the Tunku to accept our demands.

We only put down all reasonable facts and arguments for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



the  Tunku and the P.A.P. Government to see and  to

study.   Our   demands  can  be  achieved   through

negotiations  between  the representatives  of  the

people   of   both  territories,  not  the   P.A.P.

Government, Sir. After putting our reasonable facts

and  arguments  before them, the P.A.P.  Government

still  continues to ignore the wishes of the people

and  carries a one-Party conference with the Tunku.

Then  the P.A.P. must shoulder all consequences  if

anything happens and not be like Chew Swee Kee  who

once  called  himself a man of honour.  After  many

talks on merger between the Prime Ministers of  the

Federation  and  Singapore and in  the  Legislative

Assembly  of  Malaya,  the  term  "merger"  becomes

clearer. And now the people know what merger means.

The  Federation Government has said that she  would

take  Singapore in as a partner with  no  power  to

deal  with  foreign affairs, defence  and  internal

security.  Singapore will become, Sir, "independent

through partnership -"



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> On a point of of order, Sir.

The  statement made by the Member for Changi is not

factually  correct, i.e., that Singapore  will  not

have  any say in foreign affairs, and so on and  so

forth, when we are represented in the Parliament in

the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Of course, that is not a point of

order. It is a point of argument.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, before I came to this

House I know there will be many interruptions  from

the Government side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Only one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> They will come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in a merger as proposed by the

P.A.P.,  Singapore will have less  power  and  less

rights  than  we are now enjoying. Is  that  called

"independence"   when  our   powers,   rights   and

interests   are   taken  away?   Is   that   called

"independence" when our destiny is  handed  from  a

colonial  regime to the P.A.P. ruling clique,  then

to  a  Right-wing Government in the Federation?  Is

that called "independence" when our citizenship  is

deprived? The people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  are  not a football that can  be  kicked

about.  The P.A.P. has no right to talk  of  merger

with  Malaya because the P.A.P. is not  trusted  by

the  people  any more. We want a true and  complete

merger between Singapore and Malaya that will bring

all  citizens of Singapore and Malaya to become one

single  Malayan  citizen. These new  citizens  must

enjoy equal rights. The P.A.P. leaders say that  if

a  true and complete merger proposed by the Barisan

Sosialis  is accepted by the Federation Government,

then  more than half of the Singapore citizens  who

were not born in Singapore will be deprived of  it,

and they must re-apply for new citizenship. Such an

argument  is very childish because Singapore  is  a

country  and  so is Malaya. They are  two  separate

countries,  Sir, -and two separate governments,  if

these  two  countries are merged to form  a  bigger

country,  therefore, both sides must have the  same

rights.  How  can they say that Singapore  citizens

must  reapply for new Malayan citizenship? If  such

is  the case, we can also say that Malayan citizens

must  also re-apply for new citizenship.  Sir,  for

both  sides  to re-apply - [Laughter]  They  laugh,

Sir,  a  cunning laugh. It is nonsensical. But  for

Singapore  to  re-apply for new  citizenship  means

that  Singapore  citizenship  is  inferior  to  the

other. It means that Singapore must surrender. Sir,

it is something like a big fish trying to swallow a

small fish. Merger between Singapore and Malaya  is

not for the good of Singapore and Malaya alone.  It

is  for the good of both. They depend on each other

for  survival.  But the leaders of the  P.A.P. say

that   the  Malayan  Government  will  not   accept

Singapore  citizens,  who  were  born  in   foreign

countries.  Why? Are they not citizens, or  second-class  citizens? If not, the Party  in  power  must

persuade  the  Malayan Government to accept,  since

the  Party  in power does not want to  consult  the

Opposition  Parties about merger. If the  Party  is

unable  to  fight for the interests of the  people,

then  she must resign and return the power  to  the

people.  How silly the PAP, leaders are by  telling

the   people  of  Singapore  that  if   they   want

citizenship of the Federation they must ask the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



Progressive  Party,  the  Socialist  Front  in  the

Federation  to fight for them. Perhaps  the  P.A.P.

leaders   have   forgotten  that   they   are   the

representatives of the people

- they need bodyguards when they see the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the merger issue, the P.A.P. Government stated

in its policy speech that the Prime Minister of the

Federation received overwhelming support  from  the

House.  It shows, Sir, that the Tunku had consulted

at least the Opposition Parties in the House in the

Federation. But did the P.A.P. Government do  that?

Where  is  the  overwhelming  support'?  The  Prime

Minister   of   Singapore   only   consulted    his

Ministers - only his Ministers, Mr Speaker. But  the

Parliamentary  Secretaries of the  P.A.P. and  the

Assemblymen  were still in the dark, and  they  are

still in the dark. Sir, for their own interests and

also for the people's, the P.A.P. must resign.  And

if  she  does  not want to do so, the  P.A.P. must

fight for the demands of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> He.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> There are many types of

laughing. Sir. The cunning laugh; the smile is also

a laugh; but their laugh is a cunning laugh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now, Sir, citizenship is the

fundamental  right  of  the  people.  Without  this

fundamental   right,   the  people   will   suffer,

spiritually and materially. Without it,  they  have

no  future.  Likewise  the children  cannot  go  to

school. They cannot apply for Government jobs. They

also  cannot  enjoy benefits which  a  citizen  can

enjoy.   They  also  cannot  take  part   in   many

activities.  If  the people lose their  citizenship

rights,  that is not only a loss to the people  but

also  a loss to the State of Singapore. I give  you

one  simple  example,  Sir. Anon-citizen  not  only

cannot get a job m Government, but also it is  very

hard for him to find a job in any private firm.  It

means unemployment for him. And these non-citizens,

in  order  to  struggle for survival, are  sure  to

commit illegal acts to get a living.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



These illegal acts are detrimental not only to  the

people  but  also to the State. To lose citizenship

rights  means  to lose everything. If merger  takes

place,  the  rights and interest of the people  are

taken  away.  I  think  the  people  will  not   be

satisfied.  Evil  men lie behind  and  within  this

dissatisfaction.  This is the  cause  which  brings

chaos to the people and to the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, who is also a famous lawyer, has explained to us the definitions of "citizenship", "citizens" and "nationals". He said

something like that. These were not the exact words

he said - that he could not see the word "citizen"

in  any  Commonwealth constitutional law. He  could

only see the word "national" in such a law. He also

said that a national of a new Federation would have

equal rights and responsibilities. But Mr Speaker,

Sir,  if  you turn to the memorandum on  merger  on

page 4, it states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All Singapore citizens will continue to enjoy

their  State right and privileges within Singapore.

And  citizens  of  Singapore  will  vote  only   in

Singapore.'



<br><br>Sir,  all these rights we have already enjoyed  and

are still enjoying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this memorandum we can see that the citizens

of  Singapore not only cannot enjoy voting  rights,

privileges and other benefits but also cannot enjoy

many  benefits  and privileges  which  we  are  now

enjoying  in Singapore. Equal rights and privileges

should  be  defined  in this  way,  Sir  - that  all

nationals  of  a  new larger Federation,  that  is,

Singapore and Malaya, should enjoy all benefits and

privileges within the larger Federation. We do  not

want  false equal rights and privileges as  defined

in  page  4  of this memorandum. If we  examine  it

carefully,   Sir,   the  so-called   nationals   in

Singapore would bear the same responsibilities  and

serve the country within the larger Federation  but

cannot   enjoy  the  benefits  within  the   larger

Federation,  but  only enjoy the  limited  benefits

within Singapore. This means that the nationals  in

Singapore  have the duty to serve the  country  but

have not the right to enjoy the benefits.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not a famous lawyer like our Prime

Minister,  and  yet I am able to  define  the  term

"equal  rights and privileges". Our Prime  Minister

may  have  defined wrongly. If not wrongly,  he  is

trying to deceive and trying to fool the people  of

Singapore  into  believing that his  definition  is

correct  and  that their rights and privileges  are

protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people of Singapore want a complete and

full  merger between Singapore and Malaya, and  all

Singapore   and   Malayan   citizens   to    become

automatically citizens of a larger, new Federation.

All  citizens  of  a larger, new Federation  should

have   equal   rights   and  responsibilities   and

proportionate   representation   in   the   Central

Government of the two territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the merger issue becomes

an  important item in this debate. It is because of

this  merger issue that the reactionary  forces  in

the P.A.P. have become so desperate and so mad. For

two   and  a  half  years  the  PAP, leaders  have

pretended to be sincere democrate and patriots  and

to  be  different from the S.P.A. Now the truth  is

out,  and  so  their  political career  has  become

bankrupt.   In   order  to  save  their   political

bankruptcy,  they suggest a phoney  merger  in  the

hope  of  rising on their political platform.  They

try  to  drive a wedge between the masses  and  the

Barisan  Sosialis by telling the  people  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis is trying to bring chaos  to  the

State  of  Singapore. Because the P.A.P. does  not

believe   in  the  strength  of  the  people,   now

therefore the people cannot trust the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people voted the P.A.P. to

office not because they supported the Party's  plan

for  merger alone. I said "alone". The people voted

the  P.A.P. to office because it has so  many  true

socialists  inside  the  Party  and  because   they

trusted  these socialists. With this in  view,  the

people  thought that the P.A.P. would  bring  unity

among  all  races,  would raise their  standard  of

living,  and would provide more employment for  the

people.  That it would give more freedom of speech,

assembly and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



organisation  to  the  people;  would  give   equal

treatment to the four streams of education  and  so

on.  The  P.A.P., therefore, was voted to form  the

government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Tunku had on many occasions rejected the

merger  proposals. I remember the Tunku  once  said

that   unless   the  Leftists  in  Singapore   were

completely  cleaned up, there was no  necessity  to

talk  of  merger.  But now the Leftists  are  still

here, Sir, and the Tunku wants merger.

that  he is reading, then, of course, he is out  of

does  not  quite  appreciate  the  difference.  The

difference is as shown in the Standing Order  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A Member shall not read his speech.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, if the Member's eyes are glued to the

paper  he is reading. But if he is merely referring

to  his  notes,  he  is  obviously  addressing  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> I bow to your ruling, Mr

Speaker.  But  as  I have said, the  Leftists  are

still  here in Singapore and the Tunku  wants  the

merger  proposed by the P.A.P. What does it  mean?

Is  it  because the Malayan Government has  enough

strength   to  combat  the  Left-wing  forces   in

Singapore? Is it because the Left-wing forces  are

now armed with weapons to put the P.A.P. down?  Is

it  because  the P.A.P. Government  is  unable  to

defeat the Leftists? The P.A.P. leaders said that

the  Leftists were afraid of the strength  of  the

Central  Government  of  Malaya.  Therefore,  they

wanted to be ruled by the colonialists. They  also

said  that  once Singapore was under  the  Malayan

Government, the Leftists could not say  that  they

were  fighting for the good of the people, because

they  were fighting the Malayan Government elected

by  the  people, and if Singapore  was  under  the

hands of the colonialists, then the Leftists could

claim  to  be anti-colonial heroes. This  is  what

they  said. And that was why we liked the British.

Sir,  this is what the P.A.P. said. This  is  very

childish. The colonialists are more powerful  than

the  Malayan  Government,  and  the  people  fight

against them not because they are colonialists  or

foreigners  but  because  these  colonialists  are

trying to exploit the people of Singapore. That is

why  the people are fighting against them.  It  is

not  because they are foreigners or that they  are

British.  Sir,  history has  taught  us  that  the

people will fight against those who try to exploit

them.  That  is why the people are now  trying  to

fight against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P. Sir, when the British go away from our

country,  our  people may say,  "Bye-bye"  to  the

British. But if the P.A.P. go away, there will  be

no  people  waving hands and saying, "Bye-bye"  to

the  Party.  What  a pitiful situation  they  will

face!  Therefore, for the good of the  P.A.P.,  we

urge  them to resign and go home for a rest.  They

must resign for a rest and clear their minds,  and

they  must think about the mistakes they have made

in the past.
