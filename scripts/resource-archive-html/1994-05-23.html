  <b>Encik Harun bin A Ghani</b> asked the Minister for Education whether a survey has been conducted on the number of Malay students in secondary schools who show an interest in offering Mandarin as a third language and, if so, how many of them are keen to learn Mandarin and what is their family background.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Ker Sin Tze) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a third language is an option offered only to top 10% pupils in the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). My Ministry has not conducted a survey to find out how many top 10% Malay pupils may be interested to offer Chinese as a third language. The number is likely to be extremely small.
  <br>

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past three years, no school candidate has offered Malay as a first language (now known as Higher Malay) at 'A' level. Instead, about 200 Malay students each year take Malay language (formerly known as Malay as second language) at 'A' level. Pupils who passed Higher Malay at 'O' level are encouraged to continue studying Malay at a higher level beyond the minimum compulsory 'AO' level.

  <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> Yes, the Ministry will allow them to take as long as they meet the conditions. But judging from the statistics last year, the number is likely to be small. There was no school candidate in 1993. There were some private candidates, but the number was also very small. There were only three private candidates who took Higher Malay at 'A' level in 1993.

  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for Health why is a person engaged in a second job of a self-employed nature on a part-time basis required to contribute to Medisave even though that person is already contributing to Medisave in respect of his regular full-time job.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, currently, a person who holds multiple employment is required to contribute to CPF from all sources of employment income. However, if his combined CPF contributions exceed the prescribed maximum, he may apply to have his CPF contributions capped at the maximum. His Medisave contributions will likewise be capped.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same principle applies to a person who is concurrently an employee and a self-employed person. He is required to contribute to Medisave based on all sources of income. Similarly, if his combined Medisave contributions exceed the prescribed maximum, he may apply to cap his Medisave contributions to the maximum amount.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that even if the Medisave account has reached its maximum, a person in this category is still required by the relevant Government
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> authorities, like the Registry of Vehicles for taxi licence renewal, etc. to continue to contribute to his Medisave account?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> If he has already reached the limit of his Medisave contribution, he can apply for it to be capped.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> But I understand that they are required to continue to contribute to their Medisave accounts. Any surplus would then be transferred from the Medisave accounts into their Ordinary accounts. What is the rationale of doing so?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The same rationale applies as it would to CPF contributions. In other words, if your monthly income exceeds $6,000 then you do not have to contribute CPF beyond $6,000. In the same way, the Medisave contributions will be capped. There are some minor variations depending on the age group you fall in. But the same principle applies. Perhaps if the Member has got specific details to raise, he can send them to me and I will give him a specific reply.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, party political broadcasts at election time are provided by SBC as a public service so that political parties need not incur large expenses to get TV airtime. The rules governing these broadcasts have been established by SBC over many years. They are simple, practical and fair. There is no need to set up a Committee with representatives from political parties to review the rules.
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> I would like to ask the Minister about rules regarding some unforeseen change of rules by the PAP, for example, the introduction of the Elected President. We had a broadcast on that. Is that included in the rules?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Are we talking about General Elections or Presidential Elections?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Such things do happen at General Elections and the Opposition is often caught unaware on how the broadcast will be made.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I am surprised. The current system has been used in the General Elections of 1980, 1984, 1988, 1991. It is based on a formula which allows free airtime to major political parties to state their platforms in the four official languages on television and radio. Under the system, a political party fielding a minimum of six candidates qualifies for the minimum airtime of one period of 2 1/2 minutes in each official language broadcast. Beyond that, airtime is increased by half a minute for every four additional candidates fielded. There has been no change since 1980. So the rules are very clear and I do not anticipate that there will be change the next time round.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> These rules concern only the normal elections. But what happens at a General Election when something new suddenly comes up? Who makes the rules?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> If there are special conditions, like the new Presidential Election, then we will have to frame the rules as we go along. In the case of the Presidential Election which took place for the first time in our history we had to create new procedures for election campaigning to be done on television. We may have to make further adjustments next time round, but we will adjust as we go along. But the general principle is you get airtime in proportion to the number of candidates you field. As for the General Elections, there has been no change since 1980. So I am not quite clear what Mr Chiam is referring to.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, there are two sets of rules. One set is for the general course of events, if nothing happens at a General Election. The other set is, if something crops up, there are no rules. I have given the example of the Elected President that was broadcast during election time. If you include the Opposition, then at least the Opposition would know what is happening rather than be caught by surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I am not sure how you can stop the Opposition from being surprised. For a General Election, the rules are clear. So there should be no surprise for the next election. For the Presidential Election, since we had rules for the first time, there should be no surprise for the next election.
  <br>
  <br>

   <b>SINGAPOREAN PRISONERS IN THAILAND</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs how many Singapore citizens are jailed in Thailand at the moment and whether the Government has taken steps to contact the Thai Government to alleviate the plight of these prisoners, in particular the removal of their leg chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 42 Singapore male citizens are in the prisons in Thailand, 20 of whom are serving life imprisonment for drug trafficking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Thailand, the leg chain is used on prisoners considered most likely to attempt to escape. These are male prisoners below 60 years of age charged with committing serious offences which carry heavy punishments. Such prisoners have to wear the leg chain when they are detained in the remand prison while awaiting trial or when they are being transferred to courts or to other prisons.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> The chain may be removed under certain conditions, for example, firstly, for good behaviour while under detention in the remand prison, as determined by the prison commander; secondly, when a prisoner has been transferred from the remand prison to a maximum security prison, after the Court has imposed sentence; thirdly, when a prisoner on death row has received the royal pardon and has his sentence commuted to life imprisonment or less.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when Singaporeans abroad are arrested for offences, our Missions will assist to ensure that our nationals are fairly treated. But those who commit offences abroad must also accept the consequences under the laws of the foreign countries, so long as they are dealt with in accordance with the due process of law. In this regard, each country has its own methods of punishment and procedures for dealing with prisoners. We cannot interfere in the operation of their legal process and cannot demand special treatment for our nationals.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that other prisoners in Thailand who have suffered the same punishment have their leg chains removed after the initial period, whereas Singaporean prisoners still have to suffer or undergo imprisonment with leg chains? Is the Minister aware of that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the information which I gave just now of the circumstances and the categories of prisoners who, we understand, have to wear leg chains is supplied by our Mission in Bangkok. I have also ascertained from our Mission in Bangkok that the information and rules which I have described apply across the board and the Singaporean prisoners are not singled out for special treatment. If Mr Chiam has knowledge of any particular case where unfair treatment was accorded, and he will give me the specifics of the case, I assure him I will look into it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me also say that although we cannot insist that special treatment be accorded, from time to time appeals are made to the Ministry and to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> our Mission to make representations on specific cases. For example, there was a case where a Singaporean prisoner's legs were weak and the Mission did assist in conveying the appeal. So this was acceded to, first, by a lighter leg chain, and later, the leg chain was removed. So the Mission and the Ministry will do their part whenever they can.

   <b>(Incentives)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Labour (a) whether more incentives will be introduced to attract females who cannot go into full-time employment to work part-time and (b) whether a lower employee Central Provident Fund contribution rate will be introduced for part-time workers so as to allow them a higher take-home pay whilst maintaining the 20% contribution from the employer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, success in attracting the economically inactive females to join the part-time workforce depends on many factors. These include the benefits offered by the employers and the scheduling of part-time work for the convenience of housewives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will ensure that our labour laws do not stifle the employment of part-time workers. In August 1990, the Ministry introduced a set of guidelines to help facilitate part-time employment. The Guidelines on Part-Time Employment were drawn up based on tripartite consultation and consensus. Under the Guidelines, statutory benefits are pro-rated based on the part-timer's contractual working hours in a year vis-a-vis that of a full-timer. Employers are also given the flexibility to encash certain benefits such as annual leave and public holiday entitlement for the part-time workers. The Ministry is conducting a review to formalise these guidelines into Employment Regulations so that the rights and obligations of the employers and part-timers are more clearly spelt out.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Regulations in place to facilitate part-time employment, employers should come up with innovative schemes to meet the convenience of housewives so that more would come forward to work part-time. This would also help to alleviate our manpower shortage and reduce our reliance on foreign workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's question of reducing the CPF contribution rate for part-time workers, my Ministry is not in favour of this. This is because CPF contribution is not the sole factor influencing the attractiveness of part-time employment. Reducing CPF contribution may not result in a larger number of people engaging in part-time work. On the other hand, any reduction in CPF contribution rates for part-time workers will affect some 47,000 part-time workers who are currently making full CPF contributions. Part-time workers also need to save for retirement and Medisave as much as full-time workers. The CPF scheme, as it is presently structured, helps them to do so. To lower CPF rate for part-time workers will create anomalies. A person working part-time but earning more may end up paying less CPF than another person working full-time but earning less.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, reducing the CPF contribution rate, even if it is the employee's contribution rate, may lead some employers to take into account the lower CPF contribution rate, hence, higher take-home pay, and therefore offering a lower basic wage to the part-time worker. The part-time worker may still not end up with a higher take-home pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, there are many categories of part-time workers. One category could be those who are engaged full-time and choose to work part-time over the weekends as cashiers or as service personnel in hotels. They already have CPF contribution in their full-time jobs. So for such work, does the Minister think there is a need for them to have the employee's CPF contribution, because they already have the CPF contribution?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, my colleague, the Minister for Health, just explained a moment ago the principle behind CPF contribution. If you are working in several jobs, you will contribute according to the full CPF rate for all the jobs. But if the sums add up to more than the maximum required for CPF contribution, that is, $6,000 a month, then you can ask to have the contribution capped at this maximum of $6,000 a month. So this principle applies, whether it is full-time employment plus part-time employment, or a person working in many different jobs on part-time basis.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from CPF records, in 1993, 5.5% (or about 60,400) of the 1.1 million active CPF members who were employees changed jobs more than once during the year. However, as we do not have information on why they changed jobs, we cannot tell what percentage of this 5.5% are job-hoppers. Many could have changed jobs for valid reasons, such as to take up more skilled and higher value-added jobs. These are not job-hoppers. Only those who frequently change jobs for frivolous reasons can be considered as job-hoppers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the Minister consider getting a questionnaire to people who have changed their jobs during a certain period? That might give us information on people who have changed jobs and this will help us to plan our productivity and competitiveness better.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not believe there is a specific reason or a clear case to make out for us to have such a questionnaire or to require such information to be obtained from people who have changed jobs because it will be extremely difficult to ascertain in each and every case whether the reason given by the respondent is in fact the precise reason for the person wanting to change job.

  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, while I agree with the Minister, we must remember that for our higher valued-added skills training, the learning curve becomes longer. And if people tend not to stay in the same job, then our competitiveness will be affected. Therefore, would the Minister consider thinking about this issue and come out with some sort of plan?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, job-hopping is not a new problem. It is not something that has just arisen as a result of our economic growth of 9.9%. Job-hopping is a problem that has been encountered for many years already. The problem itself is aggravated each time there is exceptional economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many proposals to solve this problem of job-hopping in the past. In 1988, a task force on job-hopping was formed under the auspices of the Singapore National Employers' Federation. They made an in-depth and very comprehensive study of the problem of job-hopping and recommended several proposals to overcome this. Most of the recommendations focused on improved personnel management practices and more efficient use of scarce labour resources. The task force found that they should leave the problem of job-hopping to employers to tackle. They felt that it should be the employers' responsibility, apart from training their workers, to also encourage their workers to remain loyal to the company, and to remain with the company for as long as possible.

People who are eligible for consideration for promotion are assessed systematically and no regard is given to ethnicity or other attributes. So the question raised by the Member for Hong Kah GRC does not arise. Our promotions are fair. Consideration is based on objective criteria.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his information, sometimes General Education Officers can be appointed as Principals and Vice-Principals. They hold such appointments and are paid a responsibility allowance. After being tested in these appointments for a number of years, they can be put up for promotion to the substantive grades of Principals and Vice-Principals.

  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.
  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Acting Minister for Community Development what services and programmes under his Ministry are run by civic organisations and what is the nature and extent of involvement of these organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Acting Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Community Development (MCD) provides a wide range of social services and programmes both directly and in conjunction with the Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently more than 100 VWOs providing regular direct welfare services. Of these, 80 work closely with MCD.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct service VWOs are autonomous in running their services and programmes. Government supports them by providing premises, finance and other resources. In addition to the VWOs, there are various civic groups (there are about 40 of them) or services clubs, such as Lions, Apex and Rotary Clubs. These groups also provide the volunteers who run programmes and services, and they also run a wide range of services too.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Yuhua):</b> Sir, from the Minister's reply, I notice that most of the activities are run by religious or civic groups. What about senior citizens, women and youth organisations? Would the Minister find ways and means to encourage these organisations to be more active in running social activities?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we encourage many helping hands in the running of social and community services, and religious groups, as has been rightly pointed out by the Member, are just one of these pairs of helping hands. All the groups mentioned by the Member for Yuhua are some of the other pairs of helping hands. But be assured that MCD will always be looking into ways of getting these and other organisations and individuals to be involved in running social

  <br>
  <br> and community services. MCD has been working with, and will continue to work closely with, the National Council of Social Service and organisations like the People's Association to look into areas where the resources of senior citizens, women and youth can be tapped.

  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development if he will justify the priority accorded to members of Citizens' Consultative Committees, Community Centre/Club Management Committees, Residents' Committee, Women's Executive Committees and Youth Executive Committees in the purchase of existing Housing and Development Board flats offered for sale and whether the scheme favours People's Action Party appointees of these various bodies and discriminates against other purchasers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I have your permission to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together because they are on the same subject?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Thank you. Under the Priority Allocation Scheme for Grassroots Organisations, HDB grants priority
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> allocation to grassroots leaders who are members of CCCs, RCs, CCMCs, YECs and WECs. This is in recognition of their services to the community. Grassroots leaders are appointed by the Government through the People's Association. They are not PAP appointees, as misconstrued by the Member for Hougang. To be eligible for this scheme, grassroots leaders must be serving members of their grassroots organisations with at least three years of continuous service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of flats allocated under this priority allocation scheme has been very small. Since the introduction of the Booking System in July 1989, only a total of 745 HDB flats have been allocated under this scheme. This constitutes less than 0.7% of the 112,000 flats offered for booking during this period. Priority allocation for grassroots leaders therefore does not adversely affect the chances of success of the other applicants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has suggested extending this priority scheme to cover charitable and social organisations. The nature of the charitable and social work is very diverse. It ranges from the occasional weekend volunteer help to paid social work. Many Singaporeans are involved in charitable and social work of one kind or another. It is not feasible to extend the scheme to all of them. The number eligible would be too large. The contributions of volunteers working in charitable and social organisations will be recognised in other ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, the Acting Minister mentioned that I have misconstrued and that these grassroots members are actually appointees of the Government. Is there a difference between the so-called Government-appointed or PAP-appointed grassroots members?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> All the grassroots leaders are appointed by the People's Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> My question is: Is there a difference between a Government appointee, as the Minister mentioned, and a PAP appointee?

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Of course, there is a difference when a person is a party member versus a person who is not a party member. For the purposes of this scheme, the volunteers are all appointed by the People's Association and, under this scheme, their assessment is based on their work in the grassroots organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the Minister saying that the office holders of the various committees, like the members of the CCMC, are not PAP members? Or if they are PAP members, they are not qualified to sit there?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Many of the appointees to these organisations are party members, but many are also not party members. We do not distinguish between them. We appoint them based on their contributions to community work, their ability to serve and their dedication to serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, these grassroots members are obviously given such priority because of the public service that they have rendered. What is the difference between the public service rendered by the grassroots members and by people who do public service in charitable organisations? I am sure the latter sometimes gives more time, energy, effort and even money than the grassroots members. But they are completely kept out. Is that fair?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not a question of effort, money or contributions. The main purpose of this priority scheme is to retain the grassroots leaders who are serving the community where they are working in. So by giving them priority allocation of flats, they will remain in the community as RC members, CCMC members, or CCC members. As I said earlier, there are many Singaporeans who do excellent work in charitable and social organisations and we do recognise them in many ways, ie, National Day awards and other avenues.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> They do not want the National Day awards. They want priority in the allocation of flats. Does the Minister not think that he should give them the choice? Is the Minister saying
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that the grassroots leaders who give their time and effort to grassroots work are, in fact, more valuable than those who give to charity?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not making a ranking of the contributions. The people who serve in the various grassroots organisations work very closely in the community that they are serving in and we find it useful to retain their ties with the community. So when we give them priority allocation, they will remain in the area where they have been working for many years. I am sure there are many Singaporeans who do excellent work in voluntary and social organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister says that he is not making a ranking. But it will disturb those Singaporeans who have given a lot of their time to charitable work and are not rewarded in concrete terms. Whereas those who work for the grassroots organisations, they are rewarded. I am sure they are very disturbed. Does the Minister not agree with me?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I will refer the Member's concern to the Minister for Community Development.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I do not think the Minister needs to be cheeky. The HDB has taken upon itself the right to make such priority. In fact, these flats are built with taxpayers' monies. Why should some Singaporeans benefit and the others do not? That is the crux of the matter. It is not a fair system, and this system should be enlarged.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me assure the House that I was not being cheeky. In fact, this is the correct procedure. HDB is not allocating these flats on its own volition. If there is indeed concern that people working in charitable and social organisations feel that they are not recognised sufficiently, then I am sure the Minister for Community Development will, on their behalf, take up their case and ask the Government and Cabinet to extend this scheme to them. HDB provides this scheme, on behalf of the Government, and extends it to the community leaders. It is not that the HDB is doing itself a favour by looking after this group.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am sure the Minister is aware that there are letters of complaint from his own Citizens' Consultative Committee members and so forth that they themselves are dissatisfied because, amongst them, some of them are given priority whereas others are not. It would be more so ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, are you making a speech? Could you ask your question?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. The question is: Is it not so that those who have given almost their whole life to charitable work are dissatisfied? Even within his own grassroots organisations, there is already dissatisfaction. My question is: Is it not so that those who have given their whole life to public service are not given this priority?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me assure the House that implementation of this scheme is done in a fair and equitable way. All those who have served three years in the various grassroots organisations as a committee member are eligible for this scheme. They approach their Advisor if they want to make use of this scheme. This is not a big scheme. So there is no need to make a song and dance out of it. Just to give Members an example. Not only is the number of flats very small - 745 flats over five years - but also the number of grassroots leaders who makes use of this scheme is, in fact, very very small. Less than 6% of the grassroots leaders have actually applied under this scheme. So 94% of all the grassroots leaders do not make use of it. They are not unhappy and complaining, as pointed out by the Member. People work for their community and they gain satisfaction from it. If they want to continue staying in the area and want to apply under the scheme, they can apply through their Advisors and all are treated fairly.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The percentage of 6% of grassroots leaders who had applied is not an issue. The issue is that there is dissatisfaction even within the 6%, ie, those who have not got them. I know it because I had received letters which were carbon copied to me.

  <b>Dr S Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for Communications when the Bus-plus scheme will be implemented and whether small scale private bus operators will be allowed to participate in the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a Bus-plus pilot scheme will be launched later this year to gauge public response to the scheme. The introduction of the Bus-plus scheme, which will include both scheduled bus and maxicab services, is to provide a wider range of public transport services to meet the different demands of public transport users. The Bus-plus scheduled service will cater to commuters who are willing to pay higher fares for a better quality of service than the basic bus/MRT service, while the Bus-plus maxicab service will cater to bigger families and groups who would otherwise need two or more taxis.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, ROV briefed all interested operators, including the private bus operators, on the proposed Bus-plus pilot scheme. Following the briefing, a joint venture company is being formed by SMRT and TIBS to participate in the pilot project. The joint venture company will be acquiring 20 mini-buses for the pilot scheme, and plans to operate three routes. The proposed routes and fare structure are being worked out and, when ready, will be submitted to the Public Transport Council for approval.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the pilot scheme proves to be successful, the Public Transport Council will consider licensing more operators to run Bus-plus services.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Acting Minister for Community Development, in view of the fact that there has been a doubling of dual career families in the last 10 years, whether he will commission another study on the existing and preferred types of childcare options that working parents would like for their children.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry last conducted a survey on the existing and preferred child care arrangements of married working women in 1989. It showed that 65.2% of married working women with children aged 6 years and below placed their children with grandparents, immediate family members or relatives while only 5.6% sent their children to child care centres. Of the married working women yet to have children, 72.3% preferred child care by grandparents, immediate family members or relatives. Only 5.9% preferred child care centres. We believe these child care arrangement and preferences have not changed significantly in the last five years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry decided since 1989 to closely monitor the demand for child care places through the centres' waiting lists and vacancy positions. In January this year, child care centres provided places for 10.7% of the total population of children aged 2 years to below 7 years. This is double the rate in 1989.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at present enough places overall to cater for mothers who want to use child care centres. Any mother who wants to send her child to a child care
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> centre can find a place if she is not particular about the choice of centre. We find that this close monitoring, done on a quarterly basis, helps us to better plan for future child care places. There is therefore no need to carry out a survey on child care arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> There has been a doubling of the dual income career families in the last 10 years. Does the Minister think that a study in the next 2-3 years is needed to take into account this change in demography?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, while the number of dual career families in Singapore has doubled in the last 10 years, the number of child care places has increased by more than 10 times. In 1983, there were 39 child care centres with 2,326 places. As at January 1994, there were 334 child care centres with 25,471 places. And by FY 96, we hope to have 32,000 places. The rate of increase in child care places has therefore more than kept pace with the increase in the number of dual career families.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, I think the Minister has not understood. I am not talking of just child care centres. I am talking of child care options. So I am not questioning the Ministry on the number of child care centres. I was talking of the child care options.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I have mentioned earlier that the child care options, ie, the preferences and the practices, have not changed significantly in the past five years.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat</b> asked the Minister for Finance, in view of the recent upsurge in property prices, whether the Government will review the estate duty exemption limit for owner-occupied residential properties.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I declare my interest in asking this Question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, estate duty is a form of wealth tax which the Government uses to achieve the social objective of an equitable redistribution of wealth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residential properties up to a certain value are exempted from estate duty. The intention is to give relief to beneficiaries in the lower and middle income groups. The exemption protects dependants of the deceased who might otherwise have to dispose of their family home to pay estate duties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the exemption limit for residential properties is $3 million. This is irrespective of the number of residential houses owned by the deceased. Despite the recent increases in property prices, the existing ceiling should provide adequate relief. It covers all HDB and HUDC flats as well as most private apartments and landed properties. Only the very wealthy in the population need pay estate duty on residential properties.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he considers it cost effective in view of the fact that the revenue from taxation on estates forms only a very small part of the taxation on assets?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It remains cost effective because it is extremely easy to collect.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If people own properties worth more than $3 million and also cash, would there not be a danger of these people in their lifetime trying to repatriate their money abroad, rather than leaving it in Singapore? If the value of their properties becomes too big an amount, will they leave their money outside Singapore rather than leaving it here? Would that be a problem?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think so because our estate duty rates are quite low. So far, we are not aware that this is a problem because for property values exceeding $3 million, up to a limit of $10 million, the tax is only 5%. Thereafter, property values exceeding $10 million are taxed at 10%. So it is not an onerous tax at all. For those who are very wealthy, I think it is neither here nor there.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister when was the $3 million limit set? Would he tie it with a real property? Let us say someone owns a $3 million property at that period of time. He was classified as not very rich. But today the same family living in that property has been classified very rich. How would he rationalise this? Would it not be more reasonable to adjust the limit from time to time in line with the escalation of property prices?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> That is true. But $10 million is a lot of money. I think very few people own properties worth more than $10 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> When was the limit of $3 million set and why was it not adjusted from time to time?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not recall exactly when it was set. I think $3 million is quite adequate even now.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Sir, the question I want to ask the Minister is this. The limit of $3 million was set sometime ago and property prices have gone up. The $3 million house which Dr Wang mentioned is now worth $6 million. So the family will still have to dispose of the house in case the owner dies. The aim of the $3 million limit was to prevent a family from disposing of the property.

  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> That may be true. But I think for those who own properties exceeding $3 million, the estate probably has a good deal more in other assets. For people in that category, surely they cannot only own one house. We have estimated that only 11,000 or 1.7% of all the houses and properties in Singapore are worth $3 million or more. Therefore, we are talking about a very small group of people who are generally very wealthy and therefore need not require additional help, I hope.

   <b>SIGNING OF URUGUAY ROUND OF GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Significance for ASEAN Free Trade Area and Singapore)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the significance of the signing of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for the ASEAN Free Trade Area and Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, Singapore is perhaps unique in being a small, almost totally open economy which is heavily reliant on trade. Our external trade accounts for some three times our GDP. The Marrakesh agreement, the product of the seven-year Uruguay Round (UR) negotiations, is an especially important agreement for economies like Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Marrakesh agreement achieved deep tariff reductions. Based on Singapore's 1993 trade figures, Singapore can look forward to potential tariff savings of about S$3 billion for our exports when the reductions are fully implemented. In the services sector, we can also look forward to greater transparency and liberalisation in the various regulations imposed by our export markets. In short, Singapore will gain when the market access barriers of our trading partners are lowered through the implementation of the Marrakesh agreement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the agreement provides for the implementation of a more effective GATT dispute settlement process. A new body, the World Trade Organisation (WTO), will
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> be set up, hopefully by 1st January 1995, to enforce international trade rules. Stronger rules and stronger enforcement will help provide greater predictability and certainty in the conduct of international trade. This will help provide some recourse for us should any trading partner decide to take unreasonable unilateral actions against our exports.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the significance of the UR on AFTA, the Marrakesh agreement requires countries to fulfil their tariff reduction and market opening commitments within a period of 10 years. On the other hand, tariff reductions in the AFTA Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme has a 15 year implementation period, starting from 1st January 1993. The UR has also extended the market access process to cover agricultural products, an area which has been excluded from the CEPT scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN Economic Ministers discussed the implications of the UR for AFTA when we met informally in Genting on 22-23 April this year. The Ministers also took note of the rapidly changing external environment, including the strong competition from the emerging economies of China, India and Indochina. The ASEAN Ministers have asked the Senior Economic Officials to review how to keep AFTA relevant with the completion of the UR. The Senior Officials will be meeting in Jakarta from 6th to 8th June this year to review and recommend changes to the programme under the AFTA.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify whether there is any loss to Singapore if Singapore is not given the opportunity to hold the first World Trade Organisation's meeting in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I think the loss would be to the whole region, because the UR meetings have taken place in all the regions of the world except in Asia. And yet Asia is today the fastest growing trading region. Therefore, if the first meeting of the WTO Ministers is not held in Asia, it represents a loss for the whole region and not just for Singapore.

  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister consider suggesting to the AFTA Senior Economic Officials the inclusion of services and investments? Otherwise AFTA will become superfluous when compared to GATT and NAFTA if services and investments are not included, besides speeding up tariff reductions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Cheow Tong; Sir, those issues will be addressed by the Senior Officials in Jakarta as well.

   <b>SHOPHOUSES</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development (a) whether the conservation programme for old shophouses in the City has met its objectives; (b) whether there are areas for improvement; and (c) whether there is still room and need for traditional small traders.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the objectives of the conservation programme have indeed been met. Almost 1,000 buildings in these conservation areas have been restored and revitalised. Areas such as Tanjong Pagar, Kreta Ayer, Telok Ayer and Boat Quay are examples where the shophouses have been given new leases of life. Close to another 1,000 buildings have submitted planning applications for restoration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With conservation now widely accepted and supported, the focus now is turned to improving the quality of restoration. The aim of conservation is to retain the character of the identified buildings. To try and conserve the traditional environment is a different matter. Some incompatible trades are not allowed in these core areas. Aside from these guidelines, the adaptive reuse of the shophouses is left to market forces to decide. The trades that go into the conserved shophouses have to be financially viable.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Sir, will the Minister consider building small stalls or corners for these traditional small traders, just like the Indian stalls selling betel nuts or flowers?

   <b>REVISED EDITION OF THE LAWS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Law, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Law Revision Commissioners who produced the 1985 Revised Edition of Acts and the 1990 Revised Edition of Subsidiary Legislation have identified two procedural shortcomings in the Revised Edition of the Laws Act which this Bill seeks to remedy. In addition, the Bill introduces a loose-leaf system for the publication of our statutes, an improvement over the current loose-booklet system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first shortcoming is that, currently, the Act does not provide for Commissioners to be appointed for fixed terms. As a result, the appointments of the present Commissioners are indefinite in duration and can only be terminated by express revocation of the President.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioners only work as a body during a major and comprehensive revision of all our Acts and subsidiary legislation. Hence, most of the appointments should be on fixed terms as this will allow for fresh appointments to be made from time to time as the need arises. The only persons who should be appointed on a permanent basis are the Attorney- General, the Solicitor-General and the Parliamentary Counsel.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill therefore provides that every Commissioner, other than the Attorney- General, Solicitor-General and Parliamentary Counsel, shall be appointed for a fixed term of not more than three years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second shortcoming is that, currently, the Act requires the Commissioners to publish a revised edition of every Act and subsidiary legislation after 1st January following the date of its enactment or amendment. In the case of Acts, this is dispensed with if the amendments have not been extensive, in which event, these minor amendments are collectively published in a separate booklet which the Commissioners are required to publish. This booklet was intended to provide a noter-up service to the Acts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrangement is unsatisfactory. The Commissioners cannot revise any Act or subsidiary legislation sooner than 1st January following the date of its amendment even if the Act or subsidiary legislation has been so extensively
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> amended that it is desirable to revise it immediately. Moreover, experience has shown that the publication of the booklet of minor amendments is not necessary. Lawyers do not find it useful, preferring instead to notate any amendments directly into their statute books.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill therefore gives the Commissioners greater discretion to decide when an Act or subsidiary legislation should be revised and to do away with the requirement for the Commissioners to publish the booklet of minor amendments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, the Bill introduces a loose-leaf system for the publication of our statutes. The present loose-booklet system was introduced in the 1985 revised edition of Acts, as an improvement over the book system which was then in use. The loose booklet is useful in that it ensures that both revised editions of Acts and subsidiary legislation are self-renewing and self-expanding, kept up-to-date by replacing those Acts or subsidiary legislation which have been amended with fresh booklets incorporating the amendments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, since our adoption of the loose-booklet system, countries such as Hong Kong, Canada and Brunei have begun to publish their statutes in loose-leaf form, which is even better because it allows for speedy, easy and convenient updating of any amended statute. Whenever a statute is amended, it is updated by simply replacing the actual pages affected by the amendment with new pages incorporating the amendments. In this way, Sir, users do not have to wait until a new revised edition of the statute is published to have a fresh updated copy of the statute. When such a system is fully operational, there will no longer be any need for annual revisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst this House has a heavy responsibility of debating Bills and making laws for Singapore, it is also important to publish these laws in such a manner that they are accessible to the legal profession and the public at large. The improvements moved by this Bill are based on the experience of the Law Commissioners. These learned men and women should know what is required to make their task more productive. In particular, I commend the implementation of the loose-leaf system of publishing our statutes. Those of us who have looked up statutes will realise how messy it can be when a statute has been heavily amended with lots of cuts and paste sections stuck all over the pages. With a loose-leaf system, such a cut and paste approach will be dispensed with. In addition, the amendment to give the Commissioners the discretion to reprint a heavily amended Act even before the ensuing 1st January is a very practical one. I wish to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how the loose-leaf system will be implemented. Does it mean that all current loose-booklet statutes will be replaced? If so, will this be costly and extravagant?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I will also ask the Parliamentary Secretary what is the implication of this Bill on the use of information technology in the legal profession as in LawNet.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I refer the Parliamentary Secretary to clause 2 of the Bill, in particular to this amended section 3(1)(d), which reads:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) The President may appoint a Law Revision Commission comprising, as Law Revision Commissioners -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) such other persons as may be appointed by the President.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister be willing to recommend to the President that these "such other persons" may comprise at least one nominee from the Law Society?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These statutes and laws of Singapore are the tools of lawyers and they are the people who are handling the law every day. It would be inappropriate if they were not included in this Law Revision
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Commission. They can certainly give important and relevant feedback to improve the revision of the laws.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time the statutes were published in book form was in 1970. It was not until 1985 that the Revised Editions were published. So there was a long lapse of time and many lawyers found it very inconvenient with their statute books full of pasted and notated amended sections of the law. If the Law Revision Commission had a lawyer or a representative from the Law Society at that time, perhaps the revision could have come sooner and make the work of the lawyers more convenient.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also noted that every time Revised Editions of the laws are published, the cost of each of these publications goes up. I do not know whether the Law Revision Commission has something to do with the pricing, but certainly I would ask the Minister to look into the cost of these Revised Editions of the law. I believe the 1970 full edition of the Singapore Statutes costs less than $1,000, but when the Revised Editions were published in 1985 they cost more than $3,000. Perhaps the Minister could look into the cost of the publications of the revised laws and make them readily available to the man-in-the-street who would certainly like to know the progress of the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> First, let me thank the Chairman of the GPC (Law) for his support of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chairman of the GPC (Law) makes two points. The first relates to the manner in which the loose-leaf system will be introduced. He makes a good point, a valid point, a very keen observation, that if we were to introduce a loose-leaf system all at once to replace the loose-booklet system, it may seem wasteful. Therefore, Sir, the methodology we have envisaged, whereby the loose-leaf system would be introduced is to phase it in. Whenever a new Act is enacted or a Revised Edition of an Act is amended, the format in which the new Act or Revised Edition will come out will be the loose-leaf form. In other words, not a once- for-all replacement, it is a gradual phasing-in. Over several years we will have a loose-leaf system fully operational.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point the Chairman of the GPC (Law) makes is to ask whether the LawNet system, the statutes database, will replace the Revised Edition of the Laws. Sir, I think it is not envisaged that the statutes database in LawNet will replace the Revised Edition of the Laws.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, Sir, the publication of our written laws is required, both under the Constitution as well as under the Interpretation Act. Therefore, LawNet is not to replace the publication of our written laws.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, under section 7 of the Revised Edition of the Laws Act, it is stated that in all courts and for all purposes the sole and proper Statute Book of Singapore is the Revised Edition of the Laws.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, Sir, is a more practical point. Whilst LawNet is used mainly by lawyers as a very useful research tool for quick updated information on the laws of Singapore, I am sure everyone in this House will agree that our laws should be made available to as wide a segment of the population as possible and at costs which are affordable. Therefore, Sir, it is envisaged that, and this is in fact provided for in the Revised Edition of the Laws, these laws shall be published and made available to the public. Therefore the LawNet system cannot fully replace the Revised Edition of the Laws.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam makes two points. First, he asks whether or not members of the Law Society - I would guess he means legal practitioners - will be appointed as Law Commissioners. Sir, as the Act provides, the appointment of Law Commissioners is made by the President. In the past, I think he will know that we have had, for example, members of the Law Faculty, eminent members, who have been appointed to the Law Commission. In other words, the Law Commission is not a closed-door affair. Even though we provide for the appointment of the AG, the SG and the Parliamentary Counsel, as and when there are members of the legal fraternity with expertise, they will be appointed. Prof. Tan Sook Yee provides an example. So I think we must leave it to the President in his wisdom to decide on who fits the bill to be appointed to the very important appointment of Law Revision Commissioner.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which Mr Chiam makes is about cost which is in fact a point met by this Bill. With the loose-leaf system, there will be no need to replace booklets in their entirety and, therefore, this should reduce costs in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.

   <b>RECLAMATION AT PASIR PANJANG</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (for the Minister for Law) (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee): Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Law, I beg to move the Motion* standing in the name of the Minister for Law as it appears on the Order Paper.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade> *The Motion reads as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 113), approves the reclamation by Government of the foreshore and seabed at Pasir Panjang containing an area of approximately 222.6 hectares as shown coloured green on the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 1/94", which is deposited at the Land Office, Singapore.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Port of Singapore Authority is developing the new container port at Pasir Panjang in four phases. Phase I of the port development is in progress. The first five berths of Phase I are expected to be operational by early 1998. When fully completed in the year 2000, Phase I will have a total of eight container berths. Together with the present Brani, Tanjong Pagar and Keppel terminals, PSA will then have a total handling capacity of 22 million TEUs or twenty-foot equivalent units. This will be sufficient to cope with the growing volume of container traffic up to the year 2000. Additional berths will be required to meet the growth in throughput thereafter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under Phase II, 18 berths will be developed. The first two berths of Phase II will have to come onstream in the year 2001 to meet the expected demand then. The remaining 16 berths of Phase II will be completed progressively to match the rate
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of growth of container throughput. Phase II is expected to be fully developed by the year 2009.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to match the development schedule, PSA intends to commence Phase II reclamation of 222.6 hectares in 1995. Phase II reclamation will take five years to complete and will cost an estimated $543 million. The area to be reclaimed is shown coloured green on the Land Office Reclamation Plan No. 1/94, a copy of which is displayed in the Library of this House for the information of Members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I have two questions for the Parliamentary Secretary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the total cost of this reclamation exercise? And could the Parliamentary Secretary break down this cost into cost of reclamation per square metre and other costs, such as compensation given to landowners?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the estimated total cost of developing Phase II is $4,800 million, and that includes infrastructure, systems and equipment costs. For reclamation cost alone, the estimated cost is $543 million.

   <b>VACANT HDB FLATS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development whether there are Housing and Development Board flat owners who, having purchased their HDB flats, hardly live there at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flats are meant to be owner-occupied. Persons who do not intend to stay in an HDB flat should not purchase one. If they do so, they will deprive others who are in genuine need of an HDB flat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessees who vacate their flats for valid reasons, and who want to sub-let their flats, should seek HDB's approval. HDB will consider each case on its own merits. HDB will compulsorily acquire the flats if the entire flats are let out without HDB's permission.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB is aware that many lessees leave their flats temporarily vacant for renovation purposes. Some have to be away temporarily to take care of elderly relatives who are ill. Also, many Singaporeans go overseas on holiday, or to work or study. Therefore, HDB adopts a flexible approach to lessees who leave their flats vacant for valid reasons. It will not penalise such lessees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB may compulsorily acquire the flats of lessees who leave them vacant for long periods without valid reasons. However, HDB exercises its powers in this respect, very judiciously. Over the last three years, there have only been two instances where HDB initiated compulsory acquisition against lessees for such an infringement. In both cases, the lessees had left their flats vacant for five years.

   <b>FULL-TIME NATIONAL SERVICE</b>

  <div align="center">
   <b>(Last six to nine months of training)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Defence (a) why full-time National Servicemen generally view the last 6 to 9 months of their National Service as less challenging and wasteful and (b) whether reviews had been made to improve the stint of NSF so that they will leave with a more positive feeling.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the Member's misinformation, the last 6 to 9 months of our full-time National Service is not "less challenging and wasteful". Indeed, this period constitutes the high point of the unit's training syllabus. At this juncture, the unit proceeds for overseas training where the NSFs are trained in a totally new and unfamiliar environment. This phase of unit training is physically and mentally demanding.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary challenge in this period is getting the unit to function as a cohesive and well-oiled combat force in contrast to the earlier period when learning personal skills is the main focus. Three months before the NSFs are released, the unit is required to undergo a Battalion proficiency test conducted by an independent evaluating team. The unit will be evaluated according to operational scenarios and high standards of training proficiency are demanded before it can be considered an operationally ready NS Battalion. If it fails to achieve the required standards, the unit will have to undergo corrective training and be re-evaluated. With the possibility of going through the demanding tests twice, it is the SAF's experience that NSFs make the extra effort to pass the test at the first trial.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last 6 to 9 months of NSF training are thus far from wasteful. But this is the period when the NSF stint is coming to an end. At this stage some NSFs begin to focus their attention on what they are going to do after their full-time NS, be it work or studies. Anticipating the prospects of life after full-time service, inevitably leads some NSFs to feel impatient about completing their service and dampens their interests for military training. But it would not be right to therefore conclude that their training at this stage is a waste of time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF always reviews and enhances its training system to maximise the contributions of NSFs to national defence during their NSF stint. We will continue to ensure that the training syllabus is relevant to the defence needs of Singapore, and NSFs' time in the SAF used meaningfully and efficiently. If the Member could provide detailed information regarding the unit where the training in the last 6 to 9 months is "less challenging and wasteful", the SAF would carry out the appropriate investigations.

   <b>(Overseas postings)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether more of our operationally ready National Servicemen will be working overseas in view of regionalisation; (b) whether these NSmen will be exempted from their National Service training during their overseas postings; and (c) how their absence will affect our defence strength.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF supports Singapore's drive to expand its external economy. More Singaporeans can be expected to venture overseas, and participate in the economic development of the region. Many of our NSmen are spearheading this regional expansion and the number working abroad is increasing.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For NSmen intending to work overseas, MINDEF excuses them from NS duties in two ways - deferment and disruption. NSmen whose overseas posting is of less than a year's duration can be deferred. However, as they are still under their units' strength, they are expected to do make-up training upon their return. To facilitate greater responsiveness in granting deferment to NSmen, the authority to defer them from ICT has been decentralised to unit commanders since the early 1980s. The unit commanding officers, who are NSmen themselves, are in the best position to decide whether the deferment request can be accommodated after considering the unit's operational training schedule.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSmen whose overseas posting is of 1 year or longer are disrupted for the period of the posting up to a maximum of 3 years at a time. The disruption can be extended, if justified. Upon their return, the NSmen will be required to continue their training from where they had left.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invariably, the disruption of increasing number of NSmen working overseas would affect the SAF. As of now, the numbers are not large enough to affect our defence capability adversely. In drawing up policies and guidelines on allowing NSmen to be absent from training, MINDEF takes into account operational considerations. To be an effective fighting force, NSmen must always train together in their own units throughout their NS cycle. In the case of an NSman who is posted for a long period overseas, he would be replaced by another suitable NSman to ensure that our defence capability is not affected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All NSmen are required to inform MINDEF of their overseas address whenever they leave Singapore for more than 24 hours. This allows the SAF to maintain its operational readiness at all times.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the need for regional economic expansion, NSmen should remember that deferment/disruption from NS comes with a price - to the NSman himself, to the SAF, and to the nation. Facilitating NSmen in their overseas work must not be at the expense of compromising the operational readiness of the SAF. Therefore, whilst MINDEF supports regionalisation, it needs to reconcile the defence of the nation with the economic aspirations of its NSmen.

   <b>VULGAR LANGUAGE ON NATIONAL SERVICEMEN</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that non- commissioned military officers and instructors are using excessive vulgar language on National Servicemen; whether this is part and parcel of the training programme and, if so, whether a stop will be put to such an uncivilised practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF is a military organisation training soldiers to deal with life and death situations in times of war. Therefore, discipline must be strict, and forceful language in strong tones is used on occasions to help recruits adjust to a military environment. The SAF's training programmes are rigorous and soldiers are prepared for them, mentally and physically with the help of their instructors. However, MINDEF does not condone the use of vulgar language. Neither has vulgarity a role in the training of national servicemen. Specialists and Warrant Officers are men of proven competence and experience, with educational background improving over the years, in parallel with the general rising education levels of our population. Many national servicemen of `A' level and above qualifications also hold such appointments. All Warrant Officers, Specialists and instructors are trained to impart military skills and positive social values to national servicemen as well as to be concerned with their well-being. They are also required to set high personal standards in their conduct, bearing and discipline for the trainees to emulate. It is a misconception that Specialists and Warrant Officers and instructors are using excessive vulgar language on national servicemen.

   <b>(Utilisation of skills of graduates)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Defence, whether any special efforts are taken to utilize the technical and scientific skills of graduates while they are doing their full-time National Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence to provide a defence capability to safeguard the sovereignty and security of Singapore. To discharge its responsibility, the SAF must first and foremost have sufficient number of combat soldiers. They form the fighting edge of the SAF. Under our universal conscription, citizens who are physically and medically fit for combat are trained and deployed in combat units regardless of their educational qualifications. Those who are able and have leadership qualities would be trained and deployed as commanders and officers. The low national birth rate makes it even more critical for the SAF to deploy the available manpower resource to combat duties where they are most needed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of graduates in the SAF has been increasing over the years. This is a positive development. Increasing educational levels of our soldiers add to our defence capability, enabling the SAF to exploit science and technology to multiply its effectiveness. With higher education, our servicemen would be better able to operate new and sophisticated weapon systems as well as be trained in more complex operations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non combat-fit servicemen would similarly be deployed in areas where they could still make a maximum contribution to support the SAF's fighting capability. Where appropriate and relevant, special skills and qualifications are used to augment and multiply our combat capability.

   <b>(Stress fractures among recruits)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Defence, what is the yearly incidence of stress fractures among full-time National Servicemen from 1989 to 1993 and what steps have been taken to reduce the incidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be effective, military training has to be tough and rigorous. Soldiers must acquire combat skills and physical fitness in peace time to prepare them for the demands of war. The SAF has to ensure its training is effective in order to build up a credible defence force.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF recognises that many new NSF recruits are not in the best physical condition before enlistment. Training is therefore conducted progressively and with all possible safety measures. The progressive physical build up and safety measures help to minimise training accidents and injury. Nevertheless, occasional accidents including stress fractures do happen.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 5 years, 0.13% of our NSF recruits were treated for stress fractures. This is a significant improvement over the rate of 3.5% in the mid-80s and reflects the results of medical research in the SAF. The SAF is constantly looking for ways to help soldiers to perform better and to reduce training injury. Some of the measures that have been introduced include:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. the 2-month pre-BMT Physical Training Phase to allow less fit recruits to gradually build up their level of physical fitness;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. appropriate rest periods scheduled into training programmes to allow recovery of strength and stamina;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. grouping recruits according to their levels of physical fitness to allow training to be conducted at a pace commensurate with their fitness levels;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. significant improvements to the combat boots through medical and ergonomic research (eg. the shock absorbent quality of the boots to better protect the feet of the soldiers).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF will continue to look for ways to reduce training injury even further.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New recruits will find military training less onerous if they take on the personal responsibility of preparing themselves well physically before enlistment.

   <b>AUCTION OF #03-06 PEK CHUAN BUILDING</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) what are the reasons that led to the decision of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore to auction off the property at #03- 06 Pek Chuan Building at Lavender Street to recover property taxes due; (b) whether the auction price raised after deducting all expenses is enough to pay off the debts; and (c) whether further action will be instituted against the owner(s).
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the property at #03-06 Pek Chuan Building at Lavender Street owes a substantial amount in tax arrears. The owner had been given more than sufficient time to make payment but had ignored the warnings issued by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRAS will auction off a property only where the tax arrears are substantial, an owner has repeatedly ignored warnings and has made no arrangements for payment, and all other enforcement measures have failed. If the auction price is sufficient, IRAS will only recover the tax arrears and expenses and no further action will be taken. However, if the auction price is insufficient, IRAS will continue to pursue the remainder of the arrears in accordance with the law.

  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider granting a higher personal relief or a lower tax burden to workers who are 55 years of age and above and still working.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked for higher tax relief or lower tax burden for workers aged 55 and above.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to revise the tax relief. With the GST-related tax changes taking effect from Year of Assessment 1994, around 75 per cent of the individual taxpayers will no longer pay any income tax. In the past, a worker aged above 55 would only need to pay income tax if his annual income exceeded $5,700. This income threshold will now be increased to about $23,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that in line with their lower statutory contributions to CPF, the tax deduction enjoyed by those aged above 55 on their CPF contributions will be correspondingly lower. This is however partly offset by the higher earned income relief for those aged above 55. The earned income relief is $3,000 for those aged above 55 to 60 and $4,000 for those aged above 60. The higher earned income relief is given to encourage the elderly to remain in the workforce.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation of jackpot machines is restricted to private clubs. A list of the clubs operating jackpot machines as well as the number of machines operated by each club is in Annex A (Cols. 79 - 84).
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRAS takes a number of factors into account in deciding on whether a club should be allowed to operate jackpot machines as well as the number of machines it should be allowed to operate. Some of the factors include membership size of the club, financial standing of club members, organisational structure and managerial control of the club. Duty collection from jackpot machines amounted to $112 million in 1993.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRAS' criteria for approving applications from clubs to operate jackpot machines are already fairly stringent. Conditions are also laid down on maximum payout for each machine and restriction of access to club members, etc. Any club found violating these conditions is liable to have its licence to operate jackpot machines suspended. The existing controls are sufficient. There is therefore no intention to impose further controls to restrict the operation of jackpot machines.

  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider (i) extending the $300 Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme to full-time National Servicemen as an endorsement of their service to the nation and (ii) giving the $300 straight into the Central Provident Fund account of retirees as a recognition and reward for their past contribution to the nation.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the second Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme (SOTUS) announced in February 1994, Singaporeans will qualify for the $300 top-up in their CPF accounts if they contribute at least $750 into their accounts over the qualifying period from 1st March 1994 to 31st August 1995.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government recognises that full-time National Servicemen are performing compulsory service to the nation. That is why during the first SOTUS in 1993, a loan scheme was arranged for national servicemen who were eligible for the top-up but did not have sufficient contribution in their CPF accounts during the qualifying period to benefit from the $200 top- up. For the second SOTUS exercise, MINDEF will consider providing a similar loan scheme to help such national servicemen.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for retirees, Government recognises the contributions that they have made to the nation. However, Mr Chia's suggestion of giving the top-up without a matching contribution runs against the fundamental principle of co-payment from citizen CPF members including retirees, to qualify for the top-up. While we appreciate their past contribution, it would be wrong, in principle, to give retirees the $300 without matching contribution, which applies to all.

  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection of pupils for the GEP is based on merit. Pupils are selected based on their overall performance on three tests measuring language, numerical and general abilities. Precautions have been taken to ensure that these tests do not contain items which are sex-biased. Over the last 10 years, the male-female ratio of selected pupils has consistently been in the region of 2 : 1. This ratio is similar to that found in the identification of children for gifted programmes in countries such as Israel and the USA.

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is consistent with the well-established fact that there are more males than females both among those with very high IQs, and also among those with very low IQs. This is because the distribution of female IQs is more closely clustered around the average, whereas the distribution of male IQs is more widely dispersed. (However, the average male IQ and the average female IQ are the same.)

  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Education whether hostels will be built for female students, especially those whose parents are Singaporean expatriates living abroad and wish their daughters to study in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are four hostels built with full Government funding that are open to both boys and girls. There are a total of about 340 girls in these hostels. Most of them are foreign students.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the existing hostels, the Government recently approved a proposal for Nanyang Girls' High School to build boarding facilities for 500 girls. The facilities will be open to girls from all secondary schools in Singapore. Priority will be given to the daughters of Singaporean expatriates living and working overseas.

   <b>DEATH SENTENCES</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many (i) Singaporeans and (ii) foreigners were sentenced to death for (i) drug trafficking and (ii) murder from 1990 to 1993 annually; (b) how many persons are now serving the death sentence; and (c) whether statistics have shown that the death sentence has deterred or reduced crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The statistics are given at Annex B (Cols. 85 - 86). The increase in the number of persons sentenced to death in 1993, especially for drug-related offences was due to the faster court hearings and the switch from the two-judge system for capital cases to a one-judge system that year. It was also due to several successes by CNB in arresting members of major drug syndicates.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1994/19940523/19940523-HA-0630085.htm">Annex B - PERSONS SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR MURDER AND DRUG-RELATED OFFENCES (Cols. 85 - 86)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) As at 22nd April 1994, there were 99 persons in the death row. Most of them are either awaiting appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, preparing their petition for clemency or awaiting the outcome of their petition for clemency.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Statistics have shown that the death penalty has a strong deterrent effect on offences such as kidnapping, firearm robbery and drug trafficking. Prior to 1973, firearm robbery was on the rise reaching a peak of 174 cases in 1973. A dramatic drop was witnessed following the introduction of the death penalty for such offences. There were less than 10 cases per year in the last five years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the death penalty for kidnapping in 1961 had likewise resulted in a dramatic drop in such cases. There were only six cases of kidnapping reported in the last 10 years, compared to a peak of 38 cases in 1959 alone.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of drug trafficking, the introduction of the death penalty has the deterrent effect of preventing organised drug syndicates from establishing themselves in Singapore and has helped keep the drug situation here under control despite our proximity to the Golden Triangle.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what is the present number of Neighbourhood Police Posts; (b) what plans there are to increase the number of NPPs; and (c) what steps are being taken to integrate the police further in the community life of the neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are presently 90 Neighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs) in operation in all the Police Land Divisions. Another one is being built in Choa Chu Kang and will be ready by the end of the year. By then there will be 91 NPPs under the NPP programme that was started in 1983.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past ten years, Singapore's population has shifted significantly due to urban renewal and the setting up of satellite towns such as Pasir Ris New Town, Choa Chu Kang New Town and Bishan. As a result some of the existing NPPs are no longer strategically located. Police is reviewing the number and locations of these NPPs to assess whether they are suitably located to serve the community. Wherever necessary NPPs will be relocated.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NPP system is an important component of community policing in Singapore. Police have made various improvements to the NPP system to enable them to be more responsive to the community. Two years ago, a `problem-solving' approach was introduced and it is still being emphasised. Under this approach, NPP officers are trained and encouraged to look at the root causes of community problems rather than just respond to the symptoms. One example was highlighted in the newspapers recently where an NPP officer responded to frequent complaints of noise pollution by residents. He discovered that the cause of the problem was a resident who suffers from Down's Syndrome. Feeling bored during the day the resident had become a nuisance. The NPP officer eventually found the resident a job at a nearby centre and the problem was solved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our NPP system was originally based on the Japanese Koban system. In January this year, Police invited a team of experts from Japan to observe the progress of our NPP system as against developments in Japan and make recommendations to improve the system. The experts were impressed with our system and endorsed the various schemes to integrate the Police into community life in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the functions of NPPs is to provide community services to the residents. This includes taking of police reports, dealing with loss and found cases, recording of change of addresses, registering deaths, etc. Currently, certain Police services to the public are offered by Police Divisional Headquarters and more specialised cases are dealt with by Traffic Police and CID. Police is considering devolving more services to the NPPs. This will bring an even greater range of police services nearer the community, thereby improving the quality of service to the public and integrating the police further with the community.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) if he will consider sympathetically the case of Singaporeans who had given up their citizenship and now wish to come back to Singapore on a permanent resident basis and are gainfully employed and (b) whether these persons will be given preference over other foreigners with similar qualifications who are applying for permanent residence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that many ex-Singaporeans can make positive contributions. If they want to work here, they can apply for employment pass just like other foreigners. Immigration Department will approve their applications if they satisfy prevailing Employment Pass policies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ex-Singaporeans will not be given preference over other permanent residence applicants just because they are ex-Singaporeans. To do so may unwittingly encourage more Singaporeans to emigrate, and later to return to Singapore and obtain permanent residence status if they cannot adjust to life overseas. Giving preference to ex-Singaporeans will also not be fair to our citizens who remain in Singapore to contribute to its development. Finally, as permanent residence is a step towards citizenship, it should not be given liberally to persons whose commitment to Singapore is suspect or who from the outset may have no intention to take up Singapore citizenship.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exception is made for female ex-Singaporeans who are married to foreigners and whose marriages have broken down or whose husbands had passed away. For this category of ex-Singaporeans we are prepared to give them preference when they apply for permanent residence.

  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Statistics has planned for the detailed Census results to be published in a series of six Statistical Releases. To date, four Statistical Releases have been published:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Demographic Characteristics (July 1992),
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Households and Housing (November 1992),
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Literacy, Languages Spoken and Education (April 1993), and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Economic Characteristics (September 1993).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other releases on Transport and Geographic Distribution and Religion, Childcare and Leisure will be published shortly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleven monographs containing more detailed analysis of the census data are being prepared by academicians and researchers from the local universities. None has been published yet. These monographs take a longer time to be ready because they involve more in depth analysis, editorial changes and pre-printing arrangements. The first monograph, on Religion, is expected to be published in August 1994. The next two, on Aged Population of Singapore and Demographic Trends, will be published in September 1994. Other monograph writers are targeting to complete their reports by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Statistics has also made further studies on the census data and published the findings in its Occasional Paper Series. Examples include Dual-Career Couples in Singapore, Profile of Self-Employed Persons in Singapore and Life Cycle Analysis of Singapore Households. To facilitate policy evaluation and formulation, the Department has provided numerous census tabulations to various ministries and government bodies.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, import duties are levied on most goods imported into Malaysia. Popular consumer items like foodstuff, textile and garments, household items and footwear, attract import duties ranging from 2%-30%. If Johore proceeds to set up a duty-free shopping (DFS) zone, these goods will become cheaper and more attractive to consumers, including Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail trade in Singapore will have to continue upgrading itself in order to remain competitive. Retailers will have to offer better value to local consumers and tourists and ensure that they remain competitive in terms of price and quality, and level of service.

If any non-Chinese Singaporean wishes to learn Mandarin for its economic importance, that is fine. We should encourage him or her as we would Singaporeans who learn German, French or Japanese.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health does not recommend AZT treatment for early asymptomatic HIV infection. Patients with HIV infection/AIDS managed at the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) are not routinely treated with AZT. AZT is only used selectively for patients with full blown AIDS and patients who have shown a moderately severe weakening of their immune system (CD4 count &lt; 500 cells/mm3).

   <b>MEDICAL CERTIFICATES ISSUED BY PRIVATE GENERAL PRACTITIONERS</b>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will assure the public that medical certificates given by private general practitioners are just as valid as those given by government and restructured hospitals as this misapprehension is a contributing cause of non- emergency cases visiting Accident and Emergency Departments of government and restructured hospitals unnecessarily.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical practitioners are required to be registered with the Singapore Medical Council before they are allowed to practise in Singapore. Medical certificates issued by all registered medical practitioners, whether they be general practitioners or specialists in the private sector or government and restructured hospitals are equally valid.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of employees who are governed by the Employment Act 1968, Section 44 of the Act requires that the employee consults " a duly registered medical practitioner appointed by the employer or if no such medical practitioner is appointed, by a medical officer" before he is entitled to paid sick leave. The "medical officer" in the Act is defined as a medical practitioner employed by the government while the medical practitioner appointed by the employer is usually a private general practitioner who functions as the company doctor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Act, employees must see their own company appointed doctor if there is one. Generally most employers have been flexible and have allowed their employees to see either their company appointed doctors or government doctors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that some employers have preferred to accept medical certificates issued by government polyclinics and A&amp;E Department doctors in the belief that general practitioners are generally more liberal in granting such leave to their patients than government doctors. There are also some employers who do not have company doctors, and their employees may visit the A&amp;E Department instead of polyclinics to obtain a medical certificate from a government medical officer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the problem, the Ministry of Health has requested the Singapore National Employers Federation to advise its members that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. employers with company doctors should encourage their staff to see their company doctors; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. employers without company doctors should appoint company doctors and ensure that their staff are aware of the names and addresses of the company doctors. They can also see government doctors at polyclinics, but not at A&amp;E Departments except for emergencies.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savings in the Special Account are meant for old age. Hence, CPF members cannot withdraw these savings for any other purposes (eg housing and investment) before age 55. At age 55, CPF members can use these savings to meet the Minimum Sum requirement. As such savings are kept with the CPF Board for a long term, additional interest at 1.25% point above the normal CPF rate will be paid on the savings from 1st July 1995.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we allow transfer of savings in the Ordinary Account to the Special Account, such transfers can only be allowed if they are made irrevocably. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the Ordinary Account savings transferred to the Special Account will remain there for long term to warrant the payment of the additional interest. However, if that condition is imposed, CPF members who had transferred their Ordinary Account savings to their Special Account, could end up having insufficient savings in their Ordinary Account when they later wish to upgrade to higher quality housing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is therefore not in favour of allowing transfer of CPF savings from the Ordinary Account to the Special Account.

  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the implementation of the retirement age law, the Ministry has received 63 applications for exemptions. Of these, 29 have been approved, six rejected, nine not pursued further after consultation with the Ministry and the rest are still being processed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six rejected applications and the application still being processed are from companies seeking to exem2pt employees who are engaged in occupations that require younger people to perform the jobs.

  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether there are any restrictions on the type of work that foreign workers from different countries are allowed to do and whether work permit holders are only allowed to come from certain countries.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers can recruit Work Permit holders from Malaysia as well as non-traditional sources (NTS), such as the Philippines, Thailand, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In general, Malaysians are allowed to work in all sectors of the economy while NTS workers can work only in the construction sector, the marine industry and as domestic workers.

  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yearly collections from the bids for new car registration numbers are as follows:
  <pre>

               Year               Collections ($ m)

               1989                     3.3

               1990                     2.9

               1991                     3.7

               1992                     5.1

               1993                     7.1

</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proceeds from bids for car registration numbers cannot be set aside for specific purposes like contributions to the Community Chest. Like all others fees and charges collected by ROV, they form part of Government's overall revenue, which is used to finance public expenditure that benefits all Singaporeans. Such expenditure includes contributions to Voluntary Welfare Organisations for their social welfare projects.

  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sulphur content of the fuel used by our power stations is limited to 2% by weight.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no plans to reduce the percentage of sulphur in the fuel as the current levels of sulphur dioxide in Singapore are within international safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my Ministry will continue to monitor the situation.

   <b>AIR POLLUTION AT SINGAPORE SIDE OF CAUSEWAY</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for the Environment (a) what is the level of air pollution at the Singapore side of the Woodlands Causeway during peak hours in view of the large number of Malaysian motorcyclists commuting to Singapore daily; (b) whether the pollution will have any effect on the health of residents living in Woodlands; and (c) whether the traffic police are instructed to turn back motorcycles and other vehicles emitting excessive exhaust smoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air quality at the Singapore side of the Causeway is not satisfactory. Although the level of air pollution is within permissible limits established by the World Health Organisation and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, nevertheless it is higher than other parts of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been working with the Malaysian authorities, through the Malaysia-Singapore Joint Committee on the Environment (MSJCE) to control pollution from vehicles crossing the Causeway. Since its formation in 1991, the MSJCE has embarked on several programmes to educate owners and drivers of diesel vehicles on preventing smoke emissions. At the same time, Malaysia and Singapore stepped up enforcement action, including the turning back of diesel trucks and lorries that repeatedly exceed the smoke emissions standard.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the MSJCE expanded its educational campaign on smoke emissions to include motorcycles. On our part, Singapore has already tightened up emission standards for Singapore registered motorcycles. Most two-stroke motorcycles cannot meet the new emission standards. To be consistent, these standards must apply to all motorcycles being used in Singapore, whether or not they are registered here. The Ministry is currently studying how to apply the new emission standards to foreign motorcycles on our roads.

   <b>SALE OF HDB PROPERTIES</b>

   <b>(Cheating by housing agents)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Acting Minister for National Development what steps the Housing and Development Board is taking to reduce the incidence of cheating by unscrupulous housing agents in the sale of HDB properties.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidents of cheating by unscrupulous housing agents the hon. Member is referring to presumably relate to the recently-publicised cases where agents obtain power of attorney from sellers, to sell the flats at an agreed fixed price. The agents subsequently sell the flats for an amount that is much higher than the agreed price, and pocket the difference.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND would like to emphasise that, in the resale transaction for an HDB flat, HDB deals directly with the buyer and the seller; HDB does not require the involvement of housing agents at any point of the transaction. Sellers who choose, of their own accord, to use agents nevertheless, and who do not wish their housing agents to profit from the sale of their flats, should avoid giving their agents power of attorney, and retain the right to receive the entire sale proceeds direct from HDB.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sellers who wish to revoke the power of attorney which they have already given to their agents, can do so, if they write in to HDB at any time before the resale transaction is completed, and produce a Deed of Revocation, which cancels the power of attorney. HDB will then make out the cheque for the nett sale proceeds in the seller's name, and not in the name of the agent.
