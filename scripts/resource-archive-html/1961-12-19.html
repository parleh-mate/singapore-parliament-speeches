<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, last Thursday, 14th December,  1961,  a

delegation  of  seven,  purporting  to  represent   an

organisation   styled   the   "All-Singapore   Chinese

Secondary Students/Parents Association" called on me.

I  met  them  for  about two hours  together  with  my

Parliamentary Secretary and two senior officials of my

Ministry.  Although  there  was  no  mention  of  this

meeting  in the English Press, both the Sin  Chew  Jit

Poh and the Nanyang Siang Pau issues of 15th December,

1961,  carried a report of the Press conference  which

they   gave   after  the  interview,  and  there   are

indications that this organisation will persist in its

agitation  over the recent examination boycott  issue.

Also, since the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2504</b></font><br><br>



school  year  is due to begin a fortnight from  today,

and  in  the  meantime graduation ceremonies  and  tea

parties  are  being held in various Chinese  secondary

schools whilst the proposed Commission of Inquiry into

the  examination  boycott has yet to be  appointed,  I

feel  it my duty, Sir, to acquaint this House of  what

transpired vis-a-vis the interview.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, 13th December, I received a registered

letter  in Chinese from a certain Tan Kong Eng stating

that a delegation of seven representatives of the "All-Singapore

Chinese Secondary Students/Parents Association" would call on me on 14th of  December  at

10 a.m. to  discuss - this,  Sir,  is  the   English

equivalent: I quote - "matters concerning  the  change

of system in the Chinese secondary schools with a view

to  arriving  at an amicable settlement".  The  letter

said  that as the matter concerned the development  of

Chinese education, the Minister should spare some time

for discussion though he might be very busy. After the

interview, it was agreed that they would go back to re-discuss

what had transpired at this interview and that

they could come back again for another discussion,  if

necessary.  I  advised them that, in the meantime,  it

would  be  desirable to avoid issuing Press statements

until the matter was resolved to mutual satisfaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I see in the 15th December, 1961, issue of

both  the  Sin Chew Jit Poh and the Nanyang Siang  Pau

that a Press conference was held immediately after the

interview, it was reported inter alia - here again, Sir,

I quote the English equivalent:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We wish to reiterate the nature of our

representation. We would seriously point out that this

delegation  was created by the "All Singapore  Chinese

Secondary  Students/Parents Association" to  maintain

and  protect  Chinese education,  to  look  after  the

personal welfare of our children, to find a reasonable

solution  to  the  problem  of  changing  the  Chinese

secondary    school    system.    These    are     the

responsibilities  entrusted  to  us  by   over   2,000

parents.'



<br><br>What, in fact, is the true character of this committee

of  seven, who purport to represent the "All-Singapore

Chinese Secondary Students/Parents Association"?  It

should be remembered that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2505</b></font><br><br>



meeting of 2,000 so-called parents held in the Chinese

High  School  on  Sunday,  3rd  December,  1961,   was

convened by the so-called Action Committee of Students

who  boycotted the Government Secondary IV Examination

on  the  issue that it was an "unreasonable condition"

for  Government to insist that only those who pass the

Government   Secondary  IV  Examination  can   present

themselves  for  the  Government  Upper  Secondary  II

Examination,  which examination will only  take  place

for  the  first time at the end of 1963.  This  normal

educational  practice and procedure has been  accepted

without question by 27 principals of Chinese secondary

schools  and the Singapore Chinese Schools  Committee-Teacher Association. Of the seven representatives  who

met me, four of them claimed that they were not  able

to  fill  up a form in Chinese which I asked  them  to

complete, and they had to be assisted to do so  by  my

officials. They were Mr Lee Swee Seng, Madam Liu Geok

Lan, Madam Yap Kim Lan and Madam Tan Wei Lam. It was a

simple  form,  Sir, that I asked them to  fill  up  in

order  to  check  on  their  credentials  before   the

interview got started. Briefly, it asked for the  name

of the student each represented, his school and class,

the relationship of the representative to the student,

his  occupation and address, whether he or  she  is  a

Singapore citizen and his or her signature. They  were

at  first reluctant to complete this form and it  took

me  nearly  15  minutes  to persuade  them  they  must

establish  their  credentials.  At  one  stage,   they

insisted on calling in the Press. Later on, they  even

asked for an adjournment to consider this matter,  but

I  said  it  was unnecessary and that all I wanted  to

know was whom they were representing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, of this committee of seven which claims to

represent   "Parents  of  all  students   of   Chinese

secondary  schools", not a single one is, in  fact,  a

genuine parent of a student studying in a Secondary IV

class.  One of the representatives, Madam Yap Kim  Lan

claimed  to  have a step-daughter in  a  Secondary  IV

class in Chung Cheng High School but was unable to say

which of the 15 Secondary IV classes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2506</b></font><br><br>



she  was in. However, a tedious search was made of the

school  registers by my officials, but they failed  to

find the student's name that was supplied. Two of them

did have some relationship with Secondary IV students,

namely,  Tan Kong Eng and Ong Ban Song as brothers  of

students  studying in Secondary IV classes at  Sin  Min

High  School and Chung Cheng High School respectively.

The third, Lee Swee Seng, is not even a relative but a

"friend" of a Secondary IV student in Chung Cheng High

School. Of the remaining three representatives who had

nothing  to do with Secondary IV students, one claimed

to  have a younger sister studying in Secondary II  at

Yoke  Eng High School, and two others claimed to  have

daughters studying in Secondary III at Chung Hwa Girls

High School and Kong Yiong High School.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen, therefore, that this committee of

seven  cannot claim to speak for parents of  Secondary

IV  students who boycotted the examination - not to  say

of  all  parents  of  students  in  Chinese  secondary

schools. They were so told at this interview. Contrast

them  with  the genuine parents who accompanied  their

children  to  the  examination  centres  despite   the

picketing  and  thus proved that the boycott  and  the

picketing was organised by a minority of agitators who

misinformed  the students and others  over  the  issue

involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, Sir, the following interesting additional

information  on  three  of the seven  representatives.

Firstly,  Tan Kong Eng - the man who wrote the  letter

seeking the interview - is also known as Tan Kwong Yong.

He  is  the  brother and not the parent of  Tan  Kwong

Buck,  aged 19, a Secondary IV student of Sin Mm  High

School,  who  was  a member of the student  delegation

which met my Parliamentary Secretary on 16th November,

1961. Secondly, Ong Ban Song was a Communist terrorist

who  surrendered to the Johore police  on  8th  March,

1954, after deserting from the 5th Independent Platoon

at  Kulai and was released on 31st May, 1954.  He  has

been  Welfare Officer of the Kampong Kembangan  Branch

of the Singapore Rural Residents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2507</b></font><br><br>



Association and its General Affairs Officer since June

1961. His younger brother, Ong Ban Kim, aged 17, is in

Secondary IVA of Chung Cheng High School and  was  one

of  the picketers. Thirdly, Lee Swee Seng, also  known

as  Wai  Tau,  is an active supporter of  the  Barisan

Sosialis.   His  Secondary  IV  student  friend,   who

boycotted the Government examination, Ng Way Ten  aged

21,  of  Chung Cheng High School, Secondary IVK class,

was  one  of  the spokesmen of the student  delegation

which met my Parliamentary Secretary on 16th November,

1961  and  an active picket leader at the Ministry  of

Education.  It  will  be remembered,  Sir,  that  this

student delegation was responsible for distorting what

actually  took  place at the same  interview  with  my

Parliamentary  Secretary. And  their  circular  letter

dated  17th  November, 1961, which was distributed  to

students  and  Members of the public,  first  received

prominence  in the second issue of Barisan,  organ  of

the Barisan Sosialis, on 22nd November, 1961, which  I

made mention of in my earlier statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the House may have a true picture of

what  transpired at this interview last Thursday,  and

to  avoid  misrepresentation, I wish to summarise  the

position   as   follows.  These   so-called   parents'

representatives were told that the Ministry could  not

agree  to  their request to do away with the so-called

"unreasonable condition" - that only those who pass the

Government   Secondary  IV  examination  can   present

themselves  for  the  Government  Upper  Secondary  II

examination, which will not be held till  the  end  of

1963.  It  was  suggested by one representative,  Sir,

that the "unreasonable condition" was not accepted  by

the   Singapore   Chinese  Schools   Committee-Teacher

Association  hut that it was surreptitiously  inserted

into  the Press statement by the Ministry without  the

knowledge  of the Committee-Teacher Association.  This

is  not  true.  After a two-hour discussion  over  the

issues,  agreement  was  reached  and  a  joint  Press

statement as published in the Sin Chew Jit Poh and the

Nanyang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2508</b></font><br><br>



Siang Pau on 6th October, 1961, was first read out  by

my Parliamentary Secretary in the presence not only of

eight members of the Committee-Teacher Association but

also  members of the Press. There is a photo, Sir,  in

the   Sin  Chew  Jit  Poh  showing  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  in  the  act of reading  the  agreed  Press

statement.  After this the President of the Committee-Teacher   Association,  Mr  Ko  Teck  Kin,  put   his

signature to the document to signify his agreement  to

the  joint statement, which fact was also reported  in

the Nanyang Siang Pan of the same day. For purpose  of

record,  the  names  of  the  eight  members  of   the

Committee-Teacher  Association who were  present  that

day were:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ko Teck Kin

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kheng Chin Hock

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lim Keng Lian

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foo Chee Fong

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Lin Fang Lan

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kao Hung Keng

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tan Choon Teng

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phua Chay Long



<br><br>One  representative of the so-called parents suggested

holding  a  referendum amongst all  Chinese  secondary

school   students  over  the  so-called  "unreasonable

condition".   This  could  not  be accepted   as   no

government in the world would consult immature  school

children  on educational policies. What would  be  the

situation if a referendum were asked on whether  there

should  be  examinations  at  all?  I  think  it   was

indicated  by  the  Member for Farrer  Park  that  the

likely result would be "No".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the evidence we had about this so-called

parents' representatives and the students' boycott, it

is   now  clear  that  the  whole  operation  of   the

examination  boycott  was part  of  the  pro-Communist

campaign  to  stir up feelings against the Government.

After  the boy-Cotters had failed in their attempt  to

wreck  the  Government Secondary IV examination,  they

organised a four-day "student congregation"  from  5th

December to 8th December to have so-called "collective

life" and "Hsueh-hsi", similar to the 1956 period,  at

the Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2509</b></font><br><br>



High  School and Chung Cheng High School. During these

so-called  "Hsueh-hsi" sessions, student leaders  read

aloud  the  article on examination  boycott  from  the

Barisan,  the organ of the Barisan Sosialis. At  these

sessions student leaders reminded those present of the

Communist-inspired  student movement  which  began  on

13th  May, 1954. One of the girl student leaders asked

those  present  not to be afraid of brutal  force  and

cited  the  May  13  incident as a worthy  example  to

emulate.  She  urged that they should consolidate  and

prepare   for  a  more  bitter  struggle  ahead.   She

stressed,  Sir,  that  in this  Assembly,  instead  of

debating  the question of merger, the Government,  she

alleged   had  brought  in  the  motion   for   police

protection   for  parents  of  students   taking   the

Government  examination in order to  divert  the  main

issue  with  the hope that this bogus merger  proposal

could be carried through. Students were also taught to

sing the following songs, "The May 13 March", "Holding

Hands",  "Praised  be  the  month  of  May",  "May  13

Remembrance Song". For the Current Affairs  test,  the

following  questions were among those set  for  verbal

answer:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(l) Why is it that the education policy of the P.A.P.

Government  is similar to that of the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government? Give reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is there any difference between "citizen" and

"national"?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What difference is there between a "complete

"merger" and "Malaysia"?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Is there any dissimilarity in the education

policy  of the Singapore Government and  that  of

the Federation Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Why do we boycott the examination and what is the

reaction of the public?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear that student agitators were making

use  of innocent students to whip up sentiment against

merger,  and  this  boycott was no doubt  part  of  an

overall  anti-Government  campaign  inspired  by  pro-Communist  elements to subvert the Government  and  to

campaign against merger. As we have said from the very

beginning,  this  has become not an educational  issue

but a political issue engineered by Communists and pro-Communists with the ulterior motive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2510</b></font><br><br>



of  discrediting  the  Government.  Fortunately  their

efforts   failed  dismally.  The  great  majority   of

students,  assisted  by  their parents,  resisted  the

campaign  of intimidation and vilification mounted  by

these   misinformed  youths.  By   sitting   for   the

Government examination, the majority of students  have

exposed the true nature of pro-Communist agitation  as

an  attempt  to  sacrifice students for their  selfish

political  interest.  For the first  time  in  Malayan

circumstances  of  the  somewhat explosive  atmosphere

around education, I have indicated to the Minster this

would  let me know, since Government had indicated  it

was  as  anxious as I to appoint a Commission, whether

he  would,  in  fact,  make  a  ministerial  statement

appointing  a  Commission so that  we  could  avoid  a

debate  wherein this educational policy might take  on

unhappy  political slants, Sir. I am anxious  that  we

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D8 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are certain large blocks of property in a

very  densely  populated  city  area  which  will   be

reverting  to the Government at the end of  a  ninety-nine year lease. I remember at one time that a certain

school  was offered a piece of that property. I  think

some  of  the leases might be expiring at the  end  of

this  year  or  at the end of the next  two  or  three

years.   Sir,   this  will  give  the  Government   an

opportunity to remove some of the very unhealthy areas

there and do some clearance work. At the same time, we

realise  very well the great difficulty in  resettling

the  people  affected. I remember visiting one  family

living in a very dingy and poorly ventilated room  and

the rent was $20 to $30 per room in that area. I asked

them why they did not go for the Housing Board houses,

where  they could get similar accommodation for  about

$20.  The answer was that they wanted to be near their

work.  "Besides, if we go for the Housing Board houses

in  Queenstown, it means more transport money, loss of

time;  so we would rather pay even $10 per month  more

than  go  over  there." Sir, these  are  some  of  the

difficulties, and we wonder whether the  Minister  has

made  plans on the development of the area and how  he

proposes to resettle these people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> I do

not  think we can rebuild the slums of Singapore  just

on the basis of property reverting to the State on the

expiry of the ninety-nine year lease. It is only  bits

of  property  here  and  there and  not  a  continuous

purchase  of property that will revert to  the  State.

But  I think the Member for Tanglin has raised a  very

vital  issue  which has been exercising the  minds  of

Government  for some time. But we do  not  see  it  as

something  that  we  can do as  part  of  the  present

Development Plan, because the Housing Board has enough

on its hands to carry out its own housing programme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2513</b></font><br><br>



which  will be mainly outside the centre of the  city.

But  obviously something must be done about the  slums

of Singapore. The building are old and dilapidated and

are  not being maintained. One possible approach which

the Government has been thinking about is not only  to

make  use  of  the  properties which revert  to  their

ownership at the end of the leases but also to buy  up

all  properties in areas to be re-developed. But  this

is  going to be a massive operation. Certainly it will

cost  several hundred millions of dollars, and it will

perhaps  take more than a decade to complete. We  have

asked the United Nations to send a specialist who  can

advice  us  on  how  to  proceed with  this  long-term

development of the city itself, how we can get rid  of

these slum buildings, and how in their places a proper

and modern city could be built. But as I said, this is

really  a rather long-term problem, something  perhaps

for  consideration in the second Five-Year Development

Plan.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware that in

the  past,  when  these 99-year  leases  expired,  the

Government  renewed  them  on  a  similar  basis  with

certain  conditions  which the  Minister  calls  in  a

haphazard   fashion.  There  are  certain   areas   in

Singapore,  Sir, where a 99-year lease is  granted  in

respect of large tracts of land on which a very  great

number  of  houses stand. Is the Government  in  fact,

pursuing  the  old tradition of renewing these  leases

when  they  expire? And secondly, whether  they  would

survey  the problem, say, for the next ten  years,  to

have  an  adequate  understanding of  the  areas  that

would,  in  fact, fall due, and have an  overall  plan

before issuing fresh leases in respect of those  which

already expired.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> To the best of my belief,

properties which revert to the State remain  with  the

State.  They are not being leased out to new  holders.

As  regards the long-term development plan to  rebuild

the  city, I have explained, in reply to the  question

of  the Member for Tanglin, that we have taken note of

this  problem. We have made preliminary steps  towards

solving it. But, as I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2514</b></font><br><br>



said, it is going to be a long-term process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D13 bereduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have tabled in all 206 amendments under the

Development  Estimates. Sir, they  have  been  put  in

because the Standing Orders require me to give  notice

if I want to raise any matter on which I would like to

ask questions or seek information. But in order to cut

this debate short, Sir, I think it would be convenient

if  you  would  allow me to roam over the  Development

Estimates. If I get satisfaction, I will therefore not

find  it  necessary to move all the  other  amendments

standing in my name.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If it is convenient, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you, Sir. Sir, that being so,

I  would like, first of all, to say that from a  close

study of the Development Estimates which we have  here

for 1963 - it would appear that little work has been put

into  it.  With  only  one exception,  it  is  a  very

convenient   reproduction  of  the  1962   Development

Estimates,  with  different amounts  estimated  to  be

spent  in  1963.  Sir, the 1962 Development  Estimates

have  at least been prepared with care, giving details

of   plan   costs,   revised  plan  costs,   estimated

expenditure  up  to  31st  December,  1961,  estimated

expenditure in 1962, expenditure required to complete,

and  notes. The 1963 Development Estimates, Sir,  just

show  plan  costs,  revised plan costs  and  estimated

expenditure in 1963. These, therefore, do not  give  a

complete  picture.  The  1963  Estimates  have  to  be

studied alongside the 1962 Estimates in order to  have

a  clear  understanding of what the  1963  Development

Estimates are about. Sir, may I touch on this? From  a

close study of the two Development Estimates, it would

appear that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>1963 Development Estimates can be divided  into  five

classes.  The first class is that under  the  item,  a

full  vote has already been provided for in 1962,  and

yet for 1963 a token provision of $10 is asked for.  I

find  it difficult try understand this. As far  as  my

little  knowledge goes of how budgets  are  drawn  up,

when  one  puts in a token vote of $10, it means  that

while the principle has been accepted, as in the  case

of  the  hospital at Kandang Kerbau  which  is  to  be

built,   the  details  have  yet  to  be  studied   or

finalised. But in this case of a token vote  in  1963,

it  is  an extra $10 that is asked for on an item  for

which  full  provision has already  been  provided  in

1962.   Therefore,  I  say,  Sir,  that   these   1963

Development  Estimates have been prepared with  little

or  no  work  at  all. It makes it difficult  for  the

Opposition to understand and appreciate what is behind

the   motive  in  presenting  as  a  rush  matter  the

Development  Estimates that do not coincide  with  the

regular  yearly  Development  Estimates,  where   full

details are given. The Government wants a rush job  of

this for reasons which they have already explained. We

have  accepted those reasons. But they  have  made  it

more  difficult for the Opposition to understand  what

they  are driving at. That is one of it. One class  is

where  full  estimates have already been  provided  in

1962,  and  yet for 1963, a token provision  is  asked

for. A token provision of $10, as far as we understand

it,  and as has been explained by the Minister in this

House,  it  always put in where a principle  has  been

accepted, but the details of the works have  not  been

finalised  or  completed. How  could  it  be  a  token

provision when the work has already started,  and  the

full amount has already been given? That is one class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second class is that full votes have already been

provided in 1962, and yet for 1963 some more money  is

asked  for.  I  think there are over a  hundred  items

where full votes have already been provided in 1962.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2516</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just take a case in point, the multi-storey car

park. Now, for 1962, $2 million has been provided, and

the cost of that multi-storey car park is estimated to

cost  $2 million. Yet for 1963, $1 million is put  in.

Of  course,  I  can understand, Sir, that  $1  million

could  be  a revote, because the Government  does  not

expect  that the full amount could have been  paid  or

that  the car park could have been completed in  1962.

But then in 1962, in cases where it is a revote, it is

clearly  stated that the vote asked for is  a  revote.

That  is in 1962, where actual facts are given, it  is

revote.  But  for 1963, just "Multi-storey  Car  Park,

Plan  Cost  $2 million, Revised Plan Cost $2  million,

amount  asked for $1 million." If we were  to  approve

that  $1  million, it could mean that  the  Government

could use that extra million to pay for a multi-storey

car  park over and above the revised plan cost. Unless

it  is put in the notes column that it is a revote, we

can  have no control. Sir, it seems that the Ministers

cannot  be  serious about it. They want the Opposition

to  vote a million dollars for them to put in an extra

storey.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> I do

not want it.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, they are now trying to tell a

cock-and-bull  story about the way they  present  this

Budget which-they say - what did the Minster for Finance

say?  He  explained  in page 37, paragraph  3  ["First

copy" of the Hansard]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To settle the details of allocation of votes and

revenue   between   State  and   Central   Government.

additional work will devolve on Treasury officials and

those    Ministries   affected   by    transfers    of

responsibility,  and it is not likely  that  the  1963

Budget will be ready in time. This may well expose the

Government to criticism. There might even be a loss of

confidence in the administration. For this reason  and

in  fairness to the administration, I will   be  asking

the  House to approve a vote on account for the  first

six  months of 1963. I also intend to ask approval for

the Development Estimates for the whole of 1963.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fairness to the administration"- May I say to the

administration,  in fairness to the  Opposition,  that

they must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2517</b></font><br><br>



present  something that contains full details  and  not

present something with no details at all and ask us  to

vote for it, as I have tried to explain in the case  of

this  multi-storey car park. If we were to approve that

vote  of  $1  million,  although  in  fairness  to  the

Government  it means a revote, it means we  would  give

the  Government the authority to spend $1 million  over

and  above the $2 million asked for in 1962. Sir,  that

is the second class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third class is this. In 1962, you will find that

the  revised  plan cost is so much; so much  will  have

been  spent by the 31st December, 1961, and a  vote  is

asked  for in 1962, and there is still some more  money

required to complete. Therefore, that money required to

complete  would, of course, have to be found  in  1963.

But then in the 1963 Development Estimates, what is put

in  to  complete the work is more than what is inserted

in  the  1962  Budget as required to complete.  Take  a

simple   item,  Civil  Aviation.  [Interruption]   That

happens  to  be  the first one. Sub-Head  9,  Passenger

Terminal  Building. According to the 1962 Budget,  what

is  required  to complete this sub-head is  $1,140,000.

But  for 1963, the vote asked for is $2,140,000,  which

is  $1 million more. And yet there is no explanation at

all  in  the space provided for notes. Sir, if we  were

just to consider the 1963 Development Estimates without

bothering to check every item bit by bit with the  1962

Estimates,  we  would not know. It would just  disclose

that  the  cost of the Passenger Terminal  Building  is

$4.8  million, the revised plan cost is $3.14  million,

and  what  is  asked for for 1963 is $2.14 million.  It

does not give the true story.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third class is that the vote asked for in 1963 is

much  more than what is required to complete the  work,

according to the 1962 Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another class, Sir, and this is really very

funny.  For 1962, $10, a lot of $10, that is to say,  a

token  vote  of $10 to say that they want  to  build  a

hospital,  but the details have not yet been  completed

or  finalised or worked out. Therefore, a token vote of

$10.  And  our approving a token vote of $10  for  1962

will allow the Government to go ahead with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2518</b></font><br><br>



the  scheme and to work out plans for whatever  project

the  token vote is for. And for 1963, yet another token

vote  is asked for. That shows they do not want  to  do

any work in 1962. If they do not want to do any work in

1962,  then why ask for a token vote for 1962? Why  not

come  to us in 1963? They think it is a playing  matter

that  they do not want to do any work for the  good  of

the  people of Singapore [Laughter]. A laughing  matter

when  they do not care to do that work with which  they

are  entrusted.  So  you have a  token  vote  in  1962;

another token vote in 1963; there may be further  token

votes  in  1964  and 1965. I do not think  it  will  go

beyond 1963, Sir, because they will be no more by then.

The P.A.P. Government will have been finish ed by then.

That is class four.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, class 5. This is another funny thing, Sir. They

have  in  1962,  if you make a comparison,  work  which

started  in 1960. They paid some money in  1961,  They

asked  for money in 1962. Then is a balance to complete

in 1963. And yet in 1963 they put down a token vote. Do

they  not know what is required to complete? Must  they

put  down a token vote of $10? This just goes to prove,

Sir,  that the Ministry of Finance has done no work  on

this. If it had done some work, it would have presented

to this Assembly a picture of the real development that

is  going on in the country and the development  plans,

instead  of  giving us something which is so  difficult

for  us  to  understand. Sir, if we were just  to  take

these  1963 Development Estimates, we would be thinking

these are new items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth class I have no quarrel with the Government

when  they put in an amount which is less than the full

amount  to  complete a job. That shows  there  is  some

work.  Let  us  take the case where the work  has  been

started in 1961, is to be carried on in 1962, and to be

completed in 1963. An amount is given and then  another

amount is given here where, instead of $1 million,  the

amount  given  is about $800,000. This shows  that  the

secretary  in  charge of this has at  least  done  some

work,  for he thinks that for 1963, only $800,000 worth

of  works  will be done. I do not complain about  that.

But if it is true that there is work to be done, and if

real work had been done,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2519</b></font><br><br>



there  would  have been a fairer picture presented  to

this  Assembly, instead of the Finance Minister coming

to  us  and saying, in fairness to the administration,

he  is  putting  this.  I  say,  in  fairness  to  the

Opposition  present, something that does  not  try  to

hide a lot of work that should have been done but  was

not done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the six classes, Sir. Can the Minister

answer  them?  In the case of votes that have  already

been  given, why is it that a token vote is now  asked

for?  And is my interpretation of a token vote  right?

That  is  one.  Why is it that when the full  vote  is

already given up to 1962, another amount is asked for?

If  it  is meant to be a revote, why not say it  is  a

revote?  If  it is not so stated, it could  mean  that

that  extra money could be spent by the Government  on

the  project.  The third one is, why is it  that  more

money  is  put in to complete the work than  what  has

been stated in the 1962 Development Estimates as money

required to complete the work? The fourth one is,  why

two  token votes, one in 1962 and another in 1963?  Do

the Government now say that for the whole of 1962 they

will  have no time because they will be in,  I  think,

the  fourth round or fifth round of the fight with the

Barisan  Sosialis and therefore they will not be  able

to  do any work? So that they still want a token  vote

for 1963. Why two token votes? Does it mean no work in

1962,  or does it mean that is the convenient  way  of

putting  $10? The fifth one is, when work has  already

been started and some monies are required to complete.

why  should a token vote of $10 be put in?  I  do  not

think  the Minister for Finance can satisfy us on  all

those  points. No matter how he satisfies us, once  we

have approved these Development Estimates as stated in

this  Cmd. Paper 38, it will give the Government every

right  to  spend an extra million dollars on a  multi-storey car park or wherever such extra money is  asked

for.  I  would therefore urge the Government that,  in

fairness  to the Opposition, the Minister should  take

the Development Estimates back and get his Ministry to

do  some real work on them, and then come back to  us.

There is no rush for 1963; even in July, August



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2520</b></font><br><br>



or  even  as  late  as November, he  can  present  the

Development  Estimates, as merger in  1963  will  have

little  or no impact on the Development Estimates.  So

why  rush  all  this? I would urge the  Government  to

withdraw   these   Estimates  and   re-present   them,

otherwise  it  shall be the duty of the Opposition  to

oppose them through every amendment that I have  under

my name - 206 of them.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member for Cairnhill has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2521</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. Anyway, the time will expire at

five past four.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I must congratulate the

Member for Cairnhill on having done his homework well.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> While you are in the boxing ring, we are working!

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Honestly he has spent some time

and  effort  on this, and I think he has  raised  some

very  pertinent points which I will try to explain  to

the  House. First, he grumbles about the fact that the 1963  Development Estimates

are a virtual reproduction

of  the 1962 Development Estimates. That is so, and  I

did  explain in my statement that both in  respect  of

the  Ordinary Estimates and the Development  Estimates

we intend not to introduce any new items. So, I think,

that comes as no surprise to the Member for Cairnhill.

Now,  the six classes of items - combination of  items.

The first one is where a full amount has been provided

for in 1962, a token sum of $10 is also entered in the 1963 Estimates.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should best discuss this in terms of

concrete examples, so that everyone will know why this

procedure is adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take Head D13, subhead 14 - High Capacity Foam

Tender. I do not know what a High Capacity Foam Tender

is, but  my  colleague the Deputy Prime Minister,  in

fact, intends to buy one in 1962. So the full cost  of

the  High  Capacity Foam Tender has been  entered  for

1962.  Now it may just be possible that the Department

of  Civil  Aviation might place the  order  and  there

might be some delay in delivery and, in fact, the bill

might  not be presented for payment in 1962, in  which

case payment must be made in 1963. The only reason for

putting   a   $10  vote  in  1963  is  to  meet   such

eventualities. They are not expected to happen but, on

the  other hand, we cannot be sure. If in the unlikely

event the bill for the High Capacity Foam Tender  does

not  arrived in time in 1962, then in 1963,  we  shall

have to make use of this vote to pay for it - of course,

through some transfers from other subheads.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2522</b></font><br><br>



That disposes of the hon. Member's first point on  the

items in the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the second one cited was an instance where the

full  amount  has been provided in the 1962  Estimates

and   yet  a  substantial  sum  appears  in  the  1963

Estimates.  The  multi-storey  car  park  is  a   good

example.  Of  course,  the explanation  given  by  the

Member  for  Cairnhill is correct. It is, in  fact,  a

revote.  The hon. Member asks, "Why not say a revote?"

The  reason is that before any item is entered in  the

Estimates as a revote, certain procedures will have to

be  complied with; that is, a progress report will  he

made to the Treasury - explanation for delay of payments

and  so  on -  and then it is approved as a revote  and

entered  accordingly. But I think it is obviously  too

early  to enter this item formally as a revote because

a  start has not been made on the project at all. Nor,

on  the  other hand, can we just enter a token sum  of

$10  because,  in this particular Head, there  is  not

enough money under other subheads to effect a virement

of  transfer  of funds. If you look at Head  D19,  you

will  see  that  there  are only  two  subheads;  one,

Construction and Installation of Parking Places, a sum

of  $120,000 has been asked for 1963. And  should  the

Multi-storey Car Park be not completed in  1962,  then

there is absolutely no money to pay for the completion

of  this  project.  Therefore,  we  put  in  a  fairly

substantial sum to meet this eventuality. Of course, I

have  had  a  word with the Deputy Prime Minister  and

urged  him  to  get on with this project  as  soon  as

possible.  I  understood from him that he has  already

got cracking on it. That explains the second class  of

items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the third one refers to instances where a vote is

provided in 1962 - let us get this right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> More than what is required.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, the case of subhead 9 of Head

D13,  Passenger  Terminal Building. The  revised  plan

cost   is   $3,140,000;  $2  million   is   voted   for

1962 - leaving therefore $1,140,000 as a balance - whereas

the amount asked for in 1963 is just $1 million more.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2523</b></font><br><br>



Here  again,  the  sum of $2,140,000 consists  of  two

parts: one is the balance and the other is, in fact, a

revote item just in the event that the progress on the

Passenger  Terminal Building is not  as  fast  as  one

would hope it to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the fourth class of items. He refers

to  the two $10 token votes for the consecutive  years

1962  and  1963. He refers to items in the plan  where

either  there is an order of priority for  getting  it

off the mark where we can wait for some time and there

is  no urgency about the matter, or else it means that

the  Ministry concerned are having second thoughts  on

that  project and they have not finally made up  their

minds whether they want to include it or throw it  out

or  substitute  some other project. So  for  the  time

being  in  case they revert back to the original  plan

and  if they want to proceed with it in 1963, they can

do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth class is where work has started in 1961,

sums have been spent in 1962, and a token sum of $10

is entered in 1963. This is really the same as the

first instance where we have provided a full total for

1962 but just in case the expenditure is not

completed, where the work is not completed -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Can I explain?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What I have said is that the work

has  been started in 1961, is carried on in 1962,  and

there  is a balance required to complete; and yet  for

1963,  instead of working out the actual  amount  that

would  be  required to be spent in 1963, a  convenient

way  has been adopted by just putting in a token  vote

of  $10;  whereas in other cases where some  work  has

been done some amounts have been inserted. But in most

cases, a mere $10 is inserted. That shows that no work

has been done.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could the Member give one item?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2524</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, in the 1962 Development

Estimates  on page 21, item (1) of subhead 5  of  Head

D25  (District  Hospitals) - Second  District  Hospital,

Works  and  Buildings; $12,000 is voted for  1962  and

there is a balance of $4,988,000. This shows that  the

work will have started in 1962; and yet for 1963 there

is  a  token vote of $10; whereas in other cases where

there are big amount, some work has been done.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think, in this instance, the

explanation is quite simple. When the 1962 Development

Estimates were prepared, the Ministry of Health  asked

for  this  sum.  I  think it was for  the  preliminary

investigations, soil-testing and so on, and then later

on  the  Ministry  decided not to  proceed  with  this

project. The whole development plan of the Ministry of

Health  is  now under revision. But as  I  have  said,

until  they can definitely tell us that that is to  be

scrapped  and they want something else, I  am  leaving

the  thing as it is and just maintaining its existence

by a token sum under this Head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member will find that there may be a

number of instances of that nature in the Ministry  of

Health.  That is the fifth class. Now as to the  sixth

class.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I think you have done your work.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Well then, I think that completes

the list.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Cairnhill is satisfied

with the sixth class?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Excuse me, Sir, in certain cases

where we have a double token vote, I am satisfied.  It

shows that the Minister wants to have second thoughts,

third  thoughts  and fourth thoughts  before  he  does

anything.  Well, I am quite happy to let the  Minister

have  as many thoughts as he wants so long as he  does

not squander public funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the $10 token on the first one. I do

not  have  any serious objection to that. But  on  the

other one where a full vote has been given and a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2525</b></font><br><br>



big  sum is asked for for 1963 without mentioning that

it is a revote, it is going to allow the Government to

use  the  money  should the revised  cost  exceed  the

actual  revised cost here. There will be  no  control.

Take the Multi-storey Car Park. The revised cost is $2

million and the plan cost is $2 million. They ask  for

$2 million for 1962 - it is all right. Then they ask for

an  extra $1 million for 1963 to the extent that it is

meant to be a revote. If it were clearly stated  as  a

revote  in  the Estimates, I would have no  objection.

But  to  vote that $1 million is equivalent to  giving

the  Government the right to spend an extra $1 million

so  that, as they have said, if they want to put up  a

storey, they can do so with this $1 million if  it  is

approved by us. They could put up another two storeys.

If  they  suddenly think they might  want  to  have  a

P.A.P. house  on top, they can still put  it  up.  So

there  is  no reason why we should vote this extra  $1

million.  If it is a revote, say so. Put it  in  there

and  make  it  clear.  I  still  maintain  that  these

Development Estimates have not been properly  prepared

and  they do not present a correct picture. I  suggest

that  they  should  be  taken  back  and  a  new   one

presented,  using the 1962 basis with an extra  column

to read "Expected to be required in 1963".



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there would be no objection. But why the rush?

Cannot the Minister take the Development Estimates for

1963  back  and  present them in a  way  that  can  be

understood, in a way that will leave no ambiguity,  in

a  way  that will kill all suspicions that  the  extra

million dollars asked for for a Multi-storey Car  Park

could  mean  that the Minister might want  to  put  up

another  two storeys - one for the P.A.P. and maybe  the

other  one  for the Barisan Sosialis if  they  should'

suddenly reconcile?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I can see that the Member for

Cairnhill is really being a bit far-fetched.  Use  the

Multi-storey Car Park as a test case, Now, if all goes

well with my colleague the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2526</b></font><br><br>



Deputy   Prime   Minister,  specifications   will   be

completed  and  tenders will be out,  say,  in  March,

April  or thereabouts next year. At that time,  surely

whoever  is  in charge of the Estimates and  financial

operations for this, must see that the amount tendered

for  does not exceed $2 million; otherwise he will  be

ultra  vires. He would not have any money to  pay  for

it.  It  is  only in the event that there could  be  a

delay  either  in  the  date  in  which  designs   are

completed or projects let out to tender that  the  sum

to  be  voted would be required. I have made it  quite

clear,  Sir, that in such cases they can be identified

quite  easily by reference to the 1962 Estimates.  The

position is quite clear.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister says they can be

easily   identified.  But  it  is  the  work  of   the

Government  to  make  it easy for  the  Opposition  to

identify, instead of which we have to go through these

two books, after sitting for 23 days, to find out what

kind  of  tricks the Government is up to now. And  the

Minister says that no new item has been inserted.  May

I  point out to him that a new item has been inserted,

and no mention has been made by the Minister? Sir, may

I  point out to him that a new item has been inserted,

although  he  has  said  just  now  and  also  in  his

statement  that  no new item has been inserted:  "Head

D18"  at  page  17 -  "Telecommunications Board" - not  in

1962.  All  these things simply show that he  is  not

making statements which are helpful to us in making  a

study, in an attempt to help him over his troubles and

all that. He makes it more difficult. Therefore, if it

gives  him pleasure to give trouble to the Opposition,

I  will  say that it is the duty of the Opposition  to

return that pleasure with interest.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

for  one  am indebted to the Member for Cairnhill  for

drawing  the  attention of the House  to  these  grave

inadequacies in the Development Estimates for 1963.  I

am  particularly perturbed, Mr Speaker, at the second

and  third classes to which he has drawn the attention

of the House. That is, as in the case of the car park,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2527</b></font><br><br>



a  full vote having been made for $2 million for 1962,

we have another $1 million for a car park in 1963. And

in  so far as I can judge, there is nothing to prevent

the  Government from having a car park for  a  million

dollars  in 1963 in respect of which there is no  real

authorisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third class, Sir, is where more money has been

voted  during  the years 1962 and 1963 in  respect  of

items  such  as  the Passenger Terminal Building,  the

cost  as indicated. This means, Sir, that within  that

particular Head, Government would be free, by  way  of

virement, to utilise these additional monies for other

items where they wish to expand the original scheme. I

say, Mr Speaker, that the Opposition, and I trust the

whole  House, is indebted to the Member for  Cairnhill

for    drawing    attention   to   the    Government's

extraordinary  fashion  in  presenting  a  budget  and

seeking a free hand in respect of public monies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final matter, Sir, which is rather a matter of

procedure  which  has  not the same  gravity  as  this

extraordinary confession on the part of the  Minister - that  he  has for 1962 a $10 token vote is respect  of

matters  on  which the Ministry has not  made  up  its

mind.  That is why he seeks another $10 for 1963.  Mr

Speaker, is it appropriate that the Government  should

trouble this House to make up its mind on principle in

respect  of  matters  in  connection  with  which  the

Government itself has not made up its mind?  What  are

we  playing?  Marbles in this House? It is  even  more

surprising,  Mr  Speaker,  that  we  have   had   the

confession  made  by the Minister in respect  of  Head

D25,  item 5: that $12,000 is expected to be spent  in

the year 1962 in respect of works when, in so far as I

can  understand  him, it is intended  to  abandon  the

Second District Hospital. How is it that the money has

already  been allocated or allocation has been  sought

in  respect of payment for something which they do not

wish  to use? If the work of exploration has been done

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2528</b></font><br><br>



1961, is it not covered by the 1961 vote? If  it  is,

why do we have to pay it in 1962?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, if, in fact, that $12,000 is in respect

of work which it is now intended to abandon, is it not

appropriate  that  this  House  should  have  been  so

advised?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

want to take the Minister to task on his statement  on

Head  D19,  subhead  2, "Multi-storey  Car  Park".  He

mentioned just now, Sir, that if the planner for  this

car park were to start work by, say, April, and decide

to  build  a  car  park that is  worth  more  than  $2

million, he would obviously be ultra vires. I  submit,

Sir,  the planner who plans a $3 million car  park  in

April  1962 is not ultra vires because, in so  far  as

this  House  is  concerned,  if  the  two  Development

Estimates  had  been passed, we would have  authorised

the expenditure of $2 million in 1962 and a further $1

million in 1963, making an estimated total expenditure

of  $3  million  for the years in 1962  and  1963.  No

doubt, Sir, the plan costs and the revised plan  costs

only  permit the planner an expenditure of $2 million.

But  this House which has sat, considered, debated and

passed  the Budget, allows the planner expenditure  to

the  extent of $3 million. I will, therefore, say here

that it is a matter of grave doubt whether the planner

should allow himself to be guided by the plan costs or

by that exact amount of monies voted by this House.  I

would  urge  the  Minister, in the same  tone  as  the

Member  for  Cairnhill has urged him,  to  bring  this

Development  budget hack and revise it; put  notes  if

necessary  to explain that this $1 million would  only

be spent should the $2 million be under spent in 1962.

And  whatever  vote  that has been  underspent  should

lapse in 1962, thereby making it necessary for this $1

million to be spent in 1963. In view of the absence of

any  explanatory notes, it would appear, Sir, that  if

the  two  Development budgets have  been  passed,  any

planner who has any respect for the decisions of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2529</b></font><br><br>



House  would be within his right and within his  power

to plan a car park which is worth $3 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, over and above the difficulties of

the Member for Cairnhill as experienced, I myself have

experienced another difficulty which I wish  to  bring

to  the  notice of the Finance Minister. In  his  1962

Development Estimates, Mr Speaker, Sir, if  you  will

be  good enough to look at page 7 of Paper Cmd. 36  of

1961  being  Development Estimates  of  the  State  of

Singapore for the Year 1962, and previous to that page

"Development  Fund Account", there is a  statement  of

Estimated Receipts and Payments. Mr Speaker, you will

notice that the Balance as at 31st December, 1961,  is

$131  million. Then there are a number of items  which

set  out  the monies which are going to be  paid  into

that   Fund.  On  the  right-hand  side  is  Estimated

Payments  cut  of that Fund for the year  1962,  after

which  the  total  sum  on  the  Receipts  column   is

exhausted.  So that on the basis of total  expenditure

on  the  Development Fund for the year 1962, the  Fund

will  remain nil as at 31st December, 1962.  If  I  am

correct  in  that, then on the 1st January,  1963,  we

start with nothing in the kitty except for $80 million

which  was transferred by the Assembly - I think it  was

last  week -  from  the  Consolidated  Fund  into   the

Development Fund, together with the $30 million  which

will  be  transferred by the Ministry of Finance  from

the  Consolidated  Fund for the  year  1962  into  the

Development Fund. There will then be $80 million  plus

$30 million, i.e. $110 millions. So that. Mr Speaker,

Sir, we start off then on 1st January, 1963, with $110

million,  and the Minister for Finance is asking  this

House  to approve Development Fund expenditure  up  to

the  extent  of $173 million. In other  words,  he  is

asking  this House to approve expenditure payable  out

of the Fund, the capital of which is not sufficient to

meet  the  expenditure he is asking us  to  meet.  The

curious thing about these 1963 Estimates, Mr Speaker,

Sir, is that the Statement of Estimated Receipts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2530</b></font><br><br>



and  Payments  which appears in the  1962  Development

Estimates does not appear. It is conspicuously absent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to ask and which is causing

some  confusion amongst the Opposition Members is this

car  park. Will the Minister assure the House that the

governing factor for the expenditure of monies will be

the total revised cost?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in view of the guillotine, may

I say this to the Minister? There is no rush for these

Estimates  to be approved today. If he will just  take

them back and get them done in the proper way, instead

of in this haphazard way, things would be much better.

But  if  he  insists  on wanting  us  to  approve  the

Development Estimates done up in such a haphazard way,

it  shall  be our duty to oppose every item  in  every

Head.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We share the opinion of the other

Opposition  Members  in saying  that  there  has  been

absolute hurry in preparing this Budget, and so far as

we  know,  as has already been pointed out, there  has

been  no adequate preparation. All we in the  Barisan

Sosialis know is that this Budget has been put forward

with  the  intention of befuddling the Opposition  and

also -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do net think the Member for

Queenstown is proper in imputing an improper motive, I

think  there  is a Standing Order which says  that  no

Member  should  impute  any improper  motive.  If  the

allegation is that the Government has introduced  this

Budget  to  befuddle the Opposition Members,  I  think

that  is  an  improper  motive.  Let  us  debate  this

soberly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we think they want to give

the  impression that the merger proposals are  already

all  under  way  and  that  merger  is  right  on  our

doorstep. As far as we know, they have not even held a

referendum. So how can they be so sure about anything?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2531</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> May I explain this? When I was

bending  my mind to the problem of how to present  the 1963   Estimates

to   the  Assembly,   I   had   two

alternatives. One is to present them in a simple  way,

with  three  columns, which is fairly straightforward.

The  other  one  would be to take  into  account  what

happened  in  the  plan cost, the revised  plan  cost,

expenditure  in  1961  and 1962, amounts  required  to

complete  amount estimated in 1963; whether there  are

revotes or no, and so on and so forth. That would make

the  matter of presentation rather complicated. If the

Members opposite so desire, it is a simple matter  for

me  to  do. I am quite willing to reproduce  the  1963

Estimates  absolutely on the same  basis,  because  we

have  all the working papers in our own files.  It  is

only to save Members of the Opposition from trying  to

read  columns  that  we have presented  three  columns

only. If they want eight columns, so be it. I am quite

happy to present to the Assembly the same stuff by the

same  identical  method. It is not a  question,  as  I

said,  of whether we have been working on them or  not

working on them. It is a matter of presentation.  They

want   a   more  complicated  presentation.  If   that

satisfies  them,  I  am  quite happy  to  take  these

Estimates  back  and come back to the  Assembly  again

next month. But I do ask Members of the Opposition  to

think carefully about it. Do we want to waste the time

of the Assembly all over again over a set of estimates

which  would differ only in presentation, only in  the

number  of  columns  they should have?  The  substance

would  be  absolutely  the same.  If  Members  of  the

Opposition want it, I am quite happy with it.  I  have

no objection at all.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is there a way

whereby the Finance Minister can withdraw? If he  can,

may  I  explain that we prefer it that  way.  We  just

raise  our objection to the fact that something  which

is  meaningless is placed before us. We want it to  be

in  clear and unequivocal terms before we can give our

vote on it.

the  duties  of the Estimates Committee is to  suggest

the form in which the Estimates might be presented. So

perhaps, to satisfy the Opposition, the matter  should

go  to the Estimates Committee as to the form in which

these Development Estimates should be presented.  Does

that satisfy?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Minister could undertake to

do that.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I make myself clear? I just draw

the attention of the hon. Members to paragraph (3)  of

Standing  Order  93  which deals  with  the  Estimates

Committee, and the relevant parts read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It shall be the duty of the Committee to examine any

of  the Estimates, to report what economies consistent

with  the  policy  implied in the Estimates  might  be

effected, and, subject to the provisions of  the  law,

to  suggest the form in which the Estimates  might  be

presented.'



<br><br>"subject to the provisions of the law, to suggest  the

form  in  which  the Estimates might be presented."  I

draw  the  attention of the Minister and that  of  the

Opposition to that provision. It might be a convenient

way of satisfying the Opposition if the matter went to

the   Estimates  Committee.  But  meanwhile,  if   the

Minister  is agreeable to Cmd. Paper 38 of 1961  being

withdrawn,  I  will  draft a motion  for  him.  Is  he

agreeable to that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not know what Members of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2533</b></font><br><br>



on a matter of presentation, we have to go through the

whole   of  the  exercise  all  over  again.  If   the

Opposition  is  prepared to consider  these  Estimates

now,  and  then get the items considered in detail  in

the  Estimates Committee, possibly for formal  tabling

in  this  Assembly, that might save a lot of time  all

round.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let the Minister complete what

he has to say.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, once the Estimates have been

approved  by this House, that is the end  of  it.  The

Government can do what it likes with it. Then there is

no  need  to  refer  to the Estimates  Committee.  The

reason  why they should go to the Estimates  Committee

to  consider the form in which these Estimates  should

be  presented is that no decision has been arrived  at

by  the House. Once the House say yes to it, there  is

no more question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> But you could outline the steps

that  would  take place if this were referred  to  the

Estimates Committee and what happens after that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister agrees that this

Development  Estimates for the State of Singapore  for

the  year 1963 be discharged, and that Paper Cmd.  38

of 1961 be withdrawn. Once that has been agreed to.  I

take  it  the  Minister will then go to the  Estimates

Committee  and get their decision on how they  require

the  Development Estimates for 1963 to  be  presented.

They  will  then  be presented in a different  Command

paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the only thing the

Estimates  Committee will be asked to do is to  settle

the  form  in  which the Development Estimates  should

come  back  to  the Assembly. But The contents  to  be

inserted  and  the  form  to be  agreed  is  a  matter

entirely for the Minister.

proper  form  has been agreed upon, all the  objection

that  I  have will not be raised by me, because  those

objections will have been met.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am quite happy, Mr Speaker,

Sir. My own opinion is that it is hardly necessary  to

go  to  the  Estimates Committee be, cause the  points

raised  by  the Member for Cairnhill could  easily  be

resolved if we, as I said, put in another four or five

columns with some notes of explanation. I do not  know

whether  we should bother the Estimates Committee.  If

the  only purpose is to say this is a revote  or  what

amount  should be carried over, and this  is  a  token

vote and so on, it is quite a simple matter to redraft

the  Estimates. I am trying to accommodate  myself  as

much as possible to the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The only reason why we suggest to the

was to ensure its smooth passage when it came here, so

that  there  would not be any more trouble  about  the

format. But if the Minister can satisfy the Opposition

on  the format, then the Estimates Committee need  not

be bothered.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, part of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech was devoted to the problems of

Singapore - Federation merger. This  has  already  been

debated  en a separate substantive motion and  I  can,

therefore, do no better now than to quote the epilogue

of the speech as the prologue of my speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The question of Federation - Singapore merger and the

question  of  forming a united Malaysia no  doubt  are

problems  which are now uppermost in our  minds.  They

are major



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2536</b></font><br><br>



questions  which  will determine the  destiny  of  ten

million people spread over nearly 130,000 square miles

of territory. It may be that the scope -'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the position is that no

aspect  at  all of the merger should be touched  upon.

Even the conclusion should be excluded because we have

dealt with merger. Because once the conclusion is read

out,   then,  of  course,  it  may  open   itself   to

rejoinders. I do not know. But I would suggest that we

leave out every aspect of merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> May I just then quote one relevant

line,  and that is, "that the scope and importance  of

these  political questions overshadow mundane  matters

like the development plans projected for next year and

which I have just outlined."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, much of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech in detail has been said by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Speech and has been discussed in

extenso  in  the  Committee  of  Supply  on  the  1962

Estimates. Sir, it is comparatively easy to  formulate

political  policies. But political policies which  are

not  geared to economic realities become mere  slogans

and  are doomed to failure. The harsh reality that  we

must constantly remember is the rapid increase of  the

population - about  4 per cent per  annum - one  of  the

highest  in the world, which is confined to  a  little

island of 200 square miles, so that within the next 20

years  we  will not only be packed like sardines,  but

there  will  be real competition for land between  the

living  and  the dead. It is estimated  that  in  1962

there  will be a net increase of 14,000 people looking

for  employment;  and  by  the  end  of  1964,  it  is

necessary  that  some  84,000  jobs  be  created.  The

problem  at  unemployment  is  aggravated  by  another

threat.  Traditionally a city that has  lived  on  its

entrepot  trade,  we now find that this  prop  of  our

economic  life is being slowly eaten away  because  of

neighbouring  countries  resorting  to  direct   trade

arrangements and to the improvement of their own  port

facilities.  In  order  to  prevent  the  unemployment

problem from growing to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2537</b></font><br><br>



unmanageable proportions within the next  five  years,

it  is, therefore, very necessary that the foundations

for  industrialisation should now be made and a  crash

programme carried out. Such a crash programme  has  to

be  mainly  in building and construction  and  in  the

export  industries.  The importance  of  building  and

construction can be gauged by the estimate that  5,000

people  lost  their jobs between 1957  and  1960  when

there was a slowing down of building activities.  This

year  saw  the  revival  of the construction  industry

initiated by the building programme of the Housing and

Development Board and the revival of private  building

activity  due  to  the  favourable  change  of  policy

towards  the development charges for main City Council

services.  The  number  of  houses  expected   to   be

completed  by the Housing and Development  Board  this

year  is  7,454;  and next year, the  Board  hopes  to

achieve its target of 10,000 houses a year. All  this,

of  course, means, firstly, fulfilling the  dreams  of

several  thousand people who have applied  for  public

housing  for  as  long  as six  years.  Secondly,  the

increase in building activity means that the estimated

5,000  building  workers who became unemployed  during

the  building slump of 1957 to 1960, have now been re-engaged  in construction and it is possible  that  new

labour  has  also entered the building  industry.  The

increase  in building and construction also  means  an

increase  in demand for building materials, especially

cement,  sand  and steel. In fact, imports  of  cement

have  increased  by  40 per cent for  the  first  nine

months of this year, and the supplying of sand for the

building  trade has increased to such an  extent  that

the  Government  has recently found  it  necessary  to

introduce  a  Bill to control sand washing activities.

The  boom in the building and construction sector  has

generated  considerable activity in many  spheres  and

ought  to  quicken the setting up of the  $50  million

steel mill which is to be located in Jurong. Steps  to

stimulate  the  setting  up of  export  industries  in

Jurong and other industrial estates have already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2538</b></font><br><br>



been  explained in detail by the Finance  Minister  in

his  Budget  Speech  on the 7th  of  this  month.  The

Industrial Development Board has already been  set  up

and  it  will  be assisted by the Industrial  Research

Unit which is now being formed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ancillaries to this industrial leap forward, it is

necessary  that  there must be an adequate  supply  of

electric  power  and  water.  A  consultant  firm   of

engineers  has already been appointed to  study  plans

for the construction of a new power station. The first

stage of the power station will have a capacity of  60

megawatts. This plan should be ready by next year when

work  commences.  Recently, an  agreement  to  extract

water  from  the Scudai River was concluded  with  the

Johore  Government.  Work  on  the  Scudai  Waterworks

should commence next year and the first phase is aimed

at  producing 15 million gallons per day. The tempo of

industrial activity ought to heighten next  year.  The

industrial  estates will have to be served  by  roads.

This  means that the road-building programme  will  be

accelerated  and also facilities at the Harbour  Board

and Airport must be increased. All these plans will be

set  in motion now that the Development Estimates  for

1962  have  been passed by the Assembly. Three  berths

will  be completed by the Singapore Harbour Board next

year, and the extended runway at the Airport should be

brought  into  operation by the end  of  January  next

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation is synonymous with the availability

of technicians and skilled workers. Recently, a survey

of  technical education was presented to the  Assembly

and  the  Minister for Education will present a  White

Paper on the Report sometime next year. Meanwhile, the

Polytechnic  is now training nearly 2,400 students  in

various technical subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All avenues of employment should be explored.

Industrialisation cannot take place overnight or,  for

that   matter,  within  a  year.  We  have   therefore

investigated  the  possibilities  of  increasing   the

number of Singapore citizens



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2539</b></font><br><br>



for  employment on board ships. Nearly 100 vessels

are  cleared each day from our harbour, and as the

fifth largest port in the world, it is right  that

more of our people should look towards the sea for

their  career.  At  some opportune  date  I  will

present a report to the Assembly of the steps that

Government   will  take  to  increase   employment

opportunities  for seamen and other categories  on

board ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1959 and 1960, when we first took over

the  Government, we had to feel our way and  study

the  problems that face the administration and the

people. Between 1960 and 1961, concrete plans  for

economic  development were drawn up. These  plans,

called   the  Four-Year  Development  Plan,   were

presented to the Assembly in March this year.  The

second  half  of 1961 marks the beginning  of  the

implementation of the Four-Year Development  Plan.

Next  year, 1962, should see the Development  Plan

being   carried  out  with  increased  tempo   and

activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I have tried to present in a very simple

form  the  general problem that faces us  in  this

country. Since the postwar years of Singapore have

been  very stormy, it is important that we in  the

political forest should not lose our way  by  only

looking at the trees, and it is important that  we

should also be able to see the picture as a whole.

Whoever  may  be  in charge of the  administration

will  be faced with this vexations problem of  the

rising  birth-rate  and, at  the  same  time,  the

problem of providing jobs for the people.  Here  I

have  tried  to  present  very  simply  what   the

Government  proposes to do in 1962 and  which  has

been  outlined in the Negara's speech. As  I  have

mentioned   earlier,  we  have   dealt   in   very

particular  detail  with that  during  the  Budget

debate and in Committee of Supply on the Estimates

for 1962.

partially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I feel that the P.A.P. Government is not

very  concerned with the problems  of  the  rural

people. This attitude is not quite correct. So  I

think I must touch on some of these problems  as

they  have  been referred to in the pamphlets  of

the P.A.P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in the last few months, the

Prime  Minister has been talking about the phoney

merger and he has been going up to the Federation

and   back  to  Singapore  many  times.  On  many

occasions he has been to Cameron Highlands. He is

trying  to get support from the Right-wing people

in  Singapore. On the one hand, he  has  to  deal

with  the reporters here and, on the other  hand,

he has to write his own stories and make speeches

over  radio. I feel that perhaps he is  too  busy

with all these activities.

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must

bear  in  mind that we are debating  the  Address

thanking  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  for  his

speech, and he must confine himself to it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I know about

this,  Sir, but I am just trying to say what  has

been  happening before I come to the  Address.  I

feel  that  because the Prime Minister  has  been

busy  with such activities, the problems  of  the

people  in  the rural areas have been overlooked.

So  the  question of the livelihood of the people

has  been  ignored  for the time  being.  In  the

speech  delivered by the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,

there  is no mention of anything which can  truly

solve  the  problems affecting the livelihood  of

the  people  and  of improvements  in  the  rural

areas.  In  the policy speech, mention  has  been

made  only  in  regard to items  such  as  social

services,  which are not very important.  I  feel

that social services are only of minor importance

and that there is no need for any emphasis on it.

I  feel that this emphasis is only given to cover

up the opportunistic means of the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2544</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the last two

years,  although the P.A.P. has  installed  some

standpipes  and built some parks  in  the  rural

areas,  let  me tell them: do not  make  use  of

these minor

improvements   to   bluff  the   rural   people.

Everybody  knows that every year the  Government

taxes  the  people a great deal,  and  so  these

social services are a

responsibility of the Government.  There  is  no

need   for   any   emphasis  in  this   respect.

Personally  I  feel  that  the  installation  of

standpipes  and  construction of  roads  in  the

rural areas are not very important, because they

are part and parcel of the social services which

do  not actually go towards improving the  basic

livelihood of the people in the rural areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since colonial rule, many people in Singapore

have  been  in  a very difficult position.  This

difficulty   is   well  known  to   the   P.A.P.

Government, because in the past the  P.A.P. had

many branches in the rural areas and some P.A.P.

leaders were in touch with the rural people.  At

that time these leaders made some suggestions to

improve the livelihood of the people. There were

also  some good and valuable ideas put  forward,

but up to now the P.A.P. Government has not done

much  to  improve the livelihood  of  the  rural

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us recollect the

1959  general elections. At that time the policy

of  the  P.A.P. was stated in the pamphlet  [The

Tasks Ahead]. The first point mentioned was  the

development   of  the  rural   areas   and   the

improvement  of the people therein. This  policy

was  welcomed and supported by the people in the

rural   areas.  The  farmers  thought  that   by

supporting the P.A.P. their livelihood would  he

improved  and so they voted for the  P.A.P.  The

P.A.P., which depended on their support, finally

was  very successful in the elections in all the

rural areas. But since taking over the reins  of

government, the leaders of the P.A.P. only  knew

how   too  consolidate  their  position  in  the

Government  and their political influence.  They

just did not care very much for the rural people

who they thought are simple-minded and gullible.

They thought that if they could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2545</b></font><br><br>

do  a  bit of social service to the rural people,

the people would be satisfied. But as a matter of

fact,  that  idea is all wrong. The rural  people

are  generally dissatisfied with the  Government.

Everybody  says that the P.A.P.'s  The  Tasks

Ahead  proclaimed  during the  general  elections

were nothing but a bluff. They cry out wine,  but

sell  vinegar  instead. The rural people  thought

that  since the P.A.P. has been in power for some

two years, it should try to go all out to improve

the  lot  of the rural people. But up to now  we,

have  not  seen the P.A.P. Government  fulfilling

its   election  promises.  The  P.A.P. has  made

certain  promises to the rural people  but  after

having been in office for half the term, none  of

the  election promises has been fulfilled. It  is

obvious that the P.A.P. Government is not willing

to go all out to serve the rural people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now quote the

pamphlet  [The Tasks Ahead] issued by the  P.A.P.

in  1959  during the general elections.  I  would

like  to  quote some paragraphs to show that  the

policy  speeches of the Government for this  year

or  for  next year are not very helpful in regard

to  the  promises made to the rural people.  This

will also show that the P.A.P. Government is  not

concerned  with  or interested in  improving  the

livelihood of the rural people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this pamphlet

outlining the policy of the P.A.P., there is  one

section  regarding  the  economy  of  the   rural

people. The first question on "Rural Development"

concerns the improvement of the lot of the  rural

people.  Now, let me read out several  paragraphs

which  were  then very impressive but  which  now

show   that   the   P.A.P.  Government   is   not

responsible for what it said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first paragraph, it is stated:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our farmers in the rural areas are already

producing  all the poultry, eggs and  pigs  which

our  population needs and there is a surplus  for

export. This they have been able to do with  very

little   support  and  encouragement   from   the

government.'.

<br><br>The  past  and the present governments  have  not

given  very  much encouragement in this  respect.

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, this  paragraph  shows

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2546</b></font><br><br>

the  farmers in Singapore play a great  role  in

the  produce  of  Singapore,  but  the  colonial

government and the Lim Yew Hock Government  gave

them  little  encouragement and support.  During

the election time these words made the people in

the  rural areas very happy. But now the  P.A.P.

Government has done hardly anything to encourage

and  to support the produce of the rural people.

As  a  matter of fact, the P.A.P. Government  is

toeing the line of the Lim Yew Hock Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency most of the dwellers are

farmers,  and so I can clearly understand  their

livelihood,  and  more so when  I  myself  am  a

farmer  there. Some of the farmers are concerned

with  the rearing of domestic animals; some  are

engaged in agricultural activities. We know that

to  rear  pigs, we need pig sties, and  to  keep

poultry  we need chicken runs. But it  was  very

difficult  to  get approval for the construction

of   these   facilities  due  to  the  stringent

conditions  and  regulations  of  the   previous

Government. As a result, the farmers in the past

suffered  great inconvenience. At that  time  we

could  not  see  any application from  a  farmer

being approved for the construction of pig sties

and  chicken  runs.  But now  under  the  P.A.P.

Government  these unreasonable and  unfavourable

regulations still exist. When a farmer wants  to

put  up  a  chicken run, he has to go through  a

certain  procedure  and  a  lot  of  trouble  is

involved, as otherwise he will be fined. Even in

repairing  old structures, it is still necessary

to go through such procedure and trouble, to say

nothing  about  new structures. Furthermore,  as

the  farmers are not aware of the procedure and

where  these  departments are, very  often  they

have to waste a lot of time and money going from

one  department to another to get  things  done.

They  have gone through a lot of suffering,  and

so  they  cannot help thinking that the promises

made by the Government during election time were

wild promises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me again quote

from  this pamphlet the last paragraph on  rural

development to show that the Government  is  not

sincere and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2547</b></font><br><br>

is bluffing the people. (Well, the Government

has bluffed me at least.)

The last paragraph reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A source of considerable irritation to dwellers

in  the  rural  areas  is the unsatisfactory  and

archaic  Rural  Board  Building  bye-laws.  These

impose undue hardships on rural dwellers in  such

matters  as the repair of their homes.  We  shall

ensure  that  these  sources  of  irritation  are

removed  and that all rural dwellers  are  freely

given  permission whenever they find it necessary

to repair their modest

homes.'

Sir,  before  I go on to the main issue,  I  feel

that this question of

attention to the Standing Order on the quorum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice taken that thirteen Members were not

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members summoned as if for a division pursuant

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker.

Sir,  I  would  like  to go  on  with  my  speech

regarding poultry and other domestic animals.  As

far  as  I know, during the time of the  Lim  Yew

Hock  Government, there were some  chemicals  for

domestic  animals which were easily available  in

Singapore.  But  during the term  of  the  P.A.P.

Government, steps have been taken to see that

these chemicals for domestic animals cannot be

obtained without a veterinary

officer's  permission. As far as I know,  it  is

very  difficult for the ordinary farmer to  look

for  a  veterinary officer. So when the  animals

belonging  to the farmers suffer from  diseases,

the  farmers  suffer a great loss,  because  the

chemicals



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2548</b></font><br><br>

and  medicines are not easily available. I want

to  remind the Government to find a solution to

this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the

second question of the improvement of the rural

people.  That  is the reduction of agricultural

costs.  In  the  P.A.P.'s  pamphlet,  The  Task

Ahead,  at  page 1 of the Chinese  version,  it

says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is our aim to expand and improve on

genetics and nutrition research with regard  to

our animal population, and by well

planned extension services, to bring the

benefits of this research to our farmers ...'



<br><br>There is another paragraph which states:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is our aim to give economic aid to the

farmers in their production.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  these sentences  are  very

short.  But  they  are  of great  significance,

especially the second part. If this part of the

programme  is carried out, then the problem  of

the  farmers will be solved to a great  extent.

The  P.A.P.  Government  has  made  a  lot   of

promises but has not carried them out  and  the

people know about it. As a matter of fact,  the

lot  of the farmers is a painful one. They  are

hoping  that  the  Government will  look  after

their  welfare. During the general election  in

1959,  the  Government came to  power  with  an

overwhelming majority with the support  of  the

farmers. But the last two years have been  very

disappointing to the rural people. These people

have  made sacrifices, but in return they  have

not received any reasonable rewards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quote the cost and the prices of

agricultural  products. The feeding  stuff  for

animals  costs $15 to $17 per picul.  Based  on

this,  it will cost the farmers $120 to produce

a  hundred  katties of pork or  fowls.  If  the

market  price is good, the farmers may be  able

to  make  some profit. But if it is  bad,  then

they may lose some money by rearing poultry.  I

want  to bring up the question of rearing pigs.

The feeding stuff for pigs costs $13 to $15 per

picul. So you must spend about $85 in order  to

produce $85 worth of meat. If a pig costs about

$70 per picul then the pig-rearers will sell at

a  loss. This is the same with eggs. At present

the  cost  of chicken feed is so high  that  it

will cost

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2549</b></font><br><br>

about eight cents to produce one egg. The selling

price  is only about nine to ten cents. When  the

price is low, it comes to about seven and a  half

cents. Mr Speaker, Sir, you will see, therefore,

from  their  costs and their selling prices  that

the  people  in  the  rural areas  are  suffering

economically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I want to touch upon the third

question - rural development; that is the

care to be taken of the farmers' land. 'Singapore

is a very small island with a

great population. The arable land is

limited. The farmers are very concerned

with their possession of arable land. Although

the farmers cannot contribute

a great deal to the food of the people

of  Singapore, they do play a great part in  the

supply of vegetables, eggs and other meats. These

supplies  all come from the farmers of Singapore.

In  this respect, they play a great part  in  the

economy  of  Singapore.  This  question  of   the

security  of  arable land is very  important.  We

know  that  the  land  owned  by  the  people  in

Singapore  is  usually on  lease.  This  land  is

usually  under  the control of the  Land  Office.

Some  land belong to the military forces. We know

that, in general, the land does not belong to the

farmers themselves. So they cannot freely develop

it.  Not  only  are, they unable  to  develop  it

freely, but they are also usually confronted with

some  restrictions. I can quote you one  concrete

example  which I have personally come across.  It

was  about  half  a year ago.  In  Yio  Chu  Kang

between  the  9�  and the 11  m.s. there  was  a

village  known  as  Chin  San  Village.  In  this

village  there were originally about 300 families

of  farmers.  Some  families were  asked  by  the

military  forces to quit from this  land  because

they  wanted  to  set up some  areas  there,  and

because  of  the telecommunications  system  they

complained that the farmers made a lot  of  noise

disturbing  the telecommunication  services.  The

wireless  station is near the main Yio  Chu  Kang

Road and there is heavy traffic along it. As  far

as  I understand, many children attend schools in

this area and they are affected by this notice to

quit. The so-called



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2550</b></font><br><br>

disturbance   to  the  wireless   service   was

actually caused by the heavy traffic along  Yio

Chu  Kang  Road, but instead the complaint  was

made  against the farmers living in  the  small

village. The military forces just cooked  up  a

reason  to ask the farmers to quit, as a result

of  which,  the livelihood of the  farmers  was

affected.  But the so-called popularly  elected

Government  who were brought to  power  by  the

poor people simply neglect the people there and

give  them  no, protection whatsoever.  So  the

wireless  station gave notice to the  villagers

to  quit  and  they were forced to leave  their

land.  As far as I understand, when the farmers

were confronted with this notice to quit, their

livelihood was affected to a very great extent.

These families who were asked to quit from  the

village  were  paid some sort of  compensation,

but  every  family was not given enough  arable

land  to carry on its production work. It could

get only one-quarter acre of land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point about their difficulty

is as follows. The farmers who were

forced to quit were not compensated

reasonably well, according to the law.

According to their valuation, it was only

one dollar compensation per square foot

in respect of cemented floor, and in respect of

uncemented floor the compensation rate was only

80 cents per square

foot. As regards chicken runs and pig

sties only 70 cents per square foot was

paid in respect of cemented floor and 50

cents  in  respect  of  uncemented  floor;  and

every  acre  of  land could not get  more  than

$1,500  compensation. Let  me  quote  one  more

example.  Say  you have a house which  occupies

about   900  square  feet.  According  to   the

Government's rate of compensation, you will get

about  $700  to  $900. But we know  that  after

these farmers have been forced to quit, it will

cost  them  far more to put up a similar  house

occupying a similar area. In fact, you  require

double the amount of compensation to put up the

same type of house occupying the same area.  We

will  take  an example of the zinc  roof  structure.  If you want to touch it up well to  give

it an attractive appearance, it will cost about

three times the compensation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2551</b></font><br><br>

paid  to  the  farmer. So we  can  see  that  the

Government's rate of compensation is quite unfair

and unreasonable, and this is a great blow to the

farmers. This is a very serious matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to list the third point regarding

the  difficulties of the farmers. You  must  know

that  it  takes  a long time for the  farmers  to

establish   their  business.  It  can   only   be

established in at least three to five years,  and

in the course of three to five years, the farmers

have  to work very hard. They must till the  land

with   great   effort  in  order   to   establish

themselves. If we compare this state  of  affairs

with  what I have just said in regard to the rate

of  compensation, the farmers suffer indeed great

losses. Let us take the compensation paid to  the

villagers  of Chin San Village. As I  have  said,

the  compensation  was too  inadequate  to  cover

their losses, and was a great blow to them. Every

family  at that time could get only about  $2,000

to  $3,000  as compensation, and only a  minority

got  about  $5,000 to $6,000. We  know  if  every

family got only $2,000 or $3,000 as compensation,

then  when it came to building up their  business

again,  this  amount would be  used  up  in  just

putting up a house. They would not be able to pay

for  other amenities out of the compensation.  So

the question of safeguard to the farmers' land is

very  important. We hope the Government will,  in

the   Agricultural   Leases   Bill,   take   into

consideration  the interest of  the  farmers  and

make provisions to look after the land leased  to

them.  In the meantime, I feel that they must  be

given reasonable opportunities for expansion  and

development.  At  present, I know  that  on  some

private  land  the  landlords do  not  allow  the

lessees to put up chicken runs and pig sties.  In

respect   of  arable  land,  the  landlord   will

restrict  the activities of the farmers  and  the

rent  is  rather unreasonable too. As  far  as  I

understand,  in  the case of private  land  if  a

farmer is allowed to build any structure thereon,

he  has to comply with certain conditions such as

the giving of

'coffee money', and so it will cost a few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2552</b></font><br><br>

hundred dollars to put up a simple structure.  I

hope this additional exploitation of the farmers

will  be got rid of by the Government by way  of

passing  legislation to relieve the  farmers  of

their  difficulties. I hope the Government  will

also  do its best, as it should. I know that  in

the  Land  Office,  which  is  under  the  Prime

Minister's   Office,  there   are   many,   many

regulations and restrictions on the construction

of  pig  sties  and  chicken runs.  I  hope  the

Government will give farmers facilities  in  the

construction   of   chicken   runs   and   other

agricultural  structures  and  that   the   rent

imposed  by  the Land Office would be reasonable

to the farmers. In my ward at the 9th milestone,

Yio  Chu  Kang  Road, there is  an  organisation

known   as   the   Rural  People's  Association.

Representatives of this Association  have  asked

the  Government to reduce the rent. I feel  they

have  every  reason to ask for the reduction  of

the  rent,  because the place is a  resettlement

area and the farmers only paid a very cheap rent

for  staying  there  before the  area  was  esta

blished.  The  assessment and  the  ground  rent

before  the  establishment of  the  resettlement

area  came to only a few dollars per year. Since

the  Government  started work  on  resettlement,

every  family has been given an acre of land  by

the  Government in this resettlement  area.  The

rent   costs  about  $10  per  year,   and   all

structures  thereon  have  to  be  rebuilt   and

modified.  As a result of this, the resettlement

area looks very neat and attractive. But as  far

as  I  know, this resettlement has dealt a great

blow  to  the  people's livelihood, because  the

assessment rates have been reconsidered  against

their  favour. They have to pay ten  times  more

than what they used to pay. The assessment rates

on Crown land have been similarly increased, and

so  they have to pay these increases. Therefore,

every  family  has to pay tens of  dollars  more

every year. In this resettlement, the Government

will  wait for five or six years to collect rent

or assessment, and so the payment has to be made

in  one  lump  sum. Every family living  in  the

resettlement area will then have to pay $100  to

$200 in one lump sum.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2553</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the idea of having a

resettlement  is  to solve the  problems  of  the

farmers. It is a good idea indeed. But in  actual

fact   it   seems   that   the   Government    is

concentrating  them  in  one  area  in  order  to

facilitate  exploitation. I hope  the  Government

will have a reasonable solution to the question I

have raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from what I have said, you

can  see  that the livelihood of the  farmers  is

indeed  a very difficult problem. The economy  of

the  rural areas is facing a crisis and is on the

verge  of  bankruptcy. The farmers have to  worry

about  their three meals. In the meantime,  their

debts    are   continuously   rising.   Generally

speaking, the average farmer living in the  rural

area   is  heavily  indebted.  The  farmers   now

complain  that  the promises made by  the  P.A.P.

before  they  came to power were very attractive.

They  had all sorts of plans on rural development

in order to improve the standard of livelihood of

the  farmers. But 2� years have gone by  and  the

Government  have done very little to improve  the

living  conditions of the farmers. Their standard

of  livelihood has not been improved. In fact, it

has deteriorated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last few days, a sum of

money  has been approved in respect of  the  Main

Estimates,  and  the  Development  Estimates  for

1962. The sum approved is the highest so far, and

I  hope the Government will be able to make  good

use  of this money to look after the requirements

of  the people. They should not make use of  this

money  to  do superficial things or to  cover  up

their failures and shortcomings. They should  not

bluff the people and bring about a phoney merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the Government that they

should  not sacrifice the interest of the  people

for the sake of a minority.

<br><br>6.07 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, after reading the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech and after listening to

the speech by the Deputy Prime Minister today,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2554</b></font><br><br>

who  made  a  very  unrealistic  impression,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I am reminded of a proverb  which

says  that once you are faced with an experience,

you  will  learn from it. Once you  have  knocked

against  a wall, you will never do it again.  The

people  of Singapore are not fools. In  my  view,

after more than two years of actual experience, I

doubt  the  beautiful promises of the Government.

In  spite  of  the emphasis of the Government  on

industrialisation and a common  commodity  market

for  the  two territories, after two and  a  half

years the industrialisation plan is still a plan.

I  can  see no improvement in the living standard

of  the people of Singapore. Up to now, the talks

in respect of the common commodity market for the

two  territories  are  still  at  the  discussion

stage.  In  my  view,  success  is  very  remote.

Therefore,  the beautiful promises and  plans  of

the Government are just like stones being boiled,

as they can never be boiled. We can only hear the

bubbling noises made by the stones in the  stove.

These  plans sound nice to the ear but, in  fact,

they are impractical. They are just like biscuits

drawn  on  paper  which cannot be  eaten  by  the

people.  On other Government plans also,  success

is  very  remote. For example, in the  Government

election pamphlet concerning women's rights, many

promises   were  made.  They  spoke   about   the

protection  of  women's rights and raising  their

status  in  society. But after coming  to  power,

they  have forgotten all these promises.  We  can

see no benefits to the women. The Government said

that they would help to protect the rights of the

workers. But today they have become anti-workers.

As  to the improvement of the rural areas and the

raising of the standard of livelihood of the  far

mers, this is all forgotten. I was brought up and

I  have  lived  in the rural areas. Therefore,  I

understand very well the sufferings of the  rural

people.   I   have  a  deep  concern  for   these

sufferings.  During those days, the  P.A.P. made

promises that they wanted to improve the  lot  of

the farmers and of the people living in the rural

areas,   and  these  promises  were   very   well

received. I was also attracted by these  promises

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suggest to the hon. Lady

that  the  Member for Jalan Kayu has touched  in

great detail on the troubles of the farmers.  It

she  wants  to mention the troubles  of  farmers

again, perhaps she can do that in passing, but I

think the Member for Jalan Kayu made a very long

and detailed speech about that.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  what  I want to talk about is the beautiful

plans  and promises of the Government which  have

not  materialised. We do not see any  results  at

all.  On  the  other  hand,  the  policy  of  the

Government  is  not realistic.  The  contents  or

their  policy are lost and there is only an empty

shell left. For instance, in the policy statement

of  the  first  Session, it was stated  that  the

Government would try its best to promote  agricul

ture, animal husbandry and fisheries. But in  the

policy  statement of the second Session  entitled

"The Year of Construction", the Government talked

about  providing the farmers with fertilisers  in

order  to  reduce the cost of their  agricultural

produce.   It   was  also  mentioned   that   the

Government  tried  to  improve  the  strains   of

chickens  in  order to increase the stock.  There

was also mention that Government intended to help

the fishermen to fish along the seashore of Singa

pore. If all these schemes had been carried  out,

they    would    have   been   quite    practical

achievements.  But  in the policy  statement  for

this  session, we cannot see any proposal of this

sort. Perhaps there could have been no results to

announce

in the policy statement. It seems that the work

to he done in the rural areas cannot

be  carried out, or whether that was carried  out

was  not quite up to expectations. In short,  the

work  in  respect  of rural improvement  and  all

projects to be implemented in the rural areas are

in a very pitiful state. There are no results and

the  improvement of livelihood of farmers has not

been  realised.  The  cost  of  fertilisers   for

growing  vegetables and of food for  poultry  has

not been reduced.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the hon. Member

for Stamford that all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2556</b></font><br><br>

this  has  already been said by the Member  for

Jalan  Kayu? Let us try not to repeat what  has

been said. It has already been touched upon  by

the Member for Jalan Kayu.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I will now talk about the achievements  of

the  Government this year in regard to the rural

areas. The Government have not paid attention to

the  livelihood of the farmers and people in the

rural  areas, but instead they have been talking

about  providing amenities to the rural  people.

All this talk is not realistic and practical. If

you  do  not  look after the livelihood  of  the

farmers,  then they will not have the  necessary

money to buy fertilisers for growing vegetables,

of  to rear poultry. Therefore, all this talk of

helping them by scientific aids and agricultural

knowledge  is  useless,  even  after  they  have

learnt  all  the scientific methods  of  raising

chickens, farm keeping, land cultivation, and so

on and so forth, what is the use if they have no

money  to  apply  their knowledge  Therefore  in

order   to  develop  the  rural  areas  and   to

safeguard   the  livelihood  of   the   farmers,

Government should try to do something  concrete.

If   the  livelihood  of  the  farmers  is   not

protected  and  not well looked  after,  then  I

think  the Government policy in this respect  is

doomed to failure. Anyway, Mr Speaker, Sir,  in

presenting its policy, Government wishes to  put

up  a  beautiful facade and disregard  the  true

meaning  of  its  contents.  This  is   a   very

irresponsible attitude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Government's industrialisation policy

and plan to solve the problem of unemployment, I

feel this is similar to the wrong policy adopted

in  regard to the farmers. Because of  the  past

colonial economic policy, the farmers are  in  a

very  bad  position  today. They  are  in  great

difficulty.  It  is quite correct  to  say  that

there  is  no arable land in Singapore  for  the

cultivation of staple food. But to say that  the

farmers cannot grow them is not correct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers have the ability to grow them but

their  economy is hampered. Even then they  grow

food not only for their own consumption but they

also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2557</b></font><br><br>

supply   food   to  neighbouring  countries.   If

Government  could  look after the  production  of

supplementary items of food, then they  would  be

contributing  much to the economy  of  Singapore.

There  are  about 20,000 farmers engaged  in  the

production of supplementary items of food for the

needs  of Singapore, and the livelihood of  these

20,000  families are directly affected  by  their

incomes. Moreover, the national income  is  in  a

way  affected  by the purchasing power  of  their

produce  of  these  farmers.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

fluctuations   in  the  prices  of   agricultural

produce  also  affect  the  livelihood  of  these

farmers.  The market for supplementary foodstuffs

is  now  facing  keen  competition  from  outside

producers. The market prices are fluctuating  all

the  time and the trend is downward, because  the

cost  of production is high and also because  the

Government  are  not properly looking  after  the

welfare of the farmers. The farmers are not  able

to  keep up with this competition, and therefore,

the  development of agriculture is  hampered.  If

the  Ministers are free, they can go to the rural

areas and farms to have a look. They can see  the

very  pitiable state of things there.  Everything

is  in a tattered and dilapidated state. All  the

pig  sties and chicken sheds are near collapsing,

because  the  farmers are very poor and  have  no

money  to repair them. Many of them, with a  very

sorrowful  heart, have come to the city  to  look

for employment.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the Member for

Stamford  that  this again was mentioned  by  the

Member for Jalan Kayu? Perhaps she could just say

that  she  agrees with the Member for Jalan  Kayu

and  get  on with the debate, because  we  cannot

have a repetition of this sort.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was saying

that  to  illustrate that because of the mistakes

of  the  Government the number of  unemployed  in

Singapore  has  increased, thereby hampering  the

economy   of   Singapore.   Therefore,   if   the

Government   want  to  solve   the   problem   of

unemployment,  they should look at  it  from  all

aspect, adopting various methods to deal with it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2558</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for industrialisation, the policy of the

Government  depends too much on  foreign  capital

and  neglects local capital. They have  neglected

their   own   responsibility  to   help   cottage

industries.  This is a very wrong attitude.  From

examples in Japan and Hong Kong, we can see  that

their   industrial  products  are  flooding   our

markets.  Our  new  local and cottage  industries

have  not been promoted and encouraged and cannot

compete  with them, and they are faced  with  the

prospect of being eliminated. If Government could

encourage and promote local light industries  and

cottage  industries, then unemployment  in  Singa

pore will be reduced. Women too will benefit from

the setting up of cottage industries, because new

avenues of employment will be open to them.  This

will  help to a great extent the economy  of  the

whole nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as to the question of the

Singapore   River,  the  Government  have   made

beautiful plans but have not carried them out. I

would like to take the opportunity here to quote

a   publication  of  the  Ministry  of   Culture

entitled "The Plans of the People". On  page  16

of  the  Chinese version, the importance of  the

Singapore River is stressed. It states that  the

Singapore River will be improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This river is the lifeline of the entrepot

trade of Singapore. On this river you have  some

2,000  specially built vessels going to and  fro

to load and unload goods. About half the imports

and exports of Singapore are handled by lighters

in the Singapore River. In fact, a great deal of

the imports and exports in Singapore have to  go

through  the  Singapore River.  Stevedores,  who

number about 4,000, and workers on the lighters,

who number about 2,000, are given opportunities

for employment because of the Singapore

River."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since Government have

stressed the importance of the Singapore  River,

how is it that they have not done anything about

it?  Just now the Acting Prime Minister said  in

his  speech that if we have a plan but no  money

to  implement it, then it is nothing  more  than

slogan-shouting. I would ask:  if  you  had  the

money but no plan to utilise the money, then how

would you call this state of affairs?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2559</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, then they talk about the urban

services.  I feel that since the P.A.P. came  to

power, they have a very strange policy in dealing

with welfare services in the urban areas. In some

districts, the Government have done a great  deal

in   respect  of  welfare  services   and   urban

amenities.  This  is because the  Ministers  come

from  these  constituencies.  In  the  Minister's

constituencies,  there  are  services  like   the

repair of roads, the putting up of standpipes and

the  building of community centres. Creches  have

also  been built. But in the other constituencies

nothing seems to have been done. For example,  in

the  Stamford  constituency, the Government  have

set  up  only one standpipe. The Government  will

only  go  according to its interest and whims  to

carry out welfare services in the urban areas. If

they  do  not  like any particular  Member,  then

nothing   will  be  done  in  his  or   her   own

constituency.  This  is not  what  a  responsible

government should do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I have touched upon

the  Singapore River. Stamford Ward has  an  area

connected with the Singapore River. Many  workers

in  this  particular area belong to the  Stamford

Ward.  I  have  received  complaints  from  these

workers.  The complaints come from three sources.

Some  come  from the workers, some from  lighter-owners, and some from businessmen. The complaints

of  the workers are that the Singapore Government

have  not  done anything to repair the  Singapore

River  and  so this has caused some inconvenience

to  their  work. The complaints of  the  lighter-owners  are mainly that because the river bed  is

not deep enough, the lighters get easily damaged.

The businessmen's complaints are that because the

river  bed  is not deep enough, it is  impossible

for  the  lighters to go near the shore when  the

tide is low. As a result, the lighters have to be

anchored in the middle of the river at low  tide.

When this is discovered by the Marine Police, the

businessmen   or  lighter-owners   will   receive

summonses.   To   put  it  in  a  nutshell,   the

Government have done nothing about the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2560</b></font><br><br>

River. Hence we have all these troubles. I feel

that  the  Government's aim in  passing  a  law

should  not mainly be to fine people so  as  to

increase their revenue. Their aim should be  to

so regulate the affairs of the people that they

will  not  go  out of hand. It is not  for  the

Government to pass a law to fine the people. If

a  lot of summonses and fines are being imposed

on  the  people,  then the Government  have  to

review their policy and the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very regrettable for

me  to  say  that  the policy  speech  of  this

session  has  forgotten entirely the  women  of

Singapore   who  constitute  about   half   the

population.   The  Government  seem   to   have

neglected  the  role which women  can  play  in

nation  building. The Government have also  for

gotten the policy they made regarding women  in

Singapore.  I feel it is very strange  that  in

the  policy speech of this Session,  there  has

been no mention of women of Singapore. It seems

that  all  the problems of women are solved  by

the  passage  of  the Women's Charter.  It  was

stated  in  the manifesto of the P.A.P. during

the election that it was the responsibility  of

the  Party  to liberate the women of Singapore.

The  Women's Charter is only a part and not the

whole  of  the  work of liberation.  There  are

other  more important work which the Government

have  not  done during their term of office  so

far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope to have your

indulgence to talk about women's problems.  But

before   I   do  so,  we  must  recognise   one

principle.  The  women  themselves  are  not  a

problem. In a very unreasonable society,  women

have  to face many problems. It is only because

of  an  unreasonable social system  that  these

problems have arisen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, before any reform is made to the

unreasonable  social system, the  sufferings  of

the women cannot be solved basically. Therefore,

I  want  to touch upon the fact that this Govern

ment  which  have come forward in  the  name  of

socialism, have in the course of their office of

about two and a half years, seen the sufferings

of  women without doing anything about it. Great

problems cannot be solved. Minor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2561</b></font><br><br>

problems  are not solved either. The unreasonable

treatment  which  women  experienced  before  the

general  election  still  exists,  although   the

Government has been in office for two years.  For

example, when a woman gets married, she can  only

get  a  temporary post. The post which  she  held

before  her marriage has to be converted  from  a

permanent  basis to a temporary basis. This  post

on a temporary basis is not a very secure one for

her. She is liable to dismissal or termination of

services  at  any time. And so this  unreasonable

condition  of  service is not only  a  threat  to

married   women,  but  it  is  also  a  sort   of

exploitation  in  the treatment of  women.  These

temporary  officers cannot enjoy pensions.  I  do

not  understand this talk about encouraging women

to get out of the kitchen, when in the administra

tion  and in politics, in business as well as  in

industry, in education and in other aspects,  the

leaders  are  not the women. I do not  understand

what  sort of policy the Government are  adopting

on  socialism. I do not understand also  on  what

logical  basis the Government are going to  raise

the status of women in society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the problems of women have

close reference to the legal, political, economic

social aspects. All

sorts  of inequalities in those aspects  which  I

have just mentioned should be eliminated, because

it  is  due to these inequalities that the  women

have to be confronted with so many problems.  The

economic  and  political  aspects  are  the  main

things.  If  women  are able  to  be  independent

economically so that they will not have to depend

on  others  for  a  living, then  all  the  other

problems  will be easily solved. At present,  the

situation is like this. Whether you are a man  or

a  woman,  it is very difficult to get a  job  in

Singapore.  And  so a woman who  has  got  a  job

through  her good fortune may be confronted  with

the  danger  of losing her job and  her  economic

independence   after   marriage.    Under    such

circumstances, she may have to depend  on  others

for  her  livelihood. If her husband's income  is

insufficient,  then the question  of  economy  is

very important to her family. If he happens



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2562</b></font><br><br>

to  be  irresponsible, then her  burden  will  be

increased  manifold. In the Five-Year  Programme,

the election plan of the P.A.P., it is stated  in

the  last  paragraph of the 3rd  edition  in  the

Chinese version that it is the basic principle of

socialism to have equal opportunities for all con

cerned,  that is to say, in respect of employment

and working conditions. Equality must be given to

all  people irrespective of sex, and there should

be  no  discrimination of  one  sex  against  the

other.  At present in the Government service  and

the leading commercial houses, it is quite common

for   married   women  to  have  their   services

terminated,  and it is also very common  to  have

married  women considered as temporary employees.

This is only a result of prejudice, that only men

can be the leaders of the families and that wives

are  only part and parcel of the property of  the

husband.  It  is a very traditional prejudice  to

say that it is the duty of the wife to look after

the  family  and the children. Now this  is  very

unfair,  because  a married woman  also  has  the

responsibility   of   maintaining   her   family,

especially when the husband is irresponsible  and

simply   deserts   her  and   the   family.   The

responsibility  of  such a  woman  is  very  much

greater.  We cannot deny the right of  the  woman

to! earn a living just because she is married. We

cannot have unequal treatment in respect of women

in their employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. laid down many

attractive  policies  before  the  election,  but

after it has taken office it has not carried  out

its  policies. Then there is talk about equal pay

for equal work in respect of men and women alike.

This  is also a basic problem of women. This  can

only  come about when socialism is achieved,  but

it  seems that the Party in power is not  sincere

in  going  in  this direction.  The  solution  to

women's   problems  lies  in  the  economic   and

political improvement of the status of women, and

this question can only be solved gradually day by

day.  Now, in the interim period before the whole

question is solved basically,

you  must  make  some partial  improvements  with

sincerity.   For   example,  in  the   Government

service, women officers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2563</b></font><br><br>

and  lady  teachers are doing the  same  kind  of

work as their men counterparts. So the Government

must make sure that they get the same pay. If the

Government  are not protecting the  interests  of

their  own  employees, how can they expect  other

employers  to give equal treatment to  women?  If

the Government deal with women from the point  of

view of a capitialist, whose main concern is only

to  make  money, then maternity leave will  be  a

loss  to  the  women. If that is the  case,  then

there  is no use for the Government to talk about

socialism and the protection of the interests  of

women.  In social reform and social work,  it  is

not  right for the social worker, who talks about

socialism, to suppress one half of the population

on  the one hand and, on the other hand, to  talk

about  social reform. That is really  a  laughing

stock.  Social  progress  must  be  made  in  all

respects,  since  women are part  and  parcel  of

society. They should not be discriminated against

or neglected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me give some examples

from  the  Five-Year Plan of  the  Government  to

prove  further that the Government say one  thing

and  do  another thing. Mr Speaker, Sir, in  the

Five-Year Plan of the Government, at page 8  of

the 3rd edition in Chinese, it is stated that  at

the  time of the so-called elected government  of

Mr  Lim  Yew Hock, it was trying to  please  the

colonial  rower  by all means and the  Government

then did nothing to improve the lot of women, and

that  in future, the P.A.P. Government would  get

rid  of  all  such  unreasonable conditions.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, at that time these attractive words

and  premises  of the Government were  very  well

received  and  supported by the people.  But  the

Government  have taken power for some  two  years

and  what  have they done during this period?  As

far  as the powers of the present Government  are

concerned, these are wider than these of the  Lim

Yew Hock Government, but as far as the actions of

this  present  Government are concerned,  I  feel

that  they  are  just  the same.  In  fact,  this

Government is even worse than the Lim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2564</b></font><br><br>



Yew  Hock  Government, in trying to please  the

colonial  power.  The  unreasonable  laws   and

conditions are still

in existence. It is not necessary for me to say

more about this. I want to ask the P.A.P.

Government whether or not they feel ashamed of

themselves - [Interruption]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

have  taken office for some two years and  have

done   nothing  to  help  the  lot  of   women.

Furthermore, no women have

been  encouraged to organise themselves.  There

is a women's section of the Party in power, but

there  is no celebration of Women's Day,  which

is  recognised internationally and which  falls

on the 3rd of August every year. In the time of

the   Lim  Yew  Hock  Government,  the  present

Minister  for  Home Affairs led  the  women  in

protest against the ban on the celebrations  of

Women's Day.

But now the Party has taken office and

yet there is no celebration of Women's Day.  So

why  talk  about  fighting for the  freedom  of

women? Why talk about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2565</b></font><br><br>

improving the political status of women? I think

this is all humbug. This humbug

cannot be seen. It looks like the Minister for

Home Affairs is dozing

off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I want to

touch on the economic aspect. I feel that the

Government have not only

failed to encourage light industries, but have

also neglected light industries.

When we talk about the care to be given to

widows and orphans as promised; I feel that the

Government have not only failed to look after

these

people, but have also reduced the public

assistance given to these poor people.

So the Government say one thing and do another

thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me raise my third point

which is mentioned in page 4, line 7 of the  same

booklet in the Chinese version. It reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. Government will try its best to

safeguard  the  rights of women workers  so  that

they  will  be  given  equal pay  and  favourable

working conditions. In the meantime, we will  try

to make sure that women will get

their maternity allowances.'

<br><br>It  is  also stated in the same booklet that  the

Government  will  legislate to  ensure  that  the

interests of women are protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, generally speaking, women

workers  can only dream of these promises.  Their

interest  is  not looked after by the Government.

Let  me bring up the matter of the lady teachers.

As  far as I know, in some Chinese aided schools,

the  women teachers have to pay to get people  to

do their work during their period of confinement.

Now if they have financial difficulties -

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> On a point of clarification.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No. If a

woman   teacher  cannot  afford  to  pay  another

teacher, then her work has to be shared among her

colleagues,  otherwise her  class  will  have  no

teacher.  Therefore,  taking  into  consideration

this  state  of  affairs, how can the  Government

talk about giving protection to women?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2566</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is another point

which  is  contained  in page  12  of  the  same

booklet  in  the Chinese version.  The  subtitle

reads  "Research Institute of Women's Problems".

It  is  stated in this booklet that  the  P.A.P.

Government  is  going  to establish  a  Research

Institute of Women's Problems to enable women of

all  races to study the problems of women.  This

Research   Institute  will   include   all   the

departments  concerned in all aspects,  such  as

politics, economics, health, culture, children's

welfare, etc, in order

to help the women to contribute to society and

to the country. This Research Institute of

Women's Problems is a good idea. But the

Government have not carried out this promise

since they took office. I do not know whether

they are sincere in establishing such an

Institute

and I wonder when it will be established. I want

to remind the Government that

they  have gone through more than half of  their

five-year  term of office. If this is  not  done

immediately, there will

hardly he any time left for the Government to do

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the third item shown in the

same pamphlet concerns culture

and education. It reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We want to encourage the cultures of the

various  races  so that these cultures  will  be

intermingled to become a united Malayan culture.

In the meantime, we want to suppress undesirable

and immoral cultures which come from outside. We

want  to stop the yellow culture promoters  from

poisoning  the thoughts of the people.  We  know

that  yellow culture has a very direct influence

on the women who are always the victims. We want

to  suppress yellow culture in order  to  ensure

that  women  and  children will  be  spiritually

healthy.   On  the  other  hand,  we   want   to

consolidate the education of women. We  want  to

set   up  adult  educational  classes  all  over

Singapore to educate illiterate women.  We  want

to  make use of many Senior Middle III graduates

who  are unemployed so that they can go into the

rural  areas to educate the womenfolk.  In  this

way, on the one hand, we can suppress the spread

of  yellow  culture  and,  on  the  other  hand,

enhance the education of women so that we may be

able to raise the moral standard of society.'

<br><br>Sir, talking about culture, I am reminded of the

pathetic  Ministry of Culture. It is responsible

for  the  development and promotion of  culture.

But its work has now been limited to the setting

up  of  a  National  Theatre  and  a  television

station.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2567</b></font><br><br>

It  is  very regrettable that a Government  which

claims  to pay attention to the moral conduct  of

society  does not seem to be anti-yellow  culture

any  more  this year. Perhaps it seems  that  the

Government have done enough to exterminate yellow

culture and so there is no point for them  to  do

anything more to suppress yellow culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of women's problems again, it

seems  that  the  Government are quite  satisfied

since passing the Women's Charter. It seems  they

feel  that  all  the women's problems  have  been

solved since the Women's Charter is passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point in respect of women's

education. I want to ask the Government why  they

have  increased the school fees for girls. Is  it

compatible with the promise of consolidating  the

education  of  women?  Does  it  mean  that   the

standard of education of the girls will be raised

because  of  an increase in the school  fees  for

girls?  The  Government have promised  that  they

will  help  to raise the status of  women  to  an

equal footing with that of men. But does it  mean

that  this  has been achieved because the  school

fees  of  the girls have been raised to those  of

the  boys?  I  must point that  if  there  is  no

improvement in the pay of women and there  is  an

increase  in the burden that they have to  carry,

then  how  can  the policy of the  Government  be

termed  to  be  one of protecting the  rights  of

women?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past two years, the

prestige  of the Government has sunk low  in  the

eyes  of  the  people. If my  impression  is  not

wrong,   I   feel  that  the  so-called  People's

Government is deteriorating year by year. At  the

present   juncture,  we  can  see  that   it   is

deteriorating day by day. [Interruption]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is strange that the Minister for Home

Affairs  seems  to be dozing and interjecting  at

the same time.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for Stamford

had been looking at the Chair, she would not have

noticed the Minister for Home Affairs was dozing.

Obviously,  she  has  not  noticed  the   Speaker

dozing.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

coming from his direction. [Interruption]. If he

had  not made any noise, I would not have looked

at him.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we have seen that the Government,

in the direction of socialism.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In the

course  of  the last two years, the unreasonable

regulations still exist. In fact, conditions are

getting worse in respect of the freedom  of  the

people. For example, take the Publications Ordin

ance,  the  Registration of Societies Ordinance,

and   the   Public  Assembly  Regulations,   the

applications    for    permission    to    stage

performances,  and the ugly P.P.S.O.  All  these

things go to explain that regulations are  still

in  existence  to restrict the  freedom  of  the

people  and  that the Government are  trying  to

bluff the people. Day by day the Government  are

going  against  the wishes of  the  people.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we  have heard the  Government's

claim  that they want to get rid of colonialism,

and  to  improve  the  lot  of  the  people   of

Singapore.  But on hearing that the people  want

to fight for more freedom and for more democracy -

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> On a point of clarification.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching:</b> No. (In Mandarin): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, if the Minister wants to  speak,

he will be given an opportunity later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hearing that the people want to ask for the

abolition  of  the  Internal Security  Council,

that  they  want  to  have freedom  of  speech,

freedom of assembly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2569</b></font><br><br>

and   of   publication,  that  they  demand   the

relaxation of applications for citizenship,  that

they ask for the reunification of the trade union

movement, the Government become very excited  and

afraid,  and are jumping up and down. On  hearing

all  these, they scold the people, brand them  as

Communists, and accuse them of having been bought

over  by the Communists. This kind of talk  seems

to  give  the people the impression that  the  Go

vernment are treating them like children. Now, if

these   people   are  so  gullible   and   easily

influenced  by  the Communists,  why  cannot  the

Government  easily influence them  as  well?  The

Government attempt to use these smears as a means

to  suppress the reasonable claims of the people.

But,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the  people  cannot  be

suppressed forever. They are suffering and as the

unemployment problem becomes more and more acute,

the  difficulties of getting employment  increase

and  the people are dissatisfied with the present

state  of affairs. All these have led the  people

to  make  their reasonable and legitimate claims.

This is but natural. How can the Government blame

the  people and how can the Government call these

people Communists?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I personally feel that

originally the people did not find fault with the

Government. They were not dissatisfied  with  the

Government  originally. They were really  unhappy

at  their exploitation under colonial rule.  They

were  dissatisfied  with  the  Internal  Security

Council imposing limitations and restrictions  on

the   present  Government.  The  people  had  the

impression that the Government's hands were  tied

because of the existence of the Internal Security

Council.   They  thought  it  was  the   Internal

Security  Council  that tied  the  hands  of  the

Government  and  prevent them  from  serving  the

people   of   Singapore   and   improving   their

conditions. The people were in sympathy with  the

Government;   so  they  tried   to   assist   the

Government  to  solve  their  difficulties.  They

wanted  to  work hand in hand with the Government

to  get rid of these unreasonable conditions,  so

that the Government would have greater powers  to

serve the people. But who could have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2570</b></font><br><br>

known  that,  instead,  the  Government  turned

round and ignored the claims of the people  and

went  against their desires. In this  way,  the

people can see clearly that the P.A.P. is now a

reactionary Party which is working in collusion

with the colonialists to go against the people.

Instead  of accepting the claims of the  people

to get rid of the Internal Security Council, it

seems that the Government have the intention to

preserve  its existence in order  to  cover  up

their  shortcomings in serving the people.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, from all these facts -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Sir. Could we

have  a  translation of the funny remarks  made

from the Government benchers?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is impossible. But I suppose

they  must  be  pleasant  remarks  because  the

Member for Stamford did

smile.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, from all these facts, you can see

that  in  the past all the work which  was  not

done  was not because the Government could  not

do  it but because the Government did not  want

to do it.



<br><br>7.23 p.m.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the question of the Government

having  no power to do it. Mr Deputy  Speaker,

Sir,  the  fact  that  the political  detainees

cannot  be released is a very good example.  As

the  saying  goes, the people can shoulder  all

sorts   of   things  but  nobody   can   accept

starvation. There is another saying - if we  have

no freedom, we will rather, die. The people are

very realistic. The Prime Minister is trying to

create an atmosphere about the Communist bogey,

but  the  broad  masses of the people  are  not

afraid  at  all. [Interruption]  But  what  the

people  are  afraid is the lack of freedom  and

bread. Are the Government trying to satisfy the

two  basic  demands of the people?  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, bread and freedom are the demands

of  the  people.  The important  point  of  the

social  problem is called politics. Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  the  voices of  dissatisfaction

with the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2571</b></font><br><br>

Government can be heard in every corner.  If  the

Government are not deaf, they must know about it.

We  want  to know whether the Government are  res

ponsible  or whether they will be very  pathetic.

The  Lim  Yew  Hock Government was  a  very  good

example. If the P.A.P. Government do not want  to

do  good, then they will end up in an even  worse

way than that of the Lim Yew Hock Government. Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I want to advise the P.A.P.

Government -

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Ta' payah.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): - that it is better for them not to be

stubborn,  and  go  on being  stubborn.  If  they

should  do so, they will have a bad name forever.

The people of Singapore will not allow the P.A.P.

Government to fool them. They will take revenge.

<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, today when we are debating the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's policy statement,  most

of  us have been concentrating on merger and  the

Government's services to the whole of  Singapore.

We  are realistic people and our Government  have

entered  the third year of their term of  office.

During  these  two years, of course,  there  were

some defects but there were also achievements  in

various  fields. This fact should not he ignored.

We  have  had some achievements. We are not  very

boastful  of what we have achieved.  As  for  the

defects,  we have the courage to admit  then  and

the courage to rectify them.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Never!

<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This has

been our resolution. Ever since the inception of

our  Party, our aim has been to find  a  way  to

rectify  and  improve the unequal conditions  of

society that we have inherited from the colonial

rule.  Mr Deputy Speaker, to achieve a  society

in  which there would he no exploitation of  man

by  man  is a long-term objective. It cannot  be

achieved  in  the short space of  eight  or  ten

years. We hope we will merge with the Federation

of Malaya as early as possible. When



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2572</b></font><br><br>

our  two  territories  are  unified,  a  Malayan

nation  can materialise. There will  then  be  a

possibility  for  us  to  realise  a   socialist

nation.  By then we shall be able thoroughly  to

improve the livelihood of the people. Now we can

only  carry  out  work which is very  much  like

patching up torn clothing. Whenever there  is  a

tear, we patch it up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member who has just spoken complains about

the  realities we are faced with. But she should

have complained against the colonial rulers.  It

is  they  who had brought about this  situation.

Therefore, I say it is important for the  people

of the two territories to be unified. Of course,

this will not be in the interests of the British

colonialists.  They will try  by  all  means  to

create  internal  confusion, chaos  and  trouble

among us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity the Member for Cairnhill is not

here.  Mr  Deputy Speaker, when the  Right-wing

Party  of Lim Yew Hock saw the division  in  our

Left-wing Party, they were very happy. I wish to

tell them that they cannot benefit from this con

fused  situation  in  the Left-wing  camp.  They

cannot  stage a comeback as a result of this.  I

tell them that they have no hope of doing this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we and the Members of the

Barisan  Sosialis, who were formerly Members  of

the  P.A.P., have had differences in  regard  to

our    political   stand   and   our   political

philosophy. The former P.A.P. Members, i.e., the

present  Members of the Barisan  Sosialis,  have

left the P.A.P. Some people think that our Party

will  become a Right-wing Party as a  result  of

these former P.A.P. members leaving us. It seems

that  they are all Leftists. The Member for Choa

Chu Kang should not be so very arrogant

in  his conception. In fact, the P.A.P. is still

the  same  as before. The policy we are adopting

to  bring about a merger with the Federation  of

Malaya  is  different from  the  policy  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  It  is  only  a  matter   of

difference in policy and standpoint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Members of the Barisan

Sosialis attack us whenever they rise to  speak.

I  feel  very disheartened and very sad  indeed.

They  want  to hit at the P.A.P. at  all  costs,

hoping  that  it  will  collapse  as  early   as

possible. But,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2573</b></font><br><br>

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, I wish to tell  them  that

they  have not realised the fact that our common

enemy still exists. They attack us just to get a

moment  of pleasure for themselves, but  at  the

cost  of neglecting the existence of the  common

enemy.  They are forgetting our common  aim  of

eliminating  our  common  enemy.  This  kind  of

attitude is contrary to what we should adopt  in

the   present   phase   of  our   constitutional

struggle.  I  hope the Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis will not bully the people too much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we also recognise the fact

that  everything is progressing and  is  in  the

process  of evolution. Of course, there must  be

certain   laws   guiding  this   evolution   and

progress.  For instance, the chairs, the  tables

and  the utensils we use every day appear to  be

the  same  every  day. But, in fact,  there  are

changes  every day in the contents, nature,  and

substance of these articles. They are, in  fact,

different  from  what  they  have  been  before.

Therefore, we say that the P.A.P. has, like  the

carpenter,   its  own  tasks  to  perform.   The

carpenter has his tools to do his work.  If  the

tools are good, then the structure put up by him

will  be  better  and can last  longer.  If  the

materials which are used to build the structures

are  bad,  then the structures put up with  such

materials will deteriorate and perish very soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regrettable and a pity really that the

Member  for  Anson  has  disappeared  now.  After

entering this House, and whenever he stands up to

speak, he expects to say something to attract the

applause of the people. Sometime ago he  said  he

wanted  to  place Singapore under the control  of

the United Nations. Mr Deputy Speaker, nobody in

any  part  in  the world should  throw  away  the

highest concept of patriotism which a human being

should  have.  I feel the Member  for  Anson  has

given  up  that highest concept. Perhaps  he  has

thrown it away. He says we are struggling and  we

are  about  to die. But I would say  that  he  is

struggling in his coffin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, now I want to turn to the

Member  for  Stamford. Just now she attacked  us.

She  criticised us and said that we had not  done

anything  during  our two and  a  half  years  of

office. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2574</b></font><br><br>

is  a  pity she is not here. Otherwise  I  could

direct  my  remarks  at her.  The  comprehensive

plans  and  the policy of the P.A.P. have  also

been  criticised  by her. In  dealing  with  the

present  society, it is impossible to carry  out

our  plans  in every detail. It will  take  some

time before the present society is reformed. But

we  have  to  perform our task  to  realise  our

objectives.  Just  now, she has  mentioned  that

women  employees  are  considered  as  temporary

employees. On this question, we have already put

up  our  memorandum to the Minister for Finance.

As  to  the question of women suffering  for  so

many  thousands  of  years,  she  has  our  full

sympathy and understanding. We cannot forget the

plight  of  our sisters who have been  suffering

all these years. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, it  is

very  regrettable  that  when  the  Member   for

Stamford  was with us in the P.A.P., she  was  a

great disappointment to us. If she had mentioned

all the points which she mentioned in this House

just now, that is, indicated the various ways to

solve  all  these problems, then we  would  have

been very thankful to her.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also touched on the point that we have not

carried  out the! policy of equal pay for  equal

work, irrespective of sex. But had she not  left

us, she would not have said so, because when she

was with us, she had stressed the difficulty  in

resolving the problems of giving equal  pay  for

equal work, irrespective of sex. We have said on

this  question  that  it is  difficult  for  the

Government to legislate to provide equal pay for

equal  work  irrespective of sex,  before  other

problems are solved. For instance, when a man is

unable  to get employment, a woman will find  it

more  difficult to get employment.  I  hope  the

Member  for Stamford will pay more attention  to

the  problems of women and try to find out  what

is the crux of the problem facing our sisters in

Singapore,  and then try to put up  constructive

suggestions.  We will be happy  to  consider  or

accept  them. Here I must say to the Member  for

Stamford that not long ago this year, a  meeting

of  the South-East Asian Women's Conference  was

convened. At that time we

suggested that Assemblywomen from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2575</b></font><br><br>

Opposition  side should attend this  meeting,  so

that  we  could have a mutual discussion  of  the

problems relating to women. In the end the Member

for   Mountbatten,   in   fact,   attended   this

conference, but the Member for Stamford  did  not

attend. When I returned to Singapore, I told her,

"My good friend, Fung Yin Ching -"

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Who is Fung Yin Ching? Is

she a Member of this Assembly?

<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, I was telling you what I told the Member

for  Stamford, not that I wanted to  mention  her

name.  I  said that the South-East Asian  Women's

Conference  had written to invite her to  attend,

but why did she not attend? Then she replied, "Is

it  really  so?"  And I told her,  "We  as  women

should   attend  this  Conference  in  order   to

contribute our opinion and take part in all kinds

of  discussion."  But when the third  meeting  of

this Conference was held, the said Member did not

attend  again. Then I told the Member  for  Delta

that the Member for Stamford did not turn up  for

this  meeting, and later on I told Mr Lim  Ching

Siong,   the  SecretaryGeneral  of  the   Barisan

Sosialis, that he should encourage her to  attend

this  meeting.  In any case, what  happened  ulti

mately  was that the meeting was not convened  in

Singapore, because we were not willing to  accept

representatives from Taiwan to come to Singapore.

Had  we  accepted, then the Members- who are  now

sitting opposite would have accused us of working

in  collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek regime  in

Taiwan. That is why we were not willing to accept

representatives  from  Taiwan  to   attend   this

special  meeting of the South-East Asian  Women's

Conference in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope the Member for

Stamford  will study the problems of women  more

and then put up constructive suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also touched on the organisation of women.

She  should know this question well. We have put

up this problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2576</b></font><br><br>

for  discussion. But the work of organising women

could not be put into practice in just one day or

overnight. This problem is still being studied by

us. Just now the Member for Stamford said that we

had  not  tried  to carry out our  duty  in  this

respect. But she should know that she should  not

look  at things from the outside. She should  try

to get at the core of the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also mentioned yellow culture. Now, this is

something which all the people in Singapore  know

very well. Since the P.A.P. came into office,  it

has  been  very  strict in  dealing  with  yellow

culture. We have made some great achievements  in

this  respect. She should not try to  ignore  our

achievements in this work. It is to be  regretted

that when the Member for Queenstown, the Chairman

of the Barisan Sosialis, was a member of the Film

Censorship  Appeal Committee, he did  not  oppose

certain strip-tease films. Instead he said  these

strip-tease shows were not yellow culture. On the

contrary, they were good. So I must say that  the

Member  for  Stamford should try to persuade  the

Member for Queenstown, her Chairman. That is only

correct and proper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I refer to what the Member

for  Stamford  has said about the  education  of

women in the rural areas. She says we have  done

nothing  in  this respect. She should  not  have

said so. Mr Deputy Speaker, since we became the

Government we have built many community  centres

throughout  Singapore. One of the activities  of

these community centres is to help solve women's

problems,  because in the community  centres  we

have established adult education classes, sewing

classes and others. The chief purpose is to help

women,  particular those from families  who  are

unable  to  send  their children  to  school  to

receive  any kind of education because of  their

poverty  and  economic situation. These  classes

which are conducted in the community centres are

meant   to  help  them  solved  their  problems,

irrespective  of whether the students  attending

there  are  men or women. So I should point  out

the  mistake in what the Member for Stamford has

said.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2577</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also mentioned the passing of the Women's

Charter.  She said that once the Women's  Charter

had  been passed, it seemed as though we took  it

for  granted that all problems relating to  women

were  solved  at one and the same  time.  But  we

never had such a conception. We can only say that

the  passing of the Women's Charter is one of the

steps  forward to solve women's problems.  It  is

not  the final and only solution in this respect.

Therefore, I hope that if she wants to review the

Women's  Charter  and to suggest any  amendments,

she  should consult the other Assemblymen in  the

Barisan Sosialis beforehand; otherwise they  will

be  also very confused in the end and cannot come

to any agreement on what they want to suggest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I agree to what the Member

for  Choa Chu Kang has said just now, but he must

admit  that our laws have been good. It  is  only

because of their opposition that there have  been

some  loopholes now in the laws. The  Member  for

Stamford  says  that  the  school  fees  of  girl

students  have been raised by $1. Now,  I  should

tell  her that we had made a careful study before

we  carried that policy out. Our Party  had  also

discussed this question, namely, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2578</b></font><br><br>

raising  of the school fees by $1. We hope  that

in  future men and women will have equal  rights

irrespective  of  sex, but the Members  opposite

have  totally  disregarded the contents  of  the

policy  statement by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.

We  have  clearly  pointed out  in  this  policy

statement  that we want to carry out the  policy

of  giving  equal treatment to all, irrespective

of sex. If the Member for Stamford, when she was

with  us,  had mentioned those points which  she

has just mentioned in this Assembly, namely, the

problems and the difficulties relating to women,

then  we  would have paid attention to what  she

had suggested. But she did not do so. Instead of

which she has mentioned this in the House today.

Does she have any ulterior motive -
