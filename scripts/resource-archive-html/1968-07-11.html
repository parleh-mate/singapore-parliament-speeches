Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour if the

Government has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



caused studies to be made of (a) the adequacy of

the present limit of Singapore's territorial

waters in the light of Singapore's vital interests

in fishing, defence and the administration of

revenue laws in these waters; and (b) the effect

on Singapore's interest in these matters of claims

to territorial waters made by neighbouring states;

and if he will make a statement on these matters.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in international law the question of the

width of territorial waters is one subject upon

which there is unfortunately a divergence of views

among states. The present position is that the

vast majority of states claim territorial waters

varying from three miles to 12 miles.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as Singapore's territorial waters are

concerned, their delimitation to the north is

governed by agreement delimiting the territorial

waters midway between Singapore Island and the

State of Johore and which has been given effect to

in our municipal law under the provisions of the

Straits Settlements and Johore Territorial Waters

Agreement Act of 1928.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for our remaining territorial waters, this is

conditioned by our geographical position. In the

absence of any specific agreement with

neighbouring countries to the contrary, the line

equidistant between Singapore and the adjacent

territory would, therefore, constitute the limits

of our territorial waters under the provisions of

the Geneva Convention on Territorial Sea. However,

since claims to territorial waters made by

neighbouring states will have some implications

for Singapore, the departments concerned are

presently examining this question.

Sir,  foreign  ambassadors or envoys are  normally

nationals of the countries they represent. In such

capacity,  they are entitled to various privileges

and  immunities, including immunity from criminal,

civil  and  administrative  jurisdiction  of   the

receiving state. As such, the holding of office in

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs and Minister for Labour,  in  the

registration  for the issue of the  new  laminated

identity cards, (a) whether attempts were made  to

use  the  same, or an identical, birth certificate

by  more than one applicant for registration,  and

the number of such eases; (b) the number of forged

old  identity cards discovered; (c) the number  of

late applications for registration received up  to

31st  May,  1968; (d) what action had  been  taken

against  the applicants in (a), (b) and  (c);  and

(e)  the  number of old identity card holders  who

have   not  yet  applied  for  the  new  laminated

identity cards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by my Minister  to

reply. The National Registration Office has so far

discovered 954 new identity card holders who  made

use  of other persons' birth certificates. A total

of   188  forged  old  identity  cards  were  also

discovered.  Up  to  31st  May,  1968,  912   late

applications  for registration were received.  All

the  above cases have been referred to the  police

for investigation. To date seven persons have been

prosecuted and convicted for using other  persons'

birth  certificates; 87 prosecuted  and  convicted

for  forged  old identity cards, and 68 prosecuted

and fined for making late applications for the new

identity  cards.  Eight hundred and  eleven  cases

under the three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



categories  are still under investigation  by  the

police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to give the exact number of

old identity card holders who have not applied for

the  new laminated identity cards, as many of  the

old  identity  card  holders  may  have  left  the

Republic  permanently without  surrendering  their

old  identity  cards. Further,  the  old  identity

cards  of persons who have died may not have  been

surrendered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Will the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour

inform  this House whether positive steps will  be

taken to remind old identity card holdrs who  have

not  applied for the renewal of the new  laminated

cards?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

that is necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Will the

Parliamentary   Secretary  consider   giving   old

identity  card  holders, say, a month's  grace  to

apply for the new laminated identity cards without

action being taken against them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

relevant Ordinance has clearly spelt out the  time

allowed for the application of new identity cards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Will the Parliamentary

Secretary   state  whether  the  Government   will

consider making some arrangements to register aged

or  disabled  persons  at  their  homes,  if  such

arrangements can be made?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that process

has  been  going on all the time. Several invalids

in   the   Chronic  Sick  Hospital  were  recently

registered,  because they had some  difficulty  in

tracing  their old identity cards. Some  had  lost

their  cards  and had to take some time  to  trace

them. There is no penalty attached in such cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

quite  happy  with  the Parliamentary  Secretary's

answer. Does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



not the Government have a record of those who have

not  applied  for  new  identity  cards?  Can  the

Parliamentary  Secretary say  why  the  Government

cannot  take some positive steps to send reminders

to these persons?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

disagree  with  the hon. Member. The  requirements

are  clearly  spelt  out in  the  Ordinance.  This

Ordinance  was debated in this House  some  months

ago  and  I  do  not see why there should  be  any

person  who  has  still not changed  his  identity

card.  If  he chooses not to change it, I  do  not

think  any  number  of reminders  will  serve  any

purpose.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been

asked  by  my Minister to reply. My Ministry  does

not  propose  to  compel  every  secondary  school

student to take part in one of the extracurricular

activities  associated with the development  of  a

rugged  society,  such  as  the  pugilistic  arts,

sports  or  the  cadet  corps,  because  voluntary

participation will, in the end, produce far better

results. Most, if not all, students participate in

a  physical  fitness test. They are encouraged  to

play  at  least one game a term at various levels:

class,   house  and  school  levels.  The  results

produced  so  far,  without having  to  resort  to

compulsory  participation, have been  encouraging.

More  than 200,000 students participate at  school

level and about 24,000 at inter-school level.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the school cadet corps, army,

sea,  air and police, has risen from 7,500 in 1967

to  12,500  this year, and next year  this  figure

will reach close to the 17,000 mark. This increase

is in keeping with the expansion programme planned

for  the  period 1966 to 1970, and the aim  is  to

establish at least one cadet corps unit  in  every

secondary  school. In and after 1970 the  increase

in  the  establishment strength is in the addition

of  an  extra  platoon in every secondary  school,

provided funds are available.

various officers of my Ministry in 1966 and  1967.

A  total of 108 officers received such awards,  82

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the last part of the question,

Of  the  seven, one has recently been selected  by

oversea  mission.  Six are attached  to  secondary

schools. It is possible that at the time of return

there  may  be no suitable vacancies to  hold  the

officers  according to their specialised training.

In  such cases, they are often posted to secondary

schools  as a temporary measure. Those from  aided

schools  are  generally  returned  to  the   aided

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



the   workers  and  their  school-going   children

still  short of requirements. And on consideration

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more ambitious suggestion for a branch

all   such   newspapers  are  wholly  printed   in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee (for the Minister for Culture):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, most of the major newspapers,

whose   history  could  be  traced  back   several

decades,  originally based their  headquarters  in

Singapore and operated from Singapore. This  happy

business  arrangement  continued  well  after  the

formation of Malaysia. Then the Malaysian  Government  imposed  a law requiring newspapers  in  the

Federation to be printed in the country of origin.

That was the origin of "split" newspapers whereby,

for  reasons  of  survival, the  major  newspapers

printed  two versions - one for Malaysian  readers

and  one for Singapore readers. Part of the plants

had to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



be shifted to Malaysia and separate staff set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it may be that no Singapore printed

newspapers are permitted to circulate in Malaysia,

it  would  be  senseless  to  adopt  tit-for-tat

measures.  This is essentially because we  believe

in  and encourage the free flow of ideas not  only

from our neighbours but also from other countries.

This   is   the   meaning  of  an  open   society.

Suppression of ideas and viewpoints not in  accord

with our own is not in our interest.

the hon. Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the major newspapers which have already

the statistics at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I presume that the hon. Member is interested in

the  staff involved in the three Tamil newspapers.

The  Tamil  Murasu  has a total of  30  employees.

Eighteen of them are citizens of Malaysia and they

are  given employment in Kuala Lumpur. The 12  who

are Singapore citizens are now left unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamil Malar shifted its operations to Kuala

Lumpur  in February this year. I do not  know  how

many of the

staff have been transferred there and how many are

left  unemployed in Singapore. But there are still

15 employees who are still with the Tamil Malar in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Malaysia Malayalee, it would seem that

this particular newspaper will continue to operate

in  Singapore  as  its circulation  is  mainly  in

Singapore.  As  such, there is no  effect  on  the

employment of their employees in Singapore.

on 13th May, 1968, in this House on the subject of

creches  during  the  debate  on  the  President's

Speech. I quote Hansard, Volume 27, No. 4,  column

220, line 15:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In order to utilise fully the facilities in the

10  creches,  a number of vacant places  in  these

creches  will  be offered to children  of  working

parents  in  the higher income groups. But  unlike

those  from families with incomes below  5500  per

month  who  will  continue to  enjoy  the  heavily

subsidized  creche facilities, children  from  the

higher  income  families  will  have  to  pay   an

economic admission charge.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of this new policy were announced by

me  on 6th July, 1968, at the fifth Annual Parents

Day for children



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



centres  and  creches held at  the  Singapore

Conference   Hall.  They  are  as   follows.   The

following rates of fees will be charged  for  each

child admitted:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) for morning session only, from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. - $l;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for afternoon session only, from 2 p.m.

to 5 p.m. - 50 cents; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) for the full day, from 7 a.m. to 5

p.m. - $l.50.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For children from the lower income families the

following  conditions will apply: any child  below

the  age  of  six, either of whose  parents  is  a

Singapore  citizen, may be admitted  to  a  Social

Welfare creche provided that satisfactory evidence

can be produced to show that the parent is working

or both parents are working or ill, and that there

is no other adult in the family able to look after

the  child  and  that the combined income  of  the

family does not exceed $500 per month. The maximum

number  of  children  for any  one  family  to  be

admitted  is  four.  Priority in  admission  will,

however, be given to children in the lowest income

group and orphans whose guardians can satisfy  the

citizenship requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child whose parents are in receipt of public

assistance  allowance will  be  admitted  free  of

charge. A child whose parents and other members of

the  family  are  earning a  combined  income  not

exceeding  $300  per  month will  have  to  pay  a

nominal charge of ten cents per day. A child whose

parents  and  other  members  of  the  family  are

earning a combined income exceeding $300, but  not

exceeding  $500  per month, will  have  to  pay  a

nominal charge of thirty cents per day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are still a substantial number of vacant

places in the 10 Social Welfare creches and as the

new conditions for admission to these creches have

only  been  introduced very recently, my  Ministry

will have to assess the public response to the new

open-door policy for creches over a period of time

sufficient   justification   for   building   more

creches,  bearing in mind other priority needs,  I

can  assure the Member for Delta that the location

of  any new creche will be carefully studied by my

officials before a decision is made.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will pick up from where I left off

yesterday.  I  said yesterday that  a  person  who

retires  at  the  age  of  55  will  have  certain

disadvantages. I said there are some workers  who,

on  reaching  55 years of age, are  preparing  for

their  death.  But,  there  are  others  who,   on

reaching  this  age, are still very energetic  and

full of spirit and vitality, in addition to having

much  precious experience gained from their  work.

At  55,  they are beginning to launch  into  their

ambitious  enterprises. Such people  constitute  a

good number.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the advanced countries, Britain

and  America,  for some examples of these  people.

They  normally reach the height of success at  the

ages  of 70 to 80. This is a very good example  to

show that the retiring age for a worker should not

be 55 years of age and there should not be any law

to  retire  a worker when he reaches 55  years  of

age.  I  would say that the basis for assessing  a

person's retiring age should be his performance in

the work. It should not be based on age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the standardisation of the

number  of  hours of work per week. I should  have

supported  this provision, but I have  reasons  to

hope  that the Minister for Labour should be aware

that  as a result of the increase of working hours

per week, there is a risk that employers will make

use  of  this  provision as a pretext to  retrench

their workers. I therefore hope the Minister  will

caution the employers not to take such action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I wind up, I would like to say positively

that  this  Bill,  of course,  is  meant  for  the

economic  stability of our country  hereafter  and

for  its  consolidation and continued  prosperity.

Therefore,  all  industries,  whether  pioneer  or

already     established,    and    all    business

establishments should increase their productivity.

This  will also ensure that the 50,000 odd workers

who  will  be  left unemployed after  the  British

withdrawal  will have re-employment opportunities.

This  is  also thinking in terms of the employment

opportunities  for our thousands of  young  people

who will be entering the labour market every year.

On these two matters - increasing productivity and

providing employment opportunities - the first  is

an old problem, but the second is a new challenge.

When  there  is a new problem, we must  adopt  new

methods to meet it. There must be a new resolve to

meet  new problems. It is not surprising  that  we

should   encourage  our  people   to   work   more

diligently.  When  I began to speak  on  the  Bill

yesterday,  I already said that there was  nothing

to   cavil  about  it.  But  because  of  the  few

shortcomings which I have enumerated above - they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



are  like bristle-tails and maggots which will eat

away the whole body of the Bill - it is hoped  the

Minister  for  Labour will accept the constructive

propositions   of  the  Back-benchers.   We   have

consulted the views of the electorate and we  hope

the Minister will deliberate on the Bill and amend

it accordingly so as to make it perfect. It should

be  like  a bright light lighting up the  path  to

economic progress and national survival. It should

not  turn  the  relationship which now  exists  so

harmoniously  between  labour  and  capital  into,

figuratively speaking, a volcano erupting on  Bali

Island.



<br><br>3.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  to lend my support  to  the  Second

Reading  of  the  Bill moved by the  Minister  for

Labour.  If  it is passed by this House,  it  will

replace the existing three Ordinances, namely, the

Labour  Ordinance,  1955,  the  Clerks  Employment

Ordinance,   1957,   and   the   Shop   Assistants

Employment Ordinance, 1957. The new Bill  embodies

most  of  the  provisions in the three  Ordinances

mentioned above, and introduces some new ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Bill is intended to rationalise and

regularise  the working conditions of both  white-collar  and blue-collar workers, whether they  are

employed  in  commercial  and  trading  firms   or

industrial  establishments in the  new  industrial

estates,   and   to   increase  productivity   and

efficiency. It will do away with all the anomalies

in  the existing Ordinances and is more in keeping

with  our  concept of an equal and  just  society.

Unless our Government seeks to establish a healthy

investment climate so necessary and vital for  the

setting up of export-oriented and labour intensive

industries,  our  task to solve  the  unemployment

problem will be hopeless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more investments in industries, both

from local and foreign sources, certain terms  and

conditions of service should be so legislated that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



there  is  little room for prolonged  negotiations

under  the present Industrial Relations Ordinance,

1960.  In  the  national interest and  to  develop

greater  economic growth, such a Bill as  the  new

Employment Bill is essential for the crucial years

ahead.  The measures as provided in the  new  Bill

may  on  the  surface appear to be  repugnant  and

retrogressive to our trade unionists, but I am  of

the  opinion  that there are only  a  few  clauses

which  may  have  to be amended to  safeguard  the

interests    of   workers   against   unscrupulous

employers. I will deal with the important  clauses

later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House must always bear in mind

that  newly  emergent  independent  countries  and

other  countries  situated in this  part  of  Asia

which have achieved independence much earlier than

we   have,  are  also  actively  promoting   their

economic  growth  in diversifying  their  hitherto

agricultural economy. This they do by  encouraging

the  setting up of light and secondary industries.

These   countries   have   cheaper   labour    and

unfavourable working conditions and the  terms  of

employment  of  the workers are exploited  to  the

full  by  capitalists. We in Singapore are already

finding  it difficult to compete in certain  types

of  manufactures for export because of lower  cost

of products from these other countries. To compete

with  them,  we  will have to use  automation  and

computers in our industries, which will mean  that

we  will  employ only a small number  of  workers.

Therefore, we cannot provide jobs for our mounting

unemployed employables who are flooding the labour

market  each year. For us, the alternative  is  to

create the maximum number of job opportunities for

our  untapped labour force who can be  trained  to

acquire  new  skills. Our people  have  a  natural

aptitude  for work in labour intensive industries,

such  as the textile mills, electronic industries,

metal   and  steel  fabricated  industries,  ship-building  and ship repairing industries,  etc.  In

order  to  attain these latter objectives  and  to

meet  the  challenges ahead brought about  by  the

accelerated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



British  withdrawal,  we  must  have  settled  and

stable  labour  conditions to give confidence  and

inducements  to  foreign, and local  investors  to

make  our  Republic the industrial  base  of  this

region.  The  enactment of this Bill into  law  at

this crucial period of our short history will go a

long  way  to promote and foster that  climate  so

necessary for our economic survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I advise hon. Members of Parliament who are

from  the  trade unions that it is  their  bounden

duty to pass on by every means to every worker  at

every   level   in  the  land  the   meaning   and

significance of the Employment Bill.  The  enemies

of our State should not be allowed a chance to use

this  Bill as a rallying cause for their  disloyal

and unpatriotic motive to create industrial strife

and  thereby engender chaotic economic conditions.

If they succeed, we will fall into their trap. Our

nation  will perish and we will never rise  again.

Our  identity  as  an  independent  and  sovereign

Singapore in this part of Asia will pass into  the

limbo of history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Employment Bill, I agree, will generate

with  good cause, fears in the minds of the  trade

union  Members  of this House,  as  it  will  open

opportunities   to  ruthless   and   less   social

conscious   employers   to   exploit   labour   by

extracting  the maximum of financial  returns  and

giving  the minimum of benefit in return.  But  in

the  final analysis, it takes two willing  parties

to    form    a   harmonious   and   understanding

partnership, and with goodwill on both sides  much

can be accomplished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In industries and commercial houses, labour and

capital  must strive sincerely for a  healthy  and

true  partnership. There must be some  measure  of

sacrifice  for  the  national  interest  and   not

sectional    interest   in   order   to    achieve

productivity and efficiency at the highest  pitch.

When these twin objectives are achieved, then only

can  we  produce goods at competitive  prices  for

export.  The sort of relationship existing between

labour and capital will finally decide our destiny

as  to whether we can succeed as an industrial and

servicing base for South-east Asia and a  thriving

and prosperous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



nation.  Much depends upon the type of  leadership

we have in both camps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two years of industrial relations as

compared  with those of the 1950s,  which  gave  a

sour and bitter taste to labour, have demonstrated

that   we   have   progressive   and   enlightened

management  on  the one hand and  responsible  and

sensible trade union leaders on the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now make a few comments on two or three

new  provisions  in the Bill. If they  are  passed

without  amendments,  they  will  have  unsettling

effects on the minds and morale of labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 - employment of a person after the age

of  55  years.  To  retire compulsorily  a  worker

earning   less  than  $750  from   his   firm   is

unrealistic   and  not  alive   to   our   present

developing economy. Our nation has just  begun  to

industrialise and in many of our small and medium-sized local enterprises, supervisors, technicians,

foremen and charge-hands usually draw salaries  of

less  than $750. With the experience and expertise

acquired  during the long years of  their  working

life, they are mainly responsible for running  the

firms  for  their employers. If these  supervisory

and  shop-floor staff and experienced workers  are

retired  at the age of 55, these enterprises  will

be  crippled and replacements will be difficult to

find. A more reasonable age to retire a worker  in

these special categories which may be spelt out in

the  Bill  should be 60 years if  they  are  still

medically fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 47 - payment of bonus. In most existing

collective agreements between management and trade

unions,  there is already a provision for  payment

of  bonus  ranging  from half a month's  to  three

months'  wages. To take away these fringe benefits

from the workers without giving back something  to

them  would  be unfair and harsh. A bonus  is  the

equivalent  of  a  red  packet  which  the   Asian

employer as a matter of tradition or custom  gives

to his workers during the New Year as a gesture of

goodwill.  This bonus provides a source  of  ready

cash  either to purchase new clothes and shoes  to

celebrate the most important festive occasion once

a year,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



or  to  purchase books, school uniforms, etc, for

school-going children when school reopens  at  the

beginning of each year. Therefore, it is necessary

as  a safeguard in the interest of workers against

irresponsible  employers to provide  a  clause  to

provide  for  bonus with a minimum of  one  week's

wages and a maximum of one month's wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a further incentive to and as a reward for

greater productivity and profit for the worker, we

should  consider  provision for  an  extra  bonus,

additional to the statutory maximum of one month's

wages  mentioned above. This additional bonus  has

to be earned and must be related to the net profit

of  the firm. The worker's actual contribution, by

working  harder  and putting  in  more  effort  to

increase productivity, thereby producing goods  at

a  more competitive price to earn more profits for

the  firm,  should be recognised in some  concrete

and financial form. His entitlement to a share  of

the  net  profit is a just claim as  he  would  be

partly  responsible  for any favourable  financial

results each year. The quantum of his share should

not  be  the  subject of negotiation  because,  as

often as not, such negotiations lead to industrial

disputes   and  sours  the  industrial   relations

between  labour  and management. I  would  suggest

that  the  share of the net profit of the  company

should  range from two to four per cent among  all

workers   drawing  less  than  $750   per   month.

Provision of this small percentage out of the  net

profit  may directly affect the yearly  bonus  and

fees  of  the  directors  and  management  of  the

company.  But  in showing this generosity  to  the

workers, the company will be more than compensated

by the goodwill and co-operation that is expressed

by  the  workers  in more efficient  productivity.

There  should be no bargaining on the  quantum  of

bonus. It should be left to the sole discretion of

the  management.  Existing  collective  agreements

with  the  bonus clause should, in my opinion,  be

permitted  to  run  out  by  the  end   of   1968,

irrespective of their expiry date. New  agreements

should be negotiated in the spirit of the new Bill

when it is passed by this House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of this new Bill into law, it

would be wise that the first agreement drawn up in

the  context of this Bill should be for a duration

of  five  years  instead of three  years  for  new

industries  to  be  set up and industries  already

granted  pioneer  status. It  takes  a  few  years

before  any newly established industry can  really

stand on its feet and show a sound balance sheet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may sound unreasonable in my views, but in the

long run the country in particular and the workers

in   general  will  reap  the  benefit  when   the

industries  can  progress  and  become  viable  to

generate greater economic growth. This clause,  if

incorporated into the Bill, will also add  impetus

to  more  and  more foreign investors coming  into

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have to sound a warning. To make a

success of the operation of this Employment  Bill,

both   workers   and   employers   must   remember

constantly that both labour and management have to

make  sacrifice  in the national interest  and  to

maintain  industrial peace at  all  costs  in  the

crucial   years  ahead.  By  maintaining   cordial

industrial relations, a good image of Singapore as

a country of economic and political stability will

be  projected  abroad with more foreign  investors

being  attracted  to our shores. In  other  words,

with  more industries established, more jobs  will

be created, more types of manufactures can be more

exported,  more  profits can be  earned  and  more

revenue  will  go  to Government  for  defence  to

maintain  our security. The end result will  be  a

more  prosperous Singapore in which everyone -  be

he  an  employer or a worker -will share  in  this

prosperity.   Our   citizens   should   discipline

themselves  and face the future economic  problems

with  good sense, soberness and make some personal

sacrifices. What is considered a sacrifice in  the

short-term  interest  will  produce  material  and

financial benefits in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill moved by the Minister for

Labour.

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, Singapore is not an agricultural country  and

has  no natural resources. It is an industrial and

trading  centre.  Therefore,  the  people   should

consider  what  future is in store  for  them.  It

follows  that plans to provide for the future  and

ensure  the  country's prosperity  should  be  our

common responsibility. The labour laws, too,  need

careful review because this will affect the future

of  our  people  and that of the nation.  A  great

majority  of the population of Singapore comprises

the labour force. Labour unrest means the people's

unrest, and the people's unrest means a threat  to

the nation's prosperity in the future. Every piece

of labour legislation should be carefully examined

in  its  proper  perspective and the  trade  union

movement,  that  is,  the  National  Trades  Union

Congress, should be consulted. We do not  wish  to

see   labour  disputes  in  our  country,  as  had

happened before the P.A.P. assumed office. We need

to  ensure  good relationship between  labour  and

management   which   will  result   in   increased

productivity  and prosperity for the country.  The

Government  plays the role of an intermediary  and

steps  should be taken to create an atmosphere  of

confidence in both parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill has generated a heated debate

not  only within the House but also outside by the

trade  union movement. We realise that all workers

will  wonder what their fate will be as they  will

be  affected  in  one way or other  by  the  Bill.

Perhaps they may be adversely affected. There  are

groups of workers whose interests have never  been

looked after and who have been exploited by  their

employers in the past. Such workers may benefit as

a result of this Bill, because previously they had

to work more than 44 hours a week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Ministry should not only introduce or

amend labour laws but it must also be prepared  to

protect  the  workers  from  being  victimised  by

unscrupulous employers. We have come across  cases

of  workers who had to work more than 44 hours per

week



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



without   being  paid  overtime;  also  cases   of

arbitrary  dismissals of workers at  the  whim  of

employers.  I  hope  this Bill  will  be  able  to

overcome  all  these difficulties and  ensure  the

security of the workers in the years ahead.



<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  inner  circles and rank and file members  of

the  trade  union  movement have long  awaited  an

employment law to cover all classes and categories

of  working  people other than those in managerial

and  executive positions. The Employment  Bill  as

introduced by Government, however, falls short  of

expectations   as   seamen,   domestic   servants,

watchmen  and security guards do not  come  within

the  ambit  of  the  Bill. The  rationale  of  our

attitude is that every employee who enters into or

works under a contract of service with an employer

must receive the protection of the employment  law

of the country. In this respect, it is worth while

to  note  that  the scope of the law will  embrace

employees working in undertakings engaged  in  the

transport  of passengers or goods by  road,  rail,

sea,  inland  waterways  or  air,  including   the

handling   of  goods  at  docks,  quays,  wharves,

warehouses or airports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of the labour movement, it

is  acceptable in principle, to repeal the  Labour

Ordinance,  1955, the Clerks Employment Ordinance,

1957,   and   the   Shop   Assistants   Employment

Ordinance, 1957. These were introduced during  the

colonial regime to cause class distinction and  to

discriminate further between those covered by  the

laws  and those falling outside the scope  of  the

laws.   In   principle,  it   is   acceptable   to

rationalise,  to  streamline  and  to  standardise

employment  practices  and  to  lay  down  minimum

conditions of employment by enacting a new law  to

replace the outdated and messy laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement of the existing labour laws by

one  employment law is not a controversial matter.

What  is  controversial are certain provisions  in

the Employment Bill which tend to remove



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



the  rights  of  the workers from enjoying  fringe

benefits,  and the reasons propounded  to  justify

their  removal.  To take away the  benefits  which

workers   are  now  enjoying  through   collective

bargaining  or  through other legitimate  ways  is

terribly unreasonable and unjust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major offences against workers is the

attempt  to  remove from the field of negotiations

the  matter  of bonus and ex-gratia  payments.  In

this  respect,  the  loss of this  right  will  be

grievously  felt. Bonus has become  entrenched  in

the  salary structure of the private sector and  a

vital  supplement to the worker's income.  It  has

become  payable not only to workmen, clerks,  shop

assistants  and  other classes of  employees,  but

even to executives in the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of negotiability of bonus has been

established  by the trade unions and  accepted  by

the Industrial Arbitration Court. The concept that

bonus  is  payable only when there are  reasonable

profits  is  prevalent in Singapore. This  is  the

trend in Singapore and the emergence of this trend

is  consistent  with the principle that  employees

should have the right to claim an equitable  share

of  profits  as  a  result of  their  labour.  The

proposal  to  remove  bonus  from  the  field   of

negotiations  and  outside  the  purview  of   the

Industrial  Arbitration Court is the rudest  shock

workers  have had and an indirect censure  of  the

Industrial Arbitration Court. I do not think  that

the  President  and the Deputy  President  of  the

Industrial  Arbitration Courts and  panel  members

have  not  used their good sense and  judgment  in

giving  awards  on  matters like  bonus.  In  this

respect, there is no necessity to circumscribe the

jurisdiction  of the Court unless  the  Court  has

been making haywire decisions. I believe that  the

Court,  in  making  awards,  has  been  guided  by

section  31 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance,

1960, which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In determining a trade dispute the Court may

have  regard  not  only to the  interests  of  the

persons immediately concerned but to the interests

of the community as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



whole  and  in  particular the  condition  of  the

economy of the State.'



<br><br>The Court, I am sure, has followed the guidance in

section  31 of the Industrial Relations  Ordinance

when it stated in an award in the case between the

Chartered  Bank and the Bank Employees'  Union  on

17th November, 1966, that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On the whole, in the present economic context,

it  would  be preferable to effect adjustments  in

bonus  whether upwards or downwards as the general

economic  condition, the particular  circumstances

of  each  case and the position of the parties  in

each   particular  dispute  are  being  considered

rather  than  to make adjustments  in  respect  of

basic salaries which are matters of more long-term

application.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Industrial Arbitration Court is to

consider  all the policy statements  made  by  the

Government  and stick to the principle  enunciated

in the case cited, there could be virtually a wage

freeze.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I venture to say that if in due

course  workers discover that there  has  been  an

overall loss rather than gain, it may well lead to

an  assault on the wage front. In view of the fact

that employers can refuse to pay bonus in spite of

higher  productivity, it will  be  interesting  to

watch  in which direction the Court will  tip  the

scale. To my mind, it will be a good thing for the

Government,  as  a  matter of  policy,  to  direct

employers   and   trade   unions   to   work   out

productivity bonus scales and payments rather than

remove  the  payment of bonus from the purview  of

negotiability.  Should any dispute  arise  between

the  parties, it could be referred to the National

Productivity Council which, I expect, can reliably

be depended upon to give correct advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, the National Productivity

Council   can   be  given  statutory   powers   to

investigate  and to make decisions on productivity

problems.  The question of increasing productivity

in  any  firm  or undertaking and the  payment  of

productivity  rewards  can  also  be  worked   out

between the particular employer, employees' representatives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



and the National Productivity  Council.

There  must  be  the  machinery  for  working  out

productivity plans, examining the results and  for

negotiating  the  payment of incentive  awards  to

make   any   productivity   drive   achieve    its

objectives.    The    question    of    increasing

productivity is an urgent matter and should be  of

serious  concern to employers, Government  workers

and   their  organisations  in  the  interest   of

economic progress. In this respect, if workers are

asked to give their wholehearted support to higher

productivity programmes and campaigns,  they  must

be    allowed   to   participate   actively    and

constructively  in  formulating  and  implementing

them.  When  there  is  success,  there  must   be

concrete and reasonable returns or rewards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the foregoing point, it is

beyond  comprehension why the payment of bonus  to

workers, a vital incentive to higher productivity,

is  to  be non-negotiable. This is indeed a  great

injustice   to  workers.  The  trade   unions   do

vehemently  protest  against the  attempt  by  the

Government  to remove bonus or ex-gratia  payments

from  the  purview of negotiability. It cannot  be

expected that all employers will wisely and fairly

pay productivity bonus. The game of the carrot  or

the  stick may very well degenerate to the  extent

where an employer provides incentives for personal

favours. It is too far-fetched to believe that all

employers  who  are  making  profits  will  pay  a

productivity  bonus  notwithstanding  the  profits

which  can  be  attributed to the productivity  of

labour. If clause 47 stands unamended, workers can

expect to lose everything in the form of bonus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this juncture I wish to ask

the   Government  to  be  ever  watchful   against

unscrupulous  employers taking  advantage  of  the

Employment   Act  and  the  Industrial   Relations

(Amendment)  Act to sour up industrial  stability,

harmony  and progress. I am prompted to  say  this

because  there are indications that some employers

are   interpreting   the   introduction   of   the

Employment Bill and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



the  Industrial Relations (Amendment)  Bill  as  a

sign of "go-ahead licence to skin the workers".



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Minister for Labour himself

informed  the House of two uncrupulous  employers,

whoever  they may be, who have taken advantage  of

the  situation.  I  hope the  Government  will  be

watchful   against   employers   victimising   the

workers.  This  warning is necessary  because  the

Minister   has   apparently  now   realised   that

employers can abuse the situation created  by  the

introduction  of  the  Employment  Bill  and   the

Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill. I  wish  to

tell the Government that the workers can take  all

the  verbal snipings of the Minister in the proper

spirit, but they will react in the most unfriendly

way  and  manner  if the Employment  Act  and  the

Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act become beach-heads  for the final assault on their job security

and economic well-being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers, whether white-collar, blue-collar,

or   bare-neck,  are  not  unconcerned  about  the

economic expansion and advancement of the  nation.

I  am sure they will be prepared to sacrifice some

of  their most important benefits if, by doing so,

more  jobs are created for their unemployed  sons,

daughters,  relatives and friends. I am  sure  the

workers  who  receive bonus will  be  prepared  to

contribute anything between 10 and 20 per cent  to

the  Central  Provident Fund if that can  generate

economic expansion and activity. This proposal has

been  made  by the National Trades Union Congress,

and  the offer to the Government is still open for

the free negotiability of bonus. This offer, which

I  have  mentioned,  is the workers'  energy  pact

offer for national development. The employers  can

match  it if they wish to accept the challenge.  I

will  disagree with anyone, including the Minister

for  Labour,  that  workers are not  squeezers  of

fringe benefits, trying to cover every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



contingency they can think of, from the  altar  to

the  hospital  and from the cradle to  the  grave.

More often than not, it is the employers who would

be  prepared to provide more fringe benefits  than

pay adequate wages and rewards for productivity. I

dare say that if workers are properly remunerated,

they will be least bothered about losses of fringe

benefits,  like sick leave which, I am sure,  they

do not hope to enjoy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the sick leave provision in clause

44, I do not consider it a productivity booster. I

do not agree with the belief that a worker will be

productive  if  he works under the fear  that  his

family will suffer if he becomes sick. Under  this

condition, he will more likely put in the  minimum

effort  to  avoid  sickness. The provision  of  14

days'  paid  sick  leave  in  each  year,  if   no

hospitalisation is necessary, and  28  days,  when

hospitalisation   is   required,   is   definitely

inadequate. I do not imagine any doctor  can  cure

anyone  suffering  from a chronic  illness  in  28

days.  It  is  unimaginable how a  malingerer  can

pretend to be seriously ill and get his employer's

doctor  to  recommend his admission to a hospital.

It  is harder to imagine how such a malingerer can

wrangle   his  way  in  getting  admitted   to   a

Government hospital. I do not see how a malingerer

can abuse such a benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I wish to say is that the National Trades

Union Congress do not stand by workers abusing any

benefit provided. We would agree to the Government

and  employers  "smoking  out"  the  culprits  and

punishing   them.  But  the  way  the   Government

proposes to solve their dilemma is like that of  a

frantic man who, being unable to catch the rats in

the  house, burns his house and everything  in  it

down,  regardless  of  the lives  of  his  family.

However,   I  am  gratified  to  know   that   the

Government will consider the proposals made by the N.T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the provisions for annual leave

and  public  holidays, I do agree  that  they  are

within   reasonable   limits   for   new   pioneer

industries. To show that the trade union movement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



does  have a social conscience and responsibility,

we  agree to the inclusion of clause 42 whereby  a

worker  who absents himself without excuse on  the

day  preceding or following a public holiday  will

not  receive any public holiday pay.  This  is  an

important and necessary punitive provision against

those who interrupt the proper functioning of  the

undertaking.  I would go to the extent  of  saying

that  any  worker  who makes  a  habit  of  taking

"French  leave"  should  be properly  disciplined,

because  we cannot allow ourselves to behave  like

some others in another country where, in spite  of

the  country's  political and  economic  position,

they fail to turn up for work following New Year's

Day  and other public holidays. To behave  in  the

same manner would be disastrous for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the next clause in the

Employment  Bill I wish to discuss is  clause  53.

This  clause  should be read in  conjunction  with

clause  7  of the Industrial Relations (Amendment)

Bill.  It is clear that only collective agreements

of  industrial  undertakings that  have  commenced

business  on or after January 1968 are covered  by

the  two  provisions.  The National  Trades  Union

Congress  fully  support  the  encouragement   and

protection of pioneer industries. In this respect,

it  has  formed the Pioneer Industries  Employees'

Union  to  look  after  the  interest  of  pioneer

industries  and  their employees. This  particular

union  is a credit to the good sense of the people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, I hope the Government will

not  only  consider the amendments to be moved  by

the Member for Bukit Ho Swee but also accept them.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I have to say that the

intentions  of the Employment Bill  are  good  and

though I am generally in agreement with the spirit

of the Bill, I have certain questions to ask.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 requires that every person who attains

the  age  of  55 may continue to work  only  after

getting  approval  from the Commissioner  who  may

impose  conditions  for  continued  employment.  I

would  like to draw the attention of the  Minister

to  the following. There are many old people -  by

"old" I mean people between 55 and 60 years of age

-  who  still have many children to support,  like

myself. There are other old people who have grown-up  children but these children are unemployed and

are dependent on their father. Clause 15 gives the

Commissioner  arbitrary powers to  decide  on  the

livelihood   of  the  whole  family  without   any

provision for appeal. For these reasons,  I  think

this clause should be removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "employer" in page 3 of the

Bill  does not include company, association,  body

corporate,  etc.  Although in page  10,  line  37,

"body  corporate" is mentioned, I  would  like  to

know  from  the  Minister  whether  the  Bill   is

intended  to  cover employers such  as  companies,

associations, bodies corporate as well as persons.

In  this  connection, I wish to draw the attention

of  the  House to the definition of "employer"  in

the Central Provident Fund Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Part X of the Bill

entitled  "Employment of Women" deals with  female

workmen only. The definition of "employee" in page

2   includes   workman,  but  the  definition   of

"workman"   in  page  6  does  not   include   all

categories  of  employees.  For  instance,  female

clerks  are  included  under  the  definition   of

"employee"   but  not  under  the  definition   of

"workman".  Hence,  the restrictions  provided  in

Part  X  under the general heading "Employment  of

Women"  are,  in fact, applicable only  to  female

workmen. May I know from the Minister if  this  is

intentional,  and  if so, why are  female  workmen

discriminated from female clerks and other  female

employees?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I now refer to

clause  112 (b) on page 37 of the Bill? I  do  not

object  to  the requirement that employers  should

notify the Employment Exchange of vacancies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



available  in  their  establishment.  I   do   not

understand why the Minister should prevent persons

from   engaging  employees  except   through   the

Employment  Exchange. He seems to have  overlooked

the  fact  that in many small establishments,  the

wife  and children help out in the business.  This

clause  prevents  the sons of the  proprietors  of

small   shops  from  working  in  their   father's

business  and  requires them  to  seek  employment

elsewhere  while  the father has to  employ  other

proprietors'  sons in his shop.  Furthermore,  the

engagement  of an employee is not always  accepted

merely  on  his  skill or ability. The  factor  of

trust often comes in. Where trust is involved, the

employer would certainly want an employee  who  is

recommended  to  him  rather  than  take   on   an

unrecommended   stranger.   Would   the   Minister

consider   amending  this  clause  to  allow   the

employment   of  wives  and  children   of   small

establishments and to allow employers to  take  on

employees on their own where trust is involved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Bill

is designed to increase efficiency and is based on

the principle of a full day's pay for a full day's

work.  In the light of mounting unemployment  when

competition  for jobs will be keen,  I  hope  that

this   Bill   will  help  in  attracting   foreign

investment  in  Singapore  and  create  more   job

opportunities for our people. It must  be  pointed

out  that  this  will call for greater  sacrifices

from  the  workers. I hope that the Minister  will

take   appropriate  steps  before  the   Bill   is

implemented  to  explain to the  workers  and  the

people  that  it  is  designed  to  help  increase

employment opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Bill will, in effect, reduce

the  earnings of the lower income group. This will

unavoidably   cause   hardship   to   them.    But

compensation  for this hardship  can  be  made  if

Government  lakes appropriate steps to  lower  the

prices  of locally produced goods. With increasing

protection given to manufacturers, it is  possible

that some irresponsible manufacturers will exploit

this  situation  and  raise prices  unnecessarily.

This will bring up the cost of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



living for the lower income group. I urge the

Government to look into this seriously.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am strongly against the provision

in  the  Employment Bill which stipulates  that  a

person shall retire at the age of 55. We all  know

the  Chinese  saying,  "At thirty,  one  is  quite

young, and one enters middle age at 40 and 50." So

with  this  provision in the Bill, a  person  will

have to retire compulsorily on reaching the age of

55. He will be put in cold storage. That will mean

that  he will be frozen and starved to death. When

a person is 55 years old, it does not mean that he

is  senile. I am 63 years old. When I was 55 I was

elected  a  Member of this House. I have  been  in

this  House all this while and I do not admit that

I am old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when Dr Lee Siew Choh of the

Barisan  Sosialis was in this Chamber, he shivered

whenever he stood up to speak because he could not

stand the air-conditioning here. As you can see, I

am not clad in any cardigan or overcoat. There was

one  Parliamentary sitting which  lasted  up  till

midnight and the Chamber was extremely cold. I was

still  wearing  my ordinary shirt and  I  did  not

shiver.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you order a person to retire at 55 years of

age, it is too arbitrary and very unreasonable. We

know  that most Chinese people work for  a  living

without the benefit of a pension. If these  people

are  forced to retire at 55, whom do we expect  to

maintain their children? Can we refer them to  the

Social  Welfare Department? Moreover,  the  Social

Welfare Department pays public assistance  out  of

public funds. This would mean that you are putting

out of operation people who are still economically

active  and  maintaining them at  public  expense.

This  is not fair. In my view, this clause  should

be deleted from the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, at 55 a person is still

strong  enough  to work. He can  even  be  at  the

forefront  of our economic activities. This  is  a

very  important year in his life. He has  got  all

the experience of his life when he reaches 55.  He

is  cultured  and at the prime of  his  life.  The

young people may still be suckling and without any

experience to take over from the old-timers. I  am

in  full support of young people working,  but  we

must  not allow them to take over everything.  Due

respect must be given to old people. They must  be

well  looked after. I think I am the oldest Member

in  this  House and I must speak my mind  on  this

clause.  I am representing many people in  my  age

group.  I hope the Minister will review clause  15

and  take  steps  to delete it. Whether  a  person

retires  or  not  at  55  should  depend  on   his

performance  and not on his age.  If  he  has  the

ability  to  work, then he should  be  allowed  to

continue  to do so. In fact, many people occupying

top  positions in organisations and in  Government

service are old people. There are some old  people

who  are  Presidents and Prime Ministers. It  does

not  mean  that when one is 55 he is incapable  of

doing anything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the provision of payment of

bonus,  we should realise that people employed  in

Chinese firms draw a very low salary. They  get  a

bonus  only  at  the  end of  the  year.  This  is

utilised for extra expenditure on their family. It

enables them to buy new shoes and new clothes  and

defray  other expenses so that they  can  enjoy  a

happy  New Year. So if the bonus is denied to  the

workers,  how do we expect them to go through  the

New  Year? Their salary is very low and they  have

no  savings for the New Year festival.  Where  can

they  get  the  money to pay for  their  New  Year

expenses? They have to depend on the bonus. In  my

view,  the  provision restricting the  payment  of

bonus should be deleted from the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



and  later,  during  the semi-colonial  days,  the

workers of Singapore were entirely at the mercy of

the employers. They were exploited to the full and

things   took  a  better  turn  only   when   this

Government  assumed office in 1959. The conditions

of  employment of workers in Singapore then became

more reasonable and rationalised. Various benefits

were  given  to  them.  All  these  benefits  were

granted  on a reciprocal basis between labour  and

management.  The  aim was to maintain  social  and

industrial  stability. As a result of this,  there

was  tremendous  improvement and progress  in  the

commercial   and  industrial  field.   There   was

prosperity all round.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trade union house was erected for the working

class  under the leadership of a democratic  trade

union  movement. This is a glorious  page  in  the

history of Singapore. It is a great achievement by

the   P.A.P.  Government  in  striving   for   the

interests of the workers of Singapore. This is  an

undeniable fact. It is there for everybody to see.

It  is a monument to the pro-labour policy of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir. Singapore is a small island

lacking  in  natural resources and an agricultural

base.  Ever since it was opened up as a  port,  it

has been a base for the United Kingdom. Therefore,

the  accelerated withdrawal of British troops from

Singapore will inevitably have grave repercussions

on  Singapore.  Within the  next  few  years,  the

problems  confronting Singapore  will  be  of  the

utmost  importance.  This  will  be  the  greatest

challenge  we have ever had. It will be  the  most

difficult period that we have to go through. I  am

glad  to  know,  however, that the Government  has

already  taken steps to prepare for the  worst  to

come.  Steps have already been taken for  a  rainy

day,  as was indicated by the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  and  Minister for Labour  in  this  House

yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister said that the

Employment   Bill  was  introduced   for   various

reasons. He then outlined these very carefully  in

this House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



The Employment Bill, he said, was intended to pave

the  way  for greater economic growth in Singapore

in  order  to ensure our survival in the next  few

years.  He also assured the House that it  is  not

the intention of the Government to allow labour to

be exploited through the Employment Bill. The long-term interests of the workers in Singapore will be

safeguarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the intention to ensure that Singapore

will  be able to overcome the difficulties arising

out  of  the  accelerated  withdrawal  of  British

forces by the end of 1971. The problems have  been

picturesquely painted by the Minister. Because  of

the  withdrawal of British troops, a sum  of  $450

million,  representing  the  expenditure  of   the

Forces,  will  be  withdrawn from  circulation  in

Singapore.  As a result of the British withdrawal,

more  than 50,000 people will be unemployed,  both

directly and indirectly. 21,000 civilian employees

in  the  British bases will be directly  affected.

Furthermore,  a  lot  of other ancillary  services

provided  by  taxi  drivers,  amahs,  shopkeepers,

restaurants,  bars  and others will  be  adversely

affected by the withdrawal of British Forces  from

Singapore.  And  added to all  this  will  be  the

school-leavers numbering some 25,000  coming  into

the   labour  market  every  year.  These  massive

figures   of  unemployment  are  frightening   and

indicate   the   seriouness  of  the  unemployment

problem in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the British troops are withdrawn, Singapore

will  not get the assistance of the United Kingdom

in   its  defence.  So  we  will  have  to  defend

ourselves. As a result, we will have to  build  up

our  military capability. We will have to shoulder

the responsibility of ensuring our security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to overcome these problems, massive

economic financing is needed. We know that capital

is   a   motivating  force  in  industry.  Without

capital,  industrialisation will be  a  flop.  The

success  of  industrialisation  depends   on   the

building  of factories and this requires  capital.

Therefore,  the  Government has to encourage  both

local and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



foreign  capitalists to invest in  Singapore.  The

Government   has   also   given   investors   many

incentives   and   tax   holidays   as   well   as

concessions.  For  instance,  profits  earned   in

Singapore by foreign capital will be allowed to be

remitted  back  to the country of origin.  We  are

fully  aware of the problems and the necessity  of

concessions. But in spite of the attractive  terms

that we are giving to foreign capitalists, we have

not  been  able to get enough foreign  capital  to

invest here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the Government has introduced the

Employment   Bill.  It  is  to  give  better   and

favourable  terms to the employers,  even  at  the

expense  of  the workers to some extent.  I  think

this is unavoidable. But to ensure the survival of

the  country as well as safeguard the interest  of

our  future  generations,  we  have  to  view  the

Employment Bill dispassionately. I appreciate that

the   provisions  in  the  Employment   Bill   are

necessary  and  quite inevitable. I  support  this

Bill in principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are certain clauses in the Bill

which  require  amendments.  I  must  indicate  my

support for the proposed amendments to be moved by

the  Member  for  Bukit  Ho Swee,  especially  the

deletion  of  clause  15  relating  to  compulsory

retirement of employees at the age of 55.  Another

amendment is in relation to sick leave.  Also  the

amendments to clauses 46, 47 and 53.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to put forward the views of the

people  of  Thomson for the consideration  of  the

Minister for Labour. The first point is whether he

will  consider restricting the application of this

Bill  to the Jurong Industrial Estate only so that

workers  in other sectors will not be affected  as

they  are covered by existing agreements.  If  the

experiment turns out to be successful in Jurong in

attracting more foreign capital and creating  more

employment  opportunities,  then  we  may  perhaps

consider extending the scope of the application of

the  Bill  to other sectors as well. If this  Bill

can  really  bring  about  the  success  that   is

envisaged  for  it,  then  the  Jurong  Industrial

Estate will become more and more prosperous.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to suggest is that before

the provisions of this Bill are enforced, adequate

publicity should be given to the intention of  the

Bill  which is to safeguard the long-term interest

and the survival of Singapore. The people must  be

told  that it is their responsibility to make some

sacrifices   to  ensure  the  survival   and   the

continuing      prosperity      of      Singapore,

notwithstanding  the  withdrawal  of  the  British

forces. The people must be made to believe that it

is in their own interest that this Employment Bill

has  been  introduced. It is only then  that  they

will realise the necessity of this Bill. When they

are  properly informed, we will be able to enforce

the Bill more effectively.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I think it is generally appreciated that this

Bill   has  been  introduced  in  order  to   meet

effectively  the serious economic challenges  that

we  face. However, the Government appears to  have

made  certain  dubious assumptions.  Factors  like

increased productivity, greater efficiency and the

like  are  not  hampered solely  by  the  workers.

Certainly  there have been a number of restrictive

practices   by   workers   which   have   hampered

productivity, efficiency and so on. But  it  would

be  a  very  grave error to assume that  employers

have nothing to contribute towards this situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have made a study of the reasons for

the  failure  of British industry in recent  years

have very cogently pointed out that the guilt  for

the failure of British industry can by no means be

attributed  to the British workers alone.  British

entrepreneurs have also been seriously  guilty  of

hampering  industrial productivity and  efficiency

by  persistent  use  of  obsolete  and  antiquated

equipment, outdated management techniques  and  so

forth.  Surely, something must be done  to  ensure

that the employers also on their part remove



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



obstacles to increased productivity and industrial

efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be appreciated that this Bill will fail

to  achieve its objectives if only the workers are

expected  to sweat their guts out in an effort  to

increase  productivity when they clearly  will  be

inhibited from making their contribution  if  they

are  expected to do so on the basis of  antiquated

equipment  and outdated production techniques.  To

many   employers,  particularly  local  employers,

increased productivity is of less concern to  them

than  increased profits. They can  be  assured  of

increased  profits without increased  productivity

if  workers  are expected to sweat out their  guts

for  them.  But  managements  themselves  make  no

significant    contribution   towards    increased

productivity and industrial efficiency through the

use  of  modern  equipment and  modern  production

techniques.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be an appropriate moment for me to

throw  out  this  challenge to  the  employers  of

Singapore. Subject to certain amendments  to  some

of  the  provisions  of the  Bill  which  will  be

introduced  at a later stage, the National  Trades

Union Congress accepts the objectives of the Bill.

We  are ready to be patriotic and to discharge our

patriotic  obligations  for  a  better  and   more

prosperous Singapore. When it comes to the crunch,

the  Government knows that it will have to  depend

largely  on  the  patriotic  sentiments   of   our

workers.  All  our  stakes are in  Singapore.  The

workers  cannot run away in moments of  crisis  to

more  prosperous countries. By and large, we shall

stand  or  fall with Singapore and are, therefore,

ready  to  make our contribution. But I  challenge

the   employers  of  Singapore,  especially  local

employers,  to state whether they will accept  the

spirit of this legislation and will make the  same

patriotic contribution as the workers are expected

to  do.  By all means, let them make their profit,

for  profitability is a legitimate motive. But are

they prepared to plough back a substantial portion

of their profits into re-investment for industrial

expansion?  Will they be prepared to  get  rid  of

obsolete



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



machinery and antiquated production techniques and

take   to   modern   machinery  and   methods   of

production? If they are prepared to do this,  then

the  workers and the Government of Singapore  will

be able to respect them as being motivated more by

patriotism   than   by   mere   consideration   of

profitability. But if our local employers  do  not

do  this, then their patriotism must be subject to

serious doubt. In that event, they will show that,

unlike  the workers, they cannot be depended  upon

in  a  moment of crisis. In other words,  when  it

comes  to  the real crunch, they will be  men  who

will  be  ready to leave the sinking ship and  fly

off elsewhere with their ill-gotten gains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I throw out this challenge in this Chamber, the

supreme  legislature  of our  Republic,  to  local

employers  in the name of the workers of Singapore

and  in  all  seriousness. Let them answer  it  in

clear and categorical terms. I am certain that the

workers  of  Singapore will prove  ready,  by  and

large,  to  discharge Their patriotic obligations.

But we would like to know publicly how and in what

manner  the  employers propose to discharge  their

obligations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While accepting the major premises on which this

Bill  has  been  formulated, I must, nevertheless,

question the need for some of the provisions in it

and  the  validity  of  the  reasons  advanced  in

support  of these provisions. The most glaring  of

the objectionable parts are clauses which seek  to

reduce  certain  vital  terms  and  conditions  of

service  to  below the minimum level  set  by  the

former colonial administration. This may be deemed

necessary    to   attract   foreign    investment,

especially from countries with archaic or anarchic

patterns  of  industrial relations. I  concede  to

this.  But  what I do not concede to is  that  the

Bill  in  its present form can achieve the purpose

for which it is intended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many factors govern a potential investor's

decision to come and set up shop in Singapore. One

of  them  is political stability. Another  is  the

cost of labour. We must remember that the cost  of

labour is not governed solely by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



the level of wages and the kind of fringe benefits

given.  It is also measured by efficiency, by  the

morale  of the men labouring on the factory floor,

and  how much effort they are prepared to put into

their work to produce not only in quantity but  in

quality  as  well.  It is measured  by  individual

enthusiasm  and it can be lowered by  frustration,

restlessness and the governing conviction that the

worker  is being exploited. Singapore workers  are

neither  unruly nor pampered. Official  statistics

should  prove this. But even if they  were,  would

you  attract  investment merely by  offering  such

labour on the cheap? Naturally not. But what could

be attractive to many businessmen worth their salt

is labour which is efficient, enthusiastic and, in

terms  of  wages  and fringe benefits,  reasonably

priced. For this reason, though I support the move

to  standardise working conditions for  the  blue-collar  and  white-collar workers at a level  that

will  attract new enterprises, I question the need

to  regard such standardisation as an exercise  to

set the limit for one and all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing economies it is a fact of life that

there are "rich" industries and "poor" industries.

Let  us be practical and regard new industries  as

the   poor   ones.  That,  of  course,  need   not

necessarily  be  the  same.  But  the   rich   and

established industries are rich industries.  There

is  no getting away from that. It is equitable  to

ask  workers  to tighten their belt and  sacrifice

merely  to  enhance  the  profit  of  these   rich

industries. There would be a rationale  for  doing

this  if  there  were  machinery  to  ensure  that

savings in cost, by reducing benefits for workers,

would  be channelled 'directly into expansion  and

diversification that would create  more  jobs  for

local  people.  And  I  stress  the  words  "local

people".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other considerations. One, how can

we  be  sure that expansion or diversification  is

not  already  dictated by natural  growth  in  the

business, which should rightly be financed by  the

owners  or  from  company  reserves,  rather  than

subsidised further by reductions in the  share  of

profit allotted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



to  the workers? Two, how can we be sure that  the

savings  in cost from reduction of fringe benefits

under the proposed legislation will not be used to

enhance the terms and conditions of executives who

are  happily  outside the scope of the  Employment

Bill? There is no such machinery. Perhaps it would

not   be  in  the  best  interest  of  Singapore's

investment promotion programme to try  to  set  up

such machinery which might scare some of the weak-hearted among the potential investors. Workers are

prepared  to make sacrifices for the Republic.  We

do   not   expect  foreign  capitalists  to   make

sacrifices  for  Singapore. They should  come  and

make  money and prosper just as we hope  Singapore

will prosper along with them. But we do expect our

Parliament and our Government to make every effort

to  ensure that sacrifices will be called for from

Singaporeans only where necessary and  that  their

sacrifices will not be in vain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this House moves into Committee stage, a

colleague   from  the  trade  unions   will   move

amendments   to   the   Employment   Bill.   These

amendments have been framed after most careful and

heart-searching consideration. We have taken  into

account  the overall interest of the Republic  and

the  difficult economic challenges facing us  all.

We   in   the  trade  unions  have  decided   that

adjustments  must  be made and that  workers  must

rise to the occasion. At the same time, we believe

that  certain safeguards are fundamental and lines

must   be  drawn  to  distinguish  sacrifice  from

sacrilege.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not here as responsible leaders of a trade

union   movement   to   sloganise   against    the

shortcomings of this Employment Bill. We are  here

to  point out constructively to the Government how

it  can better achieve its purpose as outlined  by

the Minister for Labour in this House yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for instance, the provision of

hospitalisation  under  clause  44  of  the  Bill.

Hospitalisation leave, as the Bill  proclaims,  is

to be limited to 28 days.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



No  matter  how seriously ill a person is  or  how

seriously injured he may be through any event,  he

would  only  be paid for 28 days in the  hospital.

Would  the  Minister  for  Labour  also  care   to

legislate that a broken leg or a broken hand of  a

worker  must be mended by the doctor  in  28  days

flat?  If  assurances can be  given  by  the  Hon.

Minister  for Health that his doctors  would  cure

every  serious  ailment inside the  period  of  28

days, then we, on our part, will willingly concede

to   have  28  days  as  the  maximum  period  for

hospitalisation. I do not know  by  what  rule  of

medical  science the Minister for Labour has  come

to the conclusion that miracles can be achieved in

hospital within 28 days. From the employers' point

of view, this would be a most desirable feature of

the  Bill for the simple reason that after 28 days

of  hospitalisation, they need no longer pay a man

his wages. Assuming that the sole bread-winner  in

a  family  is being hospitalised for two or  three

months,  does the Minister for Labour not  realise

that  the man's family would have to queue  up  at

the  Social Welfare Department for dole after  the

28-day period is over? Perhaps the alternative  to

this  could be for the hospitalised man to  return

to his employer, medically half or quarter fit for

duty.  In what way will this increase productivity

and  efficiency and be an added incentive for  the

employer  is once again a closely guarded  mystery

that only the Minister for Labour can reveal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other equally ridiculous provision on which a

lot  has been said by my colleagues in this  House

is clause 15 of the Bill. Suffice it for me to say

that  the  effect of this clause will be this.  If

someone reaches the age of 55, he will be  put  in

cold  storage  if  he  is unfortunate  not  to  be

employed  by someone else. On the other  hand,  we

are all bending backwards to improve the skills of

our  citizens with experience. On the other  hand,

we  are advocating a complete wastage of skill  by

legislating  against people who are  mentally  and

physically fit to work beyond the age of 55.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for instance, the question of annual leave.

Whilst I welcome the attempt to standardise annual

leave for industrial and non-industrial workers, I

feel  that  the Government must have a  very  good

reason to divide annual leave into two categories,

namely, 7 days for workers with less than 10 years

of service, and 14 days for workers with more than

10  years of service, the principle being that  an

older worker needs a longer holiday than a younger

person setting out on a career. At present, in the

private  sector clerical workers enjoy  an  annual

leave going up to 21 days per annum. This has been

the   result  of  free  negotiations  between  the

employers  and  the trade unions.  The  Industrial

Arbitration  Court  has  in  a  number  of  awards

accepted this as a pattern and there have been  no

significant complaints from the employers. Perhaps

the  Government's  reason  for  shortening  annual

leave is to give an incentive to employers. If  it

is not so, why does the Government not think of  a

three-tier system whereby all employees can  enjoy

a maximum of 21 days' annual leave after they have

put  in,  say, 15 years of service?  I  think  the

Government,  as  a  large  employer,  has   always

accepted this principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, there are other provisions in the Bill

which  have  been introduced merely in  the  blind

hope  that it would serve as an incentive  to  the

employers  and not for any well-defined or  cogent

reasons.  My  other colleagues in the trade  union

movement, during the course of the debate on  this

Bill, will touch on the other provisions, such  as

annual bonuses in the private sector and so on. In

short,  far from sloganising on the ills  of  this

Bill,  we  will, when this debate ends,  make  the

House  realise that certain provisions are utterly

unnecessary  for  the aims and purposes  that  the

Bill proposes to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Minister for Labour

had  occasion to warn employers against the misuse

of  the provisions of this Bill. In fact, he  even

drew  their  attention to his ability in  wielding

the  stick.  We  in  the  trade  union  world  are

grateful to him for this timely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



warning.  But  we  must point  out  that  had  the

Minister   not  harboured  any  fears   that   the

employers would indeed react in a manner different

from  what was really intended, then he would  not

have  had  occasion to issue this severe  warning.

Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the knowledge that

prevention  is  always better than cure,  I  would

most  sincerely urge the Government to re-consider

some  of  the  harsher  provisions  in  the  Bill,

particularly  if these will not serve  the  larger

interest of the community at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister also indicated yesterday that

the Government will be making amendments to clause

38  to  ensure that where an employee  working  in

essential   services  of  the  Government   or   a

statutory board is required to work part of a rest

day, he shall only be entitled to part of a day in

substitution. Sir, we agree that work essential to

the  community must be carried on every day of the

week. But we must point out that if an employee is

called upon to work on part of his rest day,  then

his rest day or holiday is completely spoiled.  If

this  amendment is proposed, the trade unions will

request  that if an employee is asked to  work  on

part  of his rest day, he should be entitled to  a

complete  day  off in lieu. We are confident  that

the Government will be magnanimous enough to grant

this request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill has no doubt placed

restrictions on trade union practices in obtaining

fringe  benefits,  but the  trade  unions  in  the

private sector are free to enter into negotiations

with  the  employers for better  wages.  But  what

about  the employees in the public sector? In  the

past  few years, every claim of the civil  service

for  wage  adjustments or removal of anomalies  in

the salary structure of the civil service has been

brushed aside and the civil service has been  told

to  wait  for the findings of the Harvey  Salaries

Commission. The Commission's recommendations  have

been in the hands of the Government for some time.

What  is  the  intention of  the  Government  with

reference   to   the  recommendations?   Are   the

recommendations going to cold storage, or is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



Government  going  to  accept  them?  I  hope  the

Minister concerned will make a statement  on  this

during  the  course of this debate.  We  from  the

trade  unions  vote  for the  Bill  but  with  the

amendments  we propose, and I am sure  this  House

will  not  fail  to  note  that  the  trade  union

movement has responded positively to the call  for

sacrifice. All we ask in return is that this House

and  the  Government think again on  some  of  the

objectionable  provisions  so  that  this  Act  of

Parliament  will be a law based  not  on  a  panic

decision  but on a rational analysis  of  what  is

best for Singapore at this particular time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

posterity  will  either look upon this  Employment

Bill as the Magna Carta of industrial Singapore or

it  will simply dismiss it as an Act full of sound

and fury, signifying nothing. My only hope is that

posterity will not also add that it was a  classic

example  of  men  who  did  not  understand  their

fellowmen. Sir, we are dealing with human  beings,

not   mere   figures,  and   it   is   upon   this

understanding, or the lack of it, that the success

or failure of this Bill would very much depend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, first, let me hasten to add that I support

the  proposition  that the  Bill  is  a  necessary

alternative  to  what really amounts  to  national

suicide,  for  it is clear to all of  us  that  we

cannot maintain the status quo any longer. And the

status  quo by any standard, whether in developing

or  developed  economies, is  grim,  a  continuing

unemployment  problem  in an expanding  population

and  an  inadequate  rate  of  growth  of  foreign

markets for our manufactured goods; a loss  of  15

per  cent of the Gross National Product after  the

withdrawal  of the British troops, and  an  almost

insatiable  need  for new investments.  These  are

formidable problems of this island Republic devoid

of  the economic buffers of a big nation with land

and natural resources. To keep the status quo without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



redoubling  our efforts  would  result  in  a

situation  very similar to the one which prevailed

in  the mid l950s. For it must mean that if  every

other  person  in  the street is  unemployed  and,

worse  still, because of our education  policy  an

educated   unemployed,  then  social  unrest   and

discontent  would increase. In such  a  situation,

there  is no doubt as to how far and how well  the

Communists  could capitalise. Only  this  time  it

would  be  greatly  different. There  will  be  no

British  air  power or sea power to  deter  anyone

inclined  to fish in troubled waters. This  could,

therefore,  mean our second phase of  colonisation

or  our  last  experience of peace, stability  and

relative  plenty. It is in this context  that  the

long-term view of this Bill should be tested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to set above all other things a

new  order, a new pattern of relationships between

Government, labour and management for the  future.

Its  over-riding intention is the  eradication  of

weaknesses and abuses in the present system of our

labour  relations. Let those who are now fortunate

to  be  in employment remember that without  sound

labour and economic conditions, their own jobs are

insecure. Let those who are union members remember

that  they  form  but a minority of  workers.  Let

everybody  remember  that widespread  unemployment

jeopardises  not only law and order but  the  very

social order for which so many have worked so long

and so hard. This Bill will also create employment

opportunities, increase productivity  and  attract

investment.   These   are   all   very   desirable

objectives which must find full support  not  only

from  this  House but also from all citizens.  But

good intentions alone are not good enough. We  are

dealing   with  the  mechanics  of  a  law   which

purportedly  embraces these good  intentions.  The

mechanics,  therefore,  must  stand  the   closest

scrutiny to bear evidence that the good intentions

would in fact be applied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now touch on certain clauses of the

Bill? In clause 15, from the employers' angle, the

misgiving on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



this  provision is that it is too wide. It  covers

everybody  employed  in  Singapore,  as  the  word

"person"  is  used  in  this  clause  instead   of

"employee". This will cover any person from a peon

to  a  managing  director. If this clause  is  not

amended and if it is applied rigidly, then instead

of  increasing  productivity,  we  may  create   a

reverse effect. For example, we are still short of

very  skilled  personnel for  our  industries.  We

cannot afford at this juncture to retire them  off

when they are still fit to work after 55 years  of

age.  The concept behind this provision is a sound

one,  as  the object is to get rid of unproductive

persons   and  those  in  "soft"  jobs.  In   many

collective  agreements, there are  provisions  for

retirement  at  55. But there are also  provisions

for  retirement benefits to be given. However,  in

the  very  large  majority  of  small  businesses,

especially the family type businesses,  there  are

no such provisions. An old employee may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



be  related  to  the employer and  most  of  these

people,  as in the small Chinese businesses,  live

on the premises. If such people were to be retired

at  the age of 55, they would have no place to go,

let alone the means to earn a livelihood. To allay

the  fears of uncertainty and insecurity among our

older workers, this clause must be removed. In any

case,  any  sensible employer will not  employ  an

inefficient and unproductive worker.
