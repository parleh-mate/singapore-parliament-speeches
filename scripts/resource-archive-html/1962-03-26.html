<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  I  beg to move, "That the Bill be now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at present 14 harbour pilots who are self-employed.

Arrangements are now being made for  pilotage

to  be taken over by a proposed new Port Authority.  The

target  date for this takeover is 1st January, 1963.  In

order  to maintain an efficient service when the  pilots

are employed by the Port Authority, it is estimated that

it will be necessary to employ 35 pilots. The Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



Harbour  Board, as the forerunner of the  proposed  Port

Authority,  has  since October last year  recruited  and

trained 17 pilots, of whom 14 have already been licensed

by  the  Pilot Board. These pilots are directly employed

by  the  Harbour Board, and by the time of the takeover,

all  pilots,  including those pilots  at  present  self-employed and who elect to remain in service, will be  in

the employ of the Harbour Board or the Port Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part X of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, which deals

with  pilotage, does not provide for any  limitation  of

liability  for loss or damage occasioned by any  act  or

default of a pilot whilst engaged in his duties; neither

does  the  Ordinance provide protection front  liability

for  the  pilot's  employment. Now  that  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board is employing pilots, it is  necessary  to

amend  the  Merchant Shipping Ordinance to  protect  the

Harbour Board and the pilots it employs from claims  for

damages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other parts of the world, pilotage authorities

employing  pilots are covered either by  being  able  to

limit their liability or by exempting themselves of  any

liability, in  the  United Kingdom, this  liability  is

limited  to £100 multiplied by the number of  pilots  in

the  pilotage  district. The Bombay Port  Trust  is  not

liable  to  pay  any damages. The pilots in  the  United

Kingdom  are  enabled  by  legislation  to  limit  their

personal liability to £100 plus the pilotage fee for the

ship involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is therefore designed to enable a harbour

pilot  to  put  up  a bond of $1,000  and  his  personal

liability shall be limited to that amount and the amount

payable  to him for piloting the vessel. This Bill  also

provides  that  general employers, such as  the  Harbour

Board  at present, shall not be liable for any  loss  or

damage caused by a pilot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now  read

a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be recalled that in November 1960, the

Government  announced  its  intention  to  acquire   the

Singapore  assets  of  Cable & Wireless  Ltd, when  the

Company's  licenses expire, on 31st December, 1962,  and

to    merge   these   assets   with   those    of    the

Telecommunications  Department  to  form   a   statutory

telecommunications  board, at  the  same  time  allowing

Cable  & Wireless Ltd, to retain an interest in the  new

board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal and external communications existing in

the  State  of Singapore are held under the  control  of

three     separate    organisations,     namely,     the

Telecommunications Department, Cable & Wireless Ltd, and

the  Singapore  Telephone Board. The  Telecommunications

Department provides telecommunication services  for  the

public,  including  commercial  organisations,  and  for

Government   or   quasi-Government  organisations.   The

Singapore  Telephone Board operates  and  maintains  the

State's  internal telephone system, and Cable & Wireless

Ltd, operate and maintain a submarine cable  and  radio

circuits    associated   with   the   intra-Commonwealth

telegraph service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable & Wireless Ltd, operate in Singapore under the

following three licenses all of which are due to  expire

on 31st December, 1962:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Landing Licence issued in January 1939 permits

the Company "to maintain, renew



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



and  use  on  and  along the shore and bed  of  the  sea

specified  submarine telegraph cables at  Singapore  and

Penang (and also at Cocos Islands and Labuan).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The Cable Licence issued in November 1940

covers   the  use  of  underground  cables  inter-connecting   the   Company's   installations    in

Singapore, Penang and Labuan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The Wireless Telegraphic Licence issued in

December  1953 authorises the Company to establish

wireless telegraphy circuits between Singapore and

places  listed  in the Schedule  attached  to  the

Licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the licences of Cable & Wireless Ltd, expire at

the  end  of  this  year, we have to  reach  a  decision

whether  a  new lease should be given to the Company  or

whether  the Government should take over the assets  and

functions of the Company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communications system of any country is one of its

most   vital   assets  and  this  aspect  is  especially

important  in  respect  of  external  communications.  A

natural development is for independent or self-governing

countries  to  acquire  the  control  of  the   nation's

communication  facilities  in  order  to  develop   such

facilities    in   accordance   with   the    countries'

requirements and also to maintain the prestige value  of

the  external  communications. Furthermore,  it  is  not

desirable     or    efficient    that    the     State's

telecommunications  services  should   be   run   by   a

government  department on the one  hand  and  a  private

company   on  the  other.  It  was  therefore  not   the

Government's  intention that Cable &  Wireless  licences

should  be  renewed  on their expiry on  31st  December,

1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it was realised that because of the

large  initial capital outlay involved and the  shortage

of   experienced  engineers  and  managerial  staff   in

Government service, it was not expedient at this  moment

to acquire



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



outright  the  assets  of  Cable  &  Wireless  Ltd, in

Singapore,  or  to take over the existing functions  and

organisation of the Company. It was estimated  that  the

assets   of   the  Company  in  Singapore  amounted   to

approximately  $8¼ million. It was  therefore  decided

that  the best arrangement would be to merge the  assets

of  the Telecommunications Department, which amounted to

approximately  the same value, with  those  of  Cable  &

Wireless Ltd, and to form a statutory board to take over

the  combined assets and the existing functions  of  the

two organisations. This statutory Board will be known as

the "Singapore Overseas Telecommunications Board".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed integration will not involve the

Government  in a large capital outlay as  would  be  the

case  if  the  assets  of Cable  &  Wireless  Ltd, were

purchased  outright. It is estimated that  approximately

$300,000  only will be required as Government's  capital

contribution towards the Board's initial expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This partnership with Cable & Wireless Ltd, is to last

ten  years,  after which the Government  will  have  the

option   to   terminate  or  vary  the  joint  ownership

arrangement  by  giving  two  years'  prior  notice   in

writing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that Government will own 51 per cent

of  the  undertakings of the Board and the Company  will

own  the  remaining 49 per cent. Thus,  Government  will

have  control  over the activities of  the  Board.  This

control by Government is further emphasised in that  the

Bill  provides that the Chairman and two members of  the

Board  will be appointed by the Government and that  the

Company  will appoint the remaining two members  of  the

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 10 relate to the transfer of officers of

the  Government  Telecommunications  Department  and  of

Cable  &  Wireless  Company to the new statutory  Board.

This  process of transferring personnel is a complicated

operation  as  the salary and terms of  service  in  two

different  departments have to be considered.  If  there

are two separate salary scales and terms of service for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



the  staff  of the proposed statutory Board, it  can  be

easily  imagined the difficulties which the  Board  will

run into. There will be difficulty in equating status of

staff,  and  at the same time differences  in  terms  of

service  will engender dissatisfaction among  the  staff

themselves. It is therefore necessary that there  should

be  a unified salary scheme and terms of service for all

members of the proposed statutory Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 is therefore so worded as to permit

discussions between the Board and staff members  of  the

Government Telecommunications Department and  the  staff

members of Cable & Wireless Company. The broad object is

that  such  staff  shall  not suffer  in  their  overall

conditions of service by reason of transfer, but  regard

to  be  had  with  the  conditions  of  service  of  the

Government  employees at the time of transfer.  In  this

way we hope a reasonable compromise can be achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 47 has the intention to train national staff

progressively  to take over more responsible  work  with

the  object  of  replacing  expatriate  staff.  Suitable

nationals  will  be  given the  opportunity  to  undergo

technical  training  in  the  United  Kingdom   at   the

Porthcurno  School of Cable and Wireless Ltd, or  other

suitable   technical   institutions   and   to    attend

administrative courses at the Company's head  office  in

London.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Sir, we are generally in

favour of the principles outlined in the Bill except  in

one respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has said that in regard to the

transfer  of  the  present  employees  of  Cable  & Wireless  Ltd,

to the Government service there might  be some  difficulty  over

the terms of service  and  salary scales.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the wording of clause 9 gives rise to such fears because -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has not

noticed  that  a notice of amendment has been  given  in

respect of clause 9 and I have received information that

the  Member  for  Anson has authorised  the  Member  for

Thomson to move that amendment. I suggest that the  hon.

Member's remarks would be better reserved for Committee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I reserve my remarks for

discussion on that clause. Generally, may I suggest that

when  it  comes to any possible differences of  opinion,

the  trade  unions concerned be consulted  and  that  no

unilateral  decision be imposed because in the  interest

of  Singapore  we  would  rather  see  disputes  settled

amicably than through strike action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>2.58 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 8 inclusive ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 7, line 19, to leave out "as near as may be

to" and insert "no less favourable than".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a certain amount of apprehension among

the  staff concerned about the way this clause has  been

worded.  I  think it is only proper that the  Government

should  give  an undertaking that no one will  suffer  a

loss as a result of this transfer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, "as near as may be to those they had previously

enjoyed"  does not necessarily mean that the  new  terms

are  going to be even identical. I believe it is grossly

unfair to tell these employees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



that they have no choice but to be transferred, and that

too on terms which may be less favourable. I submit that

"as  near as may be" is frightfully vague. I am  of  the

opinion that no locally engaged officer should have  his

remuneration  or other terms changed to his disadvantage

by  a transfer of this nature. I do not know whether the

intention  of Government is to effect comparable  terms,

but  clause 9 as it stands now gives ample room for  one

to  believe  that locally engaged staff will have  their

terms   changed  to  their  disadvantage   on   becoming

employees of the Board.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment is to safeguard the

interests  of  the employees to ensure  that  they  will

incur  no  loss.  I hope the Government appreciates  the

principle  in  effecting transfers  of  this  nature.  I

believe  it  has  an  obligation  to  guarantee  locally

engaged  staff  that  they shall be transferred  to  the

Board  only  on  terms that will not be less  favourable

than those which are in force at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we support the

amendment  because, as the clause stands, there  is  not

only room for doubt but a possibility for those who  are

trying to adjust the salaries to fix lower salaries than

those prevailing at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"as near as may be", Sir, may mean not up to or

beyond, but under. Now, people framing salary scales are

very  fond of round figures and naturally when, in round

figures,  the salary of the present employee goes  down,

no  doubt  from the point of view of the man  who  wants

tidy  figures it looks fine, but from the point of  view

of  the employee he feels that he has been given  a  bad

turn. I am sure the amount involved is so small that the

Government,  desiring  to  have  the  goodwill  of   the

workers,  will not in any way make them feel  that  they

have  been  penalised by the transfer.  I  am  sure  the

Deputy Prime Minister, when he says that in the transfer

the present employees should not suffer, surely would be

glad to accept this amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I must explain why the

words  "no less favourable than" have been left  out  of

this  clause and replaced by "as near as may be to".  In

the  original draft of the Bill, I myself suggested that

the  phrase  "no less favourable than" be  used  in  the

clause.  Subsequently the Government  side  had  several

discussions with Cable & Wireless Ltd, and we discovered

that  if the words "no less favourable than" were  used,

in  effect the new statutory Board would be placed in  a

predicament, for the reason that you would have a salary

scale  for  Government employees who are transferred  to

the  new  Board  and another salary scale  for  Cable  &

Wireless employees transferred to the new Board,  and  a

third  salary  scale  for new employees.  Now,  for  any

statutory  Board or any single employer  to  have  three

different  rates of pay for its employees  is  obviously

not  feasible. That is exactly what the Board  would  be

landed with if the words "no less favourable than"  were

used  in  clause  9.  Therefore, it is  obvious  that  a

compromise  has  to be achieved and this  compromise  is

attained by inserting the words "as near as may be".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give the undertaking that discussions with the staff

of both the Government Telecommunications Department and

the  staff of Cable & Wireless Ltd, will be held so that

the  terms  arrived  at  for transfer  will  be  to  the

satisfaction of all parties. It is not the intention  of

this  clause to do the workers in. Far from it. In fact,

may  I  point  out  that when the Oriental  Telephone  &

Electric Co. Ltd, was converted into a statutory  Board,

the Singapore Telephone Board, the terms of transfer  of

the  staff  of this Company to the Telephone Board  were

worded  similarly - "shall be deemed to be an officer  of

the Board at the same rate of pay and as near as may  be

on the same conditions as those on which he was employed

by  the  Company"? Now in the case of  the  transfer  of

personnel  from the O.T.E.C. to the Singapore  Telephone

Board, the exercise is relatively simple because  it  is

just merely transferring bodies from one department to a

new department. In other words, it is just a question of

change of name. But in the formation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Telecommunications Board, we have  an  exercise

where   staff  from  two  different  bodies  are   being

integrated and unfortunately the salary scales for these

two  departments  vary - they are  not  exactly  equal - and

therefore a happy mean will have to be struck.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in respect of drafting, I

think the Member for Thomson has failed to read on  from

where  he left off in this clause. Clause 9 states  that

the  employees who are transferred "shall be transferred

to  the service of the Board on terms as near as may  be

to  those  they had previously enjoyed and  such  terms,

which shall be determined by the Board, shall take  into

account  salaries and conditions of service  enjoyed  by

such officers when in the employ of the Government or of

the  Company." So that, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Board will

be under an obligation to take into account the salaries

enjoyed  by  the officers in Government at the  time  of

their transfer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I am not a lawyer but I

understand  that  cases  have  failed  because  of  some

technicality. Now, the wording to anybody here is clear,

that  "as near as may be" may be as near from the bottom

or  as  near from the top. And it can be interpreted  by

whoever  draws  up the salary scales that  it  does  not

preclude  that  "being as near from  the  bottom"  means

less. No doubt the Deputy Prime Minister has given us an

assurance,  but the interpretation of the clause  as  it

stands does not preclude the wrong interpretation  later

on.  I  wonder how he is going to get over that.  If  he

accepts the amendment proposed here, it will satisfy his

own     principle    and    preclude    any     possible

misinterpretation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Tanglin is now

embarking on a new career in his political life. He  may

be  the champion of workers and trade unions, and may  I

wish him all success in his rather belated start -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Fairer Park):</b> Therefore "you are a

Communist".



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - in this field of action. Now,

obviously he has not got a good start because in dealing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



with  this  question of future terms and  conditions  of

service of the Board, he starts off with something  that

the  Government is out to do the workers in, that if  we

want to equate it, we would not equate it by taking  all

the  terms together but what we want to do is to pay the

chap just a few dollars less than what he is entitled to

get. I mean this is really too childish an approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us imagine that it is stated that the staff

transferred  to  the Board shall receive  conditions  of

service  no  less favourable than they are now  getting.

Let  us  look  at  the  implications  of  that  sort  of

undertaking. Now, some of these persons are  members  of

the  Telecommunications Department, Divisions I, II, III

and  so  on. One of the purposes of office in Government

is  entitlement to holiday bungalows at low cost. If you

want to say no less favourable terms than what they  are

enjoying,  then the Board would be required  to  put  up

holiday  bungalows  on a scale and  at  places  no  less

lavish  than  those which the Government  is  providing.

Then  there are other conditions such as leave,  pension

rights, and so on. It is not possible in respect of each

and  every  item to give the employees  who  are  to  be

transferred treatment no less favourable than what  they

are  getting now without the Board being committed to  a

tremendous amount of capital expenditure. And  not  only

that. The staff of Cable & Wireless Ltd, may be enjoying

certain perquisites which the Government officers do not

get  and  which the Government are required,  after  the

transfer,  to give to their staff. If you  give  to  one

section of the staff, you must give to everybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the test to be applied whether or not fair play has

been  done  is  whether  taking  overall  conditions  of

service  justice has not been done. I say  it  is  quite

unnecessary  for  Members of the Opposition  to  pretend

that the Government is out to do the workers in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may perhaps briefly refer to another integration

exercise,  i.e.,  the integration of  the  City  Council

staff into the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



service. We did give an undertaking  that  they

will  be  transferred on terms no less  favourable  than

what  they  were then enjoying. And this has  meant,  in

practice,  that  the  former City Council  staff  remain

exactly  on their old salary scales, on their old  terms

of  service,  and integration is only an  organisational

one - in  the sense that they are put into some  positions

in   the   hierarchy   of   Ministries.   But   complete

integration, i.e., in the sense of having one  identical

salary   scale  for  all  officers  whether  they   were

originally in the Government or in the City Council,  is

not possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council was formerly a Government department,

and   although   there  were  divergences   of   working

conditions  between the City Council and the Government,

they  were not of such a major order of magnitude as  to

create  insoluble problems. But in the case of a private

company - although  I  have not  examined  in  detail  the

working  conditions in both Cable and Wireless Ltd, and

the  Telecommunications Department - I  say  it  would  be

quite  impossible in respect of each and every grade  of

staff  to  have treatment no less favourable  than  what

they  are getting now. All that we can aim for is  that,

taking all conditions of service together, they get fair

treatment. More than this, I think, we cannot  guarantee

them.  But  less  than this, we in  the  Government  can

assure that they will not get.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

cannot  understand why the Minister should say that  the

Opposition  pretends that the Government is  out  to  do

damage. The Opposition is not pretending. The Opposition

knows for a fact that the Government has done damage  to

its  civil servants, and, therefore, the Opposition does

not  rely  on  any assurance given by the Government  in

regard to any dealing by the Government of any employee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a very important point in trade unionism

that,  in any transfer from one service to another,  the

conditions  of  service  shall be  no  less  favourable.

Surely,  if  the Government says that we are  pretending

that  it is out to do damage and that it sincerely  does

not want to do damage, then why all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



this opposition to this amendment, which only means that

the  terms  and conditions of service shall be  no  less

favourable than what they have had before? The  Minister

says  that  it  is  not possible for  employees  in  the

Government to continue to receive privileges of bungalow

facilities  and what not, and that in the  case  of  the

Cable  and  Wireless employees, there might be employees

who  are being given certain conditions of service which

may  not  be  acceptable  to  the  Government.  But  the

Minister for Health and Law has clearly pointed out that

in  so  far  as  their own conditions of employment  are

concerned,  it shall be as near as may be. And  we  only

say  that  if  there  is no intention  on  the  part  of

Government  to  do  damage, then surely  the  Government

should  accept that the transfer shall be on  terms  "no

less favourable than".



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to say a few

words. First of all, I think the Minister for Health and

Law  has suggested that I have not read the other  parts

of  the  clause. Sir, I assure him that I have read  the

other parts of the clause. What it says here is that the

Board   shall   take  into  account  the  salaries   for

determining   the  new  terms.  Sir,   that   does   not

necessarily mean again, to say the least of it, that the

new  salaries  and new terms are going to be  identical.

Sir,  all  that the Deputy Prime Minister said was  that

because  there  are more than two salary scales  at  the

moment,  it  may be difficult to work out an arrangement

whereby  the  terms may not be less favourable.  Sir,  I

frankly  do not see any difficulty in this.  I  am  sure

Government Members will agree that that has happened  in

other  industries  and  in other establishments  in  the

past.  Whether  there is one salary  scale,  two  salary

scales or three salary scales, if we adopt the principle

of  converting so that no one receives terms  which  are

less  favourable than the old terms, we can easily  fuse

this  into one common salary structure. I am not  saying

that the Government is definitely going to do it to  the

workers.  What  I  am saying is that it  should  provide

safeguards to say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



the  salaries and other terms of service of the  locally

engaged   staff - I  am  not  concerned  about  expatriate

officers - be  ensured  and are not less  favourable  than

whatever they are enjoying at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am glad the Member for Thomson

has  at least agreed that on principle we should have  a

unified  salary scale for employees of the new statutory

Board.  It is pretty obvious that in order to arrive  at

this  new salary scale, the terms of clause 9 should  be

such as to enable the Board to discuss it with the staff

members in the Telecommunications Department and members

in  Cable and Wireless Ltd, so that this unified  salary

scale can be achieved. But the moment we insert the term

"no  less  favourable than", that means they  are  stuck

with  the  terms  and conditions which  they  have  now.

Therefore,  it is not possible to arrive  at  a  unified

salary  scale. As I have explained earlier to the House,

I  myself inserted in the draft Bill "no less favourable

than". But after listening to all sides, I was convinced

that  it  was not possible to proceed with the  transfer

with  this  phrase  "no less favourable  than".  Let  me

assure the House and staff members of Cable and Wireless

Ltd, and in the Telecommunications Department  that  we

want   this   telecommunications  service   to   proceed

smoothly,  just as the telephone system in Singapore  is

proceeding  smoothly under a statutory Board. Therefore,

an  opportunity  will be given for negotiations  between

the Board and the staff members.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read

a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to carry out yet another move towards

equality of status between men and women in our society.

Hitherto, the income of a wife has been aggregated  with

that  of  the  husband for taxation  purposes.  Taxation

authorities are wary about separating incomes  of  wives

from  those  of their husbands. Unless proper safeguards

are taken, separation of incomes for assessment purposes

can give rise to many opportunities for tax avoidance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is unfair that when a wife is

earning an income through her own efforts and in her own

right,  such  income  should be, for taxation  purposes,

considered  as accruing to her husband. This Bill  seeks

to  remove  this form of injustice hitherto  imposed  on

working wives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first be allowed to clarify the principles

underlying  the Bill, before going into the implications

of  the  separate clauses? This Bill provides that  only

the   earned   income  of  a  wife  shall  be   assessed

separately.  That is to say, the incomes from  property,

such   as  rent,  dividends,  interest  on  loans,  etc.

accruing to a wife shall continue to be aggregated  with

the  income of her husband. This is obviously  necessary

in  order to provide safeguards against large-scale  tax

avoidance. Where a wife works in the business carried on

by   her   husband,  and  this  business   is   a   sole

proprietorship or a partnership, she shall not  deem  to

have   earned  a  separate  income  except  in   certain

specified  profession.  The purpose  of  this  is  quite

clear.  We  do not want to allow a loophole whereby  the

husband can put the wife on the payroll of his business,

thereby reducing his total tax liability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, however, the wife has her own professional

qualifications as specified in clause 4  (b),  then  her

income  will  be separately assessed from  that  of  her

husband,   even  though  she  works  in  her   husband's

business.  This  list  of  professions  given   includes

doctors,  lawyers,  dentists, pharmacists,  accountants,

engineers  and architects. There may be wives  who  work

either as partners or employees in their husbands'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



private business, and where the wife is a duly qualified

professional,  she  should  be  entitled   to   separate

assessment  of  her  income. The  range  of  professions

listed  in  clause  4  (b) is fairly comprehensive,  but

there  may  be  the odd case in other professions  where

similar  treatment  is merited. I  therefore  intend  to

move, subject to your consent, Mr Speaker, Sir, and the

general  assent of Members present under Standing  Order

32, an amendment in Committee to allow the extension  to

other  professions. This would enable the Government  to

grant  similar  treatment  to  wives  working  in  other

professions than those listed in clause 4 (b). I do  not

know  whether  there are instances in other  professions

where  the  wife  is  a partner or an  employee  of  the

husband's  private  business.  It  is  conceivable,  for

instance, that a private medical practitioner may  marry

his  nurse. These things always happen in the Government

service.  If  such a thing happens in private  practice,

then I think the nurse deserves the same rights as women

in other professions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause, however, is not intended to be used

indiscriminately. It must be confined to professions  in

which  certain  standards are laid  down  and  observed.

Offhand,  I  can  think  of  professions  like  nursing,

teaching,  quantity surveying and valuation.  There  are

professional standards here and registration  procedures

which  will make the task of the Comptroller  of  Inland

Revenue easier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will be of benefit to all married women who

are  employed in establishments unconnected  with  their

husbands'  business. There are married  women  teachers,

doctors,  clerks, stenographers, architects and  so  on.

Professional  married women will enjoy this  benefit  of

separate  assessment  even if  they  do  work  in  their

husbands' business. But all married women, regardless of

their  profession, will enjoy this benefit if  they  are

not working in their husbands' business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses of the Bill are really consequential

to  clause 4. They are, intended to regulate the  manner

in which deductions in respect of relief on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



account of dependants should be calculated so as to

avoid double deduction for the same person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

agree  with  the  Minister that it is  unfair  to  treat

women's salaries as part of their husbands' salaries and

assess  them  as one. I am glad about this Bill.  But  I

cannot   understand   why  this  benefit   is   extended

especially  to professional women. What about  the  poor

wife  who works in her husband's shop, let us say, as  a

cashier  in  a  little provision shop and  who  probably

receives cash from her husband? Is not her value as much

as  if her husband had employed another girl who may not

be  as trustworthy as his own wife? Just because she  is

working  in her husband's shop and just because  she  is

not a professional, she is not to enjoy the benefits  of

this  Bill. What if she is her husband's typist, cashier

or  stenographer?  To add insult to  injury,  all  these

people are going to benefit if they do not work in their

husbands' firms. So the penalty is, firstly, if they are

not  professional, and secondly, if they work  in  their

husbands' firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking at this Bill it gives me the impression

that  it  is  going to benefit families  in  the  higher

income group. Let us take a clerk for instance who earns

$400,  and his wife is not working, compared with a  man

who  earns  $400 and his wife is earning $400.  Mr  A's

family  has to depend entirely on the $400 pay  and  yet

that family is given less relief than the family who  is

earning  $800 (husband $400 and wife $400). That  family

receives  more relief. I cannot understand the logic  of

this -  the more you earn the more relief you are  given,

an  extra  $1,000 to the wife. The argument is that  the

working  wife spends more. What about the home, not  the

wife, with a non-wage-earning wife? It spends more  too.

It  needs more, Sir, because it has less to spend.  Sir,

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



logic  that  the wife who goes out to earn  money  needs

more  money  to spend is very dangerous. The  Government

has just introduced equal pay for women, and equality for

women.  But while introducing equality between  men  and

women, they are now creating this disparity amongst  the

women  themselves. There are new anomalies  now  created

between  professional and non-professional  women,  non-professional  women who work in their  husbands'  firms,

non-professional  women  who  do  not  work   in   their

husbands'  firms,  and the non-wage-earning  wives.  All

these new anomalies are quite unnecessary and dangerous.

I  say  they are dangerous because at almost all  United

Nations  conferences, especially when  they  talk  about

juvenile  delinquency or the status of  women,  emphasis

has  always  been  laid  on  the  deplorable  fact  that

although the services of the non-wage-earning wife as  a

wife  and a mother in the home are of the highest value,

which cannot be replaced by any paid services, they have

never  been given recognition and the appreciation  that

they  deserve.  If this Bill is going through,  it  will

further  belittle such valuable services of a  wife  and

mother.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate to recall that in "The Tasks Ahead" of the

P.A.P. they described housework services rendered  by  a

wife  to  her husband, children and home as slavery  aid

drudgery of housework. They promised to free women  from

this slavery and drudgery. I was against it at that time

and I am still against it. I deplore this attitude. I am

surprised how the women on the Government Bencher  allow

these  terms to be used. I say categorically as a  woman

that the service we render our husbands is a service  to

love  to  the  family. A wife does not  deserve  to  be

called  a wife if she calls those services to her family

drudgery  and slavery. It is a service of  love  to  the

family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill emphasises the monetary value of the

services  of a woman to her family. It will destroy  the

beauty  and the glory of a woman's services that she  is

capable of rendering to her loved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



ones.  It tends to make the woman feel that, unless  she

can  contribute  financially  to  the  family,  she   is

inferior  to  the  wife  who can  do  so  and  therefore

deserves less to spend and needs less. It tends to break

the  family unit because money will be the criterion  of

decision. The wife's dignity and respect will depend  on

how  much  money she can bring home. Her value  will  be

measured by what financial contributions she is  capable

of making rather than, as it should be, by how much care

and  love  she is capable of giving and by what  a  good

mother or wife she makes in the home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me as a woman give this warning to the men

who  are  thinking  of  passing this  Bill.  Do  not  be

surprised -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> There

are also men on the other side!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> This warning is to all men who

have  wives who have been caring for them and  rendering

services  of love in their home, especially where  there

is  no  necessity for them to go out and work  and  earn

money: do not be surprised if the wives say, "All right,

if  that is the yardstick, I will go and work. You  look

after yourselves and the children because the real value

of a woman is how much she can earn."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Go on strike.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, this Bill is going to have a

bad  effect.  It  will  demoralise housewives.  I:  will

degrade the most important vocation of a woman, which is

her  services  to  her  husband and  children.  It  will

force - probably inadvertently - women to leave their  young

children  at  home and go out to work to keep  up  their

prestige especially when there is no need for them to do

so.  It  breaks the family unit because in future  money

will  be the yardstick by which her value to members  of

her family will be measured. You will agree with me, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that this is most undesirable.  All  this

put  together is going to disrupt the family.  When  the

family is disrupted and when women



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



start  thinking of their services to their husbands  and

children as drudgery and slavery, it is inevitable, that

juvenile delinquency will be on the increase.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking as a man

after a woman, I would like to say here -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Which woman are you after?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> After the woman who has spoken!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is better.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I find it difficult to understand

the  purpose  behind all this. Sir, in the first  place,

the  Government is proud to crow that it has reached  an

agreement  on  closer  association with  the  Federation

Government.  Paper  Cmd. 33 of 1961  sets  out  that  in

regard  to taxes it is Federal. May I therefore ask  the

Minister   whether   the   Government   has   had    any

consultations  with  the  Federation?  If  so,  is   the

Federation Government going to introduce a similar  Bill

in  order  to regularise the income tax laws  throughout

Malaya?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has touched on the family

unit.  I  want to touch on it too but from  a  different

angle - from  that of a man. In spite of what  the  P.A.P.

profess  insofar as culture is concerned, they  are  now

embarking  on  a scheme that is going to  break  up  the

family  unit. I remember, and I am sure all married  men

will  remember, what they and their brides said the  day

they got married: To cherish and to hold; what I have is

yours  and  what  you have is mine;  we  work  and  live

together for the good of the family. But now the  P.A.P.

say,  "Ah,  but  wives  who work belong  to  a  separate

class - the  P.A.P. class - because if you  work,  you  can

submit  a separate income tax form for assessment."  But

what is the benefit? Just $1,000 more and nothing else..

Instead  of  a  $1,000 allowance for the wife  which  is

allowed under her husband's income tax returns, it means

that  if a wife qualifies under the proposed legislation

she  is  entitled to a personal allowance of $2,000.  If

that is the case, why should the Government introduce  a

reduction from $2,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



to  $1,000  for wives in 1961? Why place  a  premium  on

women who go out to work against women who stay at  home

to  look after the family for the good of the family and

of  the country? Why? Is that culture? I myself as a man

would  place  a higher value on the woman who  stays  at

home  and looks after her family and her house. But  the

P.A.P. say, "No. If you go out to work, all right,  you

can  have your own income tax." All for a measly  $1,000

extra  allowance!,  That  is all - $1,000  extra  personal

allowance.  Instead  of $1,000  for  a  wife  under  her

husband's income tax returns, she will get $2,000 if she

submits her own separate income tax returns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again under clause 4, the Minister has brought

out this statement. "It is all right. The wife can claim

that  I  am  feeding six children and, the  husband  can

claim that he is feeding four children (if there are ten

children  in the house) so long as the husband  and  the

wife  do  not claim for the same children." Are  we  not

breaking  up the family? Are we not letting our children

know that it is the mother that looks after them and not

the  parents? Are we not trying to do that in this  way,

to  tell  your  children, "Your mother is looking  after

you.  Your father is no good. No, he cannot even  earn."

But  if there is a family, if it is intended and if they

really have their culture of a family unit -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is a family bonus.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - the Government should not try to

do  things which tend to disrupt the family unit. To say

that  a  wife  can  claim that she is  supporting  three

children  and the husband is supporting two so  long  as

there is no false claim is to suggest to the wife and to

the  husband that perhaps it might be better  to  divide

their  children just like common property. It cannot  be

done that way. You cannot deal with human beings in that

way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Nobody is suggesting that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If the Government are really sincere

in  saying  that  a married woman who  earns  should  be

allowed an extra $1,000 off, then why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



not  do it through the simple process of including  that

in  the  income tax returns of her husband? If the  wife

works, all right, $2,000 allowance; and if the wife does

not  work, $1,000 allowance. But why should there  be  a

difference? Even if the Government were to  do  that,  I

would  ask them, why there should be that difference  of

$1,000?  Does it mean that wives have a different  value

whether  they work or they do not work? What I  am  more

anxious  to know is this. Have the Government  consulted

the Federation Government in the light of Paper Cmd. No.

33 that the taxes are going to be Federal? If they have,

I  want  to  know whether they have been told  that  the

Federation    Government    will    introduce    similar

legislation. If they have not, I want to know why it  is

that  after  having  come to an agreement  with  another

Government in all honesty, they now do something to show

that they cannot be trusted, as we know that they cannot

be trusted.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

have  clarification  on  two points.  Firstly,  can  the

Minister assure us that the relief of $3,000 in the case

of  the  husband's  income for  his  wife  will  not  be

interfered with if his wife is not employed? Because  if

by  the  wife working the husband is penalised, then  of

course that would not be fair to the husband. I just ask

the Minister for clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 11th December, 1961, I raised the question of

income  tax relief for aged parents and the reply was - to

paraphrase it - that the Finance Minister had not  given

thought to that and that

in view of the fact that income tax legislation would be

a  Federal subject he would not give any thought to that

for  the time being. In view of the fact that he has now

brought up this amending Bill, I therefore infer that he

must  have  consulted  the Federal  Government  on  this

subject.  If  he  has done so, can  he  please  tell  me

whether  he has also consulted the Federation Government

as  regards  relief  for  aged  and  dependent  parents,

because in this country we do not have pensions for  old

people, whereas they have them in England?

astonishment   to   the  speech  of   the   Member   for

Mountbatten. Truly, Sir, you can never satisfy women!  I

was  all  the  time  wondering whether  we  should  have

proceeded  with  the wisdom of ever giving  anything  to

women.  However, I think she, in fact, deep down in  her

heart, fully approves of the principle of this Bill, but

party discipline having been imposed on her, she had  to

raise some objections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> A question, Sir, I would like to

inform the Minister that I am all in agreement with  the

Bill  except for the fact that wives who are not working

get less relief. I am suggesting that they should get as

much  relief in separate returns for income tax - a relief

of  $2,000  for women who are working. I am  asking  for

more.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They are never satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Well, there you are. You can never

satisfy them!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I will deal with the points that she raised, one by

one.  First,  the extension of benefits to  professional

women,  and  not  giving  them  to  all  wives  as,  for

instance,  the old lady who looks after a  sundry  shop.

Where  a  man runs a family business and the wife  takes

charge  of the till or the counter now and then,  it  is

clear  that  in such a family business it is  only  fair

that the income accruing to the whole business should be

treated  as one unit. That is a natural taxation entity.

The  other point is that you just let open loopholes for

a  terrific amount of tax avoidance, and that we are not

prepared to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point was raised about the effects of this Bill on

breaking  of  family units - demoralising housewives  and

forcing them to work. I cannot follow this logic. I have

listened  to  both  the Member for Mountbatten  and  the

Member for Cairnhill, and I cannot follow their logic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is a different line.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is quite

simple. This is nothing new tried out in other

countries. There has been no collapse of families and

institutions in those countries, and there is not going

to be any collapse or break-up of family spheres as a

result of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, all the three speakers, I think,

misunderstood the effect of this Bill. They thought that

the  only benefit this Bill would confer on the taxpayer

is to increase the personal allowances of working wives.

That  is not correct. When the income of a wife is taxed

separately, then both the husband and the wife will  pay

income,  tax  at  lower  rates, and  this  is  a  fairly

substantial benefit which they will get.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if you treat the wife as a separate

taxpayer,  naturally she will get the  full  benefit  of

personal allowances. Now it is not possible to give  the

assurance  which the Member for Tanglin sought - that  the

man  should  get personal relief even when his  wife  is

working.  That is a bit thick. You cannot  get  it  both

ways. If the wife is working, she `should be exempt from

taxation.  This is separate. This is set out clearly  in

clause  3 (a). This clause, in conjunction with section

39 of the principal Ordinance, sets out that if the wife

earns less than $1,000 a year, then what she earns  will

be deducted from the personal allowance. And, of course,

if  she  earns more than $1,000 a year, then the husband

gets no relief in respect of his wife.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin raised the question of tax

relief  for aged parents. I do not know whether I should

really reveal this to the House, but I did have a  brief

and informal discussion with the Minister for Finance in

the  Federation, and we both came to the conclusion that

there  is no case for proceeding with it. I am sorry  to

disappoint  the  Member  for Tanglin;  he  looks  a  bit

dejected, I thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for consultations with the Federation, we informed

the  Federation  of our intention to proceed  with  this

Bill and asked whether they would raise any objection.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



My Permanent Secretary brought up  the  matter

before  his  opposite  number  several  times,   and   I

personally wrote to the Finance Minister in Kuala Lumpur

asking  whether he had any objection. After a reasonable

passage  of  time,  we did not hear  from  them  and  we

proceeded with our own scheme. My understanding of  this

is  that they themselves have not made up their minds on

this  issue, but since we are proceeding with equal  pay

for  women,  it is logical that this measure  should  be

taken at about the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be  now  read a Second time." I have His Excellency  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara's recommendation that the Bill be

proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House may have read or heard a great

deal  about  what  is  now  termed  "mushroom  insurance

companies"  that  have been carrying on  life  insurance

business  both  in  Singapore and the Federation.  These

companies  are  not doing the type of business  normally

associated  with  life  insurance.  One  would  normally

associate a life insurance policy as being taken out  by

an  insured person to set aside a small portion  of  his

current income for the eventuality when there might be a

danger to his life. The insurance cover that is provided

will  enable  his  dependants to  have  some  protection

should  the  worst  happen  to  him.  Subsequently  life

insurance has developed into a form of saving money, and

many  people buy life insurance policies as  a  form  of

savings for their old age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mushroom insurance companies do not deal in this

type  of  insurance. Their business is more  a  form  of

gambling  and  swindling as their main  objective.  They

promise  a  fixed capital sum at the end of a period  of

years  to  anybody  who is prepared  to  pay  a  regular

monthly  premium. The attraction here is  that  anybody,

irrespective  of his age or physical condition,  can  be

insured.  The  gambling instincts  of  many  people  are

strong,  and the foolish and the avaricious are  thereby

induced  to  insure the lives of their aged or  decrepit

relatives in the hope of getting this capital sum  after

a  short  time. This form of life insurance  degenerates

into little more than gambling - the fortunes of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



the  gamblers  to  be determined by the  early  or  late

demise of their insured relatives or friends. There have

been  cases where more than 100 policies have been taken

out  on  the  life of one old man in the  family.  These

policies  may  be taken out on his life  either  by  his

children  or  by  other  relatives  or  even  by   total

strangers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mushroom insurance companies have exploited the

situation and have duped thousands of people who possess

strong  gambling  instincts and hope  to  make  a  quick

penny. These people do not realise that they are playing

into  the hands of unscrupulous racketeers who  have  no

intention  whatsoever of remaining in the  business  for

more  than the initial few years. The mushroom companies

begin their business by having runners working for  them

on  a  commission basis and selling as many policies  as

possible. Some of them do not even comply with  the  law

by  putting  the  required  $200,000  deposit  with  the

Accountant-General. One of the indications of  the  fact

that  they  have no intention to remain in the  business

can  be  gleaned  from the way the  premium  monies  are

collected. For a typical policy of $500 maturing at  the

end  of ten years, a person who buys as insurance policy

from  a mushroom insurance company pays $5 entrance fee,

$3  annual  registration fee and $3 monthly  premium.  A

policy can be taken out for anybody irrespective of age,

sex  and  physical  condition.  No  medical  examination

whatsoever  of  the  insured person  is  necessary.  The

person  who buys a policy needs to do very little except

pay  the necessary fee and monthly premiums. Often  even

the   proposal  forms  are  completed  for  him  by  the

insurance company's agents. The first payment he has  to

make  is a total of $11. This whole sum is not collected

and  paid into the insurance company, for in its  effort

to  sell  as many policies as possible, it has to  offer

attractive commission rates to its runners;  and  so  $8

out  of the first $11 is pocketed by the agents who sell

the  policy  and  the  company  gets  only  $3.  Of  the

subsequent  collections  of $3  per  month,  the  agents

sometimes get as much as 30 to 40 per cent. By any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



actuarial  assessment, the amount of premiums  collected

by the insurance company cannot provide the insured with

a  capital  of $500 at the end of ten years. It  is  not

likely that the mushroom insurance company can remain in

business for long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Federation of Malaya, many mushroom companies

came  to  life  towards  the latter  part  of  1960  and

continued  until a stop was put to them by a  Federation

legislation  introduced in October 1961. By  this  time,

there  had  already  been  in  existence  more  than  50

mushroom  companies. There were certain companies  which

were  not even registered, but were nevertheless issuing

insurance policies until the law caught up with them. In

Singapore,  there  are 17 registered companies  of  this

type - l4  of them being branches of Federation  companies

and  three being incorporated in Singapore - with $200,000

deposited with the Accountant-General. The Government is

of the view that this type of insurance companies should

be prevented from further cheating the people. An effort

should  be  made  to  assist the poor  people  who  have

purchased  insurance  policies  to  seek  some  form  of

redress, and, if possible, to recover a portion of their

payment.  The  problem is a very big  one.  Hundreds  of

thousands  of  policies  have  been  issued  by  various

mushroom   companies.  The  Federation  Government   has

brought   in  legislation  to  wind  up  these   unsound

companies. I have obtained agreement from the Federation

Government   that  the  claims  of  policy  holders   in

Singapore  against  the  Federation  companies  will  be

treated  in  the  same manner as those held  by  Federal

citizens.  Although  this  generous  attitude  has  been

adopted  by the Federation Government, I would not  like

to  raise  the  hopes  of Singapore  policy  holders  or

beneficiaries. They must realise that they have ventured

into a most unprofitable form of investment. What little

asset  may  be left by the mushroom insurance  companies

would constitute in most instances only a small fraction

of  the  money  that has been mulcted  from  the  policy

holders during the period of operation. The monies  that

have been paid by the insured or the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



beneficiaries  have  been divided  between  the  agents,

collectors  and various directors and employees  of  the

company.  Nevertheless, it is necessary that  action  be

taken   to  terminate  the  activities  of  the  unsound

insurance companies operating in the State and to ensure

that  these  rackets are stopped once and for  all.  For

this  reason,  the Life Assurance Companies  (Compulsory

Liquidation) Bill is now before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moving this Bill on a Certificate of Urgency

to enable the Government to deal with mushroom companies

in  the  State effectively and to offer some redress  to

the  poor  policy holders from any assets that would  be

realised. Under the provisions of the Bill, the Minister

may  compel mushroom companies to furnish him  within  a

period  of  seven  days with the rates of  premium  they

charge  for  policies issued. If the premium  rates  are

found  to  be  inadequate  or  determined  without   any

actuarial basis, they, as well as those companies  which

have  not complied with the Minister's notice, shall  be

considered  unsound, and the Minister may  petition  the

court to wind up these companies. This liquidation shall

be  carried  out  by the liquidators  appointed  by  the

court.  They will be empowered to seize and realise  the

assets  of  the company under liquidation and distribute

them  on  a  pari  passu basis with  creditors  who  can

establish  proper claims. In doing so, priority  payment

shall  be accorded to claims established by persons  who

have  paid  premiums to this company.  In  other  words,

policy  holders of this company shall get first priority

on the claims to the assets of this company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also ensure that in future only life

insurance  companies which can satisfy  certain  minimum

standards of actuarial and business rationality will  be

allowed  to continue to operate or to start business  in

the  State.  The  Bill now presented  contains  parallel

legislative  provisions  incorporated  in  two  of   the

Federation   of   Malaya  Insurance  Acts   which   were

introduced   in   October   1961   and   February   1962

respectively.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain minor amendments, however, have been made in

the  light  of  experience in the  Federation,  both  to

facilitate  the  winding  up  and  liquidation  of   the

mushroom  companies  and to meet local  conditions.  The

amended  or additional provisions of the Bill  are  sub-clauses  (4), (5) and (6) of clause 7. This would  cater

for  the situation where mushroom companies are  in  the

process  of  voluntary liquidation.  The  Government  is

aware  that it could be possible, because of  the  terms

laid  down  in insurance policy, that the policy  holder

would  find difficulty in establishing his valid  claim.

It  would,  therefore, be to the interest of the  policy

holder for the company to be wound up in accordance with

the provisions of the present Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clauses (4) and (5) of clause 8 will provide that

the claims of the policy holders are given priority.  We

are aware that the assets of the insurance companies are

not likely to be sufficient to meet all claims, and that

very probably only a small proportion of the claims  are

likely  to  be  met.  Hence it is  decided  that  policy

holders should have first priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 enables the Minister to make rules for

carrying out the provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends the existing Life Assurance Companies

Ordinance  (Chapter 178) to provide for an  increase  of

penalty  for  persons  who  fail  to  comply  with   the

provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of this Bill will be threefold. First, it

will  enable  a  stricter control to be  exercised  over

insurance companies. Second, it will enable the Minister

to  declare certain insurance firms which cannot  comply

with  the requirements of clause 7 as being unsound  and

to  order  their winding up. Lastly, it will enable  the

liquidator to realise the assets of these companies  and

to   distribute  them  in  accordance  with  the  claims

received, but with priority being given to those of  the

policy holders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we welcome the provisions

of  this  Bill,  particularly that aspect  of  it  which

concerns  itself  with  the  compulsory  liquidation  of

certain mushroom life assurance companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill seems to deal with two

aspects  of  the problem. The first aspect  is  that  it

seeks  to amend certain provisions of the Life Assurance

Companies Ordinance (Chapter 178) which, as I see it, is

a  permanent statute intended to deal with all bona fide

life assurance companies, whereas the main impetus given

to  the  Bill before the House, I take it, was by  these

mushroom companies coming into operation; as a result of

which  it  is necessary to compulsorily liquidate  these

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would have welcomed two Bills on

this - one dealing with permanent amendments to, if I  may

say   so,   a  permanent  Ordinance  and  a  Liquidation

Ordinance dealing specifically and particularly with the

mushroom companies in respect of which this Bill  really

seeks to proceed against. On the aspect of the companies

which  this  Bill seeks to liquidate, I find  myself  in

sympathy with the Finance Minister in rushing this  Bill

through  because the problem is one of urgency,  and  we

ourselves from this side of the House have been pressing

the  Government  to take immediate action  against  such

companies. But there is this position where the Bill was

presented  to the Opposition, I understand, at  about  3

o'clock:  I  was not in the House when it was presented.

But  may  I suggest to the Minister - I do appreciate  the

urgency for this Bill - that if this Bill had been given

to  us say on Sunday (or Saturday afternoon, if that was

possible),  it  might have served  the  purpose?  But  I

derive  some solace because this Bill follows to a  very

large extent the Federation Liquidation Ordinance which,

I  take  it,  was  also promulgated to  meet  a  similar

difficulty  in  the  Federation. So probably  from  that

point of view, the objections of presenting this Bill in

the  manner in which it has been presented are not  very

substantial. But I do suggest to the Government that the

major



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



problems  arising from these mushroom companies probably

stem  from  the fact that the provisions of the  present

Life   Assurance  Companies  Ordinance  have  not   been

utilised to the fullest possible extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I was surprised to hear the Finance

Minister  say  that in some cases not even the  $200,000

deposit  required  by the Assurance Companies  Ordinance

had  been  extracted  from these companies  before  they

started business. If I heard the Minister correctly -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Branches.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Branches - I beg your pardon. Even then, Mr

Speaker, Sir, if that was so, probably there is a hiatus

in  the  law.  Any foreign company - and it is  a  foreign

company  which  establishes its branch  here - seeking  to

carry  on  an insurance business here, having registered

itself  probably  under section  301  of  the  Companies

Ordinance or probably registered itself under  the  Life

Assurance  Companies Ordinance, -should,  by  that  law,

have been made to pay the $200,000 here rather than rely

on  the $200,000 paid in the Federation. Possibly there

is  a  hiatus  in  the law. I have not looked  into  the

Ordinance, but I would have done so if I had  notice  of

this  earlier.  It  did surprise me  to  hear  from  the

Minister  that  it  was possible for  a  life  insurance

company   which  .was  possibly  incorporated   in   the

Federation   of  Malaya  to  start  business   in   this

commercial  city of ours and extract a lot  of  premiums

without  paying the minimum deposit which the Government

thought  was  necessary before it was let loose  on  the

unsuspecting public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than that, I have no comments. I have hurriedly

looked  through this Bill and the clauses that  are  new

seem to be matters which I think are improvements on the

Federation Bill. On that score, I have nothing  to  say.

But  I do hope that the provisions of this Bill will  be

carried  out to their fullest possible extent, that  the

culprits  will be brought to book and that the  severest

punishment possible under the law be `meted out to  them

because they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



been  making use of the gullibility of the poor citizens

of  Singapore to enrich themselves. Such people are  not

deserving of sympathy or mercy and the Government should

proceed  against  them  to the fullest  possible  extent

under the law.



<br><br>4.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

understand that many years ago we had a similar mushroom

growth  of bogus life insurance companies. Therefore,  I

fail  to understand why when we had this mushroom growth

in  1960  the  Government had failed to  take  immediate

action and warn the public against investing their whole

life savings in these bogus life insurance companies. We

understand that there is a Commercial Crimes  Branch  of

the  Police  Department. I do not know  whether  it  has

brought   to   the  attention  of  the  Government   the

activities  of these bogus life insurance companies.  If

it  has,  then  it  is  a crime and  a  failing  of  the

Government in not having taken action one or  two  years

back.  After the citizens of Singapore have  lost  their

life  savings in the policies issued by these bogus life

insurance  companies, the Government is  now  forced  to

take  appropriate action. Mr Speaker, Sir, in my  view,

most  of the directors or managers of the life insurance

companies who formed these companies were conscious that

they  were perpetrating a fraud and swindling  the  poor

gullible  public. The Bill, as it stands,  is  going  to

treat these bogus insurance companies in the same way as

the   Government  is  treating  persons  who  run   into

bankruptcy. I do not agree that such companies should be

treated in the same way as bankrupts are treated by  the

law.  The  Government should go one step  further.  They

should  take  criminal action against the directors  and

managers  of  these  bogus insurance companies  and,  if

necessary, impound their personal assets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not envisage these policy

holders  getting  back anything substantial  from  their

investments in these companies because the Minister  for

Finance  has said just now that much of the  funds  were

wasted  or  were spent on agents' commission, collection

fees,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



and   so  on.  In  addition  to  this  expenditure,  the

directors and managers who were prepared to perpetrate a

fraud must have also written off large sums of money  in

the   form  of  salaries,  travelling  allowances   and,

perhaps,  transferred  a  big portion  of  their  assets

elsewhere.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I strongly  advocate  that

the  Government  should take action not only  under  the

proposed  insurance  law but that it  should  also  take

criminal  action against the directors and  managers  of

these life insurance companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to inform the House how

many of these companies registered in Singapore, and how

many branches of companies registered in the Federation,

do  not pay the $200,000 deposit which is required of  a

life insurance company, and whether the Government would

consider  introducing legislation to make sure  that  in

future  a  percentage  of  the  premiums  collected   in

Singapore  by all life insurance companies are  invested

in Singapore.



<br><br>4.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, this Bill which has been introduced  today

is just like trying to prepare the net for the fish that

has  already escaped. But we welcome this Bill which the

Government has introduced today because it will  prevent

any  future  occurrence of illegal insurance agents  and

directors  mulcting our local people. We  did  not  have

much  time to study this Bill in detail because we  only

received it this afternoon in this Chamber. According to

the explanation given by the Minister for Finance, there

are  at present 17 life insurance companies of this sort

in   Singapore.   I  understand  that  these   insurance

companies have already wound up their business and  that

many  policy  holders have not been able to contact  the

insurance  agents  after  the Government  announced  its

intention   of  introducing  legislation.  Many   policy

holders are now worried and they are at a loss as to how

they can get back all or part of the premiums they paid.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance explained that the liquidator appointed by the court will have the power to order the liquidation of these life insurance companies - whether they are incorporated locally or in the Federation - and that a certain amount will be paid back to the policy holders after the assets of these companies have been assessed on liquidation. But we understand that such life insurance companies have very limited assets in

Singapore.  At  the most, they have a few  rooms  in  an

office and a few vans. It is also doubtful whether these

really  belong to them. The Minister has said that  when

these   insurance  companies  are  liquidated  the-local

citizens   will  get  priority  on  their   claims   for

compensation. But I say that what they will get will  be

very limited. The Minister for Finance has said that  he

had  already discussed the matter of companies which are

registered  in  the  Federation  of  Malaya   with   the

Federation  Minister  of  Finance  and  that   Singapore

citizens,  just like Federal citizens, will be  able  to

get  compensation from such companies. He has also  very

clearly  intimated that the policy holders will be  able

to  get  a  very limited amount of payment  out  of  the

premiums paid to these companies which are registered in

the  Federation. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the

Government  should  try to take all  possible  steps  to

recover what the policy holders have paid in the way  of

premiums to these companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a great number of such

insurance companies. It may be that there are only 17 in

Singapore  because  of the Mutual Benefit  Organisations

Bill  which  was passed in this Assembly  sometime  ago.

Many  people  who  were  members  of  these  mutual  aid

associations  then  took  out policies  with  such  life

insurance  companies. I understand  the  Social  Welfare

Department  has helped to transfer membership  lists  of

certain mutual aid societies to the Kinta Life Assurance

Company.  At  that  time,  I  discussed  with  the  then

Minister for Labour and the Member for Bukit Timah about

organising  a committee on this question. The  names  of

members of the mutual aid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



societies  were  transferred to the membership  list  of

this life insurance company. But now this life insurance

company  has  already stopped functioning. Many  of  the

policy  holders have told me that it was the  Government

which  helped them to transfer their names to this  life

insurance  company. Therefore, the Government should  be

responsible  for  getting back their payments  on  their

behalf.  I have already informed the Director of  Social

Welfare   of  this  matter  and  have  urged  that   the

Government should contact this life insurance company so

that  a  solution to this problem can be arrived  at.  I

hope  the  Minister for Finance can give us a  reply  on

this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the Bill is passed, we hone that the poor

people  of Singapore will not be exploited any  more  by

agents  and  operators of these illegal  life  insurance

companies.  We also hope that from now on  the  Minister

for  Finance  will pay more attention  to  such  illegal

companies in order that the people of Singapore will not

suffer any more losses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to clear up

one  point  which  the  Member for  Choa  Chu  Kang  has

referred  to  just now. He tried to give the  House  the

impression  that  the  Social  Welfare  Department   got

contributors to a mutual aid organisation to transfer to

the Kinta Insurance Company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there was an old lady who was

operating some sort of a family benefit society  in  the

Bukit Panjang area. As soon as the Government introduced

the Mutual Benefit Organisations Bill, she ceased to  do

business  and  there  was  a danger  of  those  who  had

contributed to her little organisation losing all  their

money. At that time, the Kinta Insurance Company of  the

Federation were seeking to do business in Singapore  and

they  had a number of discussions and meetings with  all

the  interested parties together with the  officials  of

the  Social Welfare Department. They undertook  to  take

over  all  the liabilities of the organisation that  was

run by the old lady in Bukit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



Panjang.  A  meeting was held. All the contributors  to

this  organisation met at the Community Centre in  Bukit

Timah Road. The position was explained to them and  they

agreed  to  transfer  to  the Kinta  Insurance  Company.

Before the Company took over the liabilities of the  old

lady, they paid a deposit of $200,000 to the Ministry of

Finance.   So  that  the  position  as  far   as   those

contributors are concerned is that because  they  sought

the  assistance  of the Social Welfare  Department  they

would  now be able to have access to the money that  has

been deposited with the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Farrer Park

made  the  important  point that  the  purpose  of  this

amending  Bill is a temporary one, to deal with  certain

mushroom  companies, and that it is not really something

that  is  suitable to remain as a permanent  statute.  I

entirely agree with him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme that is before the Governments of

Singapore   and  the  Federation  is  to   introduce   a

comprehensive  Ordinance  to regulate  all  the  various

forms  of  insurance - not only life  insurance  but  fire

insurance,  marine insurance, and so on. We have  worked

on  this  for  nearly two years with the  assistance  of

experts  sent  by  the Australian Government  under  the

Colombo  Plan. So we hope eventually to have a tidy  and

permanent  Ordinance on the statute book regulating  the

proper conduct of insurance companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point the Member for Farrer Park made was

this.  He asked whether it was true that foreign  branch

companies  could operate in Singapore without  paying  a

deposit of $200,000. The answer is that any company that

has  made  a  deposit  with the  Federation  Accountant-General  can  carry  on  business in  Singapore  without

making a deposit here; and vice versa anybody who  makes

a  deposit  in Singapore can carry on operation  in  the

Federation.  However, when we get the final  legislation

on this, I think all these weaknesses in our present law

will be remedied.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Hong Lim who

implied that these bogus insurance companies  were

known  to have started many years ago and he asked

why  no  action was taken earlier. The  answer  of

course is that the Member has got his facts wrong.

So   far   as  Singapore  is  concerned,  mushroom

companies  began to sprout round about the  middle

of  last  year  and they were really  active  from

September or October onwards last year. Therefore,

they  have  not had all the time in the  world  to

carry  out  their nefarious activities. Therefore,

it  is quite untrue for the Member for Hong Lim to

allege  that most of the poor have lost all  their

life  savings. I would say that a person who  took

out  an  average  policy of $500 might  have  paid

out - I  do  not  know - $20 or $25  from,  say,  last

September  till now, and I think the life  savings

of the poor are considerably more than this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is one point to which some

attention must be drawn. In the policies  of  most

of  these companies, it is stated that unless  you

pay  your  monthly premiums regularly your  policy

will lapse. I think they give a period of grace of

two months or so. Now under this Bill whatever  is

paid  will be considered as a claim on the  assets

of  the  company when it is wound up  and  if  the

condition  of  the policy say the  policy  lapses,

that condition will be set aside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now both the Member for Farrer Park and the

Member  for  Hong  Lim urged  that  the  strongest

action  be taken against the offending parties.  I

am  completely  in  agreement with  the  sentiment

behind   this  request,  but  I  can  see  certain

difficulties. First, the directors  of  all  these

companies  are Federation citizens and  therefore,

this  being  a civil suit, it is not possible  for

the    Singapore   Government   to   request   the

extradition   of  the  culprits.  No   doubt   the

Federation  Government will take  suitable  action

should criminal offences be revealed in the course

of  their  investigations into the  activities  of

these  companies.  In fairness to  some  of  these

directors  or  some of the persons connected  with

these  companies, I think it is wrong to say  that

all  of them are equally criminal and evil-minded.

Some may have been led into this business and induced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



to  put some capital into it by  the  major

culprits,  and there may be innocent people  among

the   directors  who  have  been  misled  by   the

promoters  into putting money into  this  venture.

Therefore,  although  we can say  with  confidence

that  the  persons who run this mushroom insurance

business  run  it  as  a racket,  nevertheless  we

cannot   condemn  everyone  connected  with   this

enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my colleague the Minister for Health and

Law  has  answered the main point  raised  by  the

Member  for Choa Chu Kang and I need not say  more

on this subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.57 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 and 2 ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 3

stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I realise that clause 2 has enlarged

the  scope  of an actuary as defined in  the  Life

Assurance Companies Ordinance to "include a Fellow

of  the  Society of Actuaries in America  and  any

person possessing such other qualifications as the

Minister may, by order, prescribe."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on clause 3.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I know. At the moment, I am told that

the   qualifications  under  the  Ordinance   are   very

difficult  to  obtain  and that  there  are  very,  very

few   actuaries  in  this  work.  Of  that,  I  am  told

there  are  about  two  or three persons  in  Singapore.

I  have  met  two  of them but there  may  be  a  third.

Now  under  clause  3,  a present insurance  company  or

a future insurance company - it seems to me



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



reading this clause hurriedly - will not be able to  carry

out  their  operations  "unless  there  is  in  force  a

certificate  by an actuary .... establishing the  minimum

rates of premium which are proper to be charged".  As  I

do   not   know  how  many  insurance  companies   there

are - perhaps  12,  15  or 20; I do  not  know  the  exact

number;  certainly  over 12 - I would  take  it  that  the

actuaries  in  Singapore  would  be  employed  by  these

insurance companies. Assuming that an insurance  company

employs  one  of  the  actuaries and  another  insurance

company employs the other, then it seems to me that  the

rest  of  the  insurance companies are left  without  an

actuary.  Now is the suggestion by the Government  under

this  clause  that  these  two  or  three  actuaries  in

Singapore  are going to act for the ether companies  and

provide them with certificates which will enable them to

carry  on  their  business?  While  I  agree  with   the

principle behind the Bill, I do not know whether  it  is

possible,  from  a practical point of view,  to  fix  an

appointed  day  in the near future and then  bring  into

play the provisions of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not really expect much trouble

on  the  administration of this clause. I think  we  can

allow the insurance companies some time and obviously we

must   give  them  an  interval  of  time  to  get   the

certificates  from an actuary. I agree with  the  Member

for  Farrer Park that the number of qualified  actuaries

is small.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is largely because they have formed

themselves into possibly the tightest professional trade

union   in   the  world.  Quite  impossible  terms   and

conditions are laid down, but the work itself is not  at

all  difficult.  So  far  as  reputable  life  insurance

companies  go, they have more or less the  same  premium

rates and the same conditions of calculations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



And  quite frankly, I do not see any  difficulty

about  this.  Certainly it is not the intention  of  the

Government  to  say,  `Well,  you  are  late  with  your

certificate  and you should close clown."  That  is  the

last thing we want to do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The point that exercises my mind is this:

there  are no actuaries to my knowledge - I may be  wrong,

Mr Speaker, Sir, and I am subject to correction here by

the  Minister - in Singapore actually practising on  their

own  as actuaries. They are no consultants. That is  the

difficulty I envisage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if each of the actuaries here is attached to a

particular insurance company, the company would bind him

to  exclusive  service. If, therefore,  these  actuaries

cannot  certify  for  the other  companies,  then  these

companies  will  experience  difficulty.  Now,  if   the

Minister proposes to appoint persons in Singapore to  do

that,  possibly  that would ease the situation.  If  the

Minister   also  permits  actuaries  living   in   other

countries to certify for particular companies registered

in  Singapore, I think that also would further ease  the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 to 14 inclusive ordered to stand part of the

Bill.
