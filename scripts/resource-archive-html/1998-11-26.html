<div align="center"><b>SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Supreme Court of Judicature Act

(Cap. 322) (SCJA) for two purposes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Firstly, to raise the claim threshold under which leave to

appeal is required:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) in the case of appeals from a decision of a District Court

or  Magistrate's Court in civil matters to the High Court,  from

$5,000 to $50,000; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) in the case of appeals from a decision of the High Court in

civil matters to the Court of Appeal, from $30,000 to $250,000;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Secondly, to deem any question of law referred to the Court

of  Appeal  by  the Public Prosecutor arising from any  criminal

matter  determined by the High Court to be a question of  public

interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the first purpose.



<br><br><i>Reasons for raising limits for Civil Appeals to High Court and Court of Appeal</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 1st August 1997, the District Courts' jurisdiction in

civil matters was raised from $100,000 to $250,000.  As a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>

result, more than 1,500 (The exact figure, updated

to 19th November 1998, is 1,544 cases.) claims exceeding

$100,000 have been filed in the District Courts since August

1997.  This has helped to reduce the number of claims filed in

the High Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under section 34(2)(a) of the SCJA, appeals to the

Court  of  Appeal  from decisions of the  High  Court  in  civil

matters  can  still  be made as a matter of right,  ie,  without

first  obtaining leave of the Court, if the value of the subject

matter exceeds $30,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the enhanced District Courts' jurisdiction to

$250,000  in civil matters, the Chief Justice has proposed  that

the  existing  $30,000 limit in section 34(2)(a)  be  raised  to

$250,000.   In  other words, bring its limit in  line  with  the

enhancement.   If the limit is not raised to $250,000,  District

Court cases of less than $250,000 can first go on appeal to  the

High  Court  and  then Court of Appeal.  This would  strain  the

limited resources of the Court of Appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, the Chief Justice also proposed that the limit of

$5,000 under section 21(1) of the SCJA, which covers appeals  to

the  High  Court from decisions of the District and Magistrates'

Courts in civil matters, be increased to $50,000.  The effect is

that  any  appeal  relating to a claim less than  $50,000  would

require the leave of the Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the amendment is that in view of the

increased  jurisdiction of the Subordinate Courts,  there  is  a

need  to discourage non-serious appeals to the High Court.  This

is  best  done  by raising the threshold limit  from  $5,000  to

$50,000.   Litigants who feel that their appeals have merit  may

still  apply  for leave to appeal.   For flexibility,  the  Bill

also  provides that the President will be empowered to vary  the

new  limits  after consulting the Chief Justice.  If  necessary,

these  new  limits can be increased or decreased after assessing

how they work out in practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that the new limits will not have the

effect of preventing meritorious appeals from being heard,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>

even if they concern claims below the new limits.

The requirement for leave is essentially a screening mechanism

to sieve out non-serious and unmeritorious appeals.  Appeals can

still be brought with the leave of court in cases falling below

the new limits.



<br><br><i>Reasons for deeming a question of law referred by Public Prosecutor to Court of Appeal arising from criminal appeal determined by High Court to be a question of public interest.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the second amendment which is to amend

section 60 to deem any question of law referred by the Attorney-General  to  the Court of Appeal (CA) arising from any  criminal

matter  determined by the High Court to be a question of  public

interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, under section 60, when an appeal from a decision

of  a Subordinate Court in a criminal matter has been determined

by  the  High  Court, the Judge may, on the application  of  any

party  and  shall, on the application of the Public  Prosecutor,

reserve for the question of the Court of Appeal any question  of

law  of  public interest which has arisen in the course  of  the

appeal.   However,  the existing provision in  relation  to  the

Public Prosecutor is unsatisfactory because the issue of whether

a  question  of  law  is  one of public interest  is  determined

exclusively by the High Court.  The result therefore is that the

Public  Prosecutor  may be prevented from seeking  a  conclusive

ruling  from the Court of Appeal on questions which  the  Public

Prosecutor considers to be of public interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Members of the House are aware, under the

Constitution,  the  Attorney-General, who  is  also  the  Public

Prosecutor,  is charged with the responsibility for the  conduct

of  all criminal prosecutions and for advising the Government on

legal   matters.    In   order   to   properly   discharge   his

constitutional  duties,  the  Attorney-General  feels,  and  the

Government agrees with him, that he should be given the  freedom

to  pose  questions which he considers to be of public  interest

for a conclusive ruling by the Court of Appeal.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment to section 60 seeks to

address this issue by providing that any question of law

referred by the Public Prosecutor to the Court of Appeal should

be deemed to be a question of public interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in our

legal  system, there are two ways in which laws are  made.   The

first  is  through Parliament and the other through  judges  who

decide  on  individual cases.  Uncertainty in the law may  arise

when   there   are  gaps  or  when  laws  are  given   differing

interpretations  by judges, or when, in the case  of  judge-made

law, judges disagree with each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In criminal law and procedure, it is important that there be

avenues  to correct any such uncertainties quickly.  The  proper

administration   of  justice  requires  laws  to   be   certain,

especially  when  criminal  laws are concerned.   Amendments  to

statutes can only be done by Parliament, but judge-made  law  is

always  subject to a determination by the highest court  of  the

land, namely, the Court of Appeal.  Who can appeal, and on  what

grounds,  all  provided for in the various statutes  and  codes.

Today,  we  are  considering  a particularly  important  aspect,

mainly  the  role  of  the  Attorney-General  in  the  appellate

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current practice, as the Minister has indicated, under

section  60, is that both party and Attorney-General can  appeal

from  a High Court decision to the Court of Appeal.  In the case

of  an application by the AG, the judge is under a duty for  the

decision  of the Court of Appeal, any question of law of  public

interest that has surfaced during the High Court hearing.  Under

the  present section 64, the Court of Appeal is under a duty  to

reserve, hear and determine the question reserved.  There  is  a

deeming  provision  that where there is a conflict  of  judicial

authority  on a point of law, the question shall be regarded  as

one of public interest.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the proposed amendment different from the

current one?  The key difference relates to the deeming

provision, ie, whenever the Attorney-General makes an

application under this section, the question of law is deemed to

be one of public interest.  That is in the proposed section 65.

That this amendment accords more with reality, there is no

doubt.  It must be a rarity that when the AG raises the question

of law, it is not in the public interest.  This conceivably can

only happen when the AG is personally involved in the case.

There is, therefore, a difference between a question of law

raised by the Attorney-General and a question of law raised by

the accused in a case. The Attorney-General, the member of the

Executive, is charged, as the Minister has pointed out, with

constitutional duties relating to the legal affairs of the

Government and the conduct of prosecutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Attorney-General Chambers also have a

legislative  division that in fact drafts all  legislation  laid

before Parliament.  It is therefore important to recognise  this

fact  that  accounts  for the difference between  the  Attorney-General  raising a question of law and the accused in  the  case

raising a similar question.  It would, of course, be tidier,  if

the  Attorney-General's ability to raise a question of  law  for

determination  by  the  Court of Appeal  is  separate  from  the

confines  of  any case.  This is the situation, for example,  in

the United Kingdom where in the Criminal Justice Act of 1972,  a

procedure known as the Attorney-General's reference was created.

This  makes  it  very clear that the public interest  is  served

every   time   the  Attorney-General  makes  a   reference   for

determination  by  the  Court.   Such  references  are  for  the

purposes  of determining the law in future and this clearly  may

be beneficial to both accused and prosecution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be emphasised that it is not the case that when an

accused  raises  a question of law, it is never  in  the  public

interest.   But equally clearly, it cannot be deemed to  be  so.

The  accused is personally interested in the outcome of the case

and is not usually concerned with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>

the application of the law to others.  As I

mentioned earlier, it could have been better to separate the

accused's right of appeal from the Attorney-General's right to

ask for determination of questions of law by the Court of

Appeal.  Perhaps, this matter can be looked at again in due

course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another merit, of course, of the reference approach is that the

defendant's  name  is normally kept out of the  appeal,  so  the

Court  of  Appeal can fully consider the case as  one  involving

prospective  cases.   At the same time, it reinforces  the  view

that  the Attorney-General cannot, in such a case, ask the Court

to  set  aside  an acquittal of the accused whose  case  is  the

subject of a reference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments can be supported in that the end result on

either  approach is to produce clearer rulings from the  highest

court  of the land to govern criminal cases.  No one, I believe,

will dispute the need or desirability to have such a procedure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there may be a case for considering, in future, a

procedure  whereby the Attorney-General can refer questions,  de

novo   to   the  Court  of  Appeal  in  anticipation  of   legal

difficulties  and  problems  without  direct  reference   to   a

particular case.  If such a procedure exists, it may help in the

development of law without the need to involve Parliament unduly

in matters concerning the administration of criminal justice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of criminal evidence and procedure, there is

always  the  argument  made that the  judiciary  and  the  legal

profession  should be allowed to regulate such rules, especially

as  they are the ones practising in this area, and where a quick

decision  may  be required.  It may take too long to  take  such

amendments   to   Parliament,   too   cumbersome   and   perhaps

unnecessary.  The power of the Attorney-General to refer to  the

Court of Appeal questions of law therefore remains a most useful

and necessary power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I wonder if Prof Chin would clarify his second

point when he says, "In future, the Attorney-General should have

the  power to raise questions."  Is he advocating this, both for

criminal and civil cases, or only criminal cases?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, the answer is that I would

expect it to be restricted to criminal cases, simply because the

Attorney-General, as the Minister mentioned just now, is charged

with the duty of all criminal prosecutions in the land.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill

increases the lower limits for appeal without leave, ie,  appeal

as of right.  The limits are changed under the Bill as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) For appeals from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court,

the  subject matter must now exceed $50,000 (which increases  it

from $5,000 to $50,000).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) For appeals from the High Court to the Court of Appeal, the

subject  matter must now exceed $250,000.  (This is an  increase

from $30,000 to $250,000).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the effect of the present limits is that cases within the

jurisdiction  of  the Magistrate's  Court are appealable  as  of

right to the High Court, but are not appealable  as of right  to

the  Court of Appeal.  This is a two-tier system.  This position

is  satisfactory,  as there is no real need for  a  three  tier-system for Magistrate Court suits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, cases within the jurisdiction of the District Courts are

appealable as of right to the High Court and are also appealable

as   of  right  to  the  Court  of  Appeal.   This  position  is

unsatisfactory as there is a  three-tier system and  it  is  not

something   that  is  really  needed.   Indeed,   the   proposed

amendments may have been intended to do away with this anomaly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases within the jurisdiction of the High Court are appealable

as  of right to the Court of Appeal.  Here again, there is a two

tier  system.  This position is satisfactory and was consciously

adopted with the cessation of appeals to the Privy Council.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the effect of the proposed amendments would be that cases

within  the  jurisdiction  of  the Magistrate's  Court  are  not

appealable  as  of right to the High Court.   There  will  be  a

single tier system. This is unsatisfactory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go on to elaborate later, Sir. Cases within the

jurisdiction  of  the District Courts are not appealable  as  of

right,  if  the subject matter is between $30,000  and  $50,000.

Cases  with  subject  matter between $50,000  and  $250,000  are

appealable  as of right to the High Court.  The removal  of  the

automatic  right  of  appeal for cases below  $50,000  is  again

unsatisfactory.  Again, appeals to the Court of Appeal are  also

no longer as a matter of right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases within the jurisdiction of the High Court are appealable

as of right only if the claim could not have been brought in the

District Court.  While the right of appeal is curtailed somehow,

the position under the proposed amendment is still satisfactory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main concern under the Bill is that there is only a

single tier for cases with subject matter below $50,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the cardinal principles for appeal is outlined by a

famous  Judge,  as he then was - Megarry Judge in  the  Erinford

Properties v Chesire CC.  Sir, judges must decide cases even  if

they are hesitant in their conclusions.  At the other extreme, a

judge may be very clear  in his conclusion and yet on appeal  be

held  to  be wrong.  No human being is infallible, and for  none

are  there more public and authoritative explanations  of  their

errors than for judges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the setting of limits to automatic rights of appeal would

streamline the administration of justice in that the  number  of

cases  heard  in the High Court would be reduced, in  particular

what  the  Minister referred to as the non-serious  cases.   The

time  taken  for the final disposition of a case would  also  be

reduced if there is a single tier.  However, it should be  noted

that  there  are already deterrents in the present  system,  and

these are the disincentives:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The appellant has to pay security for cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) He has to pay the cost of his own solicitors or

lawyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) He has also got to pay the cost of the winning party if

he  loses  his  appeal.



So there are inherent  cost  deterrents which are already in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendments would run against the grain

for the following considerations:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current limit of $5,000 is a relatively small figure

for  most  Singaporeans.   Cases with subject  matter  of,  say,

$20,000  to  $50,000 are not small to many litigants and  indeed

the  outcome may be a matter of serious economic consequence for

a  fair number. Sir, from the labour statistics available as  at

end of 1997, more than 770,000 Singaporeans still earn less than

$1,500  per  month.   The number increases to 1,288,000  earning

less  than  $2,500  per  month.  Sir,  for  a  large  number  of

Singaporeans, the $50,000 cut-off amount is too large an amount.

Perhaps  the  amount could be increased to $10,000  or  $15,000.

When  this  amendment came in 1994, even if  one  looks  at  the

inflation figure, I think it does not justify such a large  jump

in  the  cut-off  amount.   Sir, we must  avoid  confirming  the

feeling of the people that justice is only for the rich.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single tier cases, in addition, would be matters

handled by a Magistrate or District Judge.  They are all members

of  the  Subordinate  Judiciary.   The  Subordinate  Courts  are

subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court, which

is  the repository of judicial authority in the Constitution and

safeguarded with security of tenure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on experience and wisdom, a Magistrate or younger

District Judge is less likely to be infallible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, appeal and the right of appeal is intrinsic in the

judicial process and ensures that justice is seen to be done.  A

litigant's  right  to  have another higher tribunal  review  his

cause  should not be curtailed.  If the problem is the increased

workload for the High Court judges, let us

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>

then appoint more High Court judges or Judicial Commissioners to

handle the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision of fair adjudication to which all have

access  is  the sine qua non in the administration  of  justice.

The  raising  of  the limit for appeals to the High  Court  from

$5,000  to $50,000 is a ten-fold increase and will result  in  a

large  number  of  individual or small business litigants  being

subject to a single tier of dispute resolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saving grace of applying for leave to appeal may be

illusory and create problems of its own.  Application for  leave

would require examination of the merits.  Affidavits would  have

to  be filed. The grounds of appeal would have to be identified.

If leave is given, the appeal itself will again be determined on

merits.   So  what happens here is that there is  an  additional

step  being created with the consequential increase in cost  and

usage of court time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Notice of Appeal also cannot be filed unless leave

itself  is obtained.  Hence the grounds of decision will not  be

available for the purposes of the leave application.  This would

mean  again  that  the judge hearing the application  for  leave

would  have  to  second  guess the  trial  judge.   Counsel,  in

advising  the  litigant wishing to appeal, would  also  have  to

second  guess  the  trial  judge, in  formulating  the  intended

grounds of appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two possible ways to address the above

issues.    The  limit can be increased from $5,000  but  not  to

$50,000.   It can perhaps be increased to $15,000.   This  would

reduce the number of appeals but would allow litigants to whom a

five figure claim is significant  to enjoy an automatic right of

appeal and access to the High Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed limits can be retained, but the system

can  be  modified.  There should be an automatic right  to  file

Notice  of Appeal on current limits or on an increased limit  to

about $15,000.  Leave is required to file the Petition of Appeal

if the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>

subject  matter  is below the proposed limit which,  as  I  have

suggested, is perhaps below $15,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another amendment that I would like to highlight is

the  amendment  to  clause 21(3).  This clause  allows  for  the

President  to increase the cut-off amount, after consulting  the

Chief  Justice,  and by publishing the same  in  the  Government

Gazette.   Sir, justice is a matter of grave importance  to  the

public.  I disagree that a matter that determines the access  to

a right of appeal should be decided by the Chief Justice and the

President  alone.   I  think such an important  matter  must  be

debated and decided by this House.  It is important that in  the

name   of   administration  of  justice,  we  do  not  introduce

deficiency in justice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I would like to support the proposed

amendments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, two intended

amendments in the Bill are of concern to me.  One is, I believe,

something you can question in principle; and the second  may  in

fact raise a constitutional question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first relates to the access to the courts. I wish to

associate  my  arguments to that of the speaker  before  me,  Mr

Ravindran.  I share many of the concerns he has expressed  about

the  intended limits of access to appeal.  If the amendments are

passed,  some cases would have no right of appeal.  There  would

be  a  single tier only and this is something we should question

in  principle.   The  right to appeal to the  Supreme  Court  is

important.   With  respect, as compared to judges  of  the  High

Court,  many  judges  in the Subordinate Courts  are  relatively

inexperienced  and  they  do  not  have  security   of   tenure.

Moreover,  the nature of the Subordinate Courts is that  written

judgements  are  not  normally  issued  with  full  grounds   of

decision, unless an appeal is pending.  Therefore, if  we  limit

the   right   to   appeal,   we  limit  the   transparency   and

accountability  of these courts, and the use of their  decisions

as precedents.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus on the quantum in each case is of concern. The

new  sums  to be set are high, Sir.  I believe that  justice  is

about questions of principle, not quantum.  Just because a  case

is  worth  less  does not automatically mean  that  it  is  less

important  to  those  involved.  One  example  illustrates  this

starkly.   In the Small Claims Tribunals Act, the sums  involved

are  well  below  $50,000.  Yet section 35 of the  Small  Claims

Tribunals Act (Chapter 308) states that any party may appeal  to

the   High   Court  on  any  point  of  law  or  questions   for

jurisdiction.   This  is  of right.  To  limit  access  now,  as

proposed, would seem inconsistent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment might be justified perhaps if there

were  a  backlog  of cases caused by a flood of appeals.   This,

however,  is not the case at present, as I understand  it.   Our

courts have shown world class efficiency.  This, we can be proud

of.   We  should  value  the efficiency in the  dispensation  of

justice.   But  we  should pause and question before  efficiency

gives way to haste or expediency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point refers to amendments to section 21(b) and

section  34(b).  These intend to allow the amounts to be  varied

by  the President after consulting the Chief Justice.  I wish to

ask  the  Minister to clarify if the Cabinet or the Minister-in-charge,  Minister for Law, is to first advise the  President  of

the  matter, or it would be left to the President to  act  after

consulting  the Chief Justice.  This is not clear  to  me.   The

plain  wording  of the amendment suggests the  latter,  that  it

would  be  left  to  the  President after consulting  the  Chief

Justice.  Article 21(5) of the Constitution of Singapore  allows

for legislation such as this to require the President to consult

with  any  person, other than the Cabinet or Minister.  However,

Article  21(1)  of the Constitution says that generally,  unless

otherwise  provided,  the President acts on ministerial  advice.

My  concern  is that if the President acts in consultation  with

the  Chief  Justice  only and without ministerial  advice,  this

raises  a  constitutional question.  Will  the  Minister  please

clarify if the Cabinet or Minister will advise the President  of

any  change, and by "advise" I mean in the constitutional  sense

of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>

putting the question outside the discretion of the President.  I

assume  the  Minister  will clarify  at  the  end  and  I  shall

therefore   proceed  with  the  question  that  arises   if   no

ministerial  advice is required and the concerns that  therefore

arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no ministerial advice is required, this raises the

concern  that it might be against constitutional principle.   In

raising  this concern, allow me to make it plain that I  do  not

question  the  august  judgment of the  Chief  Justice  and  the

President.    Rather,  it  is  question  of  the  constitutional

arrangements  of  power.  The Constitution  gives  separate  and

different  powers  to  the Executive, the  legislature  and  the

judiciary.   One  institution should not  intrude  on  another's

domain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the judicial power in Article 93 is to interpret law

as  applied in individual cases.  The Chief Justice also has the

power  to  supervise  administration  of  the  courts  that  the

Constitution  provides  or this House  creates  by  legislation.

This   House  cannot  make  laws  that  are  designed  to  apply

specifically and specially to decide any singular or  particular

case.  This would intrude on the judicial power as shown in  the

Privy Council case of Liyange.   Judicial power, however, is set

within  its own limits.  Judicial power is not a power  to  make

law or to decide general rules on what kind of cases to hear  by

quantum  or  other  general characteristics  as  these  intended

amendments  provide.  This is the power of the  legislation  and

that   power  belongs  rightly  to  the  legislature  and   this

Parliament.  The power to make laws such as the SCJA belongs  to

this  House.  So does the power to vary it.  It does not  belong

to either the Chief Justice or the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to make law can be, of course, delegated for

subsidiary  legislation.   The power can  be  delegated  to  the

Executive,  Ministers.   Parliament  then  plays  its  role   by

retaining the power to question Ministers over their use of  the

delegated power to hold them accountable to the House.  This  is

possible  because our Ministers are also Members of  Parliament.

The  constitutional  principle  is  that  delegated  legislation

should be in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>

the  hands  of the Executives who are accountable to Parliament.

If  we  put  the  power in the hands of the President  or  Chief

Justice,  I  wish to point out that the House cannot  hold  them

accountable in the same way as Ministers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this problem can, of course, be circumvented. The

amendment  can  provide for the Minister for Law to  act,  after

consulting   the   Chief   Justice.   This   will   accord   the

constitutional  principles  and accountability  of  this  House,

while  achieving  the  wish  to  take  into  account  the  Chief

Justice's  views  and to amend as necessary.  This  is  a  small

change,  but it is one that may be necessary to clearly  observe

the  Constitution.  I would urge the Minister to  clarify  these

concerns before passing the amendments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

obliged  to  you  for  giving  me this  opportunity.   Sir,  two

previous  speakers, Mr Ravindran and Mr Simon Tay, have  touched

on  the  question of section 34, ie, the power of the President.

I totally agree with them, and may I add my own view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the matter now stands, it is this Parliament that

decides  the  question of jurisdiction.  And I see no  need  for

this  power to be given either to the President or to the  Chief

Justice.   This  is  a  very  important  constitutional   issue.

Question  of  jurisdiction should be within the  hands  of  this

Parliament  and  this Parliament alone.  And I  would  urge  the

Minister to reconsider the position.  As Mr Simon Tay has  said,

even  if  the  Minister advises, I still think that  this  House

should be the final body to decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. However, I

must  say that I have reservation that the quantum that is being

asked  in  this Bill is indeed very high.  As the matter  stands

now, anything below $5,000, you require leave.  Now we are being

asked to raise this limit to $50,000, which is 10 times.   I  am

aware that leave will be granted if there is merit.  But then it

would lead to legal expenses and involve time.  The Minister has

not given this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>

House  any  figure to indicate that because of  this  provision,

there  is  a backlog in the High Court and the Court of  Appeal.

Justice must be seen to be done and I think justice will be done

if  there is less restraint on the part of the litigant to  seek

justice.   And  I would like to assure this House,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  that  members of the legal profession, who would  normally

advise  on  question of appeal, are very cautious.   They  would

consider  the merit of the case because time and legal  expenses

are  involved and only when they think there is some merit, then

only  they  will  go to court.  So I am asking the  Minister  to

increase  it by all means, but not 10 times, perhaps $20,000  (4

times)  and  come back to this House sometime in the future,  if

need be, as the previous speaker, Mr Simon Tay, has spoken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a practising member of the Bar, Sir, I am proud of the

judicial  system.   In  the  last  seven  years,  despite   some

criticisms  from some quarters outside, I can say in this  House

that  we  have the most independent and capable judicial  system

anywhere in the world, and world bodies have reckoned this.  But

in the name of efficiency, we should not undermine the system to

such an extent that the right to appeal is questioned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also a related question which, of course, is

not  part  of  this  debate, but I will  pursue  it,  with  your

permission.  The Court of Appeal is presently made  up  of  only

three permanent Judges.  May I urge the Minister to consider  in

future  to increase this to five permanent Judges.  I  know  the

Chief  Justice  from time to time appoints  one  of  the  senior

Judges of the Supreme Court, but I think this arrangement is not

practical.   Even Hong Kong, Sir, I am told, has got more  Court

of  Appeal Judges.  With more Appellate Judges, there  would  be

more views and our judicial system will benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I come to another issue which I think deserves

mention  -  the  right of appeal.  The Attorney-General  is  the

highest  officer  of  the land and I am glad  the  Minister  has

brought  this  amendment.  He should have  the  discretion.   He

should have the right to appeal in the public interest.   And  I

share Prof. Chin's concern

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>

that  even  on  hypothetical questions, he is the  man  who  can

foresee  what are the problems that are going to face  him.   He

could  pose even hypothetical questions, so that the  public  at

large will know what is the legal position.  I think it will  be

a  wise  thing for us to do this now than to wait for things  to

happen and then introduce legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a practising member of the Bar, I would urge the

Minister - I am supportive of the amendment - to please go slow.

The perception and the signal we must send to the public is that

we  are  interested in justice and we are not, in  the  name  of

efficiency,  going to change the system to the  disadvantage  of

the litigant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I would like to raise my concern on one of the two proposed

amendments  to  the  Bill, that is, the monetary  limit  for  an

appeal to the higher Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main rules of natural justice is the quick

resolution  of disputes.  The fat of the proposed  Bill  may  be

just  that.  But many cases may not be referred for appeal to  a

higher Court and therefore it removes potentially the backlog of

appeal cases.  But equally important is the accessibility  to  a

right  of appeal.  The Bill, by increasing the limit from $5,000

to  $50,000  for an appeal to the High Court from a District  or

Magistrate Court, and $30,000 to $250,000 for an appeal  to  the

Court  of Appeal, is, in my view, excessive.  The public,  whose

disputes and claims may be small in quantum, may feel that  they

have  no  access to appeal to a higher Court simply because  the

claim involved is small.  In fact, it may appear that commercial

cases  are  more  likely to qualify for appeal  because  of  the

higher  limit  as  quite naturally, cases  involving  commercial

disputes involve large sums of money.  But the right of  appeal,

Sir,  is  for everyone, not just corporations.  For an  ordinary

man, it is not just the quantum, it is the principle and the law

that  is involved that is equally important to him.  For parties

that go to Court, especially when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>

they  have  used up all the avenues of mediation, his  case  and

dispute  could be the most important thing to him,  whether  the

amount is big or small.  A more accessible right to appeal  also

means the opportunity for any person seeking justice to have his

case heard before a more experienced Judge, especially when many

of  our Judges in the District and Magistrate Courts are younger

and less experienced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, money cannot be the main determinant whether a case is

heard  by a more experienced Judge.  There could be cases  where

the  amount  involved is small but may have very  important  and

wide  implications to society.  Are we discounting the fact that

mistake  in judgement and decision could be one of the  possible

outcomes  and consequence of decision at the lower  Court?   Why

make  it difficult for parties to appeal?  If any, we must  make

the  appeal  process accessible, convenient and  affordable.   I

urge   the   Minister  to  review  and  clarify  these  matters,

especially  on  the  limits of appeal, so  as  not  to  make  it

excessive.  Based on this qualification, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may I say from the outset that I am most unhappy with  the

amendments  proposed in this Bill.  I do not support  the  Bill,

and may I say that my Party does not support this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have to say in this House that

justice  lies at the heart of every human being.  And  he  wants

justice in his conduct of his daily life and in any action taken

against him by the Government or the public prosecutor who is  a

member  of  the Executive.  So, he must be given access  to  the

Courts and to the highest Court, if necessary, if he feels  that

it is important enough to him.  So he must have ready access.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on which I have expressed my dissatisfaction and the

Party's  dissatisfaction, although it does not come  within  the

scope  of  this Bill, is the increasing cost of justice  to  the

ordinary man.  We have had cost increases several times and many

a man feels now it is too expensive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>

to go to the Courts.  This is a very unfortunate and regrettable

feeling if it is shared by a great majority of the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been said here, Mr Speaker, Sir, the right of an appeal

to  test  the  decision of a single Judge has been with  us  for

many, many years.  It is an inherent part of the judicial system

of  many countries, almost every country I should have said, and

not  only  do  they provide a one tier appeal,  they  go  on  to

provide  a  further  appeal, a two tier appeal.   We  have  seen

recently  with Malaysia setting up the Supreme Court of Malaysia

to  hear  appeals  from the Court of Appeal.   And  I  shall  be

talking about this later.  Instead of moving towards a two  tier

appeal system, we seem to be heading towards cutting out appeals

altogether.   Is that what we want in this country?   There  are

other  ways  than  bringing  legislation  before  Parliament  to

discourage appeals, and which are also to be regretted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago, the Chief Justice, who hears Magistrates'

appeals,  said quite publicly at a hearing that he was going  to

discourage frivolous appeals by convicted persons who  may  have

had  long sentences of imprisonment or heavy fines, and he would

discourage  that, cut down the number of appeals  by  increasing

the  sentences.   May  I say that is a most unfortunate  remark.

And  now  what does the Government propose to do?  As  has  been

said by the speakers before me, it proposes to provide from now,

with the passing of this Bill, and there is no question that  it

will  become  law, that a single magistrate be  left  to  decide

claims  below  $30,000.  To the litigant, a  claim  of  $15,000,

$20,000  or  $25,000  may mean a great  lot  to  him.   In  that

respect,  this Bill is discriminatory.  Mr Ravindran,  I  think,

mentioned  that, but I will go further and say this  is  totally

discriminatory, and questions may be asked whether  it  does  or

does  not  violate the equality requirement in our Constitution.

Why  should  you deny a litigant who has a claim  of  less  than

$50,000 any right of appeal from the decision of a single  judge

or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>

magistrate?  Why is it that only persons who have claims of more

than $50,000 and $250,000 should have this right and not persons

who  have  claims  below the sum of $50,000?  Of  course,  there

should  be  a  little restraint in the number of appeals  to  be

allowed and the present limits are good enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, as has been pointed out, there are other restraints by

way  of requiring appellants to provide security for costs.   If

the  appeal is thought to be frivolous, the answer is to ask for

further  security and the opposing litigants can do  just  that.

If  they  thought an appeal was frivolous, they  could  make  an

application  to  the  High Court for security  for  cost  to  be

increased,  particularly  if there is  some  evidence  that  the

person appealing will not have the means to pay the costs at the

end.   So we have the mechanism to prevent frivolous and useless

appeals going up to the High Court or to the Court of Appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister was very brief in his introduction of this Bill and

he  says the Chief Justice had requested the amendments.  May we

know  from the Minister whether it is because there are too many

appeals  and, if so, what is the present number of appeals  that

judges find difficult to cope with?  As has been said before me,

justice demands that even if it takes a little longer, that  the

person seeking justice should be accorded justice and be able to

leave  the  court or tribunal with the feeling that justice  has

been done to him even though he may not agree with the decision.

So  what  is  the need?  Is it because there are  far  too  many

appeals  and we have not got enough judges, or we have  not  got

enough court rooms and appeals are going to be lengthened out to

two or three years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, I am unhappy at the haste with which cases are

processed  through the courts.  So I am, and my Party  is,  very

unhappy with the proposal that we now increase the threshold for

appeal  from the Subordinate Courts to $50,000.  It is not  good

enough  to say they can still appeal because they can  seek  the

leave  of the magistrate.   Magistrates are human and, like  any

other human being.  More so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>

because  they are judicial officers and they have to  decide  on

the merits they must feel that they are right in their decision.

They  would  be  reluctant to grant any further  appeal  saying,

"This question is very clear to me.  I cannot see that an appeal

is  going  to  help."  So the decision is left entirely  to  the

magistrate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I illustrate this by what the Privy Council said, and I am

sure  the Minister is aware of this, in relation to applications

that  were  made  under  section 60  of  the  Supreme  Court  of

Judicature  Act.  There were two applications made  under  that,

one  to  the Chief Justice and one to another judge of the  High

Court.  They were criminal cases because section 60 applies only

to  criminal cases.  And in both instances, the applications  to

refer  questions  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  were  turned  down

summarily.  The Privy Council which, as I have said before,  was

then the highest court in the land, pronounced their unhappiness

over  the decisions of the two judges not to refer the questions

to  the Court of Appeal.  The Privy Council was in no doubt that

the  questions  sought to be referred were questions  of  public

interest and they said they should have been referred.  So there

is  the Privy Council commenting, not on magistrates' decisions,

but on the decision of the Chief Justice and a judge of the High

Court.   So  if  they can make mistakes, what about magistrates?

Are they not liable to fall into the same error?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hear from the Minister the compelling reasons

why  this amendment is necessary at this stage.  If it is speedy

justice  that  we want, cases heard and disposed of immediately,

perhaps  we  should  try and take a leaf  from  what  the  Prime

Minister  in  Pakistan is proposing to do.  He is  proposing  to

have  cases  heard  immediately,  appeal  heard  the  next  day,

execution carried out within seven days.  Is that what  we  want

in Singapore - is that the whole aim and object of justice, that

it should be speedily carried out and determined?  Or is our aim

to  try  and do justice between subject and subject and  between

the  subject  and  the  Government?  These  are  very  important

questions of principle and cannot be shrugged off or shelved  by

considerations

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>

of   time   or  convenience.   Many  a  judge  has   said   that

administrative  convenience  has  no  place  in  the  system  of

justice.   However inconvenient it may be, it must be  the  sole

aim  and object of justice to do justice even though it  may  be

inconvenient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I move on to the proposed repeal and re-enactment of section

60.  This is again most unsatisfactory.  I have raised this, not

once, but two or three times in this House, after I returned  to

this  House.   The  law  as  it  now  stands  gives  the  Public

Prosecutor  the sole right without any hindrance to  take  up  a

question  to the Court of Appeal.  But the accused has to  apply

for leave and, as I have indicated, whether it reaches the Court

of  Appeal or not was left to the judge who heard the appeal and

who  quite  clearly  felt  convinced of  the  rightness  of  his

decisions.  That itself was wrong in principle.  Why should  the

Public  Prosecutor be allowed to ride - I suppose I  should  not

say his coach and six horses - his car through the courts?  This

Bill  seeks to give him greater rights.  I am sure the  Minister

is  aware, and this comes from the pronouncements of the highest

courts which have dealt with the question of Crown privilege.  I

am sure he is aware that the courts have decided again and again

in  England and Scotland that the question of public interest is

not a matter for the Attorney-General or anyone else, but it  is

for the courts to determine after hearing both sides what is the

public interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is wrong about that? The courts are the persons who

should  decide   what  is  in  the  public  interest,  not   the

Executive.   This amendment seeks to remove that  question  from

the realm of the court to the Public Prosecutor, contrary to the

decisions from other jurisdictions.  We seem to be stepping  out

of  line  with the jurisdictions in other countries.  I  suppose

then it can be said that we are unique, we are different, we  do

not  follow what other countries do.  Is that what we want?   Or

are  we concerned with whether our present system serves justice

or not?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had proposed previously that under section 60 at least the

right  to  take the matter up to the Court of Appeal  should  be

left to the Court of Appeal itself and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>

that  litigants  or  the  Public  Prosecutor  should  make   the

application  to  the Court of Appeal and not to  the  judge  who

heard it.  This was done by Malaysia many, many years ago.  They

substituted the decision of the judge with the decision  of  the

Court  of  Appeal, requiring an application to be  made  to  the

Court of Appeal.  What is wrong with that, instead of giving the

Public  Prosecutor greater rights?  Reference was  made  to  the

right  of the Public Prosecutor in the United Kingdom.   As  has

been  pointed out, in the United Kingdom, the Public  Prosecutor

has  no  right  of appeal against the acquittal of  any  accused

person by a court.  But here in Singapore we do, and it is there

that  he takes up the questions to the Court of Appeal.  In  the

United  Kingdom, it is purely a question of law which would  not

affect  the decision in a particular case.  It is to govern  the

courts  in  any  future cases coming before them involving  that

point of law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also say a few words about the amendment proposed by

clause  3  on  the amendment of section 34 to  add  a  new  sub-section.   This  is again, may I say, very unsatisfactory.   The

right  of  appeal, as I have said, is an inherent  part  of  the

judicial  system, and is a matter of great public interest.   It

should only be left to the legislature what limits should be put

to  it  and  not  left  entirely to the  Chief  Justice  or  the

President.  A very valuable point was taken by Mr Simon Tay that

under  the amendment if a decision to change the limit is  taken

by  the  President or the Chief Justice, it cannot be questioned

in  this House.  I would ask the Minister not to move the Second

Reading  of  the  Bill  but  that it be  referred  to  a  Select

Committee.   At least then we will have the views of the  public

as to what they feel about the rights of appeal being restricted

so severely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say a few words about the present system of appeals

in Singapore.  At the moment, as I indicated, we only have a one

tier  appeal except where in civil cases, decisions go  up  from

the District Court to the High Court. Then there is another tier

of appeal to the Court of Appeal.  I think it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>

is  time  we thought of introducing a further tier of appeal,  a

two-tier  appeal, which as I said, is in place in  most  of  the

other countries, certainly in the Commonwealth countries and the

United  Kingdom.  And in the United States, you will  find  that

they  have  more  than a two-tier system of appeal.   They  have

three  tiers  and there may, in some cases, be a  four-tier.   I

know  criticism has been made particularly about the  death  row

inmates in the United States.  I agree that a person should  not

be  left 10 - 12 years waiting to know whether he is going to be

executed or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I illustrate, if I have the time, Mr Speaker, Sir, why I

think  a two-tier appeal is necessary by referring to a case  in

Singapore  where I think a possible miscarriage of  justice  was

done  to  the litigants by the absence of a further appeal  from

the Court of Appeal.  And this was the case of the three accused

persons which I referred to in my motion on the appointment of a

commission  to  look into the investigation of  criminal  cases.

These  three men were charged with murder when they  should  not

have  been  charged.  They were not even at the  scene  and  the

murder  was  committed by someone else as was proved later,  and

that man was convicted after the three men were acquitted.   And

that  came about because the defence sought strenuously to bring

that other man to justice.  That is the criminal side of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the men took their action to the High Court for damages,

because  they  had  spent  three years  in  jail,  the  Judicial

Commissioner  dismissed the case without answering the  question

which  was posed to him.  He was asked to answer how is it  that

three  innocent  men could confess to such a gruesome  crime  as

murder  when they knew, at the end of it, they would be  hanged.

He did not answer the question.  They took it up to the Court of

Appeal  and the Court of Appeal was troubled with this question.

The  Court of Appeal felt that the presumption of innocence  was

very  strong.  The three men had been acquitted and someone else

had  been convicted. They felt there was this strong presumption

of innocence in favour of the accused

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>

who  were  claiming for damages for malicious prosecution.   But

the  Court of Appeal said in its judgment, "But we can  find  no

evidence   that   they   gave  evidence  before   the   Judicial

Commissioner  that  they were innocent and that  they  were  not

there  at the scene of the crime."  That was an error.  A  total

error.   They  had  adjourned  their  decision  and  gave  their

judgment.   But they overlooked the evidence the men had  given.

Yet,  in  their own affidavit of evidence filed, in the  hearing

before  the  Judicial  Commissioner, every  single  accused  had

started his affidavit by saying, "I am totally innocent of  this

crime.   I was never there.  I knew nothing about this.  I  deny

the charge right from the start."  So the evidence was there and

yet the Court of Appeal missed that evidence.  If there had been

a  further  appeal available to the three men, they  could  have

gone up to the appellate court.  But that was not possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, your time is up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam :</b> May I say those men have now been made

bankrupt.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank Members

who   have   spoken  and  several  comments,  observations   and

criticisms  have  been made.  I will try to categorise  them  in

broad categories and deal with the issues that they have raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, several Members have expressed the concern that this

somehow  will  affect  access  to  justice  and  there  will  be

restrictions  on justice.  Much has been said by  Members  about

the   inherent  right  for  litigants  to  appeal.   Some   have

emphasised  the importance of automatic appeal.   Mr  Jeyaretnam

even  thought that this amendment raises questions  of  equality

under  the Constitution.  Before we get carried away in thinking

that this amendment has come out of the blue, never done before,

and that it violates some sacrosanct principles, I would like to

inform Members of the background.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background is that all these years, the principle that leave

to appeal is required, coupled with a monetary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>

threshold, is not new.  It has always been there in our  statute

books.  That is the first point I wish to make.  I think Members

should know that this system of leave to appeal, coupled with  a

monetary  limit,  has  been an essential feature  of  our  legal

system.  It  has been in our laws since 1955.  In  fact,  before

that,  in  1936, there was no appeal when the amount  was  below

$100.  At that time the jurisdiction of the Court was $500.  So,

in  case Members did not realise it, the monetary limit is  part

and parcel of this principle of leave to appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, periodic adjustments of the monetary limit is also not

new,  and it has never been argued before that having that limit

and  persons who do not qualify under the limit having to  apply

for  leave  -  it  has never been argued that justice  has  been

denied  and access to justice restricted.  Because some  of  the

speakers  seem to be unaware of this background, let  me  remind

them of how this has evolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1986, the monetary limit was $500 in the Subordinate

Courts,  or with leave if the amount was less.  This element  of

being  able  to  apply for leave has always been there,  if  the

amount was not reached.  So the monetary limit was $500 and  the

jurisdictional  limit  of  the Subordinate  Courts  was  $10,000

before   1986.   In  1986,  the  jurisdictional  limit  of   the

Subordinate Courts was raised to $50,000.  When that  was  done,

the  appeal threshold limit was then raised from $500 to $2,000,

a  four-fold  increase.  I was then in Parliament.   Of  course,

some  of  the Members who spoke were not there.  But  I  do  not

recall  any  Member  then arguing that this was  curtailment  of

justice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, seven years later, the jurisdictional limit of the

Subordinate Courts was raised to $100,000.  The appeal threshold

limit  was  then  raised from $2,000 to $5,000,   2  1/2  times.

Again, I stress, the element of applying for leave to appeal was

always there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 1997, the jurisdictional limit for the

Subordinate  Courts was raised to $250,000.  But last  year  the

courts did not propose that the appeal be immediately

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>

changed.  It was kept at $5,000, and monitored for a year.  Now,

we  are  altering the appeal limit to $50,000.  The  element  of

leave  being given is still being retained.  So the point to  be

underscored  is  that with the increase in jurisdiction  of  our

Subordinate  Courts to $250,000, obviously more and  more  cases

are going to be heard by the Subordinate Courts.  Therefore, the

threshold  for  appeals has to be adjusted.  Then  the  question

arises:  what  is the figure?  $10,000, $15,000,  $20,000?   The

Chief Justice has proposed it be raised to $50,000.  I would, as

the  Minister for Law, accept the judgement of the Chief Justice

who  is in charge of administration of the courts and who has  a

good  overview of the management of cases.  That  is  the  first

point  I  would  make.  So let's be clear about the  background.

This  is  not  something that has come out of the blue,  it  was

never   done   before.   These  are  periodic   adjustments   of

jurisdictional  limits and threshold limits  for  appeals.   All

along,  those who do not meet the threshold limits did not  have

automatic appeal. But it does not mean that the right of  appeal

was  curtailed  because they could have  applied  for  leave  to

appeal.  If there were merits and they made a case, leave  would

be granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to make to those who have suggested

that  it somehow conjures up curtailment of justice, some  grave

injustice  is being done, is to say that that is a  very  narrow

way  of  approaching  the issue.  They  proceed  on  the  narrow

assumption  that the more appeals you have, the  more  tiers  of

appeals  you have, the more automatic appeals you have, that  is

justice.  I do not think it follows.  That is a narrow  view  of

looking  at the whole system of justice because looking  at  the

administration of justice in totality, you have to view what the

courts  have  done  in the past many years.  A  whole  array  of

reforms has been undertaken by the courts.  Rather than conclude

that  automatic  appeals,  greater number  of  appeals,  greater

number  of  tiers  of  appeals equals better  administration  of

justice, why not examine and inquire what the courts have  done,

which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>

is  a  pro-active case management approach to administration  of

justice?   In  fact it saves time, cost and trauma and  emotions

for  potential  litigants, with lesser cases  having  to  go  to

trial,  and lesser cases going to appeal.  Does that necessarily

mean it is bad for justice?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The justice system in Singapore has undergone tremendous reforms

and many initiatives have been taken by the courts.  The quality

of  judgments, quality of judges improves and judges handle  the

cases  and  deal  with them seriously and fewer appeals  go  up.

Does  this  necessarily mean bad?  I do not  think  it  follows.

Therefore, I would stress that we should look at the totality of

our  justice system.  Look at the whole context of the proactive

approach  taken by the courts because they have indeed  taken  a

wide  variety  of  measures which have  in  fact  benefited  the

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A notable example that comes to my mind is mediation of civil

cases  since  1994.   The law did not require  it.   It  was  an

initiative,  an innovation of the courts, that all  civil  cases

are mediated before trial, and the settlement rate is 92%.  From

1995 to October 1998, only 1.6% of 125,000 civil cases proceeded

to  trial.  If you proceed on the assumption that the more cases

the  better, obviously it is a bad system of justice!   I  would

like to put it to colleagues here that this system of mediation,

where  so many cases have been settled, has in fact resulted  in

substantial  savings  of  money, time, heartache,  emotion,  for

potential litigants.  None of the MPs have touched on this.   In

fact,  the  justice system as evolved by our  courts  under  the

leadership of the Chief Justice has in fact led to two bites  at

the  cherry.  One bite is to have the case resolved by mediation

first.  If that fails, then a second bite at the trial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the other proactive measures taken by the courts - mediation and counselling in matrimonial cases which can cause

tremendous  emotional  trauma  for  the  husband  or  wife   and

children.  The number of cases now going to trial is very small.

The  courts have reduced the time lag between setting  down  the

case and hearing in the High Court where they had a target of 18

months, and I am told the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>

target has been reached.  Even the Subordinate Courts cases  are

fixed  within three to four weeks from the time that the parties

are  ready.  Pre-trial conferences, electronic filing of  cases,

ability  of people to pay fines through ATOMs without having  to

go  to the Subordinate Courts.  And the Subordinate Courts  have

now  also had a recent soft launching of its innovative  concept

known  as  "Multi-door Hot House", which is a  one-stop  service

centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I mention all this? Because I am troubled by the

approach  taken by some of my colleagues who seem to focus  just

on  this  right  of  appeal.  They have not been  aware  that  a

periodic  adjustment has been done from 1986,  and  before  that

too.   We  have  to  do  this because  the  monetary  limit  was

increased in 1987 to $250,000.  Do not take a narrow view.   You

have to look at the whole system of justice and it is because of

all  these  reforms taken that our judiciary has been given  top

marks,  not  by  me, speaking as the Minister for  Law,  but  by

independent international rating agencies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> By the ICJ.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> ICJ is not an independent rating agency!

In  the  PERC  study, August 1998, on the ranking of Singapore's

Police  and  Judiciary  among certain countries,  Singapore  was

rated  to have the best national institutions in Asia.   In  the

ranking of the judiciary and the police, Singapore topped  again

with a score of 2.87 whereas the rating of the United States and

Hong  Kong  was  3 and 3.11 respectively.  Since an  interesting

debate is going to come later on, PERC commented:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surprisingly, for a country where the Government is often

accused by foreign human rights activists (and if I may add,  by

somebody  else)  of  using the judiciary to pursue  politically-motivated  libel  suits,  our  American  respondents  living  in

Singapore  even  rated  the island's judicial  system  as  being

superior to that of the United States."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please bear in mind this total approach to the administration of

justice, and I think colleagues should really join me in  giving

top   marks  to  our  judiciary,  ie,  the  Supreme  Court,  the

Subordinate  Courts and our Chief Justice.  I  think  they  have

done

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  proud.  Far from curtailing access to  justice,  they

have  in fact gone out of their way to deliver justice in a more

user-friendly and more efficient way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the statistics are interesting. When the appeal limit

was  $5,000 in the Subordinate Courts, in 1996 the total  number

of claims filed in the Subordinate Courts was 29,281.  Of these,

425 went to trial.  Of these, only 83 went on appeal.  Of these,

only  15  appeals were allowed, less than 1%.  In  1997,  32,088

claims  were  filed in the Subordinate Courts.  Only  462  cases

went to trial.  Of these, 87 went up on appeal, of which 14 were

allowed.   In 1998, up to October this year, 36,269 claims  were

filed in the Subordinate Courts.  469 went to trial, and 97 went

up on appeal.  The point I am making is that the system has just

evolved  shows  that  many cases have been mediated.   Only  the

cases  that deserve to go on trial, or fail mediation,  went  to

trial.   Of  that, not many went on appeal.  So  the  system  of

jurisdiction limits and threshold limits for appeals works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the small number of cases that later went to

trial  shows  the high quality of the Subordinate Court  Judges.

It  shows that the regular adjustment of monetary limits ensures

that  only  serious appeals go up.  Otherwise, many other  cases

would have gone up and occupied precious High Court time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding what I have said and the variation to the

limits proposed in the amendment, colleagues have noted that the

amendment provides for the President, in consultation  with  the

Chief Justice, to vary the amounts so the Courts can monitor the

number of appeals and the number of applications filed for leave

to  appeal.   If necessary, in the light of experience  of  what

happens,  the  amount  can be decreased  or  adjusted.   Several

Members  - Mr Simon Tay, Mr Ravindran, Mr Shriniwas Rai  and  Mr

Jeyaretnam  -  took umbrage at this provision and said  this  is

intrinsically wrong, it is Parliament which should  decide,  and

Parliament  should be the sole arbiter, whether  this  or  other

limit.   We can argue this and debate it.  But who is  the  best

judge of what limit best works?  We in Parliament?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Of course.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam says, of course. The

administration of the Courts is really under the  leadership  of

the  Chief Justice.  He has brought the Courts and developed the

Courts  to a situation which has today earned praise and  kudos.

I  for one would have full confidence in the Chief Justice,  and

in  the  light of experience, depending on the number of  cases,

this figure can be adjusted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay raised a question as to whether there are some

constitutional principles involved here.  But I must be  careful

not  to give any authoritative pronouncement or purport to  make

any  authoritative pronouncement on constitutional issue.   With

that  caveat, let me say also that the Attorney-General is  very

careful  when  he  drafts Bills that he would  have  taken  into

account the constitutional aspect of the Bill.  But to answer Mr

Simon  Tay's  question, I would think that this  provision  does

fall  within  Article 21(5) of the Constitution  which  provides

that, "The Legislature may by law make provision to require  the

President   to   act  after  consultation  with,   or   on   the

recommendation of, any person or body of persons other than  the

Cabinet  in the exercise of his functions other than . [the  two

provisos are not applicable here.]"  But let me say to Mr  Simon

Tay  that, in practice, the Chief Justice, on such matters,  has

close  consultations with the Attorney-General who in turn  also

consults me for my views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have suggested raising the figure to $10,000 or

$15,000.   This is a matter for judgement really at the  end  of

the day.  If you say the figure has to be raised, and has to  be

raised because of the upping of the limit last year to $250,000,

then  it is a relative matter, whether it is $10,000 or $15,000.

I  think  $10,000 or $15,000, in fact, comes very close  to  the

cases  which  the Small Claims Tribunal hears, ie, cases  up  to

$10,000,  and with the consent of both parties, up  to  $20,000.

So  to raise it to $10,000 or $15,000, which will come so close,

and overlap with the Small Claims Tribunal, may be unrealistic.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another argument was made by more than one speaker who

suggested   that  this  amendment  gives  the  impression   that

litigants  who have larger claims have better access to  justice

and  better rights, and that this amendment may favour the rich.

But  they  fail  to  look at it from the other  point  of  view.

Because   you  can  have  a  "rich"  plaintiff,  big   corporate

plaintiff,  suing  a  small-timer, small businessman.   A  small

businessman  wins  a  case,  the plaintiff,  if  not  for  these

threshold limits, because he can afford it, can take it all  the

way  up  the ladder to the different tiers of appeal  where  the

small-time defendant, who has won the case, would not be able to

afford.  So it works both ways.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Legal aid.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> It works both ways. So it does not

follow ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, if you have anything to

say,  could you please get my attention first?  Please continue,

Prof. Jayakumar.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Thank you, Sir. So the Members who made

that point have failed to look at it from the other side of  the

coin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I touch on the amendments to section 60? First, Prof.

Chin Tet Yung has made some interesting observations.  He agrees

with  the  premise that there should be a difference  between  a

reference  or a question by the Attorney-General and application

to  refer by the accused person.  I think he accepts there is  a

fundamental  distinction.  But as I listened to  his  speech,  I

think he made two separate points.  First, he proposes that  the

Attorney-General's  reference ought  to  be  distinct  from  the

reference  by the accused convicted person.  And he  would  want

the Attorney-General to have the right to refer any question  of

law  unconnected  with  the accused  person.   I  think  we  can

consider  that.   Of  course,  he  would  have  noted  that  the

amendment  does  make  a distinction in a  sense  that  for  the

accused  person, the Court has a discretion whether  to  reserve

the  question for decision by the Court of Appeal.  In the  case

of  an  application  by  the Attorney-General,  the  Judge  must

reserve  the question, provided the other ingredients  are  met.

He has referred to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>

United  Kingdom's position.  Of course, in the  United  Kingdom,

the  conviction and acquittal is not disturbed by the  Court  of

Appeal's  decision.   Our  existing  provision,  including   the

amendment that we propose to make, is different because in cases

of  acquittal, the Court of Appeal's practice is not to  disturb

the  acquittal  even  if they agree with the  arguments  of  the

public  prosecutor.  But the Court of Appeal can set  aside  the

conviction  if  the point of law is decided against  the  public

prosecutor's arguments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he made a second and even broader proposal, which is

that  the  Attorney-General should have the power to  refer  any

question  de  novo without direct reference to any  case,  as  I

understand  it.  And he says it will help in the development  of

the  law, and I believe he was supported by Mr Shriniwas Rai who

has  gone  further  and said even hypothetical  cases  could  be

raised.   The significance of this proposal is that it would  be

delinking from the other elements which have to be satisfied  in

the  existing provision, ie, that it must arise in a  particular

criminal matter and the determination of that question must have

affected  the  case.   But he has clarified  that  he  is  still

talking  about criminal cases.  I am prepared to look into  this

and  discuss  it with the Attorney-General, and if  we  conclude

that  there  is  merit  in this, we may well  have  to  come  to

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam, as he himself admits, has raised much of

what  he has said before.  The first point he makes is that  the

public   prosecutor  ought  not  to  have  this  special   right

distinguished from the application by the accused -  application

by the accused is discretionary; the Court can turn it down, but

the  application  by the Attorney-General has  to  be  approved,

provided it meets these other elements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this so? Instead of giving a lengthy reply, since

he  raised it on 30th July 1997, my colleague, Minister of State

Ho Peng Kee, gave an excellent reply which was as follows, and I

quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the Public Prosecutor prosecutes cases, he prosecutes

in  the public interest.  If there is a point of public interest

that needs the clarification of a full

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>

Court  of  Appeal, then as Public Prosecutor he should have  the

leeway so that the point of law can be conclusively decided."



But,  then,  Mr  Jeyaretnam  says  on  the  question  of  public

interest,  we  are  out  of line with other  jurisdictions,  and

public  interest  must  be determined by  the  Court.   He  even

referred  to  Malaysia.   He should  double  check  the  law  in

Malaysia because in the case of Public Prosecutor v Lim Joo Soon

[1981]  1  Malayan  Law Journal, page 107,  this  was  what  the

Federal Court had to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". The Public Prosecutor's application coming as it is as

from  such  an  august  officer of  the  law  removes  from  the

discretion  of  the  court the right to decide  on  whether  the

question  is  of  public interest.  When the  Public  Prosecutor

applies  for  a reference . it must be taken that  any  question

posed  by him is of public interest, unless of course it can  be

shown  that the question is indeed of his own personal  interest

and of no one else."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be useful for me to explain to this House why is it that

the Attorney-General's conclusion that the question he is posing

or  is  applying  to refer a matter of public interest  must  be

taken  to  be a public interest.  And the best I can  do  is  to

reproduce  part of the judgement of the Court of Appeal  in  the

Public  Prosecutor v Bridges Christopher case (1998).   In  that

case,  the argument was made by the Attorney-General.   But  the

court found that his submissions were "compelling" but felt that

the  existing provision was not appropriately worded.   This  is

what the Attorney-General argued, and this is summarised by  the

Court  in  its judgement and I think it succinctly puts  forward

the rationale for this amendment to section 60. I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Public Prosecutor is responsible for and represents

the  State  in all criminal prosecutions.  He is also the  Chief

Legal  Adviser to the Government on what the law is.  He  has  a

duty  to  enforce what he believes to be the right law which  no

one  has.   Therefore  if  he does not agree  with  the  law  as

pronounced by the High Court, he should be entitled to go to the

Court  of  Appeal for a final ruling.  Accordingly,  the  Public

Prosecutor  submitted in the case that any  Public  Prosecutor's

questions which satisfy the three conditions would invariably be

one  of public interest based on the need to have a final ruling

for future cases.  He further submitted that a determination  by

the  Court of Appeal advances the public interest in reinforcing

the  finality principle in the following ways:  (a)  the  Public

Prosecutor  is  thereafter  able to decide  on  prosecutions  in

accordance with the Court of Appeal's decision;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Public Prosecutor is able to advise the

Government on whether or not it is desirable to change the  law;

and   (c)   where  the  Court  of  Appeal  upholds  the   Public

Prosecutor's  case,  all convictions and acquittals  founded  on

that  principle  of  law are likely to end  at  the  Subordinate

Courts."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Court of Appeal's judgement is that the

Attorney-General's submissions were compelling,  the  Government

has agreed to give effect to it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I raise a number of

points with the Minister by way of clarification?  As I listened

to  his  reply,  I noted that he was saying that the  number  of

cases  had  decreased tremendously, not only by the transfer  of

the  cases  above  $50,000  to the  Subordinate  Courts  by  the

amendment  made  last  year, but as a result  of  the  mediation

process  introduced in this country.  I am all for it.   But  to

say  that we have mediation and we do not need appeals seems  to

me to miss the point altogether.  If that is true ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am asking him some questions, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could you please ask your question but do not

embark on a new speech and enter into a debate?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, all right. Mr Speaker, Sir, I accept

your ruling.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. Make your clarification now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, I have got questions to ask him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. Ask your questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> If the number of cases has been reduced,

then  what is the compelling need for this amendment?   Are  our

judges overworked with appeals at the moment?  May I ask all the

questions so that Prof. Jayakumar does not have to jump up every

few  minutes.   May I point out to him, by way of clarification,

that  I  was  not  relying  on  the  Malaysian  Court  for   the

proposition that public interest is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>

matter  for the courts.  I am sure he is aware of the  decisions

in  the  House  of Lords, on appeals from Scotland and  England,

that  public interest is eminently a matter that should be  left

to  the  courts, and he mentioned Christopher Bridges'  case.  I

stand  corrected of course, but the Court of Appeal  there  said

that  the  question  of public interest was  a  matter  for  the

courts.   It did.  So there we have it, supporting what  I  said

that it should be a matter for the courts and not for the Public

Prosecutor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I ask the Minister whether it is the speedy

administration of justice that is important in society?   It  is

important.   Or  is  it the perception in the public  mind  that

every  citizen will get the justice that is satisfactory and  of

which  he  can  feel satisfied?  Which is more important  -  the

perception  of  justice by the public at  large  or  the  speedy

administration of justice?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first point, I

did  not  say that, because there is mediation, there should  be

lesser  appeals.  I raised the point on mediation  to  make  the

broader  point to urge colleagues to look at the total  approach

to the administration of justice which our courts have taken and

that  is a considerable development for which the courts are  to

be congratulated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also not justified this amendment on the ground that

there  is a tremendous overload or flood of cases.  The point  I

made here is that the main reason is because of the increase  of

the  jurisdictional limit to $250,000, there will be more cases.

And  as we have done before, we will have to increase the appeal

limit so as to be in line with the jurisdictional limit.   As  I

conceded, we can have a debate on whether it should be  $50,000,

$40,000,  $30,000, and so on.  It is a relative  matter.   I  am

more  than  willing to defer to the wise judgement of the  Chief

Justice   in  this  regard  because  he  is  dealing  with   the

administration of the courts on a daily basis.  Who  are  we  to

second  guess  and  say, "Well, it should  be  $40,000  and  not

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Jeyaretnam extols what is going on in the United

Kingdom and what the courts have decided.  I should point out to

him  that  the provision in the United Kingdom which Prof.  Chin

Tet Yung referred to, would enable the Attorney-General there to

refer a point to the court, if I am not mistaken, whether or not

it  is of public interest.  So the United Kingdom's approach  in

an  analogous provision delinks it from the public interest.  Mr

Jeyaretnam is shaking his head.  But he may do well to  look  up

section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1972.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Christopher Bridges' case indeed. If he had listened

carefully  to what I have said, I said that the Attorney-General

argued  and made a lengthy submission as to why there were  very

good  reasons for interpreting the provisions in such a way that

when the Attorney-General makes an application for reference  of

a  question,  it should be considered to be of public  interest.

The  court  found that argument compelling but the  section,  as

worded,  they  did  not feel it was appropriate  to  accept  the

Attorney-General's  argument.  Therefore,  the  law  has  to  be

amended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question he asked is that he seems to imply that

all  the measures which I have praised the court are really  for

the  speedy administration of justice, ie, speed at the  expense

of  justice being done.  Actually, if you examine what  happens,

the  measures  taken  by the courts involve more  time,  effort,

energy  and  work  by the judges, the Registrars  and  everybody

involved.  They need not have done it.  They can just say,  "You

have come to sue?  A wants to sue B?  Fine, let's have a trial."

The  amount  of  work  it takes for counselling  in  family  and

matrimonial  affairs and the amount of work  it  takes  to  have

mediation is tremendous.  So it is not speed in wanting  to  get

rid  of  these cases.  It is in fact with the desire  to  ensure

that  the parties are able to resolve the cases before they come

to  trial  that  motivates them.  And I think  that  is  a  very

important  principle in the administration of justice  which  we

should not forget.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have another question. Is the Minister

aware that, in some cases I know personally, a lot of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>

compulsion is brought on litigants and even in criminal cases to

either plead guilty or settle the cases?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Since Mr Jeyaretnam says he knows

personally that there is certain compulsion, he should raise  it

with  the appropriate authorities, either with the Registrar  of

the  court or the Law Society.  This is not the place for us  to

determine whether he is right or wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I would like my vote to be recorded as

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.28 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in July last year, I informed this House that the

Tripartite Committee on Extension of Retirement Age had proposed

that  the  retirement age be extended from 60 to 62 with  effect

from   1st   January  1999.   The  Tripartite   Committee   also

recommended the reduction in the employer's CPF contribution for

workers above the age of 60 and allowing employers to reduce the

wage cost of older employees by up to 10%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the raising of the retirement age is a strategic move

to tackle the problem brought about by our ageing population and

declining  birth  rates.  Currently, eight  economically  active

persons  aged between 15 and 59 support one person aged  60  and

above.  This ratio will decline

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>

sharply  in future.  By the year 2010, there will only  be  four

economically active persons supporting one person  aged  60  and

above.   This ratio is expected to fall further to  2.5  in  the

year 2030.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this decline in economically active persons will

affect  our economic vitality.  The working population  will  be

faced  with an increasingly heavy burden of having to support  a

growing number of elderly persons who are not able to work.  The

growing  number  of economically inactive senior  citizens  will

also  place  a heavy demand for a wide range of social  services

including health care.  This will result in a heavier tax burden

on those who are still working.  Furthermore, a dwindling supply

of  local workers will compel employers to turn to more  foreign

workers  to  meet their manpower needs.  While  an  increase  in

skilled  and  talented  foreign workers  will  be  an  asset  to

Singapore,  an  increase  in  the number  of  unskilled  foreign

workers will create more social problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life expectancy at birth is 77 years. Many

Singaporeans are healthy and vigorous well beyond  60  years  of

age.   It is a waste of valuable human resources if workers  are

required to retire at the age of 60 when they are still able  to

add  value to the economy.  Moreover, an early retirement  means

that  a  retired worker or retiree will have to start living  on

the  CPF  savings much earlier.  This will result  in  a  faster

depletion  of  their retirement savings. Hence, an extension  of

the retirement age will not only maximise the utilisation of our

human  resources, it will also provide the opportunity for older

workers  to  continue earning a regular income and  accumulating

more savings for their eventual retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that most developed countries are

already  ahead of us in this area.  The retirement age  norm  in

countries  like  Germany, Switzerland, United  Kingdom,  Sweden,

Netherlands  and  Italy is 65.  Some countries like  Norway  and

Denmark  set a higher retirement age of 67 years.  We understand

that the United States has recently announced its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>

long-term  plan to raise the retirement age to 70.  The  current

retirement  age is 65 and is due to increase to  67  next  year.

Even  in the Asian NIEs, workers are now working well beyond  60

years. For example, retirement age norm in Taiwan is now 65.  As

a  country  with  a  small population, we  should  maximize  our

limited   indigenous   human  resource,  including   the   older

Singaporeans  who have accumulated valuable skills  and  working

experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be no doubt that raising the retirement age

will  generate  long  term benefits for  our  economy,  for  the

employers and also for the workers themselves.  It is a  win-win

strategy.  Despite the current economic downturn and an increase

in  unemployment rate, we should not ignore the long-term impact

of  a  rapidly  aging workforce.  We need to take  a  pro-active

approach  to  address the issue now before it  develops  into  a

serious  problem in future.  The time to tackle  such  potential

problems  is  now,  not  when  our  competitiveness  is  already

seriously  weakened by an aging workforce.  But in  raising  the

retirement  age,  we must not ignore the reality  to  employers,

which  is,  the cost of employing older workers is higher  as  a

result of our seniority-based wage scale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current wage structure, the longer a worker has

been  employed,  the higher is his pay.  In  other  words,  wage

levels  are  determined more by an employee's length of  service

than the value of his job or performance.  As a result, wages of

older  workers  are not closely linked to their productivity  or

performance.  Consequently, older workers are often  being  paid

beyond their job worth.  That is why employers are reluctant  to

retain or to employ older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the problems of the seniority-based-wage system,

the  Tripartite Committee on the Extension of Retirement Age had

recommended  that  employers should implement the  base-up  wage

system.   The adoption of the base-up wage system will  help  to

narrow   the  maximum-minimum  salary  ratio  and  enable   wage

increases  to  be  more  closely  linked  to  productivity   and

performance.  However, before the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>

base-up wage system can be implemented, companies have to adjust

their salary ratio to the optimal level of 1.5:1.  Since it will

take  some  time  to  achieve  the  optimal  salary  ratio,  the

Tripartite  Committee  recommended  that  employers  should   be

allowed to initiate a wage cut of up to 10% for employees  above

the  age  of 60.  This measure will make it more attractive  for

employers to retain their older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To supplement the 10% wage cut for older workers, the

Tripartite   Committee  also  proposed   that   employer's   CPF

contribution rate for employees aged 60-65 years be reduced from

7.5% to 4% and from 5% to 4% for employees aged above 65 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation to introduce wage and CPF cuts came

about  after  extensive  discussions and  deliberations  by  the

Tripartite Committee.  The Committee took note of the fact  that

since  most  workers  are on the seniority wage  system,  it  is

currently not uncommon for an employee to accept a wage  cut  of

20%  to  25%  when  they are re-employed upon retirement  at  60

years.  The Tripartite Committee's proposal to cut wages  by  up

to 10% in addition to the CPF cut is therefore a more favourable

arrangement for older workers.  This should encourage more older

workers  to work beyond 60 and continue to contribute  to  their

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the employers have given the full discretion to

initiate a wage cut, the Tripartite Committee also urged them to

be judicious in implementing this policy.  Employers should bear

in  mind  that  the  wage  cut is introduced  with  the  aim  to

rectifying  the problems arising out of the seniority-based-wage

system  and  to bring wages of older workers in line with  their

productivity and performance.  They should therefore  take  into

account  their companies' maximum-minimum salary ratio, as  well

as  their  job  worth  and performance of older  employees  when

deciding  on making the wage cut.  A wage cut is not  needed  if

the  older employees' salaries are already reflective  of  their

job  worth or their productivity or where their productivity and

performance already justify their salaries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the Bill seeks to amend the Retirement Age Act

(Cap  274A)  to  enable employers to reduce the wages  of  their

employees who attain the age of 60 years and above, on or  after

1st  January  1999.  The higher retirement age  of  62  will  be

effected separately through Regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill introduces a new section 4A to spell

out  the  circumstances and conditions whereby an  employer  can

reduce the wages of employees above the age of 60.  This section

stipulates that an employer should give reasonable prior  notice

in  writing to an older employee of the intention to reduce  his

salary.   The prior notice should furnish information,  such  as

the  amount and the effective date of the reduction.  The extent

of  the wage reduction is limited to 10% of the employee's  wage

at the age of 60.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers will be required to give the older employees a

reasonable  opportunity to consider and respond to the  proposed

wage  reduction.  In the event that no agreement can be reached,

the  older  employee  may choose to retire on  his  own  accord.

Alternatively, the employer may retire him from service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 4A(5)(a) lays down the grounds whereby

employers can initiate a wage cut.  It states that the reduction

shall  be  based  on reasonable factors, such as the  employee's

productivity,  performance,  duties  and  responsibilities,  and

whether  he is on a seniority-based-wage system.  Employers  are

prohibited from initiating a wage cut solely on the ground of an

employee's  age, unless age is a bona-fide requirement  for  the

performance of his job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide more flexibility, section 4A(5)(b) allows

employers to introduce the wage cut, either at the age of 60  or

at  any  age  above  60.   Hence,  in  a  situation  whereby  an

employee's  salary is still reflective of the job worth  at  the

age of 60 but not beyond, his employer can choose not to cut his

wages  at the age of 60 but to initiate a cut later on, say,  at

age  61.   At  the  same time, employers are allowed  to  either

introduce a one-off cut in the wages of their older employees by

up to 10%, or to stagger the wage cut in such a manner

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>

that  the total extent of the reduction does not exceed  10%  of

the  employee's  wages  at age 60.  In  view  of  the  differing

productivity levels and performances among employees, the extent

of the wage cut could vary from one employee to another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill hence enables employers to implement the wage

reduction  in  a manner most suited to the company's  needs  and

circumstances.   However, employers should  follow  closely  the

Tripartite  Committee's  recommendation  of  initiating  a  wage

reduction  either  through  a  direct  wage  cut  or  through  a

combination  of  various wage cost items  which  include  fringe

benefits, variable bonus, AWS and the basic wage.  In  the  case

of unionized companies, the union concerned should be consulted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the key recommendations on raising the retirement

age   and  reducing  wages  of  older  workers,  the  Tripartite

Committee  also proposed several other measures to  address  the

problems of an aging workforce.  These include :-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 25-year cap on the service period for the calculation of

retrenchment benefit;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoption of a base-up-wage system in place of the seniority-based-wage system;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Alternative Medical Benefit Scheme in place of the

current medical benefit scheme; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An outplacement programme to assist older workers who

cannot  be re-deployed within the company, to secure a  suitable

job in another company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are supplementary measures to address concerns of the

high  costs of retaining older workers. These measures  will  be

implemented through the tripartite guidelines.  We do  not  need

legislative  changes at this juncture for  the  measures  to  be

applied.   In  fact,  some  employers and  unions  have  already

started  to  implement  these  measures.   While  some  teething

problems  may crop up at the initial stage of implementation,  I

am  confident with good tripartite co-operation, we will be able

to make progress in these reforms.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the retirement age was raised from

55  to 60 in 1993, it had provided employment opportunities  for

some  63,000  employees who are above the age of 55.   With  the

raising  of  the  retirement age to 62,  it  is  estimated  that

another 7,000 employees who will turn 60 next year will benefit.

In the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year of the implementation, about 10,000

workers are expected to benefit each year.  The raising  of  the

retirement  age  is clearly beneficial to older  workers  as  it

allows  them  to remain gainfully employed for a longer  period.

Employers  will also stand to gain from the retention  of  these

skilled and experienced workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, thank you for

allowing me to speak on this interesting Bill.  I fully  support

this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the picture painted by the Minister is indeed a very

challenging  one for all of us in Singapore because  demographic

transition  will be very dramatic in the years  ahead.   By  the

Year  2010,  as the Minister has stated, the population  of  the

aged  could  become quite dramatic and grave for us.   It  is  a

issue well thought of, because we would have to think about  how

we  need to deal with this challenging issue of the future,  ie,

the  greying  of Singapore.  The Bill will be relevant  at  this

juncture,  but  it  will be redundant in the future  because  we

would not be able to talk about retirement in the years ahead as

nobody   will  be  retiring  and  the  work  world  will  change

significantly.   Nobody will be allowed to  retire.   Mind  you,

some  of you would not be allowed to get off!  You will be  kept

as long as possible and there will be no retirement, Mr Speaker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be the issue of information technology. With

the change of work itself, people will be retained as long as it

is possible and it is not a picture that we can avoid.  It could

be a real picture in future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in relation to this Bill, it will enhance the employability

of  the retirees and this is good.  It enables various companies

to think about retaining older workers and this is indeed a very

positive  move.   But there are a few areas of  concern  that  I

would  like  to raise, because with this transition, there  will

obviously be areas of disputes related to wages.  I want to find

out  from the Minister who mediates in case there is dispute  on

the  wages. I can understand that for workers who are unionised,

the  unions would be able to represent them.  But there are lots

of  workers who are not unionised and one needs to look  at  how

their interest could be protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there would be a lot of employers who might take

advantage of this Bill and try and find a leverage to retire off

people  earlier  than they should.  So there  will  be  to  some

extent  older workers who would be got rid off because they  are

either  not  really productive or found not to be  suitable,  or

some  excuses could be given to terminate them from  their  work

world.  I want to find out what protection or recourse would  be

available   to   ensure  that  older  workers   would   not   be

unjustifiably  retired  off earlier  than  they  should  by  the

employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Bill as a whole, I agree with it because it

is  going to help us meet the challenges of the aging population

of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, to those who have reached the age of 60, "1-1-99" is a very

important  number  to  remember because, with  effect  from  1st

January  1999,  the  Ministry of Manpower  will  raise  the  new

retirement age from 60 to 62.  The new Act will allow  employers

to  cut up to 10% of the wages of employees beyond the age of 60

over a period of two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support this Bill. For employees who have reached

the  age of 60, the employers' CPF contribution has already been

reduced  from 20% to 4%.  With the recently announced employers'

cost-cutting measures, this will again be cut by 2%.   In  other

words, the employers'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>

CPF  contribution will be reduced from 20% to  2%,  which  is  a

reduction of 18%.  This will reduce the income of the employees.

During  their  years  of employment, these employees  have  made

contributions to the company.  They worked hard for the company.

I  hope that when employers are deciding on the wage-cut of  the

employees,  they will consider all these factors.  At  the  same

time,  they must also value and treasure the experience acquired

by the older employees.  I feel that the wage-cuts should not be

exercised too frequently, otherwise the employers will  be  busy

calculating  the  amounts  to be cut  all  the  time  while  the

employees will be bogged down with worries and anxiety and  lose

heart   to  work.   Efficiency  will  be  affected.    So   will

productivity.   So  I  would suggest that wage  cuts  should  be

limited to not more than once a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private companies and the civil service should adopt the

principle  of  annual increments to evaluate the performance  of

their  employees  before the employers decide  whether  the  pay

should  be  cut  or  not.   An annual  appraisal  will  be  more

rational.  Secondly, under the Bill, the employers who intend to

cut the pay of employees must give reasonable advance notice  in

writing  to  the employees so as to give the employees  time  to

consider  the  matter. As such, I would propose  that  the  Bill

should  specify that the employees must be given  at  least  one

month's  notice  and  should  be  required  to  reply  to  their

employers within one month whether they accept the terms.   With

the  stipulation of one month, it is good for both sides.  There

will be no unnecessary controversies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the civil servants who are under the pension

scheme  will  be seriously affected by this new Bill  when  they

reach  the  retirement  age at 60.  I  would  propose  that  the

Government  consider allowing civil servants  to  collect  their

lump sum pension when they reach the age of 60 and then continue

to work in keeping with the spirit of the new Bill.  These civil

servants have worked their whole adult working lives in  various

Ministries   and   Government   departments   and   have    made

contributions to the development of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>

Singapore.  I hope the Government will allow them to take  their

pensions  and also to continue working  under the provisions  of

the new law.

I support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the amendment in the Retirement Age (Amendment) Bill,

moved  by  the  Minister for Manpower, and I  also  support  the

raising  of  the retirement age for the reasons  stated  by  the

Minister and Dr Vasoo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the seniority-based wage system, practised by the vast

majority of employers in Singapore, increases the wages of  most

workers  every  year through service annual  increments.   As  a

result  of  these  increments, older workers  generally  receive

higher  wages compared to younger workers who are still  at  the

lower  end  of their salary scales even for doing the same  job.

This may create a situation eventually where it becomes less and

less  viable for companies to retain the services of their older

workers compared to the younger ones.  Employers may also resist

attempts  to  raise  the  retirement  age  as  it  will   become

progressively more expensive to retain an aging workforce.   The

situation  for  older  workers is especially  precarious  during

periods   of  economic  downturn,  as  companies  retrench   and

restructure their operations in order to remain competitive  and

to  survive the recession.  Higher-paid workers are more  likely

to  be  axed  if their jobs can be taken over by less  expensive

younger  workers.  Our older workers will find it more difficult

to hold on to their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>

jobs  in companies that are facing difficult times, as the  cost

differential of keeping them on the payroll compared to  younger

workers becomes too wide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from several Members in the last few days,

including  NTUC Secretary-General, that older workers  generally

experience more difficulty obtaining and fitting into new  jobs,

requiring new skills and offering lower salaries, when they  are

retrenched  compared  to  younger  workers.   It  is   therefore

imperative  that  measures be taken to  ensure  that  our  older

workers stand an equal chance of remaining employed and  not  be

placed  in  a  more disadvantaged position compared  to  younger

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of such measures becomes more critical in

these economically difficult times, as companies look at ways to

trim   costs.    Reduction  in  the  rate  of   employer's   CPF

contributions  for older workers had previously helped  to  keep

the  cost  differential of retaining older workers  compared  to

hiring  younger  ones  manageable.  The employers'  contribution

rate  for  younger  workers until recently stood  at  20%  while

employers  pay only 7.5% or less for workers over  55  years  of

age.   However,  with the impending reduction in employer's  CPF

contribution rate by 10% for younger workers, but only  by  3.5%

or  less  for  older  workers,  the comparative  cost  advantage

afforded  by lower CPF contributions for older workers  will  be

eroded.   Adjustments will have to be made in order  to  enhance

the  viability  for employers to retain or employ older  workers

while  ensuring that workers, regardless of their age,  continue

to  receive  a  fair  wage  for  their  experience,  skills  and

performance,  and  not  to be discriminated  against  purely  by

virtue of their age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendment for the reasons

that  have  been  stated.  However, I would  like  to  urge  the

Minister  to  consider safeguards that would  ensure  our  older

workers, whose salaries are at or below the market rate for  the

job,  would  not  be adversely affected by this amendment  where

their salaries can be further reduced by 10% when they attain 60

years of age.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 4A(3) of the amendment Bill stipulates that the

employer  has  to  give reasonable prior notice  to  the  worker

before reducing his salary, and that the worker must be given  a

reasonable  opportunity of being heard.   After  the  worker  is

heard,  new section 4A(3) implies that he is then left with  two

choices,  if  he is not happy with the reduction in his  salary.

He  can either retire or be retired by his employer.  In effect,

it  is  really no choice, and the worker has to retire.  Whether

it is voluntarily or involuntarily, it is really quite academic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to have seen a provision in the Bill that

would  provide the worker an exemption of the 10%  reduction  in

the  salary after he attains 60 years of age if he or his  union

is  able  to establish that his cost to his employer is no  more

than that of younger workers with equivalent job performance  in

similar jobs in his company, or that his wage is at or below the

market rate for this job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to urge the Minister to prohibit

employers  who  are  not  affected by the  seniority-based  wage

system  from  invoking the provisions in this Bill in  order  to

reduce the salaries of their older workers.  For example, if  an

employer  pays  his  workers a fixed hourly rate  for  the  job,

regardless  of the seniority of the worker, should the  employer

still  be permitted to reduce the salary of his employee by  10%

once he attains the age of 60 years?  To permit employers to  do

so   without   other   valid   grounds   would   tantamount   to

discrimination against the worker purely by virtue of his age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 4A(5) permits an employer to reduce the wages

of  the  older  employees differently for various reasons  other

than age.  However, this section may not have gone far enough to

prohibit  employers  not  affected by the  seniority-based  wage

system  from using provisions in this amendment Bill  to  reduce

wages  of their workers purely by them attaining the age  of  60

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on balance, I support the amendment Bill

as it will remove one more obstacle and one more excuse given by

some employers for not wanting to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>

employ older workers, and it will also enhance the prospects  of

further  extensions of the retirement age for  workers  who  may

want  to work beyond the current retirement age without imposing

too onerous a burden on employers, especially in these difficult

times.   However,  I  would  like to  request  the  Minister  to

consider further refinements to the provisions of the Retirement

Age Act in subsequent amendments after more companies modify  or

discard the seniority-based wage system for alternative systems.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today,

we  face economic difficulties.  The number of retrenchments has

risen  beyond 20,000, more than double the figure for the  whole

of  last  year.  The unemployment rate has shot up  to  4.5%  in

September,  more than double what it was in July.  So  when  the

number of jobless rises, we can expect some people to call for a

lowering  of the retirement age.  Yet, we are today  meeting  to

raise  our retirement age from 60 to 62, from 1st January  1999,

as scheduled.  Why are we doing this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has cited some statistics to show the very

rapid  rate which our population and workforce are ageing. Faced

with  this trend, I share the Minister's view that there  is  an

urgent  need  to  raise the retirement age.   With  rising  life

expectancy,  we should allow our older workers to remain  longer

in  the  workforce.   This  would enable  them  to  continue  to

contribute to the economy and remain financially independent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has provided convincing arguments on the need

to  cut the wages of older workers by up to 10%.  This issue has

been thoroughly discussed and agreed at the Tripartite Committee

on  the  Extension of the Retirement Age.  Unions and  employees

are  aware  of  the rationale behind the cut and  agreed  it  is

justifiable  under the seniority-based wage  system.   But  from

what  I know, most older employees are prepared to accept a wage

cut in return for the opportunity to continue working beyond the

age  of 60.  They find this a reasonable trade-off in return for

the opportunity to earn a steady

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>

income  for another two years.  In any case, most of them  would

have  discharged the bulk of their financial obligations.   They

can also tap on their CPF savings to meet their expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, nevertheless, there is concern among some employees

that  employers might abuse the right to initiate  a  wage  cut.

They fear that employers might insist on introducing a wage  cut

even  where  the older workers' job worth and performance  could

justify  their  salary.  It is reassuring earlier  on  that  the

Minister   has   in  his  speech  highlighted   the   Tripartite

Committee's  call for employers to be judicious in  implementing

the  wage  cut.  I certainly hope that employers could heed  the

Tripartite  Committee's  call  and  carefully  consider  various

factors  such  as the companies' minimum-maximum ratio  and  the

employees'  skills,  experience and job responsibilities  before

deciding on wage cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also heartening to note that the proposed Bill

requires  that  the  older employees be given  reasonable  prior

notice  on  the  intended wage cut, and also the opportunity  to

consider  and  respond to the proposed cut.  I would  urge  both

employers  and employees to be open-minded and accommodating  in

their  discussion of the wage cut and be prepared to  listen  to

each  other's views.  If there is any disagreement on  the  wage

cut, both parties should adopt a flexible attitude and strive to

come to a compromise.  I hope that the proposed section 4A(4) of

the Bill would only be used as a last resort and employers would

as  far  as possible avoid exercising the right to retire  their

employees under this section.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the issue of training. With

the  extension of the retirement age, older workers are expected

to  remain  longer in the workforce.  It is therefore  important

that they should continue to be given the necessary training  to

enable  them to remain relevant on the job.  Training  would  be

especially  essential in situations where the older workers  are

deployed to other jobs.  From

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>

what I gather, some employers are reluctant to train their older

workers because they perceive that these workers are either  too

old  to  learn or not cost-effective to be trained because  they

are   due  for  retirement  soon.   This  perception  is  wrong.

Speaking from my experience, older workers are every bit as keen

to  learn  as  their younger counterparts.  They take  pride  in

their work and are prepared to upgrade their skills so that they

can continue to remain an asset not only to the company but also

contribute to its growth.  Older workers are also less likely to

job-hop so it does make economic sense for employers to continue

to provide them with the necessary training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I am glad that the Government has taken a

long-term perspective on the issue of raising the retirement age

and  has  proceeded  to  raise the retirement  age  despite  the

economic  downturn.  I am positive that we  have  moved  in  the

right  direction  and  this policy will  benefit  not  only  our

workers, but also our employers and the economy in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that we have moved in the right

direction by raising retirement age, even though in Germany, the

new  government is considering reducing it from 65 to 60.   What

would  be the effect if we lower our retirement age?  If  we  do

so,  we  will merely be shifting employment from the old to  the

young.   There is no additional employment created.  What  would

the  `young retirees' do?  How would they live?  In the case  of

Germany, the unions expect the state to pay pensions.   If  not,

the `young retirees' would have to fend for themselves.  Surely,

this is not the way we should go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People need money to live on. Extending retirement age has

helped  the more senior amongst us to be independent.  The  crux

of  the  problem  is  to  create  employment,  and  keep  people

employable.   So  I  support the Bill on the  extension  of  the

retirement age.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, with the rapid ageing of our population, the mapping out of

an employment policy must be one of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>

the  most  urgent tasks, arguably more urgent, than  any  single

employment policy.  The Bill to reduce wages of employees  above

60  years  old must be supported as part of the steps to  expand

the  employment potential of older workers.  We should also give

priority  to  efforts to encourage and facilitate  employers  to

retain workers as long as they possibly can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, but the greying of Singapore requires effort that goes

beyond  legislation.  Far from being a relatively young country,

Singapore will enter the 21st century with the fastest  rate  of

ageing  ever  experienced on earth.  In the nine  years  between

2012 and 2021, the proportion of our population above the age of

60  will  rise from 10% to 15%.  The same process took Japan  15

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the biggest obstacles we face today is the inherent

prejudice  and  wrong perceptions that people have  about  older

workers.   We have read recently how difficult it is for  a  45-year  old  young  man to look for a job.  Quite  frequently  and

wrongly,  he  is  seen  as being in poor  health,  difficult  to

manage,  not strong, does not present an image of dynamism,  not

adaptable  and would stifle the promotion prospects  of  younger

colleagues.   Evidence from advertised job vacancies  shows  the

incidence of age qualified vacancies is fairly widespread.  They

fail to realise that older workers cannot be neatly grouped into

skill,   ability  and  physical  strength.   Although   physical

strength does decline with age, chronological age is by no means

an  accurate indicator of one's ability to perform a task.   Age

does not necessarily affect productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, we must ensure that older workers are not exploited or

discriminated.   In  1978, the US introduced  a  legislation  to

outlaw discrimination on grounds of age among workers up to  the

age  of  70.   Perhaps, it is timely that we should  incorporate

such  legislation  here.   Many of the  older  workers  want  to

continue  to  work, especially if they can find less  stressful,

less  physically demanding work.  They want to live  independent

lives.   Many prefer not to depend on their children as a source

of income.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>

Many simply cannot afford to remain unemployed without suffering

a substantial loss of income and fall in living standards.  Even

for the increasingly affluent group, work will provide more than

just  income.   But status, interest and companionship  and  the

need  for  these does not necessarily become less  important  on

retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose four specific suggestions for the

Minister to consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Prepare workers for retirement. Many are ill-prepared to

cope  what  maybe  one  third of their lives.   We  should  have

programmes  that  will prepare them and enlighten  them  of  the

choices  that they can make.  For example, volunteer,  part-time

work,  or  even  a change that will lead to a life  of  leisure,

especially at a time when we are calling for more active  people

sector.   We  can also establish more adult education programmes

in the existing tertiary institutions to cater to this need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We should encourage and prepare workers for second careers.

We  must fully utilise aged workers.  Their capacities and  long

job  experience  are human resources in which tremendous  public

and  private  investments have been made.   These  are  reliable

resources  that  have to be effectively utilised  not  only  for

their sake but for the community and the society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) We must reserve some jobs which are most suited for the

elderly.  Grandparents today are the most ideal choice of  care-givers  for our children.  Yet, how often do we see grandparents

in  kindergartens,  in  childcare  centres  where  they  can  be

effective  not  only as tutors, but in passing  down  the  right

values  and  attitudes  to the younger  generation.   This  also

applies  to  many of the jobs in service counters in  Government

Ministries and statutory boards.  They are especially suited  to

community  organisations,  for  example,  the  CDCs,  the   town

councils,  which  require a high level  of  human  relationship,

skills  and patience.  The elderly make good counsellors because

age   may  bring  maturity  of  judgement  and  the  weight   of

experience.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We must expand the Skills Development Fund. It should be

enlarged  to allow for the training of older workers  for  their

second careers.  The fact is that blue collar workers will  have

fewer  opportunities compared to white collar workers in finding

jobs where their skills and experience can be fully utilised  in

later years.  Therefore, programmes to train workers should also

be  extended  to  older  or  retiring  workers.   Unfortunately,

technological  innovation  may also induce  obsolescence  in  an

ageing workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, the current economic crisis will pose a great

challenge  because  of falling demand for labour.   Despite  the

wage  cuts  and  reduced CPF contribution, employers  may  still

prefer  to  employ younger workers.  We must do more  to  change

this.   In  Singapore, today, sadly, becoming 60s is a watershed

because to many, it is an end of employment and the beginning of

a loss of income, status and sometimes independence.  Retirement

may  not  necessarily mean an end to this.   I  would  urge  the

Government  to  do more to change the attitude  people  have  of

older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, think about this. Few would attribute the same

characteristics to a 30-year old as they would  a  60-year  old.

Why  then  should  the 60s and 90s be classed  together  as  one

group?  It is very easy to assume that all the elderly want this

or  feel  that.   It  might be more realistic to  generalise  if

people  are  divided according to how they appear in  behaviour,

attitudes  and thoughts.  "As old as you feel" is one  approach.

And  if  to act old is to be sad in one way, to lack flexibility

of thought and to generally look old fashioned, then, Sir, there

are many people in the 20s and 30s who will qualify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the average

lifespan  of Singaporeans today is 76 and the current retirement

age  is  60.   What this means is that, on average, Singaporeans

would  spend about 70% of their adult life working  and  30%  in

retirement.  With the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>

raising of the retirement age to 62, this will increase from 70%

to  about 75% and eventually, if we do raise the retirement  age

to  67, it will go up to 85%.  I therefore support the extension

of  the  retirement  age  because I  believe  this  will  enable

Singaporeans to live a more fulfilling life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in supporting this extension of retirement age, I would

like  to  raise  three  points  for  the  consideration  of  the

Minister.  Firstly, the purpose of extending retirement  age  is

to  secure  the  right  for  Singaporeans  to  work  beyond  60.

However,  we  should  continue to leave  it  to  the  individual

Singaporeans to decide whether they want to exercise  the  right

beyond  the  age of 60.  So from that angle, in determining  the

pension  arrangement for civil servants, I hope  the  Government

will  not  penalise  civil servants who are on  the  pensionable

service and who decide to work beyond 60 under this extension of

retirement age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as we extend the retirement age, we are endorsing pay

cut of up to 10%.  As the Minister mentioned, this is because of

the  seniority-based wage system in Singapore.  From the union's

perspective,  we hope that this is only a temporary  arrangement

because  the  long-term  solution  is  to  move  away  from  the

seniority-based wage system towards a base-up wage system.  Sir,

in this regard, we hope that the civil service can take the lead

to  move  into the base-up wage system because today, the  civil

service  likewise depends very much on the seniority-based  wage

system.   We hope the civil service can respond.  As  we  extend

the retirement age, why not take the lead to move into the base-up  wage  system  in a big way, in a concerted  way,  so  as  to

encourage the private sector to follow suit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that with the extension of retirement age,

even though it will give Singapore workers the right to work, it

does  not  guarantee that Singaporeans will be able to  exercise

the  right.   For  example,  in  this  particular  crisis,  many

companies are now talking about renewing their workforce  so  as

to gear up for a knowledge-based economy of the future.  Some of

them are talking about retrenching the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>

older workers and re-hiring the younger workers. So their way of

renewing workforce is by retrenching the older workers.  If this

were to continue in a big way, then obviously, many Singaporeans

are  not going to be able to exercise their right to work beyond

60 years old under the extension of retirement age.  We hope the

tripartite   partners,  namely,  the  unions,   Government   and

employers,  can  work together to arrest this particular  trend.

We need to encourage as many companies and employers as possible

to  work  together  to  help our Singapore workforce  to  remain

healthy, employable and productive, so that as many Singaporeans

as  possible can really exercise their right to work  beyond  60

under  the extension of retirement age.  On that, I support  the

amendment Bill, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me assure you that I

am  going  to be very brief.  I just have one question  for  the

Minister.  Isn't this talk about raising the retirement age  for

employees  in  the  private  sector  academic  so  long  as  the

Employment  Act allows an employer to terminate the services  of

any  employee by just giving him one month's notice?  I can  see

that this makes a profound change perhaps for the civil servants

who have security of tenure under the Constitution.  But for the

private sector, is this not purely academic?

have  spoken out in support of this amendment Bill to raise  the

retirement  age  from  60 to 62.  They have  raised  many  valid

points  for  consideration and I will try  to  address  all  the

concerns that they have raised.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Dr Vasoo, in supporting the amendment, raised the

concern  of  potential  areas of dispute between  employers  and

employees when they come to the age of 60 and they have to  give

reasonable  notice on reducing the wage of older  workers.   And

his  question is:  if there is a dispute, who will mediate,  who

will help the employee to listen to his appeal, to listen to his

own concern?  I would like to assure the Member that my Ministry

has  since 1994, when we first enacted the Retirement  Age  Act,

established a unit in the Labour Relations Department  which  is

geared towards looking after the needs of older workers who have

any  dispute with their employers on account of age.  So, if  an

older  worker  feels that his employer is making an unreasonable

offer or that he is being retired prematurely, or his service is

terminated on account of age, he can always come to my  Ministry

to  seek  conciliation  or to seek support  in  resolving  those

problems  with  their  employers.  I am  pleased  to  say  that,

although I do not have the exact numbers with me, since 1994, we

have been able to resolve the cases we handled expeditiously and

satisfactorily for both parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, Dr Vasoo also raised this possibility of

employers  taking advantage of the wage reduction to  force  out

older  workers.  The recourse here is of course  for  the  older

workers to appeal to my Ministry to investigate their complaints

against their employers for taking such unfair action.   Let  me

assure  Members  once  again that any such  complaints  will  be

carefully investigated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng also supported the Bill and he asked that

employers  should consider the contribution of  older  employees

when they adjust the wages of such employees.  I agree with him.

I  think  I  said  so  in  my main speech  that  the  Tripartite

Committee  in  fact made specific recommendation that  employers

should always consider the contribution, the wage level and  the

performance of the older employees before they proceed  to  make

adjustment to the wages.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang also suggested that the wage reduction should not be

done  haphazardly on a month-to-month basis or as and  when  the

employers  feel like doing so.  We have a certain  understanding

between the tripartite partners that such wage reduction  should

in  fact be done for a reasonable period, either a year  or  two

years.   The  extension of the retirement age is for two  years.

Ideally, it should be for the full period of two years.   It  is

not  good management practice to go and change the wages of  the

employee  on  a haphazard basis.  So I agree with him  that  the

employer should in fact give the employees reasonable notice and

also make such wage adjustment over a reasonable period of time.

He,  in fact, also said that there is this provision in the Bill

for   employees  to  give  reasonable  notice  to  their   older

employees.  It is not specified what is a reasonable  period  of

notice  and  the question is:  should it be seven  days  or  two

months?   Let  me assure the Member that through the  tripartite

practice,  and  through our practice of managing  the  employer-employee relationship, there have evolved certain norms on  what

is a reasonable notice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tripartite Committee on the Extension of Retirement Age has

in  fact  discussed this particular issue quite extensively  and

both  employer  and  employee  representatives  agreed  that  in

amending  the  law,  we should not try to fix  a  rigid  period,

whether  it  should be two weeks or a month.   This  is  because

there  are  many situations in actual human resource  management

practice  where you have to give allowance for the size  of  the

company,  the  set-up within the company and the  company's  own

management practices.  They have recommended that we take a more

flexible  approach  instead  of  specifying  the  exact  period.

Reasonable notices to us, would mean, say, at least a  month  or

something  like that.  If, in fact, an employee feels  aggrieved

that  the  period of notice has been too short,  he  can  always

appeal  to  my  Ministry  and  we  will  try  to  resolve  these

differences.  As long as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>

it  is  in  tune with what is current practice in Singapore,  it

would be considered reasonable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang and Mr Lim Swee Say brought up this point that with

the  raising of the retirement age, pensionable employees in the

civil  service  should  not  be disadvantaged.   Although  civil

servants  are  exempted from the coverage of  the  extension  of

retirement  age, when we moved from age 55 to 60, we  gave  this

exemption to the civil service.  I understand that the PSD  will

in  fact  apply the new retirement age.  In other  words,  civil

servants  will  be  able  to work up to  the  age  of  62.   For

pensionable  civil  servants, if they  want  to  withdraw  their

pension  at  age 60, they would have to retire from the  service

because  they cannot withdraw the pension and carry  on  working

continuously.  But if they want to carry on working, then  their

pension  right will be preserved up to the age of 62.   And  any

time  between 60 and 62, if they choose to retire, they will  be

entitled  to their pension.  I think this is reasonable  because

if  you  are already working and drawing a salary, albeit  about

10%  less, there is really no need for you to have your  pension

upfront.   So,  you carry on working, you have a regular  income

and  you  do not need the pension.  The pension will be released

when you retire.  But it will be frozen at the age of 60.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong made several comments in supporting the

amendment.   I agree with him that older workers right  now  may

have  more difficulties fitting into new jobs that are available

and I think Mr Lim Swee Say also made a point on the possibility

of  retrenchment for older workers.  Our approach is to  try  to

help  the  older  workers who are retrenched  or  who  are  more

vulnerable to retrenchment to uplift their skills, so that  they

would  be able to continue to serve or contribute to the company

where  they  are currently working, or if offered an alternative

job   in   another  company  where  they  can  make  a  valuable

contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the main thrust of the Skills Redevelopment Programme

and I reported to this House yesterday that, in fact, the Skills

Redevelopment Programme

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>

is  progressing  very  smoothly and the  take-up  rate  is  very

encouraging.   As  of  now, we already  have  more  than  10,000

workers,  mostly  older  workers, who have  signed  up  for  the

programme for retraining.  This is the way that we can  help  to

look after the older workers who are in need of skills upgrading

to  ensure that they remain employable.  I have to say that this

is  in fact the only way that we can help these older workers to

equip  them  with the means to hold on to a job.   There  is  no

other  way  that we can ensure that they remain employable.   We

cannot legislate or force the employers, on their own, to retain

the  older  workers, because there are economic  considerations.

We  must make sure that older workers are equipped with all  the

skills  that  are necessary for them to make a  value  added  to

their employer and that is the only way to remain employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong mentioned that the cut in CPF arising from the

recommendation  of the Committee on Singapore's  Competitiveness

could  erode  the  differential between the  younger  and  older

workers.  I want to correct an impression.  The reduction in the

employer's  CPF  contribution for older workers  is  a  separate

matter.  So, we are going to proceed with that.  We will, on 1st

January 1999, reduce the CPF contribution rate for older workers

from  7.5% to 4% for those aged 60 to 65, and for those aged  65

and above, from 5% to 4%.  This is a separate matter.  The CSC's

recommendation,  which has been accepted by the  Government,  to

reduce  employer's contribution by 10% point will also kick  in.

In   fact,  for  older  workers,  from  1st  January  1999,  the

employer's CPF contribution rate will come down to 2%,  not  4%.

So the differential would still be maintained.  In fact, it will

actually be improved, because in the past, we used to have 12.5%

differential between the two groups.  Now, we have narrowed  the

differential some more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong and Dr Vasoo also requested that safeguards should be

put  in  place  to ensure that older workers who  are  currently

drawing  salaries which are at or in fact below the market  rate

should  not  be affected by the 10% wage cut.  If they  were  to

look at the Bill, they will see that in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>

fact these safeguards are already provided under the new section

4A(5) which stipulates that the wage reduction shall be based on

factors such as employee's productivity, performance, duties and

responsibilities and the wage system that a company practises or

exercises.  This provision means that while employers are  given

the flexibility to reduce the wages of older employees by up  to

10%,  such  cuts  cannot  be introduced  indiscriminately.   For

employees  who are not on the seniority-based wage system,  such

as  those  who are paid by hourly rate or fixed rate, regardless

of  their age - in other words, they are being paid according to

their  job  worth - then the employers would have to  take  this

into  consideration in deciding on whether to make a  wage  cut.

If  in  fact  they proceed to make a wage cut and the  employees

feel  unhappy, they can always appeal to my Ministry.   We  will

investigate their complaints and help them to reach  a  solution

with the employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong also suggested that we should prohibit companies

which  are  not affected by the seniority-based wage  system  to

introduce  a  wage  cut  for  the  older  employees.   While   I

understand  his  concern  that he  wants  to  provide  for  this

explicit  protection for older workers, we are of the view  that

the companies in fact should be given some flexibility to adjust

the  cost  of  retaining their older workers.   Apart  from  the

seniority-based wage system, companies may need  to  adjust  the

salaries  of  older workers based on other considerations  which

are already spelt out in the section provided earlier on.  These

other factors are productivity, performance and contribution  to

the  company.  So we should allow companies to do so  to  ensure

continued  cost competitiveness despite the fact that there  are

going to be more and more older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I also would like to point out that it would be

unwise  for  an employer to indiscriminately cut  the  wages  of

their productive older employees as this will certainly cause  a

serious  effect on the morale of such employees.  In  any  case,

employers who intend to introduce a wage cut are required, under

the proposed Bill, to give notice to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>

employees  and  come to an agreement between  the  employer  and

employee.    In  fact,  in  companies  where  the  workers   are

represented  by  unions,  the  unions  also  would  want  to  be

consulted on the degree of reduction that the employers want  to

carry out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I come to Mr Cyrille Tan. I thank him also for the

support.  He has reinforced my argument on why we should move at

this  juncture,  despite  the economic downturn,  to  raise  the

retirement age.  The fact that most older employees are prepared

to  accept the wage cut of 10%, according to Mr Cyrille Tan,  is

an  indication  that our process of tripartite discussion  of  a

sensitive  issue is working well.  It is through this Tripartite

Committee on Extension of Retirement Age that we have arrived at

this consensus that would take into consideration the employers'

and  also the employees' concern. We have arrived at this  level

of  wage  adjustment  which  I think,  as  Mr  Cyrille  Tan  has

mentioned,  is  acceptable to the workers.  That would  help  to

encourage more older Singaporeans to carry on working.   If  you

make too big a cut, then you will demotivate them and they might

just  decide  not to carry on, in which case our Retirement  Age

Act would not have achieved its objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cyrille Tan also mentioned the need for training of

older  workers.  I touched on it earlier on.  I agree  with  him

that we should continue to provide training to older workers, in

particular, to help them to adjust to the changed labour  market

where newer jobs are being created, but requiring higher skills.

I  think  it is of interest for Members to know that  the  shift

towards  higher skilled jobs is taking place quite rapidly.   In

the  early 90s, EDB promoted investments and created  a  lot  of

jobs.    Out  of  the  jobs  that  were  created  through  EDB's

investment  promotion effort, about one-third of  them  required

skilled  workers.  But today the investments brought in  by  EDB

and  the  jobs  that they create require two-thirds  of  skilled

workers.  So we have doubled the requirement for skilled workers

over a short

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>

period  of less than a decade.  So older workers, in particular,

therefore need to make a special effort.  Let me assure  Members

that  Government will provide all the opportunities and fundings

that  are necessary to ensure that older workers who are in need

of skills upgrading will receive this training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mr Zulkifli Baharudin. He raised several

valid  points  and  concerns which I will try  to  address.   He

mentioned  the possibility of introducing legislation like  that

in  the US to outlaw discrimination of workers up to the age  of

70.   In  fact,  the  Retirement Age Act is such  a  legislation

because  under  the  Retirement Age Act the  employers  are  not

allowed  to retire workers on account of age until they reach  a

minimum  statutory retirement age.  So, in effect,  it  provides

the  same degree of non-discrimination for older workers.   Yes,

the  provision now is to raise to only 62, but we  have  already

served  notice that we intend to raise it to 67.  But we  cannot

do  this  in a rush.  We cannot hurry the process.  We  have  to

take  time  to ensure that the employment market can  adjust  to

this  change.   In due course, when we move it to 67,  we  would

already be very much closer to the target in the US.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli also suggested that we should prepare workers

for  retirement.  I also agree with him on that score that  even

as  we  talk  about  extending the retirement  age  and  working

longer,  we do need to make preparation for eventual retirement,

and  to  make  both financial planning and also in terms  of  an

alternative or even a second career after retirement.   Even  at

age  62  or,  in the future, 65, there will be many Singaporeans

who  are  still  very  physically and mentally  very  alert  and

active.  They can do a lot of other kinds of work as a form of a

second  career.   It  is  part of our continuing  education  and

training  programme that we are  in the process of  establishing

under  the  new  charter of the Ministry of Manpower,  ie,  this

concept of a lifelong learning. We will incorporate these  ideas

to  train  young  and old workers so that they  can  continually

upgrade  their skills and capabilities and they can continue  to

serve their employers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>

or  in other areas such as social organisations, as mentioned by

the Nominated Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one point that he raised that I cannot quite

agree  with him, and that is, the point about trying to  reserve

certain jobs for older workers.  For instance, he mentioned jobs

in  kindergartens and childcare services.   While I  agree  with

him   that  grandparents  are  great  for  looking  after  young

children,  we should not be interfering with the job  market  to

the  extent  that  certain jobs such as those in  the  childcare

centres be reserved for older people.  That would not help us in

the  sense  that they will introduce rigidities and  distortions

into our labour market.  It may cause unhappiness and resentment

among the younger workers who also may want to do such jobs.  We

cannot  generalise to say that younger workers  cannot  do  such

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, it is not advisable for us to move towards

trying  to  take a protectionist approach and say  that  certain

jobs must be reserved for older workers or to interfere with our

free   labour   market  practice.   Instead  of  adopting   this

protectionistic  approach,  trying to  reserve  jobs  for  older

workers,  which is really not efficient, economically  speaking,

it  will  be  more  viable for us to continue to  encourage  and

promote  the employment of older Singaporeans for a wide variety

of  jobs.   I  am  sure Members are aware of how companies  like

McDonalds, for instance, have branched out  in their search  for

manpower  to  the  older Singaporeans and they  have  been  very

successful  in  that.   They  can  meet  most  of  their  labour

requirements   by   employing  older   Singaporeans,   including

retirees.   More and more companies should adopt  this  approach

and  change  their  mindset to try to create  opportunities  for

older Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli also suggests extending the Skills Development

Fund  or  setting up a special fund to look after  the  training

needs  of  older people.  I have already mentioned that  in  our

concept of developing a lifelong learning system, we will  reach

out to both young and old workers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>

At this juncture, I do not think there is a need to specifically

identify  a  fund for older workers.  In fact, the SRP,  if  you

want  to look at it, indirectly benefits older workers more than

younger workers because the SRP is targeted at the lower skilled

and  less  educated  workers who, by virtue of  the  definition,

become  the  older  workers.  They are  the  ones  who  are  now

benefiting  most  from  the SRP.  All  Skills  Development  Fund

training  subsidies are eligible for young and old workers.   We

make no distinction on age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have addressed Mr Lim Swee Say's point about

pensionable  civil servants.  Their pensions will be  protected.

They  can  carry  on to work beyond 60 to 62.  Of  course,  they

would  also have to come to an agreement on the amount  of  wage

reduction, just like employees in the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would pass on his suggestion that the civil service takes

the  lead in implementing the base-up wage system.  I think this

will  be considered by the PSD.  I agree with Mr Lim that  while

we  can amend the law, there is still no guarantee of employment

because  this  is  very much dependent on the job  opportunities

available.  In a situation where there is an overall decline  in

employment, as we have experienced in the last two quarters as a

result  of  the economic downturn, there is of course a  greater

difficulty  to ensure that older Singaporeans stay in  the  job.

But I would urge all employers, even when they have to downsize,

not  to inflict a penalty on the older workers.  I think Mr  Lim

has  adequately pointed out that older workers,  and,  in  fact,

several other Members have mentioned this, can continue to  make

a valuable contribution to the company's operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to Mr Jeyaretnam. He says that the talk of

raising the retirement age is academic as long as employers  are

allowed  to  terminate the employee's service with  one  month's

notice.  This is not a new thing.  This right to give notice  to

terminate  an  employment contract is already in our  Employment

Act.  We have to look at it in totality.  While the employer can

give termination notice, there must be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>

a  sufficient  reason  for  such termination.   If  in  fact  an

employee whose service has been terminated but he feels that  it

is actually a dismissal in the guise of contractual termination,

he  can  always appeal to my Ministry.  Each year we  do  get  a

certain  number of such appeals and we have always been able  to

resolve  the differences between the employer and employee.   So

it  is  not a completely one-sided situation where the  employer

has absolute right and to exercise it indiscriminately.  We have

a  mechanism within the Ministry in implementing the  Employment

Act  to  ensure that employees' interests are also looked after.

I  am pleased to inform Members that in terms of conciliation of

resolving  such  difficulties, the Ministry's  Labour  Relations

Department has been very effective and efficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member also has to look from the point of view

of  the employer.  After all, employees also can leave a job  by

giving  a  certain period of notice.  So it cuts both ways.   An

employer  has  invested money in training an  employee  and  the

employee can turn around and say, "Look, I want to quit.  I give

you  a month's notice."  So I think in a free labour market,  we

should   allow  this  flexibility,  instead  of  creating   more

rigidities, as he seems to be suggesting.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I just ask the Minister one more

question?  Does he not agree that there is no provision  in  the

Act  for  an  employee  whose services are terminated  with  the

requisite notice of one month to appeal to the Ministry?  He  is

not aware of that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just said that

if  any  employee  feels that his services  have  been  unfairly

terminated, he can appeal to my Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>4.18 pm



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill makes technical amendments to the Civil Law Act

for  purposes  of clarification and law reform.  The  provisions

have  the  support  of  relevant bodies  such  as  the  Monetary

Authority  of Singapore and the Singapore Academy of Law,  where

the  Law  Society  of Singapore is represented.   The  financial

services  industry  and NUS law lecturers were  also  consulted.

The  Bill  will improve our commercial and civil  law  and  will

provide   a   more  predictable  legal  environment,   something

important to businesses and financial institutions.

<br><br><i>Updating the law on contribution</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first set of amendments makes new provisions for

contribution  between persons who are jointly or  severally,  or

both  jointly and severally, liable for the same damage  and  in

certain other similar cases where two or more persons have  paid

or  may be required to pay compensation for the same damage.  It

also  amends  the  law relating to proceedings  against  persons

jointly  liable  for the same debt or jointly or  severally,  or

both jointly and severally, liable for the same damage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments are of a law reform nature. They were proposed

by  the  Academy of Law's Law Reform Committee and supported  by

the  Attorney-General (AG).  The changes will bring our  law  on

contribution  in line with the UK Civil Liability (Contribution)

Act  1978 and address anomalies in litigation practice.  The law

on contribution is a technical area which deals with the payment

of  a proportionate share of a liability which has been borne by

one or some only of a number of persons who are jointly liable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the Civil Law Act will be amended to extend the

applicability  of  the  provisions on  contribution  to  damages

arising from legal grounds other than tort.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>The rule in Bain v Fothergill</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment of a law reform nature is to abolish the

rule  of  law  known  as the rule in Bain  v  Fothergill.   This

follows   changes  made  in  the  UK  by  the  Law  of  Property

(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rule of law is that "if, a person enters into a

contract  for  the sale of real estate knowing that  he  has  no

title to it, nor any means of acquiring it, the purchaser cannot

recover damages beyond the expenses he has incurred by an action

for breach of the contract; he can only obtain other damages  by

an  action  for  deceit".  This rule is an anachronism  and  was

abolished  in  the  UK in 1989.  It was established  before  the

development  of a comprehensive land registration  system,  when

parties  could  not be absolutely certain about their  title  to

land  and when there was a requirement to trace a good  root  of

title  back  for  60 years.  The rule is no longer  relevant  in

present  day  Singapore.  Most of our land  are  now  registered

under  the  Land  Titles Act or the Land  Titles  (Strata)  Act.

Further,  all dealings in unregistered land are required  to  be

registered under the Registration of Deeds Act where the duty to

show good root of title goes back only 15 years.

<br><br><i>Creating predictability for financial services law against gaming</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next set of amendments is for purposes of

clarification.   They  are supported by MAS  and  the  financial

services   industry.   These  amendments  do  not   affect   the

regulation of financial and investment activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment relates to section 6(1) of the Civil

Law  Act,  which renders all contracts or agreements by  way  of

gaming  or wagering null and void.  This amendment arose out  of

concerns  expressed  by  a  private  sector  Corporate   Finance

Committee  (CFC),  chaired by Mr Lim Yong  Wah,  that  there  is

currently  uncertainty over whether the  trading  of  "Over  the

Counter"   (OTC)  derivatives  in  Singapore  is   illegal   and

unenforceable because of the law against gaming.  The  CFC  felt

that  this uncertainty has impeded the growth of a thriving  OTC

derivatives

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>

market in Singapore.  As a large number of derivatives contracts

are  settled  by  price differences based  on  future  uncertain

events,  and  do  not  depend  on any  actual  delivery  of  the

underlying  property,  they could technically  fall  within  the

definition  of  gaming.   The CFC's  report,  published  on  9th

November  1998, recommended that the law should be clarified  to

facilitate the growth of the derivative business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the law against gaming should not apply to any

legitimate or hedging investment activity.  It should not hinder

the  dynamic  development of innovative  financial  products  in

Singapore.   The Bill therefore amends section 6 to  make  clear

that  the  law  against gaming does not affect the  validity  or

enforceability of contracts entered into by way of business  and

the making or performance of which constitutes an investment  or

hedging activity.  A list of these activities, drafted in  close

consultation  with  MAS  and representatives  of  the  financial

services industry, is set out in the Bill.

<br><br><i>EMU and the Euro</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another amendment makes clear that the European

Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will not affect the continuity

of  contracts denominated in currencies that will be affected by

the  introduction  of  the euros.  The premise  underlying  this

amendment  is  that,  as  far as possible,  we  should  maintain

Singapore's  competitiveness as an  international  business  and

financial  centre by providing predictability and  certainty  to

businesses when the euro is introduced on 1st January 1999,  the

start  of  the  transitional stage.  It is  modelled  after  the

equivalent New York law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, a declaratory provision will be

enacted that the continuity of contracts will not be affected by

the  substitution  or  replacement of  currencies  by  the  euro

arising from the European Economic and Monetary Union.

<br><br><i>Consequential and related amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Bill makes consequential amendments to

section 6(1) of the Carriage by Air Act (Cap. 32A) and section 3

of the Contributory Negligence

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>

and  Personal  Injuries Act (Cap. 54).  The Bill  also  makes  a

related  amendment to the Limitation Act (Cap. 163) by inserting

a  new  section 6A to provide for a special time  limit  of  two

years  for  claiming contribution.  This will clarify a  current

uncertainty in litigation practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am obliged to you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

for  giving me this opportunity.  I am in support of  the  Bill.

The  Minister has been very thorough and convincing.  I will  be

very short.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Civil Law Act is one of the cornerstones of our

legal system and the number of amendments that has been proposed

will  help us in the administration of justice.  In our  system,

we  practise  the  rule  of law and the separation  of  power  - Judiciary,  Executive  and Legislature.   The  function  of  the

Judiciary  is to interpret the law while it is the  function  of

Parliament  to  enact  laws.  I congratulate  the  Minister  for

introducing  this  Bill.  It is timely.  I am  especially  happy

that  the  rule in Bain's case is being laid to  rest.   It  has

outlived  its  usefulness.  It just goes to show  that  the  law

cannot  be static.  It is a living institution.  It must undergo

change  from time to time.  And in this regard, I am asking  the

Minister  whether,  besides  the Law  Reform  Committee  of  the

Singapore  Academy  of  Law, the Ministry  has  any  unit  which

monitors changes of law that are required in our system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to administer outmoded law would do grave injustice to

the  parties.   The  Minister has been very,  very  thorough  in

showing  us  the  various amendments he is going  to  introduce,

which  are  going to help us, and I hope other Ministries  would

also do likewise.  I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the Ministry of Law itself

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for Law moved the Copyright (Amendment)

Bill in February this year, he informed the House that an inter-ministry  Committee  has  been  reviewing  our  legislation   on

intellectual  property rights to give effect to our  obligations

under  the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Trade-Related

Aspects  of  Intellectual Property or the TRIPS  Agreement,  for

short.   The Committee's work has resulted in amendments to  the

Copyright Act and Patents Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is another product of the Committee's review. It

will replace the existing Trade Marks Act.  Besides amending the

law to comply with the TRIPS Agreement, the Bill also modernises

and  simplifies  our trade marks law in line with  international

trends.   Our  trade  marks legislation is  some  50  years  old

(1938).   Some  of its provisions on the registration  of  trade

marks  are unnecessarily complicated and onerous, thus  impeding

the  efficiency  of the Registry of Trade Marks.   A  number  of

provisions  are  also  outdated and do not  conform  to  current

international  trends.  This Bill addresses these  shortcomings.

Furthermore,  the Bill will enable Singapore to  accede  to  the

Protocol Relating to the International Registration of Marks  or

the  Madrid Protocol.  In the process of drafting the  Bill,  we

have  taken into account the views of academics from the Faculty

of  Law, National University of Singapore, and consultants  from

World  Intellectual Property Organisation or WIPO,  as  well  as

views of the industry.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>TRIPS related provisions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me turn first to the provisions inserted to comply

with the TRIPS Agreement.  These relate to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) definition of trade mark;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) well-known trade marks;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) collective marks;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) civil measures;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) border enforcement; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) geographical indications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill, a trade mark is defined along the lines of the

TRIPS  Agreement.   Basically, a trade  mark  must  be  visually

perceptible and capable of distinguishing the goods or  services

of the proprietor.  Three-dimensional marks are now registrable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards well-known trade marks, the Bill allows the

proprietor  of  an  earlier  trade mark  which  is  entitled  to

protection under the Paris Convention or the TRIPS Agreement  as

a  well-known  trade  mark  to oppose  the  registration  of  an

identical or similar trade mark.  Further, the proprietor  of  a

well-known trade mark is entitled to restrain by injunction  the

use  of  an  identical  or  similar  trademark  in  relation  to

identical  or similar goods or services where the use is  likely

to cause confusion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, well-known trade marks are protected under the

common  law tort of passing off.  If they consist of an invented

word or words, they can also be registered as defensive marks in

respect  of  goods  under  the  existing  Trade  Marks  Act.   A

defensive  mark is essentially a well-known trade mark  that  is

registered  for  goods other than those in which the  proprietor

trades, where a connection in the course of trade between  those

goods and the proprietor is likely to be inferred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new feature of the Bill is the registration of collective

marks.   This is required by the TRIPS Agreement.  A  collective

mark is held by an association and used by its members.  It is a

mark distinguishing the goods or services of members of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>

association from those dealt with or provided by persons who are

not members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is no registration of collective marks in

the  existing  Trade Marks Act.  Instead, an  association  which

does  not use its logo as a trade mark registers it as  a  trade

mark  and then registers its members as permitted users  of  the

trade mark. The registration of collective marks by associations

under  the  Bill  will enable their members  to  use  the  marks

without   having  to  go  through  the  process  of  registering

themselves as permitted users with the Registry of Trade Marks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also expressly sets out the civil and

administrative   remedies  available  to  a  proprietor   of   a

registered  trade  mark.   These include  injunctions,  damages,

account  of  profits,  removal of the  offending  sign  and  the

delivery  up and forfeiture or destruction of infringing  goods,

material or articles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important aspect of the Bill pertains to border

enforcement measures to prevent infringing intellectual property

materials  from  entering Singapore.  The Bill's  provisions  on

these  measures are similar to those in the copyright area  with

adaptation  to  suit  the  trade  mark  field.   In  line   with

international trends, the Bill designates the Customs and Excise

Department to handle border enforcement.

<br><br><i>Modernisation and Simplification in accordance with International Trends</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to the provisions which seek to modernise

and   simplify   our   trade  marks  law  in   accordance   with

international trends.  Some of the more important changes are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, abolishing the distinction between Parts A and B of

the   Register  of  Trade  Marks.   Trade  Marks  are  presently

registered  in  Part  A or Part B of the register.   Almost  all

applications  filed  with the Registry of Trade  Marks  are  for

registration  in  Part A.   If the Registrar  decides  that  the

trade  marks  do  not  qualify for Part A registration,  he  may

propose to register them in Part B.  A trade

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>

mark  registered  in  Part  A must satisfy  a  higher  level  of

distinctiveness  than a Part B trade mark and thus  has  greater

protection.   For  example, the validity  of  a  trade  mark  is

presumed  to  be conclusive after 7 years under the Trade  Marks

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the differences for the proprietor between

registration in Part A or Part B do not justify the considerable

amount  of time spent by examiners and applicants in determining

which  Part  a  trade  mark  is  registrable  under.   The  Bill

accordingly  provides for a unified register.   This  will  thus

simplify  examination,  resulting in savings  in  administration

costs and also costs to applicants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, providing for less stringent criteria for

registration  of  trade marks.  This will  make  it  easier  for

proprietors to obtain registration.  The test for registrability

will  generally  be  similar to that for a Part  B  registration

under  the  present Trade Marks Act, that is,  a  mark  must  be

capable  of  distinguishing  the  goods  or  services   of   its

proprietor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, simplifying and expediting the examination process

by  removing the Registrar's power to impose disclaimers.  Under

the  present Trade Marks Act, the Registrar may, as a  condition

of registration, require the applicant to disclaim rights to non-distinctive  features  of  a  trade  mark.   The  effect  of   a

disclaimer  is that the proprietor of the registered trade  mark

cannot claim any rights under the Act in respect of the parts of

the  mark to which the disclaimer relates.  Therefore, no action

for infringement shall lie in respect of the use or imitation of

the disclaimed elements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill, the Registrar will have no power to impose

disclaimers.   But  there is a provision for disclaimers  to  be

entered  in  the  register by the applicants  voluntarily.   The

applicants  may  wish  to do this at the  application  stage  to

forestall possible opposition to the registration of their trade

marks.  Disclaimers may also be entered by the applicants  as  a

result of opposition proceedings.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, abolishing Association of Trade Marks. The Bill

abolishes the practice of associating identical or similar trade

marks  in  respect  of  the same or similar  goods  or  services

belonging  to  the  same proprietor.  Under the  existing  Trade

Marks Act, associated trade marks must be assigned together,  to

prevent  the  public from being misled as to the source  of  the

goods  or  services.  The abolition of the association of  trade

marks  in  the  Bill  is premised on the fact  that  trade  mark

proprietors  are most attuned to market conditions and  are  the

best  persons to ensure that an assignment of their trade  marks

does  not  lead  to confusion or deception on the  part  of  the

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, registering marks relating to Ancillary Services.

At  the  second  reading of the Trade Marks Bill  in  1991,  the

Minister   for  Law  informed  the  House  that  the  issue   of

registration of retail service marks would be reviewed.  We have

studied   the   international  trend  which  acknowledges   that

ancillary services such as retail services have attributes which

deserve  recognition.  The Bill accordingly makes provision  for

the  registration  of  marks in relation to  ancillary  services

performed  for  the  benefit  of someone  else  other  than  the

proprietor.   Therefore, marks such as SOGO and  METRO  are  now

registrable in respect of retail services.

<br><br><i>The Madrid Protocol</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Bill will enable Singapore to accede to

the  Madrid  Protocol.   The  Madrid Protocol  which  came  into

operation  on  1st  April  1996 is  administered  by  the  World

Intellectual   Property  Organisation  or  WIPO.    Essentially,

accession to the Protocol would enable trade marks registered in

Singapore  to be protected internationally.  As at  1st  October

1998,   35  countries  including  the  United  Kingdom,  France,

Germany, Switzerland and China were parties to the Protocol.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill will be an important addition to

our  legislation on intellectual property rights which have seen

significant advancements in recent years.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for

your indulgence.  I support the Bill and I just want to raise  a

small point for the Minister to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, as it stands right now, does not deal with e-mail

addresses  and  domain names.  I believe with  Singapore's  move

into  e-commerce and greater use of the Internet for competitive

purposes,  there will be an opportunity given to scoundrels  and

crooks  who  would register things as they have  done  in  other

countries like ronald@Mcdonald.com.sg and these are things which

make  use  of  well-known trade marks or even  registered  trade

marks  for purposes which include blackmailing the actual  trade

mark  owner to pay off this particular person.  So I would  just

like  the Minister to consider adding this perhaps to the future

amendment to the law.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I thank the Member for his

suggestion.  We can certainly consider it as we see how the  law

works out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill, as in the case of the Trade Marks Bill,

which has just been read and put through the House, is a product

of  the  inter-ministry Committee reviewing our  legislation  on

intellectual protection rights.  A similar consultative approach

was taken.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the aim of this Bill is two-fold. Firstly, it seeks to

enhance  the  level of protection for geographical  indications.

Secondly,  it  seeks  to enable Singapore  to  comply  with  our

obligations  under  Articles 22 to 24 of the  WTO  Agreement  on

Trade-Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,  or  the

TRIPS Agreement, in short.

<br><br><i>Geographical Indications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, geographical indications are names or signs used in

trade to identify a good or product as originating from a place,

where  a  given  quality, reputation or other characteristic  of

that good or product is largely attributable to its geographical

origin.  Some  well-known  examples of geographical  indications

include  "CHAMPAGNE", "SCOTCH WHISKY", "CHEDDAR CHEESE",  "PARMA

HAM",  "BORDEAUX", "PORT" and "SHERRY", names which Singaporeans

would likely have come across in any supermarket.

<br><br><i>Compliance of the Existing Law with the TRIPS Agreement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore presently does not have specific legislation

governing the use of geographical indications.  It is,  however,

possible to register them as certification trade marks, if  they

fulfil   the   requirements   under   the   Trade   Marks   Act.

Alternatively,  owners  of  geographical  indications  or  those

authorised by them to use the geographical indication,  may  sue

for  passing off, if the geographical indication fails to fulfil

the  registrability  requirements under  the  Trade  Marks  Act.

Also,  under the Consumer Protection Act, the use or application

of  a  false trade description on goods, including their origin,

is prohibited and constitutes an offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, these laws do not meet the standard of

protection  required  for geographical  indications  in  general

under  the  TRIPS Agreement.  Also, international  trend  is  to

enact  specific legislation to protect geographical indications,

distinct   from  those  relating  to  trade  marks   or   unfair

competition. Hence, we have decided to enact a separate Bill  to

cover this specific area.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Aim of the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly, Sir, the Bill, in compliance with the TRIPS

Agreement, prohibits the following acts:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) use of misleading geographical indications;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) registration of misleading geographical indications as

trade marks; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) use of geographical indications which would constitute an

act  of  unfair  competition within the  meaning  of  the  Paris

Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, further, the Bill provides additional protection for

geographical  indications  relating  to  wines  and  spirits  by

prohibiting the non-misleading use of a geographical  indication

in  relation to wines and spirits, that is to say, the use of  a

geographical  indication for wines and spirits  not  originating

from the place indicated by the geographical indication, even if

the  true  origin of the goods is indicated, or the geographical

indication  is used in translation or accompanied by expressions

such as "kind", "type", "style", "imitation" or the like.

<br><br><i>Main Features of the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, protection under the Bill is limited to geographical

indications of a country or territory which is a member  of  the

WTO,  or  a party to the Paris Convention for the Protection  of

Industrial Property, or a country designated by the Minister  as

a qualifying country. The last category is to give us the option

of  entering  into  a bilateral or multilateral  agreement  with

countries that are neither members of the WTO, nor party to  the

Paris Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no requirement for registration of a geographical

indication  as  the  TRIPS Agreement does  not  make  protection

contingent  upon  registration.   Instead,  the  Bill  allows  a

producer   or   trader  of  goods  identified  by   geographical

indications  or  an association of these persons,  to  institute

proceedings  against a person for committing an  act  prohibited

under the Bill. In line with the TRIPS Agreement,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>

consumers  may  not pursue this avenue. Consumers may,  however,

pursue  existing remedies under the Consumer Protection  Act  or

the Trade Marks Act.

<br><br><i>Exceptions to Protection of Geographical Indications</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, protection under the Bill is subject to some

exceptions, including:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, no relief may be claimed under the Bill in relation

to  a  geographical indication which is contrary to public order

or morality, or which has fallen into disuse or has ceased to be

protected in its country of origin;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, a person may use a geographical indication in relation

to  goods  or services which has become a common name  of  those

goods or services in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, businesses which produce or trade in products which

rely  on  geographical origin to indicate their quality and  for

their reputation will benefit from this Bill.  It will also have

the general effect of facilitating trade and the flow of quality

goods,  and  allow consumers to rely confidently on geographical

indications as an indication of the quality commonly  associated

with the various geographical regions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

read a Third time and passed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a second

time".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Estate Duty (Amendment) Bill 1998 seeks to give

legislative effect to reductions in the interest payable on

estate duty, exemption of donations/gifts and bequests made to

Institutions of a Public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>

Character  or  the Government from estate duty, and  to  changes

which   will  facilitate  the  administration  of  estate  duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, interest of 3% is payable on all estate duty within

the first six months after death.  The rate is 6% if estate duty

is unpaid 6 to 18 months from the date of death, and there is no

provision  to reduce the rate if reasonable cause for the  delay

can be shown.  For the period beyond 18 months, the 12% interest

rate  can  be  reduced to 6% provided reasonable cause  for  the

delay can be shown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage the administrator or executor of an estate to

file in a complete affidavit early, the rate for the first six

months after death will be reduced to 0% if a complete affidavit

is received.  The rate on unpaid estate duty 6 to 18 months

after death will also be reduced from 6% to 3% if reasonable

cause for the delay can be shown.  Clause 12 re-enacts the Sixth

Schedule of the Estate Duty Act (the Act) to empower the

Commissioner to reduce the interest rates payable under these

circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act, gifts or donations made more than a year

before the death of the donor for public or charitable purposes

are not subject to estate duty.  However, under the Income Tax

Act, tax deductions are allowed for donations made to

Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) or the Government at

any point of time.  For consistency with the Income Tax Act,

donations, gifts and bequests to IPCs or the Government will be

exempt from estate duty regardless of the point of time they are

made to these institutions.  Clauses 3 and 4 amend the Act to

provide for the estate duty exemption on donations/gifts and

bequests made to these institutions while clause 13 repeals the

Ninth Schedule which is no longer required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate administration of estate duty, clauses 2, 5,

6 ,7 and 8 amend the Act to provide for the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To empower the Commissioner of Estate Duty, instead of

the  Minister for Finance, to determine the forms for notice  of

assessment,  estate duty affidavit and the estate duty  form  of

account;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To remove the requirement for the Commissioner of

Estate  Duty to certify the payment of estate duty on the estate

duty  affidavit  or  the  form of account  for  internal  record

purposes; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To allow the shares of a deceased person in

the  CDP  account  or CPF investment account to  be  transferred

without estate duty clearance if the market value of such shares

in  either account at the time of death does not exceed $50,000.

Statistics  show  that such cases are generally  not  liable  to

estate duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I rise to support the Bill. The new

amendment   would  allow  the  Commissioner   of   Estate   Duty

flexibility in issuing notices of assessments in such form as he

may  determine.  Similarly, the Estate Duty affidavit which  has

been in circulation for a long time would also be updated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the exemption of gifts and donations to be made

to  Institutions of a Public Character (IPC) as well as  to  the

Government and I hope that the media will give enough  publicity

so that more donations could be made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I find clause 8 which amends section 44 of

the  Act  very progressive.  However, my complaint  is  why  the

Minister chose only a figure of $50,000 instead of $100,000.   I

think  another  method  could have  been  adopted.   Instead  of

setting  the  limit  at  $50,000, we could  have  empowered  the

Minister to vary the figure.  As it now stands, he has  to  come

back to this House whenever he has to make any amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore must be Asia's largest shareholding country

and this is why I am appealing to the Minister to reconsider the

position.   I  also hope the Minister would consider introducing

legislation where small estates below $100,000 need  not  go  to

court.  It could be administered either by the Public Trustee or

even institutions like banks and solicitors.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to the Sixth Schedule is to be welcomed.

However,  I  have  one plea for the Minister, and  that  is,  he

should  give outright exemption for interest for the  first  six

months and thereafter the interest should be added in accordance

with  the  current prime rate.  I am aware of the fact that  the

Commissioner is quite generous in exempting interest  but  I  am

puzzled that the upper limit of 12% is indeed high.  May I  urge

the Minister to reconsider the position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have got another request. I know I am not going to be happy

at  the  end  of the day but I am still asking the  Minister  to

consider  abolishing  estate duty itself gradually.   I  am  not

asking  him to do it now but eventually I hope he would consider

that

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

thank  Mr  Rai for his comments.  I consider the figure  $50,000

adequate  for  the time being although the suggestion  that  the

Minister should be allowed to vary it is reasonable which may be

incorporated in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the introduction of legislation to exempt small estates,

I will consider the suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On interest rates, if an affidavit is filed within six

months,  the  interest  rate should be  zero.   Thereafter,  the

interest  rates  are applied to induce estates to  submit  their

affidavits  in  a timely manner so as to expedite  the  process.

But we will always review this from time to time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on his suggestion to abolish estate duty

altogether, I would like to assure him that the issue of  estate

duty  revision is reviewed annually, and I will take his request

into consideration in the next Budget, although I cannot promise

anything now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House mainly seeks to improve the

standard  of the professional accounting practice in  Singapore,

as  well  as  to streamline disciplinary proceedings for  better

regulation of the profession.  With the worldwide trend  towards

greater transparency and disclosure in corporate regimes,  there

is  a  need  to  ensure that our public accountants  continually

improve  their high standards to ensure the continued  integrity

of our financial system.  I believe that the proposed amendments

take us a step further in that direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments in the Bill arose mainly out of

recommendations made by the Accountants Act Amendments Committee

and  the  Public  Accountants Board (PAB) Working  Committee  to

Review Accounting and Auditing Standards in Singapore.  The  two

Committees included academics and practitioners from the Nanyang

Technological  University, the Stock Exchange of Singapore,  the

Auditor-General's Office, the Attorney-General's  Chambers,  the

Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore  (ICPAS),

and the Registry of Companies and Businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now briefly explain the key provisions of the Bill,

starting with those which strengthen the regulatory framework of

public  accountants, contained in the following clauses  of  the

Bill.

<br><br><i>Clause 6: Validity Period of Licence and Prescribed Requirements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 repeals and re-enacts section 15, which governs

the  certificate  of registration of a public  accountant.   The

duration  of the registration of a public accountant is  reduced

from three years at present to one year.  The Public Accountants

Board  will  then be able to gain more timely information  about

applicants,  and more effectively regulate errant practitioners.

Rather than an automatic renewal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>

of  the licence once every three years, it is now provided  that

the Board will renew the certificate of registration of a public

accountant   only  if  he  has  complied  with  the   prescribed

requirements  relating  to  continuing  professional   education

(CPE),  and  meets what is expected in his professional  conduct

and practice.  This re-emphasises the importance of training and

practice review to maintain the high standards of accounting and

auditing  practices in Singapore.  It will give legal effect  to

standards already required of public accountants by ICPAS.

<br><br><i>Clause 8:  Preliminary Information/Need for Deposit</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 20, which governs procedures on

complaints.   The Board, in the event of a complaint  against  a

public accountant, can now require the accountant to respond  to

its  preliminary inquiries, before the complaint is referred  to

an  Inquiry Committee.  A maximum fine of $2,000 may be  imposed

if  the  accountant concerned refuses, without good  reason,  to

respond  to  the  preliminary inquiry.  To  weed  out  frivolous

complaints and abuse of the disciplinary process, the  amendment

will  also  allow the Board to require a refundable deposit  not

exceeding  $1,000 to be placed with the Board.  This amount  may

be  forfeited in full or partially if the complaint is found  to

be  frivolous or vexatious, or dismissed because the complainant

refuses to co-operate with the Board.

<br><br><i>Clauses 6 & 9: Suspension and De-Registration</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 amends section 21 to add to the grounds on which the

Board  may  suspend  or de-register a public accountant.   Every

public  accountant  who  is registered with  the  Board  has  to

observe the Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics, set out  in

the  Third  Schedule  of the Board Rules.   He  has  to  conduct

himself in a manner consistent with the good reputation  of  the

accountancy   profession,  which  demands  high   standards   of

integrity,  objectivity, independence and moral character.   The

amendment  gives  legal effect for failure  to  conduct  oneself

properly.  Consequential amendment is made via clause 6

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>

to  section  19 to allow an Inquiry Committee to be set  up  for

purpose  of  ascertaining whether an infringement or failure  to

observe the Code has been committed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public accountants will also benefit from this amendment, which

provides  that any suspension, de-registration or imposition  of

penalty  on a public accountant may take effect only  after  the

expiration  of  one  month from the date  on  which  the  appeal

against  the decision made to the High Court has been determined

or  withdrawn.   This  new provision seeks  to  minimize  losses

suffered   by  the  public  accountant  as  a  result   of   the

cancellation or suspension of his licence.  The High  Court  may

also assess any cost charged against a public accountant.

<br><br><i>Clause 11: Voluntary De-Registration Upon Complaint/Summary De-Registration</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 amends section 23 to add to the grounds on which a

public accountant may be summarily removed from the Register  of

Public  Accountants.  A new provision is inserted to  prevent  a

public  accountant from applying to be removed from the Register

of  Public Accountants if disciplinary action is pending against

him  or  if  he  is being investigated by an Inquiry  Committee.

This  is  a  loophole  that should be  plugged  and  is  a  fair

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Bill, we have however received

feedback from various sources that the other intended provisions

may  be  too  harsh.   In  particular, in the  current  economic

environment, business revenues may be severely affected, leading

to  unavoidable  credit problems.  As such, I  have  decided  to

remove   "insolvency"  and  "entering  into   composition   with

creditors"  as  grounds for summary removal.  Instead,  in  such

cases, we will rely on existing provisions under section  21  of

the Act, which requires an Inquiry Committee to be first set up,

with its appropriate appeal channels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in cases where the public accountant has already been

adjudged a bankrupt through the usual processes, there is really

no need for the PAB to go through a further Inquiry Committee.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>

Hence, there are grounds for summary removal in the case where a

public  accountant is an adjudged bankrupt.  I propose  to  move

amendments  to clarify these points.  With the consent  of  this

House,  I will therefore be proposing these changes to the  Bill

when we are in Committee stage later on.

<br><br><i>Clause 13: Imposition of Composition Fines</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 inserts a new section 56A. This enables the Board to

impose deterrent fines on minor offences without having to bring

offenders   to  court.  However,  offences  involving   personal

misconduct,   which  will  be  dealt  with  under  the   Board's

disciplinary  proceedings and subject to due process,  shall  be

excluded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to other amendments which will improve the operations

and efficiency  of the Public Accountants Board.

<br><br><i>Clause 3: Adoption of Accounting Standards</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, PAB rules already require a public accountant to

carry out his professional work in accordance with technical and

professional  standards expected of him as a public  accountant.

While  the practice of the Public Accountants Board is to  adopt

the standards issued by ICPAS, its power to do so is implied  by

section 5(d) as one of the Board's functions is to "control  and

regulate the practice of the profession of accountancy by public

accountants".   In comparison, in the United States  and  United

Kingdom,  the  regulatory bodies for the accountancy  profession

have the legislative power to prescribe such standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence an amendment is required to amend section 5 of the

Accountants Act to expressly empower the Board to prescribe  the

standards,  methods and procedures that public accountants  have

to follow in the course of their professional work.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Clause 12: De-Regulation of Tax Consultants</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 amends section 48 to enable persons not registered as

public   accountants  to  practise  as  tax  consultants.    Tax

consultancy   should  not  be  the  sole  preserve   of   public

accountants  and  solicitors, as currently  provided  under  the

Accountants   Act.   Indeed  market  forces   will   drive   tax

consultants  who  do  not deliver good quality  service  out  of

business.  In addition, unlike public accountants whose work has

a great impact on the public, the argument for the protection of

general  public interest holds less weight in the  case  of  tax

consultancy  as  it  is  a  service offered  exclusively  to  an

individual paying customer.  There is thus no specific need  for

the  Board  to  regulate tax agents.  Nevertheless,  the  Inland

Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) will be examining ways  of

ensuring the continued high professional standard of tax agents,

and this will be announced when ready.

<br><br><i>Clause 4: Change to Self-Funding Status of PAB</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 4 amends section 7 to enable the Board to meet

its expenses through Government funding. Presently, the Board is

funded  solely  by  fees  collected from  the  registration  and

renewal  of public accountants' licences. This is not sufficient

to  cover  the  Board's operating expenditure,  especially  when

legal  and  inquiry  costs need to be incurred.   The  grant  is

necessary as the Board's expenditure will continue to be  pushed

up  by  rising administrative expenses as well as investigation,

prosecution and legal assessment costs for increasingly  complex

complaint  cases.   These  costs  are  essential  to  ensure   a

thorough, fair and effective complaints inquiry process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments are to clarify interpretations and relate

to consequential amendments to the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak in support of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>

the  Accountants  (Amendment) Bill.  I would like,  however,  to

express  some concerns over some of the proposed amendments  and

also to seek clarification on some others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 21(1)(a)(viii) appears to be very stringent such

that  the  public  accountants are  not  able  to  pursue  other

business   interests.    This   does   not   provide   for   the

entrepreneurial  spirit,  which  our  country   is   encouraging

currently.  Moreover, this will pose hardship to many  part-time

and  small  time public accountants who form quite a substantial

portion of the accountant community.  They will feel the adverse

effects  of  this  amendment as in  most cases they  do  provide

other non-accountancy-related services as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 23(g) should stop at the word "bankrupt". This

is   because,  with  the  current  economic  crisis,  a   public

accountant  may need to enter into a composition with  creditors

and should he be successful, there is no reason why he should be

removed from the register.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 56(A), there is no consistency in this provision

whereby  any offences under this Act or any rule made thereunder

which  is  prescribed as compoundable offences may be compounded

for  a  sum  of  money not exceeding $1,000.   This  is  because

certain  provisions  call for a fine not  exceeding  $2,000,  an

example  which may be found in section 20(3E).  Therefore,  this

provision  may have been better to be in line with  the  others,

ie, a fine not exceeding $2,000 as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in section 19 provides a much wider scope for

misconduct  for  public accountants, unlike the  old  Act  which

restricts complaints to professional misconduct only.  There  is

ambiguity  in  the  "improper  act  or  conduct"  which   brings

disrepute  to  the accountants' profession or which  makes  them

unfit  for practice.  There is a need for clarification here  in

the  nature  and  extent  in the meaning  of  "improper  act  or

conduct".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards section 15, firstly, subsection 5(b) on "appraisal of

the public accountant's professional conduct and practice" calls

for  further clarification on the operational methods to  ensure

effective and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>

credible  judgement and, secondly, in subsection  5(c)  on  "any

other  matter  which the Board considers relevant" embodies  too

much  and  the  nature of these matters should be specified  and

should be confined to technical, professional or moral issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments in section 5 appear to prepare the way for the

Public  Accountants Board to prescribe the accounting standards,

methods and procedures to be followed by public accountants when

doing any work in the course of their profession.  I would  like

to  seek  clarification on the kind of resources which  will  be

committed  to  this  function in order to  benefit  the  general

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the Bill.  I would like to declare my interest  as  a

practising  public  accountant,  as  a  Council  member  of  the

Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore,  and  as

someone  who has participated in some of the discussions earlier

on over some of these amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to state that I am expressing a personal

view.   When  I  first read the Bill for the first  time  as  an

individual, as anyone else would have been looking at  the  text

of  the Bill, I had this feeling that the amendments were rather

draconian.   Then I read it a second and third  time,  but  this

time  as  a practitioner, as a public accountant, and I  realise

that the amendments really were to bring the Accountants Act  in

line  with  other  Acts regulating the other professionals.   In

some respect, because it is a more recent amendment than the Act

regulating,  say, the solicitors, we have actually  improved  on

it.   We  have  included composition for very minor offences  as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite convinced that the amendments have been made not to

make  life  more difficult for public accountants, but  to  help

public  accountants maintain their stature.  I am in support  of

the Bill but there are some areas of concern that I feel need to

be addressed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15(5)(a) on continuing professional education and

section  15(5)(b)   on the appraisal of the public  accountant's

professional  conduct  and practice are two  of  the  areas  for

compliance  that will be considered by the Board for the  annual

renewal  of  their  certificate.  I think  there  will  be  some

problems here because Continuing Professional Education (CPE) is

being  monitored  for  compliance over  a  3-year  period.   The

practice review to appraise the public accountant's professional

conduct and practice is also done in cycles.  Perhaps there is a

need to add that compliance in these two areas is assumed unless

there is evidence to the contrary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that there is going to be an amendment to the

amendment  because I was quite concerned over the  inclusion  of

the  condition  of  insolvency and of  a  composition  with  any

creditor  for a public accountant to be struck off.   Especially

in  current times, a public accountant having bought a home with

a  bank overdraft, and with the fall in the property market, may

well  find himself to be technically insolvent.  But I think  it

is  now  water  under  the bridge as there  is  now  a  proposed

amendment.  So overall, yes, I find it is more stringent on  the

public  accountants  but  it  is a profession,  the  stature  is

respected and should be maintained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly glad with the amendment in section 48 which

now  allows non-accountants to practise as tax consultants.  For

some time now, I feel that it does not make sense that a person,

who has passed all the vigorous examinations of the Institute of

Taxation,  and perhaps even with experience practising taxation,

or  perhaps  has  been  in  employment  of  the  Inland  Revenue

Authority, cannot come out and practise as a tax consultant.   I

think now this addresses that issue.  However, having opened  it

up,  there  is  a  need perhaps for regulation  to  control  and

maintain the standards of tax consultants in the interest of the

public.   It would be a sad day if the public is represented  by

someone holding himself up to be a tax consultant and who is not

competent, and therefore results in huge losses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amendments to the Accountants Act, the public

accountant is well regulated, and I am sure some will feel  that

we  are being over-regulated.  I am very sure over the next  few

months,  some  public accountants will be arguing  and  debating

over  the  amendments.  The question that remains is:  who  then

regulates  the accountants in commerce?  After all,  they  cause

financial statements to be prepared and often are the  ones  who

prepare the financial statements themselves.  I think there is a

need also to control the conduct and the standard of accountants

in  commercial practice.  If the work of both the commercial and

public   accountants  is  of  a  high  standard,   they   become

complementary.  But, as it stands now, in some cases  where  the

standards  do differ, the respective positions of the commercial

accountants  and the public accountants can then be  adversarial

to the detriment of all parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I do support the Bill, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

thank Dr Neo and Mr Ee for their comments and points raised  and

I will try to address their concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, disciplinary proceedings. Dr Lily Neo has commented

that  section  21(1)(a)(viii) is too  stringent  and  may  deter

entrepreneurship.   She also feels that it will  pose  hardship,

especially  on small time accountants, since in most cases  they

do provide other non-accountancy related services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is also concerned that section 19(1) may be too wide as the

grounds  for  an  Inquiry Committee to be set up  have  expanded

beyond professional misconduct, and now include an "improper act

or  conduct" which brings disrepute to the profession  or  makes

them  unfit  for  practice.  I will address these  two  concerns

together, as they are related.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in moving the amendment, I had earlier informed the

House  that every public accountant has to observe the  Code  of

Professional  Conduct and Ethics and has to conduct  himself  or

herself in a manner consistent with the good reputation  of  the

accountancy   profession.    The  Code   already   imposes   the

requirement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>

that  public accountants should not be substantially engaged  in

any  other  business,  other than that of a  public  accountant.

This is to pre-empt situations where public accountants are  put

in a position where their independence is compromised, and there

is   a   conflict   of   interest   between   his   professional

responsibilities and the pursuit of wider business interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 21 merely picks up on these

professional  obligations which are,  in  fact,  being  observed

already.  Section 21 sets out the grounds for the PAB to suspend

or    cancel    a   public   accountant's   licence,   following

investigations by an Inquiry Committee.  It thus establishes the

legal recourse (of suspension or deregistration) for failure  to

act professionally and independently, resulting from a range  of

causes, including that of engaging in business at odds with  the

demands  of the profession.  I am therefore confident  that  the

amendment  should  not  in any way hinder  entrepreneurship,  as

public  accountants would remain quite free  to  carry  on  non-accountancy-related services, as long as there is no conflict of

interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to section 19 are really

consequential to the broadening of the causes for deregistration

in section 21.  The amendment will allow an Inquiry Committee to

be  set  up  when  a public accountant brings disrepute  to  his

profession,  by  behaviour  in  areas  beyond  his  professional

capacity.  Some may say that this appears draconian, but let  me

assure Members that the provisions will not be triggered when  a

public  accountant has committed an improper  act  per  se.   An

inquiry can only proceed if the act has an adverse impact on the

general  standing of the profession, or shows  that  the  public

accountant  is  unfit  for  his  profession.   This  is  a  fair

application  of  the law, in order to safeguard and  uphold  the

integrity of the accounting profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers are crafted broadly in the statute in order to

ensure  that  the  PAB has a wide enough remit  to  achieve  its

objective.   But  I  expect the PAB to  be  circumspect  in  its

administration.  Members may also be interested to know

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>

that  largely  similar provisions exist in the Legal  Profession

Act,  where  "misconduct unbefitting . an advocate or solicitor"

is also grounds for discipline by the Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of renewal of certificate of registration,

both Dr Neo and Mr Gerard Ee have asked for clarification on how

the  new provisions in section 15 on the renewal of certificates

of registration will work in practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, renewal of certificates will no longer be

automatic,    but   conditional   on   satisfying    "continuing

professional  education"  (CPE) and  "appraisal  of  the  public

accountant's professional conduct and practice".  In response to

Mr  Ee's  question, the annual CPE records of public accountants

will  be  considered by the Public Accountants  Board  when  the

renewal of public accountants becomes due.  But given the three-year compliance rule, consideration will be given to whether  or

not the public accountant has fulfilled the requirements for the

preceding three-year period on a rolling basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For practice reviews, the Board shall consider only the reports

of  accounting firms for which the review has been completed  in

that  year.   Only  the public accountants of  these  particular

firms will have the renewals of their licences to be subject  to

the practice review reports being satisfactory.  However, over a

three-year cycle, all public accountants will be covered  as  it

is intended for all public accounting firms to be reviewed.  The

practice review of accounting firms with public listed companies

as clients will be more regular.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For both CPE and practice review requirements, if a public

accountant  does not satisfy either requirement  for  the  first

time,  he  will  be issued with a warning letter.   Only  if  he

persists in failing to meet the requirement will the licence not

be renewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAB's Rules will be suitably amended to incorporate the new

provisions in due course.  As for Dr Neo's concern that  section

15(5)(c)  is  overly wide, I would like to assure her  that  the

Board will continue to confine itself only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>

to  technical and professional issues.  There is no intention to

deliberately  make it more difficult for public  accountants  to

renew their licences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of composition fines, Dr Neo has commented

that  the new section 56A, which allows PAB to compound offences

of  up  to  $1,000,  is  inconsistent  with  provisions  in  the

Accountants Act on other offences, some of which can  result  in

fines of up to $2,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there should be a clear distinction between a

compoundment of an offence and a statutory fine.  A  composition

sum  is that which the authority administering an Act allows  an

offender to pay, in lieu of prosecuting him in the court for the

offence,  whereas a statutory fine results from a conviction  in

court, and covers more serious offences.  Thus, the penalty  for

compounded offence should necessarily be lower than  that  of  a

statutory  fine, as the two are not equivalent.  Compounding  is

really  for  more  minor offences or offences  where  there  are

mitigating factors, such that a prosecution is not warranted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without an option to compound fines for minor offences at a

lower  amount,  the High Court may be clogged up with  even  the

most  minor  offences.   If  the  composition  fine  is  raised,

offenders may find it more attractive to fight it out  in  court

in the hope of getting undeserved acquittals.  This would defeat

the whole purpose of the compoundment provision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On regulation of tax consultants, Mr Gerard Ee has asked

who will regulate the tax professionals.  As I have mentioned in

my  Second  Reading  speech,  the Inland  Revenue  Authority  of

Singapore would be examining ways of ensuring the continued high

professional standard of tax agents, and this will be  announced

when  ready.   Under the Tax Acts, where there are  errors  (and

omissions)  in tax returns, IRAS can prosecute those  who  flout

the law.  If the error is due to negligence of the tax agent, he

would be required to pay penalties.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On regulation over non-practising accountants, Mr Gerard Ee

also  feels that there should be greater regulation and  control

over  non-practising  accountants who are the  frontline  people

preparing   or   influencing   the  preparation   of   financial

statements.   I  think  this is a fair statement.   But  control

already  exists in the Institute of Certified Public Accountants

of  Singapore (ICPAS) as it regulates non-practising accountants

who   are  its  members.   For  example,  ICPAS  has  also  made

continuing professional education (CPE) hours mandatory for such

members,  who  can also be deregistered from ICPAS  for  various

offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICPAS, however, has no hold over non-practising accountants who

are  not  its  members, and it is unclear that  such  regulation

should  be  mandated.  This was debated at  length  by  the  PAB

Working  Committee to Review Accounting and Auditing  Standards,

whose  rationale was as follows.  As non-practising  accountants

generally work for companies, it is more of an employer-employee

relationship.   And  since it is the responsibility  of  company

directors  to ensure that the proper records are kept  and  that

accounts are properly drawn up, it is less imperative that  such

accounts preparers be directly regulated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On PAB resources, Dr Neo has commented on the amendment to

section  5,  which provides for PAB to prescribe the  accounting

standards  and procedures to be followed by public  accountants.

She  would like to know what kind of resources will be committed

to this function.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of

Singapore prescribes auditing and accounting standards,  and  as

earlier explained, the amendment will expressly empower the  PAB

to  adopt  such standards.  Therefore, I do not expect  this  to

result  in a significant increase in resources required for  the

PAB.   Nonetheless,  I  wish to point out that  I  have  already

introduced,  by  way of clause 4, a change to  the  self-funding

status  of  the  PAB.   The Government  is  prepared  to  extend

operating grants to PAB, and this co-sharing of regulatory

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>

costs    signifies    the   Government's   commitment    towards

strengthening the integrity of the financial system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this, and other proposed changes, will all

contribute  to  a major enhancement of the regulatory  framework

for  the accounting profession, and deserve the support of  this

House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of summary removal due to composition

arrangement with creditors, I have already addressed this in  my

Second  Reading  speech, and I believe that Dr  Neo  and  Mr  Ee

should be pleased with the outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As the notice of amendment is out of time, I

"(c) by deleting the words "has been adjudicated bankrupt or" in

sub-paragraph (v) of subsection (1)(a);".

Members  will recall that I had touched upon this in  my  speech

earlier.   The  reason behind the amendment is  that  for  cases

where  the  public  accountant has  been  adjudged  a  bankrupt,

summary  removal  of  his  name  from  the  Register  of  Public

Accountants  without  the  need  for  further  inquiry   is   an

appropriate course of action.

has".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In page 7, lines 23 and 24, to leave out "or who has

entered into a composition with any creditor".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Members will recall that I had earlier explained that due

to  the  current economic environment, business revenues may  be

severely  affected leading to unavoidable credit  problems.   As

such,  insolvency when entering into composition with  creditors

should not constitute grounds for summary removal.  These  words

should  be  omitted from the Bill.  Instead it is proposed  that

such cases continue to be referred to the PAB Inquiry Committee,

which  is  currently  the  practice and already  provided  under

section 21 of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House principally focuses on the repeal

of  the  provision  in the Currency Act which currently  imposes

strict controls on the existence of full colour copying machines

in  Singapore.  Apart from this major amendment, opportunity  is

also  taken  to incorporate 16 other amendments to  improve  and

update practices and procedures of the Board of Commissioners of

Currency of Singapore (BCCS).

<br><br><i>Clause 13: Lifting of Controls over Colour Copiers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill seeks to repeal the existing

provision on the controls of colour copiers governed by  section

20A of the Currency Act and the Currency (Full Copying Machines)

Regulations  of 1996.  These statutes require a permit  for  the

use  of  colour  copiers,  as well as a  counterfeit  prevention

system (CPS) to be fitted in every such machine licensed for use

in  Singapore.  Controls on colour copiers had been put in place

since  1979 to combat counterfeit activity.  They were  enhanced

in  1995 when currency counterfeits made by even low-end  colour

copiers  were found to be good enough to be passed off  as  real

currency.  However, with rapid advances in technology, a drastic

reduction in the cost of producing colour copiers, and therefore

the  widespread availability of these colour copiers  worldwide,

the  Government  has  acknowledged that our controls  on  colour

copiers  are becoming increasingly onerous and impractical,  and

cannot be expected to be water-tight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, instead of seeking to continue strong and direct

controls  which  disadvantage Singaporeans and inhibit  industry

players,  especially those based in Singapore,  we  have  chosen

instead to speed up the development of a new Portrait series  of

Singapore   currency   notes  that   are   more   resistant   to

counterfeiting via colour copiers.  BCCS will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>

issuing  the new Portrait Series incorporating the latest  anti-colour copier and anti-scanner security features, including  the

Common  Mark  System  (CMS) in 1999.  The  CMS  is  designed  to

distort  the image of any attempted colour photocopies of  these

notes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely for the existing controls of colour copiers to be

lifted.  The main beneficiaries would be Singaporeans, who  will

now  have  wider access to full colour copiers, and the business

community,  not  only  users but also  manufacturers  trying  to

create a mass market for low-cost colour copiers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other proposed amendments to the Currency Act are to improve

the  practices and procedures of the BCCS.  I will now bring the

House through the main amendments.

<br><br><i>Clauses 4 and 5: Board Appointment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 seeks to amend section 6 of the Act to clarify

that all members of the Board, including the Chairman and Deputy

Chairman, shall be appointed for a specific period not exceeding

three  years  and  shall  be eligible  for  re-appointment.  The

proposed  amendment is made in view of the provision since  1991

that the post of Chairman, BCCS, is no longer held automatically

by  the  Minister  for Finance, hence the need  to  specify  the

duration  of  the Chairman's appointment.  Clause 5 extends  the

general  disqualification  provision  in  section  8(1)  of  the

Currency Act to apply to all members of the Board, including the

Chairman.



<br><br><i>Clause 12: Provision on Currency Reproduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 seeks to amend section 20(1) and (2) to clarify

and  extend the restriction on the use of photographs,  drawings

or  designs  of Singapore currency notes and coins.  The  clause

also  seeks  to  enable  BCCS to impose conditions  in  granting

permission on the use of these photographs, drawings  or  design

of  currency notes and coins. The effect would be that  selected

manufacturers and others who have been licensed to use Singapore

currency  note  or coin design for souvenirs, merchandise,  etc,

could have

<br><br><i>Clauses 14 and 18: Currency Fund and Liquidity Requirements</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends section 21(5) to remove the percentage of

30%  of  the Currency Fund which must be held in liquid portion.

This  specification is considered unnecessary as currently,  the

liquid portion can be varied with the unanimous approval of  the

Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 also seeks to delete section 21(6) which defines

the list of assets previously deemed to be liquid, such as gold,

silver,  foreign  exchange and Government guaranteed  securities

maturing in less than two years.  The amendment brings  the  Act

up to date with current developments in the financial landscape,

in  which liquidity is no longer static or quantifiable concept,

given  that the ease with which investments are liquidated would

differ under varying circumstances.  The proposed amendment will

accord  the  Board  greater flexibility in maintaining  adequate

liquidity in the Currency Fund to meet demand.

<br><br><i>Clause 15: External Assets</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 seeks to amend section 22 to specify three other

types of external assets in the Currency Fund, namely, equities,

corporate  bonds,  and  currency  and  financial  futures.  This

amendment makes it clear in the legislation the inclusion of the

three  additional  external  assets  which  have  already   been

approved by the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments are of a drafting nature to rectify

inconsistencies, and clarify provisions where  there  have  been

difficulties in interpretation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br>5.43 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The motion is subject to signification

of  support by at least one Member.  Does the motion   have  the

support of at least one hon. Member?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, recognizing that in a true democratic

society, every citizen should have the basic right to comment on

and  criticise the conduct of public officials in the  discharge

of their public functions and duties, resolves that a Commission

be  appointed  to examine and recommend what changes  should  be

made  to the law of defamation to give every citizen this  basic

right to exercise without fear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this motion that I am tabling this

evening is a logical follow-up to the last motion that I  tabled

and  which  was debated some four months ago on the  removal  of

fear in Singapore.  And I dare say that Members, feeling perhaps

exhausted  after a long day and not only just the long  day  but

the  week, will say to themselves, "Are we going to have another

tedious  hour  from  Mr Jeyaretnam?"  It is  probably  for  that

reason that our faithful Singapore press did not report anything

of what I said at the last motion.  They find it tedious to bore

their  readers and that is probably why nothing was  said  about

what  I said in Parliament two days ago.  But I am not going  to

bother about what the Singapore press has to say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion, Mr Deputy Speaker, moves the focus to this House.

May  I  make that clear.  The previous motion was examining  the

role  of  the people in our society, particularly their role  in

the  participation  in decision-making.   But  this  motion  now

proposes to examine the role of Parliament in such a society.  I

will explain what I mean as I go on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said once before, in 1947, when we, as a people, were

deciding  what  sort  of a government we  desired,  because  the

British  had  offered some self-autonomy, we sent  an  All-Party

Commission  to  London  to say that we  wanted  a  parliamentary

democracy  based  on  the Westminster  model.   And  it  is  not

surprising,  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that we should have  chosen

that,  that  is, that we wanted a parliamentary democracy  where

the  Government will be subject to Parliament, representing  the

will  of  the people.  I said it is not surprising because  that

system  of  government was accepted by the people of the  United

States  when they decided to break away from the United  Kingdom

and become a nation by themselves, only that they carried it  to

more  rigid  divisions  of power and it  was  also  accepted  by

countries which were once under British rule and then broke away

from  British  rule.   And Pandit Jawaharlal  Nehru,  the  first

Prime  Minister  of  India,  and who  was  a  great,  passionate

believer in parliamentary democracy, chose that as the model for

India.   May I say, it was not just Jawaharlal Nehru,  even  our

present  Senior  Minister  who was a  member  of  the  All-Party

Commission  to  London,  chose for  Singapore,  along  with  the

others,  this parliamentary system of government.   It  was  not

surprising  that  he  should  choose  that,  having  come   from

Cambridge and studied DICEY and the rule of law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this system of government, it is Parliament that, as

representatives  of  the people, should have  control  over  the

Government.   It  should  act not only  as  offering  advice  on

legislation, law and other matters, but first and foremost, as a

check  on  executive power.  That was the foremost intention  of

the  people who evolved Parliament into what it is today in  the

United Kingdom and other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that I am posing today, and which I would ask the

Members to answer honestly, is: is this Parliament, now 50 years

down  the  road, after we accepted the parliamentary  system  of

government,  performing such a role, and if  not,  why  not?   I

propose in the course

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>

of  my  speech to give the answers as to why this House  is  not

performing  the  role  that  it  should  be  performing   in   a

parliamentary  democratic  form of government  and  suggest  the

remedy for that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was envisaged by those who were setting out on the nationhood

for  Singapore that Parliament should, as I said, be the supreme

body  and  that the Government be subject to it.  Of  course,  I

have  to  acknowledge that in the years before  1959,  when  the

present  Senior Minister was in the opposition, the  Legislative

Assembly,  even though it had limited powers, was trying  to  do

just  that,  to  act as a check on the Government  then.   Those

Members  who have read the debates would have seen that  Mr  Lee

wasted  no time, although again his Opposition Members were  not

very  large, in trying to bring the Government to check, probing

and  seeking answers to questions.  He then showed himself as  a

firm  believer  in parliamentary democracy.  But for  Singapore,

this fervour somewhat began to cool off after the PAP took power

in  1959, though from the years 1963 to 1965, when we were  part

of  Malaysia  and Mr Lee was attending the Malaysian Parliament,

there  he  again found his fervour and spoke at length, whenever

it was possible, on the need for parliamentary democracy and the

government being subject to parliamentary control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after we came out of Malaysia and perhaps before that,

Parliament  began on the road of not being able to exercise  its

role  which  was intended for it.  This became very marked  when

the  Barisan Sosialis who were still in the Assembly after  they

had  broken away from the People's Action Party and were sitting

in  the  opposition benches, decided, for some reason or  other,

that  they would take their battle to the streets, and would  no

longer  attend the sittings of the Assembly.  That, may  I  say,

and I have said it, was a wrong move and it was a disservice  to

the people of Singapore when they left the Legislative Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, when we came out of Malaysia, we found ourselves with a

Parliament  totally  composed of One-Party Members,  the  ruling

party Members, and that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>

continued  until  1981  when there was  one  other  Member  from

another party in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, 50 years down the road, we still have not reached

anywhere  near the stage of performing the role that  Parliament

was intended.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, can I just hear

from you whether you have any experiences to demonstrate that we

need to change the law of defamation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam :</b> I am coming to it, but I must perhaps lay

the  background and show you the present role of Parliament  and

why  it  is  such a damaging thing for our society.  I  will  be

coming to it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> We have heard your views on a number of

times.  Otherwise, I will not allow it because you are repeating

your points over and over again over the years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is important

so  that  Members  can  understand why we  need  to  change  the

defamation  laws.  They should understand the role of Parliament

and ask the question where they are moving.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Do not go back to history because what

you have said has already been mentioned over and over again  in

this House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am not repeating what I have said today.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> All right. Proceed and go to the

point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You must bear with me. This is Parliament

and  Members should have the right to speak their minds  on  the

present position.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, there is a Standing

Order to discourage repetition of points.  So can you just stick

to the point and do not go back to history all over again?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Mr Deputy Speaker. But the

point  is that by a systematic and deliberate move, which  I  am

going to spell out, the libel suits

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>

would  be one of these measures.  That is why I am going to  ask

for an amendment to the defamation laws.  But I am saying, by  a

systematic  and  deliberate  move, the  Government  has  so  far

succeeded   in  preventing  the  election  into  Parliament   of

Opposition  Members  and that is what I am  talking  about  this

evening,  and  that is why I am asking for an amendment  to  the

defamation  laws in accordance with the spirit and  Articles  of

the Constitution.  Do I make myself clear, Mr Deputy Speaker?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Come to the point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, thank you. As I said, by a deliberate

and  systematic  course of action, they kept Opposition  Members

out.   At  first,  it  was  the use  of  ISA,  and  making  life

inconvenient  for  those who aspired to enter  Parliament.   But

now, over the last few years, we see an increasing trend to keep

Opposition  Members out by the use of the libel  law  and  which

deters very effectively, may I say, persons who aspire to  enter

Parliament  to serve their country, but think that  their  place

should  really  be in the Opposition, and not in the  Government

party.  But they are deterred by the defamation actions.   I  am

going  to  ask whether these defamation actions accord with  the

spirit  of the Articles in the Constitution and with the law  as

it is being developed in other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want me to move on, I will. But the quintessence of a

parliamentary  democracy,  may  I  say,  is  the   presence   in

Parliament  of  a  sufficient body of  members  to  perform  the

primary role of Parliament as a check on the Executive.  So  the

point  I  am  making is that if you really believe  in  a  truly

democratic  society,  then you should  put  no  impediments,  no

blocks,  on Parliament playing the role that it was intended  to

play.  It can only play that role if you have a sufficient  body

of  Opposition Members.  They can only enter Parliament  through

elections and there is no substitute for allowing the electorate

to  elect the Opposition Members into Parliament.  With  respect

to  the  Nominated Members, they are no substitute.   Parliament

should have the Opposition Members in Parliament elected by  the

electorate.  For this, there is a basic right

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>

on  the  part of voters to receive information on issues in  the

elections  and  corresponding  right  on  candidates  to  impart

information.  Therefore, free speech becomes the life  blood  in

elections for voters to make their choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is guaranteed by the Constitution. Article 14, Part IV

of  the  Constitution, enshrines what are the  essentials  of  a

democratic  society  and which Singapore should  have.   Article

14(1)  of the Constitution  grants every citizen the freedom  of

expression and assembly.    Article 14(2)(a), however, seeks  to

impose  a  restriction  on this right  where  it  is  considered

necessary.   It  says,  "Parliament may by  law  impose  .  such

restrictions  as it considers necessary."  Article  162  of  the

Constitution expressly mandates the courts, Parliament  and  all

other  law-making  bodies  to construe  any  existing  law  with

modifications,  adaptations, qualifications  and  exceptions  to

bring  them into conformity with the Constitution.  So there  is

clear  mandate in the Constitution that there should be  no  law

which  unnecessarily, and that is important, puts an  impediment

on the development of a truly democratic society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will illustrate how the defamation laws have been applied by

the  courts, and I am not here to criticise the decisions of the

courts,  but  I  am here to ask whether we should  now  make  an

amendment to the defamation law to bring it into accord with the

Constitution.   I will illustrate this by three cases  of  libel

suits that were brought, and they are of very recent origins, so

I expect Members must be more than aware of these suits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first was a suit brought in 1989 and it arose over

questions asked about the death of a Minister.  Members will, of

course, recall that the former Minister for National Development

of whom Mr Lee, when I was in this House, declared, "Where can I

find  another Mr Teh Cheang Wan."  He was found dead in bed  one

morning  and  the  cause  of death was  an  overdose  of  amytal

tablets.   It  was then revealed that he was under investigation

for corruption.  So that was immediately a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>

matter  of great public interest.  There is no question that  it

was  a  matter  of  great  public  interest.   Our  party  asked

questions saying there should be a full investigation into  this

death  and  how  he came by his death.  We asked  two  questions

because  it  was revealed that he had written to the then  Prime

Minister,  the present Senior Minister, a letter the day  before

he  died.   It was not revealed whether there was any  reply  to

that  letter.  So we asked whether there was any reply given  to

him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question was: how did he get these amytal tablets?

Because   amytal tablets, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are probably

aware,  are  on the Poisons List.  Their stocks and distribution

are  controlled,  and should be controlled very  strictly,  with

proper  records kept.  When we asked for questions  through  the

party, there was no answer.  But when I asked the same questions

in  an  election in 1988, I was served with a writ.  I  do  want

Members  to  understand this clearly that this  arose  over  two

questions  asked, questions which were of great public interest.

In  any other country, the press and public would be in full cry

wanting  to know the answers to several questions.   But  I  was

taken to court as having libelled the then Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in court, we got an answer from him that he did

not reply to that letter.  As someone observed to me, "Well, you

had to pay $260,000 for an answer to a question. Was that not  a

bit expensive?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that we should ask is: should we permit actions

like this, or should we not amend the law to prevent actions  of

this nature where the action arises over legitimate questions of

public interest asked of Ministers and public officials?  It  is

very important that we grasp this because if Ministers are going

to  serve  a  writ  on any member of the public  or  any  member

aspiring  to  come into Parliament because he asks questions  of

public  interest and then scare him into coming into Parliament,

we are never going to get a Parliament to play its role.  We are

not  going to get the Opposition Members coming into Parliament.

So that was one case.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, the more recent cases brought after the last

elections or just towards the tail end of the elections.   I  do

not have to repeat or give a lot of information to Members about

how  these libel suits came about.  But, of course, Members will

recall that it was revealed publicly that a Cabinet decision had

been  taken to keep Mr Tang Liang Hong out of Parliament.   That

the  Cabinet  had  decided that he should not  be  allowed  into

Parliament.  Of course, that meant that the whole team could not

come in.  I could not come in either because he was part of  the

team.   In  pursuance of that, they decided,  and  this  is  all

public,  that they would expose him as a Chinese chauvinist  and

an  anti-Christian.  He had not said anything but  they  decided

that  they would expose him as a Chinese chauvinist and an anti-Christian so that he would not enter into Parliament, and  along

with   him,  me  and  the  others  who  were  standing  in  this

constituency.  And Mr Tang said he was not a Chinese chauvinist,

he was not anti-Christian, because he could not keep silent when

he  was  accused of these things, and so he spoke to the  press,

and he said, "I am not."  He said, "They are telling lies."  But

he could have said they were not telling the truth.  There is no

truth in what they say.  And for that, it was decided that libel

suits should be issued against him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Members can see how oppressively libel suits are

being  used in Singapore.  Here is a man who is accused of being

a  Chinese  chauvinist,  being  anti-Christian,  because  it  is

thought  that he should not be in this House.  And  libel  suits

are issued against him when he denies it, says that they are not

telling  the  truth  when they accuse him  of  being  a  Chinese

chauvinist and anti-Christian.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there were other suits against him. One was that

because  he said in Kuala Lumpur when he was informed  that  the

Prime Minister had said that he would not be arrested under  the

ISA,  "Should I trust him?" or something.  He was again  slapped

with a libel suit.  Again, the question that Members should  ask

is:  was  a libel suit necessary in these circumstances?   There

was  no  statement,  I repeat, made either by  me  in  the  1988

statement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>

in  the  elections  or Mr Tang Liang Hong accusing  anyone,  any

Minister,  of corruption or of committing criminal offences.   I

was  asking questions of public interest and Mr Tang Liang  Hong

was  seeking  to  deny  allegations made  against  him.   Is  it

justifiable  that he should then be the subject, as  I  was  the

subject,  of  libel suits, simply to frighten - I am  saying  in

this House - others who may aspire to come into Parliament?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then following that was the Prime Minister's suit against

me.  And, again, I do not have to remind Members - I am sure  it

must  be  fresh in their memories - that the words over which  I

was sued for libel were to give a statement of fact that Mr Tang

Liang  Hong  had made reports to the Police, as he had  said  he

would.  And his report to the Police, if you care to look it up,

was  simply  denying  the allegations, and  to  ask  for  Police

protection.   And I was slapped with suits.  Just as  he,  there

were  about  eight  or nine suits against him  (I  think  it  is

probably more), but I had eight suits against me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this how we are going to keep Opposition Members out of

Parliament?   The question we have to ask, and I keep  repeating

this:  should  we allow in this country these libel  actions  to

continue?   Or  should we say enough is enough now,  we  want  a

society  that is progressive, and we can only become progressive

if  Parliament  is allowed to play its role as a  check  on  the

Government.   And if that will not be possible,  we  will  never

become  a  progressive  society, we will never  become  an  open

society,  so long as these impediments are in place,  preventing

candidates  from speaking their mind openly and  freely  at  the

elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not advocating - let me make it very clear - a licence for

candidates  to  defame Ministers or others in  public  life,  to

accuse them falsely of anything.  But as I have tried to show in

these  three actions, there was nothing of that sort.   And  yet

the  actions  were  brought.   The Courts  have  held  that  the

meanings were that we were defaming them.  But, as I said, I  am

not  here to criticise the decision of the Courts.  But if  that

is  how it is going to be interpreted, then it is time we looked

the  law of defamation to see whether actions like these  should

be  allowed to be brought in the Courts in Singapore,  but  that

candidates  should have, as was intended by the framers  of  the

Constitution, the uninhibited basic right to give information to

the voters and to ask questions that are necessary and that will

help  to guide the voters in the choice of who they should  send

into Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, perhaps I will deal at length with the

laws  in the other countries in my reply, but I wish to say this

now,  so  that  whoever is replying can consider this.   Article

14(2)(a)  allows  Parliament to make  such  laws  as  Parliament

considers  it necessary to impose restrictions on the  right  of

freedom  granted  under Article 14(1).  The question  is,  would

these laws be necessary?  There is also the question of which is

the  greater  public  interest - the asking  of  questions,  the

attempt  to  deny  allegations made against you  or  is  it  the

supposed  protection  of  the reputation  of  public  officials?

Which is of greater public interest?  And I am sure, if you  ask

any Parliamentarian, he would say the greater public interest is

that questions should be asked and information given honestly to

voters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first decision which made an inroad to cut on this attempt

to  shut  members of the public from questioning or  criticising

the  conduct of public officials was way back in the 1940s  when

the US Supreme Court decided in the case of Sullivan and the New

York  Times  that  public officials cannot  maintain  an  action

against  any  criticism of them even if the facts  were  wrongly

stated,  unless  the public officials were  able  to  show  that

whoever made that criticism had actual knowledge that the  facts

were false and so were acting maliciously.  Knowing something to

be false and stating it.  That was a revolutionary change in the

law.   It stopped public officials from bringing actions because

of criticism of the officials concerned.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even at the beginning of this century, a minority view in a

Supreme  Court (I think it goes back to 1908), it  was  a  State

Supreme Court, held that the greater right was the right to  ask

questions and that libel actions should not be entertained where

a  citizen seeks to criticise, even wrongly on wrong facts,  the

conduct  of  public officials.  Sullivan's case was followed  by

the  European Court of Human Rights in the case of a  journalist

who  wrote  an  article  criticising  the  Austrian  Chancellor,

accusing   him  of  very  grave  offences,  of  harbouring   and

protecting  Nazis during the Nazi regime.  And he was  convicted

in  an  action brought for criminal defamation.  He took up  his

case  to the European Court of Human Rights. Fortunately, Europe

has  thought  fit  to have a court of human rights  which  would

entertain  petitions of this nature.  I shall read the provision

in   the  European  Charter,  which  I  say  corresponds  almost

identically  with  our  Article 14.  The  Court  held  that  the

conviction  was an unnecessary interference with the liberty  of

this journalist to write on a matter of public interest and they

set aside the conviction and ordered compensation to be paid  to

the  journalist for all the suffering he had suffered.  They had

no  doubt  of  what was the greater right in a truly  democratic

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was a case in England brought by a County Council

against  a newspaper which had criticised, not public officials,

I  must point out the difference, but the Council itself, and  I

shall read some of the passages in the judgement in my reply but

time does not permit me to read them now.  It was held that in a

truly democratic society, this freedom is important, the freedom

to  criticise and comment on public officials, and the action by

the  County Council was thrown out.  It went up to the House  of

Lords.  The County Council took it up to the House of Lords  who

dismissed  the  appeal, again, declaring what had  already  been

said  about  the vital importance and role in a truly democratic

society for citizens to comment on and criticise the conduct  of

public officials and to ask questions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have these developments in the law in other countries.

This  development of the law is also taking place  in  Australia

where  the High Court of Australia has ruled that it is  of  the

utmost  importance that the right of citizens to  criticise  and

comment on the conduct of public officials should not be  curbed

in any way unless it is absolutely necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three cases that I have illustrated, I hope, will

demonstrate  that  the actions were totally unnecessary  because

there  was no question of the Ministers being accused of  crimes

or  misconduct  in their lives.  These actions  arose  over  the

exercise of our rights as citizens to ask questions and, in  the

case  of Mr Tang Liang Hong, to deny accusations which were made

against  him.   Here  is  a  man who was  seeking  elections  to

Parliament along with me.  If he did not deny it, and if he  did

not  say  it  was not the truth, what would the electorate  say?

Those  who  had to make up their minds would say,  "I  see.   He

admits that he is a Chinese chauvinist.  He admits he is an anti-Christian.  So we better not vote him in."  So does he not  have

a  right  to deny that he is a Chinese chauvinist and  an  anti-Christian?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that he is a Chinese chauvinist, and I said

that  several times during the elections, neither is he an anti-Christian.  His daughter is a Christian.  And as we said, it  is

quite  inexplicable that if he is an anti-Christian,  he  should

decide to team up with me who is a Christian, and he knew  that.

And it is not only him who suffered, it was his wife of whom  we

have  seen  some  publicity the week before.  Her  passport  was

impounded illegally.  She was prevented from leaving Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on but probably I am nearing the time I am allowed to

speak.  But what we have to ask is, as Mr Lee was asking when he

was  in the Opposition, do we believe in democracy or do we not?

He  was asking that question.  He said that it was simple.  "You

answer that", he said.  Do we believe in democracy or do we not?

If we do believe in democracy, then there is no answer except to

say  that  we  should allow the practice of  democracy  in  this

country  which means the right in every citizen to ask honestly,

without any malice,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>

any questions of public officials in their conduct and discharge

of  public  functions.   If,  however,  we  do  not  believe  in

democracy  and we do not want a democratic society in Singapore,

we  do  not want a Parliamentary system of government which  can

only  function with an adequate number of Opposition Members  in

Parliament,  not  Nominated Members, but Opposition  Members  in

Parliament, then let us tell the world we do not want  democracy

in  this  country.  We do not want Parliamentary democracy.   We

are  quite  happy with our own autocracy.  So then  we  will  be

honest with ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the contrary, we hear protestations from Ministers that

we  are a democratic country, that we are an open society.   The

questions I asked in 1988, may I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, were in

reply  to  Mr Lee's statement then that the Singapore Government

was  an open Government accountable to the people.  And I  posed

several   questions  and  these  questions  were   among   those

questions:  were you open and accountable to the people in those

situations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for us who have the mandate under the Constitution to see

that  the  spirit of the Constitution is preserved and enforced.

We  take  the  oath when we come into this House  that  we  will

defend, preserve and protect the Constitution.  If we are to  be

true  to  that oath, then we have got to take steps to see  that

the  Constitution is not in any way hindered or impeded by  laws

or  administrative  action, but that  the  full  spirit  of  the

Constitution be given effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not suggesting what amendments

should  be  made.   A Nominated Member queried  why  we  need  a

Commission.  I thought it would be obvious.  I am not suggesting

what amendments should be made.  I am suggesting that we appoint

a Commission now to inquire into whether it is time for us, as a

society,  to  look at the way the defamation law is applied  and

whether  it should be continued to be applied as it  is  at  the

moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of the utmost importance, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that we

should take steps now.  We were debating the whole of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>

this  week  on  competitiveness and about going  into  the  21st

century.  If we are to go into the 21st century, we have got  to

go in as a progressive society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Your time is up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, in the earlier motion

that  Mr Jeyaretnam referred to, I was concerned about the rules

of  preventive  detention.  But I did not  support  that  motion

because I felt that there were smaller concerns that might limit

free speech in our society.  I turn then to this motion to think

whether our defamation laws are one of those concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking today, I must say that while some sectors of

Singaporeans  have  sympathy  for Mr  J.B.  Jeyaretnam  for  the

various suits that he has fought and lost, I would wish to  make

my  remarks less personal and avoid the cases he has referred to

which  have  already been decided by the courts and which  stand

today as the law in Singapore as decided by our highest courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me then turn to four questions. The first is the

importance of free speech.  The second is whether this important

free speech needs to be balanced in some way.  The third is what

is  that right balance.  And the fourth is how do we change  the

law.   Is a Commission, as proposed by the motion, the best  way

to go about it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question, the importance of free speech. I have

served  this  year, and I am still serving, as a member  of  the

Singapore 21 Committee.  In this context, I co-chair a committee

concerning the search for consensus and consultation on one hand

against  decisiveness and quick action on  the  other.   In  our

meetings  with  many  people,  we  have  emphasised  that,   for

consultation to happen in Singapore, there must be free  speech,

there must also be a sense of participation and there must be  a

recognition  of  our  national interests and  the  harmony  that

underpins our society.  Only when we accept on one hand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>

the  right  to  speak  and,  on the  other,  recognise  the  due

limitations  to  those who speak.  This helps make  consultation

work, and Singapore is a better place rather than a more fragile

place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the law of defamation concerns me because it is

not  about all forms of speech.  Defamation, as any law  student

will tell you, is about false statements.  If you are saying the

truth, you cannot be found guilty of defamation.  You must first

be  saying  something that is false.  There are  other  elements

such  as,  secondly,  that  false  statement  then  injures  the

reputation  of  the  person you refer to.   That  is  the  first

distinction  I want to make about the broader question  of  free

speech and the narrower question on defamation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we value free speech, should we value it so much that

we  want to protect false statements that harm reputation?  This

question  is an important one because it leads me to my  second,

the  question  of balance.  Having said that free speech  has  a

value and is recognised in the Constitution under Article 14, we

have  to recognise that there are concerns that the politicians,

or  those who would be politicians, would have their reputations

injured falsely, or ordinary citizens would.  This might lead to

the  lack  of  good  people to volunteer themselves  for  public

office  and  to have their reputation scrutinised  and  publicly

criticised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exception of question of defamation is also in the

Constitution.  So, if on one hand, the freedom of speech  is  in

the Constitution, so is the exception of defamation, and we have

to recognise that that is the substance of our Constitution.  We

cannot on one hand inflate the value of free speech, and pretend

the  exception does not exist in our Constitution.  But I  still

think  that  there  is  room  to  recognise  that  the  law   of

defamation, as it exists today, can have unintended consequences

that  it  can chill free speech.  It can prevent some  good  and

honest citizens from speaking up in case they make a false slip.

And  I  want  to  emphasise "in case" because we recognise  that

Singaporeans,  as a generic quality, are somewhat  "kiasu",  too

careful.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also have to think about the law of defamation

that  exists  and  the unintended consequences  because  of  two

things.  The first is the privilege that all of us in this House

enjoy  as Members.  In this House, we are free from civil suits,

including  suits for defamation.  Why do we enjoy this  freedom?

It is because this House should have the freest debate possible.

We  may  be brought up for parliamentary processes, but  we  are

free from civil action while we speak in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason I can think of to re-look at defamation

law  at  this point in time is the example set by our own  Prime

Minister,  Mr Goh Chok Tong.  In the recent suit with the  NCMP,

Mr Jeyaretnam, I, and I think, many Singaporeans, were heartened

by  PM  Goh's offer to forgo a certain amount of damages  if  Mr

Jeyaretnam was to publicly accept the judgment of the  Court  of

Appeal  and  to  apologise in certain terms  set  by  the  Prime

Minister's  lawyers.  This offer did not come to  pass  but  the

Prime  Minister's  offer  itself  makes  it  clear  that  he  is

cognizant of an unintended consequence that might otherwise have

come  to  pass.  That, in the legitimate interest of  protecting

his  reputation, he might unintentionally knock out a Member  of

Parliament, an NCMP, which he said was not his intention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn then to the next question. Having said that

there is a reason for balance, what is the right balance?  I  do

not  want to guess what Mr Jeyaretnam will bring up as examples.

Let me just quickly sketch two extreme positions and some places

in  between.  The two extreme positions, as I see them, is first

the  USA,  and second, ours.  I mean there are positions  beyond

ours,  but for the spectrum I wish to sketch, I will take  these

two ends.  In America, as regards politicians, you cannot defame

them,  even  if  you  are completely and utterly  false  without

basis,  only if you can prove actual malice, that is, out  of  a

vendetta, a hate, a personal vindictiveness, you have said  what

you know to be false, and obviously, this is very hard to prove.

So, the American political figures live with all sorts of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>

slander.  In Singapore, at this end of the spectrum, there is no

difference between politicians and private individuals.  Whether

you  are  running  for office or whether you choose  to  lead  a

quiet, private life, the rule is the same for you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to see therefore when we think about law reform,

that  there  can be places in between these two positions.   But

even  if we choose to reform, we need not open up the box to  be

exactly like America.  That may be fine for Americans but it may

not suit our temper and tenor of our society.  This position  in

between can try to make a distinction where a false statement is

made recklessly, or a false statement is made negligently, or  a

false  statement  is made out of some sincere belief  or  honest

mistake.   Let  me quickly sketch the differences between  these

three intermediate positions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recklessly" might mean I heard some rumour about Mr X and I

just  simply blurt it out publicly.  I make no attempt  to  find

out  whether it is true.  Second, negligently, I heard the  same

rumour.   Perhaps  I  am  a more careful  man,  I  call  up  the

newspaper  or somebody who is supposed to be the authority,  his

boss,  his  subordinate, and I check.  But  somehow,  that  same

mistake  is  duplicated.  It is not cured.  I make my  statement

and  fail  to check properly; I make some checks, but I  do  not

check  properly, and I am negligent.  The third: sincere  belief

or honest mistake is when I have been thorough in my checking, I

have  already tried exhaustively to check out whether what I  am

saying is true or not true, and yet it is still possible to make

a mistake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, we are talking here about false statements in

defamation that lower someone's reputation in the public eye.  I

myself will stand for the idea that if there is malice, or if it

is  reckless or negligent, the value of free speech  should  not

cover such sins.  We should not excuse such forms of defamation.

That  leaves me only with the concern about honest mistakes  and

sincerely held beliefs.  The law of defamation, as it stands  in

Singapore,  recognises various defences, one  of  which  is  the

defence of fair comment.  This has to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>

be  a question of opinion, of course, rather than a statement of

fact.   It is of course possible to add other defences, such  as

honest  mistake  and  it is possible to  twin  this  with  other

questions  and limits, such as to limit this extent  of  greater

freedom  to times of political competition in elections,  or  to

limit  to politicians or those who run for public office because

they  put themselves up for public choice and the public  should

have  a  right to know.  We could also cap damages to a sizeable

amount,  an  amount  that  has  bite,  but  one  that  will  not

necessarily  ruin  a  person for a  single  mistake.   We  could

institute a formal role to the question of apology.  Many of you

know  that  when an apology is given honestly and sincerely  and

accepted, this defamatory mistake can be forgiven.  However,  as

it  stands, this is a matter of negotiation between the  wronged

party  and  the person who has wronged them.  It is possible  to

make this matter of public process in the courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many possibilities of which I have quickly

sketched my own inclinations.  But the motion today is not about

any  particular  choice  and I do not want  to  over-argue  this

point.   I  just  want to demonstrate that if  a  Commission  is

called for, there is room to work on the law, to refine the law,

finding a new balance without abandoning certain cornerstones of

our  belief, such as democracy, and on the other hand, the  need

to defend reputations which are falsely accused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point then is the question of institutions.

Courts  themselves  have  regulated  defamation.   There  is   a

Defamation  Act  of  course passed by  this  Parliament  or  its

predecessors, but that Act does not really provide the  body  of

defamation  law.  It provides rather some narrow  exceptions  to

it.   The  body  of defamation law is carried over by  Singapore

from   other  precedents  in  England  particularly,  and   more

recently, our own precedent, as one case builds on another.  The

courts  themselves, I believe, are always the  first  person  to

turn to, to change their own mistakes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House, I have previously spoken and cautioned against

over-anxiety of legislation to cure one or two judgments, and  I

have  not  shifted my position.  That is still my view that  the

courts  themselves  should be the primary focus  when  we  think

about  an evolutionary change in law.  How else can the  law  be

changed?   Normally,  when  there is  a  call  for  reform,  the

Government  will take it up and the Attorney-General's  Chambers

will  do  the work, call in together the various ministries  and

other agencies that are concerned or involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion standing in the NCMP's name is different from

this.  It calls for a Commission of Inquiry.  I am not sure this

is  at all the right institution. It is certainly different from

what has been done before and I think it is quite different from

the  nature  of  most Commissions of Inquiry  to  investigate  a

certain,  fixed  and quite narrow question.  But  when  I  think

through  the  motion  and  whether I should  support  it,  I  am

reminded  that  in  one of the sittings in  this  House  that  I

attended, the NCMP said in a rather sarcastic tone that  he  was

not  at  all  surprised  that  one of  the  NMPs  supported  the

Government.  I then shared my view of the function of NMPs  with

him  and  the  House.   NMPs, to my mind, are  neither  for  the

Government nor against it, neither are we for the opposition nor

against them.  I try to look at the law and policies in  a  non-partisan  light to give what inputs we can, and I have tried  to

do this today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Mr Jeyaretnam's personal remarks and the cases that he

has  brought  up  concerning himself or  his  fellow  opposition

candidates, I do believe, for the reasons I have given, the  law

could  stand  the  question of reform.  When  we  look  at  this

question  of reform, we may not in the end decide we do  need  a

reform.   If we do decide on a reform, we do not need to  decide

that it is American or some other western form.  We can find our

own way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this hope and with this reservation also about the

institution, about some of the arguments that the NCMP has  made

for  the  law and for the value of freedom of speech, I  support

the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>

<br>7.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would

personally agree with the call to review the Defamation Act  but

certainly not the formation of a commission.  I do not  wish  to

comment  on  the  personal experiences of Mr  J.  B.  Jeyaretnam

except  to say that the law must apply if defamation is  proven.

But  it  is another completely different matter and outside  the

present  law  if the Prime Minister offers him avenues  to  help

lessen the burden and consequences brought about by the decision

of  the  court.  Personally, I am encouraged by PM's gesture  of

tolerance and forgiveness.  But I would like to ask the Minister

to  consider  the  wider  implication  of  the  Defamation  Act.

Article  14 of the Constitution clearly guarantees every citizen

the  right  to  freedom  of  speech and  expression.   But  this

certainly  does  not  mean the right to defame.   We  can  speak

freely, but certainly no one can defame freely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that I would like to highlight is that the

Defamation  Act  is  not  necessarily for  politicians  only  or

political parties.  It is available for any citizen, corporation

or  organisation.  The law of defamation essentially attempts to

strike a balance between the public's freedom of speech and  the

individual's right to the protection of his good name, and  that

certainly  must  be  a  very sensitive and important  matter  of

somebody  who  holds  a  high public  position  like  the  Prime

Minister.  Unfortunately, in Singapore, people tend to associate

defamation laws with political figures and politics, because  of

the  series  of legal suits involving politicians and  the  high

profile  publicity given to such suits.  My concern is  that  it

has  brought  about, like what my colleague, Mr  Simon  Tay  has

mentioned,   the  unintended  consequences  and  some   negative

implications on civil society.  Because of that, some people are

reluctant  to  speak  up  and comment  on  controversial  public

policies  or on public office holders because of the  fear  that

they may be subjected to legal suits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, most people have no problem giving their views to

local newspapers because they feel that the local

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>

press  will  exercise  care and caution  not  to  defame  public

officials.   But this is not in the case of foreign publications

or  journalists  because  of  their  past  experience  of  being

involved  in  defamation  suits themselves.   Quite  frequently,

foreign  journalists  have  problems getting  enough  people  in

Singapore  willing  to express their views.    "No  comment"  or

"Don't  quote  me"  are  common  responses.   As  such,  we  may

unnecessarily be sending a wrong signal to Singaporeans who  are

afraid to speak up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to be fair, Sir, a lot depends on the person himself to

exercise  caution  when commenting on personalities  and  public

policies.  While it is quite easy to determine whether a  person

making  defamatory statements has been malicious or reckless  by

exposing the person to hatred, contempt or ridicule which, in my

view, is what the Act is intended for, it is quite difficult  to

determine  intent  and impact of other less damaging  statements

which may arise out of mistakes or negligence or, at the spur of

the  moment, reliance on wrong source of information.  I do  not

necessarily condone this.  But perhaps in view of that,  it  may

be  useful to consider amending the present legislation to  give

more  weightage to apology in mitigation factors or in assessing

damages.   Perhaps  one  suggestion is to consider  limiting  or

specifying the quantum awarded in a different type of defamation

cases,  especially  parties who have relied on  the  process  of

mediation   or  in  settlement  are  prepared  to  make   public

apologies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, political leaders who have been defamed,

quite  rightly  have  taken  strong  actions  to  protect  their

reputation.  Although monetary compensations were given,  as  in

most  cases  quite  large sums, these do  not  seem  to  be  the

objective of those seeking remedies, as charities have been  the

main   beneficiaries  of  such  monetary  awards.   Again,   the

intention  here is not to bankrupt anybody but to  redeem  one's

reputation.   However, the consequence is  that,  as  it  stands

today,  because of the monetary compensation given, some  people

stay away from political controversies of criticising on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>

public  policies or politicians because of the fear that it  may

lead  to financial ruin.  What in fact happens is those who have

been found guility, and I said guilty, are certainly liable  for

defamation.   In  this case, they may find themselves  paying  a

heavy price or penalty for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to elections where some of these issues have

cropped  up, especially during elections, and it can be expected

that  during the heat of elections, statements that can be  made

may  be  construed as defamatory, not in its intent, but in  its

environment  and  the situation that is found.   Based  on  past

cases,  one has to be extremely careful and one should in making

speeches  during election rallies.  While care  must  always  be

exercised,  the  law should not cause unnecessary  restrictions,

especially  during  elections.  One  suggestion  is  perhaps  to

exercise  more  tolerance before resorting to legal  suits.   Of

course,  this  works both ways for all parties  taking  part  in

election rallies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another, Sir, is to provide for limited privileges during

elections,   especially   to  cover   cases   of   unintentional

defamation.   Of course, one can argue that this suggestion  may

mean  giving  political  parties  or  individuals  a  leeway  to

criticise  and  defame  others and  later  get  away  by  merely

apologising.   But  I would say today, Sir,  that  it  would  be

foolish for any politician seeking office to think that  he  can

get  elected  if  he  has  the habit  of  frequently  having  to

apologise  to his political opponents.  At the end of  the  day,

Sir, defamation, especially the one Mr Jeyaretnam mentioned,  is

a  very  personal  matter.   I  think  the  Prime  Minister  has

demonstrated  that  avenues have been made available,  which  is

relevant  to this case.  At the end of the day, the two  parties

must explore those personal avenues available to settle what  is

essentially  a  personal matter.  But I hope the Minister  would

consider  the suggestions that I have referred to in  the  wider

context.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr

Jeyaretnam's motion to call on the Government to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>

appoint  a  commission  to examine and  recommend  what  changes

should  be  made  to the law of defamation is  misconceived  and

should not be supported by this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the benefit of Members of this House who may not

be  familiar with the subject, the general starting point  of  a

defamation  law  begins  with a published  defamatory  statement

which  refers  to the person concerned.  I underline  the  words

"persons  concerned" because this will be relevant  subsequently

when  I respond to Mr Simon Tay's point.  A defamatory statement

is  one which is calculated to injure a person's reputation  and

to diminish the willingness of the others to associate with him.

Where  it  is  alleged that a defamatory remark  has  been  made

against  a  person, the person who is alleged to have  made  the

defamatory  remarks  would not be liable  for  those  defamatory

remarks  if  he  is able to establish certain defences  such  as

justification, absolute privilege, qualified privilege  or  fair

comment.  For instance, if I called somebody a cheat and a liar,

I would, on the face of the statement, be liable for defamation.

However,  if  I  am able to, among other things, show  that  the

person  whom  I had called such was indeed a cheat and  a  liar,

then  I  would  not  be  liable  as  I  had  spoken  the  truth.

Alternatively,  if  it  was found as a fact  that  a  particular

person indeed told a lie, it would not be defamatory for one  to

pass an opinion that it was wrong to lie, since this comment was

based on a proven fact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had broadly stated the underlying principles of

defamation  only  to  show that contrary to what  Mr  Jeyaretnam

seems to suggest, there is generally a right to proffer what  is

on  the  surface, defamatory comments on the conduct  of  public

officials or anybody whatsoever, provided that the author of the

statements  is  able  to raise the defences  which  I  mentioned

earlier.   If  I  may add, defamatory statements  are  not  just

statements  alone  but  also include innuendoes  or  suggestions

indicating the conduct or otherwise of the person concerned.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam had numerous encounters with defamation laws.

Unfortunately, not all of his encounters have met with successes

in  his  favour.  Perhaps that is the reason, and we have  heard

this  to  be  so,  why  he is asking this  House  to  appoint  a

Commission to reform the laws of defamation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must recognise that in every democratic society, there

must  be  a  constitutional right of free  speech.   We  are  no

exception.   Our  Constitution provides the assurance  that  all

Singaporeans  have that right.  However, we must also  recognise

that  there  is equally the right of individuals to protect  his

honour,  reputation and dignity.  The right of free speech  must

be subject to some form of legal control.  An English jurist put

it well when he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Firstly, any person is entitled prima facie to his good

name,  and  imputations are not to be made without justification

which  are detrimental to his reputation.  Secondly, any  person

should  be  entitled in a free democratic community  to  publish

fearlessly  statements  of  fact  and  expressions  of  opinions

however forthright or unpopular and even though they may reflect

on or displease particular individuals or groups."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the freedom of expression without fear or favour

serves  as an important underpinning in our democracy.   Without

the freedom to speak up, our people will not have the ability to

determine  their  own future in this country.   To  be  able  to

criticise  and  comment is the spur by which our  Government  is

kept  perpetually on its toes.  In any democracy, if the  people

do not have the right to speak nor the courage to get themselves

involved  or  heard,  there  will  not  be  any  check  on   the

Government.  In the end, they only have themselves to  blame  if

the Government abuses its powers at the expense of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while we recognise the constitutional right of

free  speech, it is another thing altogether to give people  the

carte  blanche  licence  to go into scurrilous  attacks  on  the

integrity  and reputation of any individual member  of  society.

The  cases which Mr Jeyaretnam referred to in his earlier speech

did  not provide the complete picture because while he tried  to

paint the picture that he merely made those remarks innocently,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>

as  a  lawyer, he should know that taken in toto, those  remarks

represent certain innuendoes which, if not pursued in a court of

law,  will  result  in the undermining of the character  of  the

person  concerned.   Certainly,  an  innocent  remark  which  he

presented  earlier, as asking questions about the conduct  of  a

particular Minister, can be seen as disparaging the good name of

the  Prime Minister, as it was indeed so, as found by the  court

in the decision which he referred to; and that is the Teh Cheang

Wan's case.  What Mr Jeyaretnam is asking for is not freedom  of

speech.    That   is  an  inalienable  constitution   right   of

Singaporeans.  What Mr Jeyaretnam wants, although  he  has  said

that this is not the case that he wanted, is a licence to defame

people  without  being called to account for the  basis  of  his

allegations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam knows that it is no defamation for anyone to

comment  and  even to criticise stridently, any  policy  of  the

Government.   Outside this House, people are free  to  criticise

Government  policies and Acts.  At the last  general  elections,

many of the Opposition Members had been volubly vocal about many

of  our  Government policies.  Are these criticisms made out  of

fear?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we must realise is that at the end of the day a

distinction  must be made between the criticism of a  particular

policy for which the fight for the vote of the people must stand

on as opposed to an attack on the integrity and the good name of

the person concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we must realise is that in a country as important

as  ours,  human  resource is our only asset.   Making  it  more

difficult  for  public officials to sue in defamation  may  well

discourage  many from joining the public sector.  The Government

would  end  up being poorer for it. It may not be the  case  for

some,  but  for  many,  honour,  reputation  and  integrity  are

qualities that many work hard at building and preserving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case which Mr Jeyaretnam cited, and that is the New York

Times'  case, has been considered in a Canadian court, Court  of

Appeal which decided not to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>

endorse it.  In Derickson v Tomat [1992] 88 DLR 401, the British

Columbian  Court of Appeal in that case took the opportunity  to

consider  whether or not the New York Times' case  ought  to  be

adopted in Canada.  The judge said that this particular decision

has no application in Canada, and I will read the dicta from the

decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rule that the New York Times case leaves vulnerable the

reputation  of  all  who are, or would be,  in  public  life  by

depriving  such  people  of any legal recourse  from  defamatory

falsehoods  directed against them, except in  those  rare  cases

where  actual  malice can be established.   Such  a  rule  would

likely  discourage  honest and decent people from  standing  for

public office."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the rule destroys rather than preserves the delicate

balance   between  freedom  of  expression  and  protection   of

reputation  which, as I already noted, is vital to the  survival

of a democratic process of government.  For that reason, I would

oppose  introducing such a rule in this country.  So  there  you

are, Mr Jeyaretnam, it is not by uniform consensus that the rule

in  the  New York Times case is universally applicable  even  by

western standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of our public servants, they are not likely to

allow  anyone  to fritter away their good name through  spurious

allegations  which cannot be substantiated.  If we  allow  that,

there  will  be  many, I am sure, who will have second  thoughts

about  being  a part of the public service.  And I am  sure  you

agree that this is not in our interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if the pubic servant concerned was engaged in some

illegal or improper acts, Mr Jeyaretnam is at liberty to  report

the  matter to the proper authorities.  Let them deal  with  it.

Indeed,  it if were true, there is nothing to stop Mr Jeyaretnam

from  stating  the  substance of his concern  publicly.   If  an

officer,  for  example, were engaged in an act of corruption  by

accepting some form of gratification, it would be a defence to a

claim in defamation if one can justify the statement.  What  the

law  cannot accept, however, is the allegation of improper  acts

through indefensible statements or innuendoes which diminish the

standing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>

of  the  person  in  the eyes of his peers.  This  is  the  real

intention  of  Mr  Jeyaretnam's  call  for  the  reformation  of

defamation laws in this country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam is aware that our laws apply equally to all. If I

choose  to defame Mr Jeyaretnam publicly outside this House,  he

can  sue me in a court of law.  Whether or not he chooses to sue

me  is a separate matter.  That is the essence of our democracy.

The  rule  of  law  applies to all.  It does not  matter  if  Mr

Jeyaretnam was making the defamatory remarks against me, or if I

was  making  a  defamatory  remark  against  him.   The  law  is

respecter of no class or rank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we recognise that with widespread literacy and universal

suffrage,  Singaporeans have the opportunity to  participate  in

the political and community affairs of our country.  With better

education,  Singaporeans  are better able  to  articulate  their

views  more  effectively.  We have seen  that  over  the  years,

Singaporeans  are  more  actively  involved  in  the   political

processes than before.  They would want more information  rather

than less of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise this and we encourage the flow of free and frank

discussions.  This is necessary for the maintenance of democracy

in  this  country.  However, and I say it again, it  is  another

thing altogether to say that that right extends to defaming  the

character  of another fellow human being and to destroy  his  or

her reputation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam's motion in part relates to some recent matters

which  involved several international NGOs.  I am  referring  in

particular  to  defamation  suits against  Mr  Jeyaretnam  which

attracted much media and international attention.  Sir, at  this

moment, I would like to touch on the comments of several parties

who have spoken publicly on this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the issue of reformation of defamation laws is the

question,  as  alleged  by  some  critics,  of  whether  we  use

defamation  laws  here to stifle and oppress opposition  voices.

Both  the  ICJ  and  the  Amnesty  International  observed   the

defamation trials involving Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amnesty International in their report expressed the concern that

the   decision   to   launch  defamation  was  unnecessary   and

unreasonable.   They  feel  that  the  combined  action  of  the

leadership and the decision of the court placed restrictions  on

freedom  of expression that cannot be justified by international

standards.   Amnesty International went on to  pontificate  that

civil defamation has been misused by the Executive to intimidate

and  deter  those  with  dissenting views.   The  suits  have  a

chilling effect on the political life and place unreasonable and

unacceptable restrictions on the right of Singaporeans to freely

hold and express their views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Commission of Jurists, on the other hand,

through  their self righteous representative Stuart  Littlemore,

blatantly stated that the courts have assisted the plaintiffs in

this case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two comments to make on these. First, we must

recognise  that  as a matter of first principle,  every  country

with  its  duly  elected government has the sovereign  right  to

determine  its own destiny.  I have stated, at the  onset,  that

the  freedom of expression and speech must be balanced in  every

democracy  against the right of any individual  to  protect  his

reputation  and  standing in the eyes of the  community.   Where

that  balance lies is to be decided by the people of the country

concerned.   It is not for any one, Stuart Littlemore  included,

who has no stake in his country, and who had himself sued others

for  defamation, to pass judgment and to say where that  balance

should be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in Singapore, we have leaders who have worked hard at

transforming this country into an economic miracle.  The success

of  this country rides not only on the back of the labour of our

people  but is also founded on the integrity and honesty of  the

leadership.   Their integrity has helped to build up  the  trust

that  the people have in the leadership of this country.  It  is

this  inherent trust that our people have in our Government that

has  led to the quiet confidence that this Government will  lead

the country through its present difficult time.  The leaders did

not forge this trust overnight or through subterfuge.  It is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>

through  years of hard work, and the success of our  leaders  at

every general election is an affirmation of that trust.  We  are

not  going  to allow anyone to fritter away the trust  that  our

people  have  in  the  leadership by  allowing  anyone  to  cast

aspersions on the character of our leaders which is indefensible

in law; and certainly not allow anyone who, after they have lost

their  case in a court of law, should now come to this House  to

ask  for  the rules to be changed so that he has the licence  to

defame others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles of defamation may be similar in most common law

countries,  but the standards of defamation are  and  should  be

different.   The  Guardian,  in its editorial,  has  called  our

leaders thin-skinned.  If that is the allegation, so be it.   We

have seen the buffoonery of the English press in the handling of

their own leaders under the guise of freedom of expression.   If

that is the standard they want us to go down to, Sir, we are not

interested.  Let us decide what those standards are and  let  us

be our own judge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the reports that have emerged suggest that we have no

avenue for constructive criticism at all.  Is this true?  Are we

deterred  as a people from speaking up publicly?  Mr  Simon  Tay

said  earlier,  people are discouraged from speaking  simply  in

case there is a chance that they may be sued for defamation.   I

did  say  earlier  that  a  distinction  must  be  made  between

defamation which goes towards the integrity and the good name of

a  person  as  opposed to a fair criticism and  comment  of  the

policies of a country.  I think, in any election, there must  be

a  contest  of ideas.  In the last elections, we have seen  that

the people have had no restraint in publicly criticising, rather

stridently at times, some of our Government policies.   But  let

there be no mistake about it, that here it is the good name  and

the  reputation of the people concerned that we  are  trying  to

protect.  And it is a matter of policy, we have decided,  or  at

least  I feel we have decided, that if we allow people to launch

into  scurrilous  attacks against the good name  of  the  people

concerned,   then   the   people  may  feel   discouraged   from

participating in the political process.  But then, of course,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>

Mr  Zulikifli  has  also said that people who  are  involved  in

elections should be prepared to have their feet muddied  in  the

process.   But then I ask Mr Zulkifli, the hon. NMP, why  should

politicians be any different?  Are they not human?  Are they not

entitled to have the right to defend their good name in a  court

of law?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, let us ask ourselves: Is there a forum

for  our people to express deep unhappiness over policies?   Are

there  people in prison today because they spoke out their minds

and  spoke from conscience?  No.  The answer is a resounding no.

Sir,  over  the  years, we have put in place  institutions  that

encourage  people  to  participate  in  policy  formulation  and

implementation.   Mr Simon Tay, for example, is  involved  in  a

forum  that looks at deciding policies that will carry Singapore

to  the  next  millennium.   If it  was  our  intention  to  gag

opposing, or even remotely, dissenting voices, he would have  no

place  in  this Committee today.  And that is why  we  have  the

Feedback  Unit,  the  Forum  page  of  the  Straits  Times,  the

Internet, and, as I said earlier, more recently the Singapore 21

Committee  where the people involved have actually gone  out  of

their   way  to  solicit  views  as  to  the  kind  of   society

Singaporeans  want  in  the  next  millennium.   In  all   these

discussions,  one would say that there were no attempts  to  put

any  unreasonable restrictions other than those which go  beyond

the  bounds  of human decency, in matters which they  have  been

allowed  to raise.  Did we go after them because of such adverse

remarks?   Was there ever any indication of oppression  or  fear

which  prevented them from speaking out?  No.  If there was  any

effort on the Government's part to gag these voices or to instil

in  them  a fear to speak out against what is perceived  as  bad

Government  policies, we would not have seen  or  heard  any  of

these strident criticisms that we see or hear of these days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should realise that nowhere in the world would you find a

Government  that has taken the trouble of constitutional  reform

to  ensure  that there is adequate representation in  Parliament

for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>

minority  voices.  It is for this reason that we  have  in  this

House  today  Nominated MPs and the NCMP.  These representatives

have no obligation to anyone and are encouraged to speak without

fear or favour.  Mr Jeyaretnam, a loser in the last election, is

here today by the grace of the same Government he now claims  is

suppressing  this  right  of free  and  fair  speech.   Has  the

Government  tried to stop him from speaking in Parliament?   No.

On  the contrary, we have been patiently listening to him  going

on  and  on  in this House almost ad nauseam on the same  themes

like  an  old record.  If we had a strict democracy,  where  the

right of admission into this august House is through the vote of

the  people, then these people, like Mr Jeyaretnam, will not  be

here  today, and we all agree that Singapore will be poorer  for

it.  So, Mr Jeyaretnam, how are we, with all that we have sought

to  do in these past years, any less democratic?  How can we  be

said  to  be  oppressive  and  stifling  free  expressions   and

discussions?   Mr Jeyaretnam, unfortunately, has his  pet  peeve

and  would waste no time in bringing it into this House  without

considering whether it stands to reason.  Today's motion is  yet

again another example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, I do not support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me say, before going

into  the  motion proper, but I would not take  as  long  as  Mr

Jeyaretnam did, when he introduced this motion with a  20-minute

speech which sounded like a history lecture, that this House  is

doing   well.   Mr  Jeyaretnam  asked  whether  this  House   is

effective.  He has criticised this House as not doing its job of

checking the Executive.  But, of course, from his standpoint, Mr

Jeyaretnam would like a gridlock, as happened in some countries,

where  the Legislative arm and the Executive arm cannot see  eye

to eye, and government cannot function.  But, Sir, in Singapore,

we  do  things  differently.  Yes, Parliament has  a  role,  and

Parliament  plays its role effectively.  This, in  fact,  was  a

subject matter of a motion which Mr Jeyaretnam himself had moved

in this House six months ago.  So we have already dealt

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>

with that effectively.  It is not only me who says this, because

here  again  if you look at independent polls, I  think  it  was

1996,  the PERC polls talked about the state of the legislatures

in  the  Asian region.  The PERC polls put Singapore at  a  very

high   placing,  saying  that  despite  the  absence  of  strong

Opposition in the House, there was rigorous and vigorous debate.

So there you have it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing about Mr Jeyaretnam is that he keeps returning

to  old  themes.   He  laments why there are so  few  Opposition

Members in Parliament.  He has given other reasons in the  past.

He has a new one this time.  He says that Opposition politicians

are defeated in the polls because of the law of defamation.   Mr

Jeyaretnam, what else will you come out with next?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first say that the motion is misconceived. It must

be  rejected because its basic premises are false and untenable.

These  are,  firstly,  that the law of defamation  denies  every

citizen  the  right to comment on and criticise the  conduct  of

public  officials  and  the discharge of  public  functions  and

duties.  And secondly, without changes to the law of defamation,

citizens cannot exercise their right without fear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sin has just said that this is far from the truth.

Because,  as  Mr  Sin has said, and indeed  this  is  the  case,

Singaporeans are not afraid to criticise Government policies  or

indeed  officials, if justified.  I think in the last debate  in

this House, again on Mr Jeyaretnam's motion, Mr Zulkifli and  Mr

Simon  Tay had alluded to this, that as a civil society, we  are

opening  up and more people are speaking up.  And for those  who

are not speaking up, it is not so much for fear of being put  in

prison or Government reprisal, but I think Mr Zulkifli also said

it  is  partly due to a cultural basis.  People may not want  to

speak up in public to avoid the embarrassment of being put  down

or having to rebut and to debate publicly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certainly, it is not the fear of defamation that puts

people  off  from speaking up.  In any case, even if  there  are

some, like Mr Zulkifli has mentioned, who may

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>

have  this fear, I hope that, after today's debate, knowing what

the ambit of the law of defamation is and how Government leaders

have in the past used it, the few instances when PAP leaders had

used  defamation  in what context and what  were  the  words  in

question, I think such fears can be put to rest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Mr Jeyaretnam's motivation for moving this debate?

I think he shows it quite clearly.  He has talked about cases he

had  been involved in, two of which he was involved in, and  the

other one involving Mr Tang Liang Hong, a Party member.  Like Mr

Sin  has  mentioned, and the other two Nominated MPs  have  also

said,  these are cases which have been dealt with fully  by  the

courts,  up to the Court of Appeal, which have examined them  in

the context of the law and in the context of accepted standards,

tests  and  principles,  whether  the  words  in  question  were

defamatory  or  not.  Of course, Mr Jeyaretnam, in  this  House,

tries  to  tell us that they were all innocent statements,  they

were  innocent denials.  Again, without going into the  details,

surely the courts examined these words very carefully, not  only

in the context of what was the natural and ordinary meaning, but

also  what was the innuendo meaning in the context in which  the

words  were uttered, and after a full consideration in the cases

that  Mr  Jeyaretnam  had mentioned, the courts  had  held  that

indeed defamation was made out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talks about democratic society and freedom of

speech.   He makes a big pitch about it.  Let me first say  that

there  is  no  democratic society in the world, let  alone  true

democracy,  words in the motion, whatever true democracy  means,

where  the right to exercise free speech includes the  right  to

defame individuals, including public officials, not here, not in

the  US, not anywhere.  As Mr Tay has pointed out, every society

has  to  strike  a  balance.  What is this balance  between  the

individual's right of free speech and the interest  of  society?

Our defamation laws are well established.  They have worked well

and  I  would  say  that there is no need for  a  Commission  of

Inquiry to look into changes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talks about democratic freedom. Sir, it is

not  a  democratic freedom to defame and attack another person's

reputation  with  falsehoods  to impugn  his  integrity  without

basis.    Our   defamation   laws   give   everyone,   including

politicians, and that is what it should be, the right to protect

one's  reputation  and honour.  It is one  thing  to  engage  in

robust  political debate and criticise the Government as leaders

or  policies  in  the  process.  In  fact,  Opposition  leaders,

Members  like Mr Low Thia Khiang, Mr Chiam See Tong and  others,

have  done  for many years.  They have not been sued  for  these

criticisms.   But  it is another thing to defame.   And  indeed,

everyone,   including   politicians,   must   take   the   legal

consequences of their words.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only Government leaders who sue in defamation. I

am  sure Mr Chiam knows this very well.  He has also invoked the

law  of  defamation.  When justified, he has sued.  He  has  won

cases,  not just against other Opposition politicians  but  also

against  PAP leaders.  Indeed, Mr Jeyaretnam himself has invoked

the  law  of defamation when he sued the Prime Minister who  was

then  DPM  in 1989.  That case went up to the Privy Council  and

was dismissed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Whatever it is, the highest

court at that time dismissed Mr Jeyaretnam's case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also talks about our Constitution. In

Singapore, yes, there is freedom of speech in Article 14 of  the

Constitution.  Yet, at the same time, and Mr Tay has alluded  to

that, it must be balanced because the word "defamation" is  also

mentioned   expressly  in  our  Constitution.   Therefore,   the

requirement  of  balance is in fact expressly  set  out  in  the

Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Tay supports Mr Jeyaretnam's call for a Commission

of  Inquiry.   A  Commission of Inquiry is normally  set  up  to

inquire into alleged wrongdoing.  It is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>

not  the proper forum for the examination of an area of the law.

Of  course,  with Mr Jeyaretnam back in the House, I  think  one

other  theme that is recurrent has been his constant  calls  for

the   formation  of  Commissions  of  Inquiry,  committees   and

whatnots.   Perhaps he sees himself playing a starring  role  in

these  committees.   He wants a higher profile  for  himself  in

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I have said just now, the law is working well. Indeed, the

law  is  evolving because our courts are still  looking  at  how

defamation laws can be applied in various contexts.   So I would

say, let the courts do the job.  I think this is an approach  Mr

Tay  himself has previously argued for.  So our position is that

unless  there  is  a  need for Parliamentary  intervention,  the

courts should do their job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should take this opportunity to explain why PAP leaders sue

for  defamation.  We have explained this many times before, both

here  and  outside.   Defamation  is  taken  very  seriously  in

Singapore,  not  just  by  the Government,  but  indeed  by  all

Singaporeans,  more  so  when  the integrity  of  its  political

leaders  and  key institutions is questioned.   In  a  Singapore

lacking  in  natural resources where the cutting edge  that  has

made a difference is human resource, it is critical that at  the

apex   where   the   national  political  leadership   and   key

institutions  sit,  there is no doubt  that  there  is  absolute

honesty  and  integrity.  Wild allegations must be deterred  and

debunked  in  accordance  with the  law.   Why?   Otherwise  the

ability  to  govern  will  be  undermined.   This  indeed  is  a

democratic  and  conclusive  way to  settle  disputes  and  thus

maintain high standards of truth in politics.  The other way, as

is  the  case  in some countries, is to exchange defamation  for

defamation  in the media with the public never the wiser  as  to

who is lying.  Singapore leaders therefore sue in defamation  to

clear their names and protect these key institutions through due

process  of  the  law,  not  to stifle,  intimidate,  harass  or

bankrupt  the  Opposition.  Therefore,  these  actions  are  not

politically motivated.  Ultimately, Singapore will benefit.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of course is that politicians who do not

clear  their name in court, when defamed, will lose the  respect

of the electorate.  They will ask what is he fearful about.  Why

is  he  not suing?  A key ingredient of good Government is  that

political  leaders have the trust and respect of the electorate.

PAP  leaders  working with important institutions, such  as  the

civil service, have through many years of hard, honest work  won

this  trust and respect.  Public interest demands that such good

repute  be accorded the protection that it deserves, because  we

cannot   risk   what  has  happened  in  some  countries   where

politicians are regarded very lowly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must not forget that when anyone, more so a national leader,

sues  in  defamation, he is putting his own  reputation  on  the

line.   As such, PAP leaders sue in their personal capacity.   I

think  all  of us know a key defence to a defamation  action  is

justification.  In other words, it is open to the  defendant  to

prove  that  what he says is true.  A politician who  sues  thus

opens  himself and his actions to public scrutiny  and  rigorous

cross-examination in court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, with all these constraints, why then do politicians sue?

The  main  point is to establish the truth.  A politician  knows

that  scurrilous accusations left unchallenged would poison  the

public's  mind.   For  example,  past  allegations  against  PAP

leaders  which have prompted them to sue for defamation  include

imputations  or  implications  of nepotism,  corruption,  lying,

abuse  of power, all of which are very serious allegations,  and

of  course implication in the death of a Minister and other such

implications.  In a Singapore founded on good honest Government,

we  cannot  allow  such  poison to fester and  go  unchallenged.

Besides  risking exposure, if the allegations are proven  to  be

true, a losing plaintiff has also to pay costs.  Therefore,  the

point  is no PAP leader will sue for defamation unadvisedly  and

without just cause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should there be a higher threshold when remarks are uttered in

the heat of the hustings?  This is Mr Zulkifli's point.  Indeed,

this is the situation on which the three cases are founded.  But

the question

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>

really  is:  why  should it be so?  Elections and electioneering

should  never  be  justification for defaming and  maligning  an

opposing  candidate  whether with  words  which  are  plain  and

ordinary  in  the  meaning or, more often than not,  words  with

innuendo   meaning.   Why  should  the  law  give   licence   to

politicians,   whether  Opposition  or   Government,   to   make

defamatory statements?  If any politician thinks it  is  in  the

public interest to expose any character flaw or wrongdoing of an

opposing candidate, he can and indeed should do so.  But, at the

same time, he must be prepared to justify these allegations, and

that is the way it should be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are rules of conduct in election campaigning. Otherwise,

we can imagine that the noble task of choosing political leaders

who  form the Government to lead the country will become an open

season  for mud-slinging and character assassination, an outcome

we must avoid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, another important point is that the defamation

action  is  not  a  blunt  instrument.   And  I  am  sure   that

Singaporeans,  I think not many, who fear defamation  action  if

they  criticise the Government or public officials, if they know

this,  they  will be assured.  Because, besides the  defence  of

justification,  there  are also other  defences,  such  as  fair

comment and qualified privilege.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a person who innocently defames another may make

amends in accordance with section 7 of the Defamation Act.  Even

if  not  made innocently, he can mitigate damages by  making  an

unreserved  apology.  And indeed an early, sincere,  unqualified

apology may in fact avert a defamation suit.  In many cases, the

publication  of  an unqualified apology in the  newspapers  will

result in a full settlement of any potential action for damages.

Some may argue that freedom of speech should include freedom  to

err in speech.  Our defamation laws allow for freedom to err  in

speech  but  not freedom to perpetuate defamatory statements  to

the detriment of the person defamed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have made these points to show that the law of defamation

is not a sledgehammer.  Quite the contrary, the law is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>

sensitive and nuanced enough to differentiate fair criticisms on

the  one hand, innocent, unintended or careless remarks  on  the

other hand, and malicious falsehoods in the third category.  The

law  also  ensures  that fair and justified  comments,  even  if

defamatory, will not necessarily get its maker into trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that Mr Jeyaretnam cites support from

developments   in  overseas  jurisdictions.   He   talks   about

Derbyshire.  He talks about New York Times.  He talks about  the

Theophanous  and  Stephen's cases in the Australian  High  Court

which incidentally were only 4-3 majority decisions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Lingers in the European Court of Human Rights.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The Austrian case, I know. My

response  is  that  as Singapore matures as a society,  we  must

build up our own legal jurisprudence.  This must be so.  This is

an  inexorable process, applicable not only in the case  of  the

law  of defamation, where there are well over 100 local reported

and  unreported  cases,  including several  important  Court  of

Appeal decisions, but in many areas of the law, such as criminal

law,  family law, as well.  But I would say that more so in  the

law  of  defamation,  we cannot follow developments  in  Western

democracies such as UK, US or Australia blindly.  Why?   Because

defamation  laws are society-oriented.  The test  of  defamation

involves  how  ordinary members of that society would  view  the

plaintiff  in  the  light  of  the alleged  defamatory  remarks.

Hence, every society must, in the final analysis, evolve its own

benchmark  and  yardstick.  What amounts to  defamation  in  one

society may not be so in another, and this is shown very clearly

in the US, for example, as Mr Tay has alluded.  And indeed, even

among the countries that Mr Jeyaretnam cites, whether it is  US,

UK, Australia, their laws of defamation also differ which proves

my point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore no one right approach. Neither is there an

international approach.  Ridiculing and sullying the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>

reputation of national political leaders may be acceptable, say,

in  the  US.   But why should it be so in Singapore,  where  the

standing of politicians and the process are different?  Hence in

the  US, because of this requirement for express malice, it  has

become  well-nigh  impossible  to  sue  in  defamation  when   a

politician  is defamed.  Hence, we have the media  coverage  and

stories  being  exchanged, defamation for  defamation.   Is  the

country better off for it?  Surely not.  So that cannot  be  the

better approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, maybe not as dramatic, but different

nonetheless, we are also evolving differently as a society  from

the British society, the Australian society.  Or as Mr Simon Tay

says, "Why not the middle ground?  US in one spectrum, or at one

end,  and  Singapore at the other end, but there  may  be  other

models  in  between."  We have to find our own model, especially

when we talk about political leaders having to protect their own

reputation because the way political leaders are elected  differ

from  country to country.  The compact between the  elected  and

the  electorate differs from country to country.  Therefore,  we

must evolve our own way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is: should there therefore be a

different yardstick for political and public figures?  I  think,

Mr  Zulkifli,  and if I am not wrong, Mr Tay, also  asked  this.

Should politicians be treated differently?  Should they be  more

thick-skinned?   Sir, the law of defamation  protects  everyone,

both  public officials and private citizens alike.  It  must  be

so.   There is equality before the law.  In fact, this point was

brought up in one of the cases where section 12 was cited.   Why

should  the reputation of public officials matter less?  Indeed,

it  is already hard enough attracting able Singaporeans to  give

up  the  privacy  of their lives to heed the higher  calling  of

politics.   A  higher  requirement of suing  and  succeeding  in

defamation, to clear one's reputation, when smeared, would be an

unnecessary   additional  barrier.   Hence,   Singaporeans   can

criticise  Government's  policies, implementation  of  policies,

conduct  of  public officials, but I would say,  no  defamation,

please.  These will be met with rebuttals,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>

explanations and consultation, if need be.  But, let us not open

Pandora's box because when the horse bolts, we may not know  how

to  rein it in.  We have kept it in this manner which has worked

all  these  years.  Singapore has done well.  It  is  the  right

approach.  Let us keep to it.  Otherwise, there will be a lot of

energy  spent by Government leaders, not governing but  handling

the media, countering these defamations in the media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important point which I have made is the occasions when

PAP leaders have sued.  I have made this point already.  That is

a  point  worth repeating.  It is not because of criticisms  but

because  of grave and serious allegations, personal ones,  going

to  the heart of good governance. Therefore, the falsehood  must

be   shown  up  and  the  best  way  to  do  it  is  decisively,

independently,   objectively,  according   to   principles   and

standards which are all laid out in the case laws in our courts.

This  afternoon, the Minister for Law has, in a very  convincing

speech,  highlighted the reputation of our Courts, not  just  in

Singapore  but  worldwide.  It is not just said by  us,  but  by

independent polls.  So let the Courts do their job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should there be a cap on the quantum of damages? Again, I

would  say  that there is no need to do this because  the  cases

differ  on  the facts.  Unlike the UK where the jury decides  on

the damages and it has been said the damages can be inordinately

large  and  somewhat  inconsistent, in Singapore,  where  judges

decide  on the damages, they look at the framework of cases  and

they decide based on precedents.  They would say, "In this case,

because  of  these facts, so much will be given."   I  think  we

should not have a cap and limit the quantum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude. It is obvious that this motion

cannot  stand.  Ever since Mr Jeyaretnam returned to this House,

he  has sought at every turn for a higher profile for himself in

Parliament.  I think this time round, as in other times, we must

deny  him  that.  Our approach has worked well.  It has resulted

in  good  government  where honest and able  men  and  women  of

integrity are prepared to step forward, sometimes as a sacrifice

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>

themselves, to assume public office.  What is happening  in  the

region in the last 2-3 years where Singapore is standing up very

well,  shows  that this approach is the way to go.   Politicians

who   are  subject  to  scurrilous  attacks  on  their  personal

integrity  and character must continue to receive the protection

of  the  law.   In  this, they should not  be  singled  out  and

additional fetters should not be placed in their path when  they

sue for defamation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I say that,

apart  from the two Nominated MPs, what we have heard  from  the

Government  benches,  Mr  Sng  in  particular,  and  the  junior

Minister are all old hat.  They say I keep repeating but  theirs

is old hat.  We have heard this over and over again, perhaps not

from them but from Ministers.  Mr  Goh Chok Tong, even from  the

witness stand, was saying what Mr Sng was repeating here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the record,

it is Mr Sin, and not Mr Sng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Sin. Forgive me. It is nothing new to

me.   But,  as I have said before, there is a total  failure  to

come  to  grips with the question raised by this motion.   There

are  even  misconceptions completely of the terms of the  motion

and  its  purpose.  Instead of that, both Mr Sin and the  junior

Minister questioned my motivation.  It is not surprising  to  me

that  they  should  question  that  motivation.   But  that   is

something I am used to.  We have heard this from Ministers  over

and  over  again but when we question their motives for bringing

the  action they take umbrage.  As I said, it does not worry  me

if  they  should  accuse  me of motivation.   But  whatever  the

motivation,  the  question  is,  and  which  must  be   answered

honestly,  is:   should  we  allow  in  Singapore  actions   for

defamation  on  the facts that I have outlined  in  these  three

cases?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think both Members, particularly the Minister of State,

suggest that I am perhaps seeking a high profile in this  House.

But again, it attacks my personal motive.  May I ask is that the

reason,  because  they  think I am  trying  to  achieve  a  high

profile.  Is that the reason why the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>

media  have  been  told to shut me out completely  so  that  the

public  may  not know anything about what I say in  this  House,

even  questions that I ask?  Nothing is shown on TV or mentioned

over the radio.  The press, particularly the English press, have

nothing  to  say.   Is  that the reason, may  I  ask,  for  this

blocking  out  of  whatever I say in this  House  because  I  am

seeking  a  high  profile and that should not be  allowed?   The

question  is:   what do the public want to hear?   What  do  the

public  feel  about the role of opposition in  Parliament?   Not

whether  the  Opposition Members are seeking a high  profile  or

not.   If they are talking nonsense, let it be reported so  that

the public can see it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the misconceptions, both Members, I think perhaps even one of

the  NMPs,  questioned whether a Commission was the  right  way.

But  if you read my motion, I am not asking for a Commission  of

Inquiry.  A Commission of Inquiry is set up to inquire into some

wrongdoing or some accident to find out the facts.  But that  is

not  what  the motion is seeking to bring about.  The motion  is

asking  for a Commission.  Have the Government Backbenchers  and

the  Minister  of  State  not heard of  law  reform  commissions

appointed  to look into the law and to suggest ways of  bringing

the  law up-to-date, if it were necessary?  That is the sort  of

Commission I am asking, not for a Commission of Inquiry into why

they brought these actions.  But a Commission on whether the law

of defamation in Singapore intrudes unnecessarily, may I repeat,

intrudes   unnecessarily,  into  the   freedom   of   expression

guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution.  That is all.  And

no one is suggesting that we bring in carte blanche the American

model  or  any  other model.  All that I am asking  is  that  we

should seriously examine this question.  Are the defamation laws

curtailing  in  any way this basic right of the individual?   So

that is the first misconception.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second misconception is that, somehow or other, I am

asking that the law of defamation be amended to give

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>

persons  the  licence to defame everybody, including politicians

in  high  places.  I do not know whether it is because they  did

not  hear  me, or whether they thought they should  just  ignore

what  I said and continue to make the same allegation that I  am

asking for a licence.  I made it clear that I was not seeking  a

licence  for  defamation, for the right to  defame,  whether  at

elections  or at any other time.  The US law does not  give  the

citizens  the  right to defame.  It only protects the  right  of

citizens  to  question and participate in  the  affairs  of  the

country.  And it protects them if there are errors of which they

were  not  aware at the time they made the statement.   What  is

wrong  with  that?   The US decision in the New York  Times  and

Sullivan does not say that you can defame the President, you can

defame all the other public officials, you can go ahead, and the

Constitution  gives you the licence.  It does not say  that  and

neither  do the laws in other countries.  So, do not be  carried

away by the idea that I am proposing for Singapore a licence  to

defame.  All I am concerned is that we should move from the kind

of society we are in now into a freer society, with the right of

every citizen, in elections or out of elections, to question the

Government  and  to have answers given to those  questions,  and

without being shut up by the threat of defamation actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, a big misconception by Mr Sin and the Minister of

State,  and perhaps also the point taken by one of the NMPs,  Mr

Zulkifli,  is  that, in Singapore, people have the  channels  to

criticise  and  they do it fearlessly.  I do not know  how  this

perception  was arrived at.  I would commend to the Minister  of

State  and to the Government that perhaps they should appoint  a

fact-finding  body,  not the Government,  to  inquire  from  the

citizens whether they feel they have a right to speak up  freely

and  criticise the Government and its officials in the discharge

of  its  public duties.  May I say from what I know, if  such  a

body  is appointed and the citizens are told, "You need have  no

fear.   You  can give the answers truly.", it will surprise  the

Government.  Not a day passes without me encountering people who

tell me,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>

"In Singapore, we cannot breathe.  In Singapore, we cannot speak

up."   It  does not only come from taxi drivers.  It comes  from

people way down.  So, I fail to understand this statement  that,

in  Singapore, no one need be afraid, whether of defamation laws

or the ISA or any other administrative action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What fora are there in Singapore for expression of public

opinion?  It is no good pointing to feedback systems set  up  by

the  Government.   I  have mentioned before  that  it  has  been

reported  to me that even at these feedback sessions,  questions

have first to be given and they have to be approved.  But what I

am  suggesting  is  that  if  you are  really  sincere  in  your

statement  that  there are enough avenues,  or  you  would  want

avenues,  then open up, and allow public discussion.  Take  away

the  permit requirements for public meetings.  Allow persons  to

congregate  and  discuss openly.  Then you  can  say,  "Yes,  in

Singapore,  we have all the avenues necessary."  But  that  does

not  obtain in Singapore.  There is no freedom of expression  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chilling effect of the defamation actions on the freedom of

expression  is not something that just the Amnesty, the  ICJ  or

other   NGOs   have  brought  up.   This  chilling   effect   of

restricting, by defamation laws, public participation was  noted

by the House of Lords in the Derbyshire County Council case.  It

is  probably  from there that people have begun using  the  term

"the  chilling effect". It is not just the ICJ or Amnesty  which

talks  about the chilling effect.  The courts in other countries

have  recognised that and they recognise the importance of  free

speech for a truly democratic society which rates the freedom of

the  citizens to participate in public affairs higher  than  the

right to protect personal reputation.   But, of course, they are

not suggesting that we go overboard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other big misconception is to totally ignore the three

cases  on  which  I  have relied and to talk generally  that  we

cannot   allow  our  citizens,  even  if  they  are   Opposition

politicians,  to run down political leaders.  Do I  need  to  go

over again the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>

facts  upon  which the actions were brought in the three  cases?

There was no smearing of the plaintiffs in these actions.  In Mr

Tang  Liang  Hong's case, it was a denial of defamation  against

him, that he was a Chinese chauvinist and anti-Christian. So are

we  saying  that  in Singapore, if a Minister  decides  to  call

someone a liar, he should just shut up and not say, "I am afraid

the  Minister is not speaking the truth"?  Because the  Minister

will then say, "Oh, you are accusing me of lying.  I am going to

sue  you in the courts."  Is that not the situation in the  case

of  Tang  Liang  Hong?  Reference is made to the  perception  of

Singaporeans that in our society politicians should  immediately

take  action  to protect themselves if there is anything  unkind

said about them, even if it is defamatory, and especially it  is

slightly defamatory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I ask: where do you get that perception from? Has

any  poll  been  conducted, as it would have been  conducted  in

other  countries,  as  to  what  Singaporeans  thought  of   the

defamation  actions in the circumstances over  which  they  were

brought?  I would urge the Government to carry out that  survey.

You  can dismiss what I say as just my own perception or because

a  few  have  told me.  My friends have told me and, of  course,

they  would  say  that.   But my own  perception  is  that  many

Singaporeans   were  very  disappointed  and  upset   over   the

defamation  actions.  I think I had said in the previous  motion

about  the  letters that I had received after the last elections

where  Singaporeans said they were sickened to the pit of  their

stomachs  by what had happened during the elections.  They  said

they were ashamed that this should be allowed in Singapore.  So,

please  carry out a survey.  I would be very glad if  you  would

carry  out  a  survey among Singaporeans as to what  they  think

about the defamation actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not disputing that we should make laws that we think are

necessary for our society.  And this would be the purpose of the

Commission.  The Commission would examine the present defamation

laws and see how they have been applied in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>

Courts.   The Commission would go into the facts and  then  come

out  with  their  recommendation whether they think  any  change

should  be  made.  That is all.  What is so difficult about  it?

We  should  all  accept that with open arms if, as  I  said,  we

believe  in democracy.  So we come back again and again to  this

question: what kind of society do we want in Singapore?   Do  we

want  an open democratic society?  Or do we want a society where

the  people's mouths are shut and they are not able to speak  up

and make their contributions to the society?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, in the speeches of the NMPs, the need to protect

politicians from false charges or reckless charges.   My  answer

to  that  is,  of  course, I can see the need  to  protect  them

against  scurrilous false charges, but we would have to  examine

and  answer  the question whether, in these three  cases,  there

were false scurrilous charges. In my own particular case, it was

a  statement of truth, that he had placed in front of me reports

which  he  had  made to the Police.  On that  it  could  not  be

denied, it was nothing but the absolute truth.  There is nothing

false about it.  And, indeed, as Members must know, the next day

the  press  carried Mr Tang Liang Hong's reports to the  Police,

released  by  no  less than the Senior Minister, in  conjunction

with the Prime Minister.  So they were informing the public  and

yet  I was sued because I had told the public that he had lodged

the reports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this situation that one should examine and answer the

question  whether  we  should  allow  libel  actions  in   these

situations.   Of  course,  there is  the  law,  the  defence  of

justification,  the  defence of fair  comment,  the  defence  of

qualified privilege.  But, as has been observed in the decisions

in the other countries, it is almost impossible for a person who

makes  a comment to prove something which lies peculiarly within

the  knowledge of the other party.  So it is for the other party

to  bring all the facts and to show that the statement was false

and  that the person knew the falsity of the statement  when  he

made it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Sin and the Minister of State talk about the sovereign

right in Singapore to make its own laws.  Where does this motion

deny  that sovereign right?  So what is the purpose in repeating

that?  We are asking independent people to advise the Government

on  the law of defamation.  We are not asking them to import any

other laws.  We would be asking them to appoint a Commission  to

make recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to read, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, and I could read,

statements  in all the cases decided outside Singapore  to  show

what importance they attach to the rights of the citizens.   But

I do not intend to do that.  I have kept Members long enough.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes, it is getting very late.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> And if I carry on, it will probably take us up

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> All right. You require five Members to

call for a division.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Those in favour of a division, would

you please stand?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong and Mr Low Thia Khiang rose.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> There are only three Members. That

does not qualify you to call for a division.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, all right. But I have called for a
