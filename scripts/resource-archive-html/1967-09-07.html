Public   Utilities   Board  to  provide   domestic

electricity  supply to kampong dwellers  at  their

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the major part of the work connected with

the provision of electricity supply to the kampong

dwellers in the Siak Kuan Road area in Changi  was

completed on 15th October, 1965, the owner of  the

land  of a certain portion of the kampong objected

to  the poles which had been erected on his  land.

The  matter was subsequently resolved through  the

good offices of the District Officer in Katong and

electricity supply has been made available to  all

the kampong dwellers since 18th April, 1967.

<div align="center"><b>(Measures to prevent water pollution)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tang See Chim</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister whether he is aware of any measures being

taken  by  the Public Utilities Board  to  prevent

water pollution now that a bridge and a band-stand

have  been  built  over the  water  in  MacRitchie

Reservoir and whether he will inform the House  of

such measures.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

question is a very timely one and I am quite  sure

there  are  many  people  who  share  the  anxiety

expressed by the Member for Choa Chu Kang  on  the

necessity   to  keep  the  waters  in   MacRitchie

Reservoir  and  elsewhere clean and unpolluted.  I

would  like to say that members of the public  who

visit  the reservoir should be fully conscious  of

the   dangers  of  polluting  the  water  in   the

reservoir  and urge them to cooperate  to  prevent

such contamination from occurring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to Members of the

House  that there have been many cases  in  recent

history  when  there were outbreaks of  infectious

hepatitis, a disease which affects the  liver,  in

several  countries  - Hongkong,  Germany,  Sweden,

India  -  and on investigation it has  been  found

that  the source of this epidemic has been  traced

to  water  being contaminated by sewage either  at

the   point  of  intake  of  the  water  from  the

reservoir or river or in the distribution  system.

The worst outbreak of this disease, hepatitis, was

in  New Delhi in 1955/56 when there were 30,000 to

50,000  cases.  The  virus  causing  hepatitis  is

resistant to standard methods of purification used

by municipalities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



Treatment   with  large  doses  of   chlorine   is

necessary  to  destroy the virus but  this  raises

enormously the cost of purified water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possibility of contaminating the reservoirs

in  Singapore comes from picnickers  who  wash  or

swim  in the reservoirs. As it is not possible  to

make  a complete patrol of the reservoirs, we  can

only  appeal  to  the civic consciousness  of  the

picnickers  and  hikers in the reservoirs  not  to

bathe  in the reservoirs or to allow dogs to enter

the water. As a note of warning to all adventurous

people, I would like to add that the reservoir  is

very  deep  and  in many parts the bed  is  muddy.

Bathing  and swimming in the reservoir can,  there

fore, be very dangerous to the swimmer who may get

stuck in the mud and drown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board is in the process of

drawing  up regulations to prevent water pollution

in  the  MacRitchie Reservoir and  misuse  of  the

MacRitchie Reservoir Park. These regulations will,

among  other things, prohibit fishing and  bathing

in the reservoir or streams, spitting in the park,

eating  or  smoking  on the bridge  in  MacRitchie

Reservoir  Park,  and  litter, rubbish  or  other

refuse  must be thrown into receptacles which  are

specially provided for them. The Board has  formed

a  MacRitchie  Reservoir Park  Committee  to  look

after  the  maintenance of the park and to  ensure

that  visitors  comply  with  the  regulations.  A

number  of patrolmen have been employed to  patrol

the  whole area of the park grounds and more  will

be  recruited to ensure that the regulations, when

promulgated, are not violated by visitors.  It  is

not  the  intention of the Public Utilities  Board

unnecessarily  to impose rules and regulations  on

all those who visit MacRitchie Reservoir Park, but

I  think  all of us will agree that the park  will

look more attractive not only to our citizens  but

also to all tourists and visitors if we ourselves,

the  public, make a particular effort to keep  the

place clean.

some   flight  of  capital  usually  takes  place.

Refugee capital coming into any country does so by

means which avoid official records. The number  of

approaches made by Hongkong industrialists to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>

increased  since  these disturbances  began.  More

than  300  Hongkong industrialists have  discussed

investments proposals with the Singapore  Economic

Development   Board,  and   I   believe   that   a

substantial   number  of  these   proposals   will

materialise into factories on the ground. This, of

course, will take time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, for some months there

has  been  public  concern over increases  in  the

prices    of   certain   commodities,   especially

foodstuffs and household articles. The reasons for

these  price increases are often confused  in  the

public  mind. As a result, there have been adverse

comments  on  Government's  industrialisation  pro

gramme  which has been blamed for the increase  in

the  cost  of  living. I wish  to  go  into  these

matters in some detail as it is important that the

blame  should be attributed to the right quarters.

The  real  reason for the widespread concern  over

the  increase  in  the cost of living,  especially

among  the  poorer people, lies in the substantial

increase  in  the cost of rice. Over the  last  18

months the price of rice has gone up by 14 cents a

katty.  To people with large incomes this increase

in  price  will  cause  no  hardship.  But  if  we

consider  the  effect on a typical working  family

of, say, a man with a wife and three children,  we

can  see  that it bears very harshly  on  them.  A

family  of  five may consume about 100 katties  of

rice a month, and the price increase means that  a

wage-earner has to bear the additional expenditure

of $14 a month. To a family earning $200 a month -

this  is  a typical working class family income  -

this represents a very substantial increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



It  is  nearly equivalent to a pay cut  of  $14  a

month,  and the extensive grumbling that  goes  on

now is the consequence of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can Government do about the price of rice?

First, we must find out why the price has gone up.

Is  it  due to profiteering by our rice merchants,

or  is  it  because the world price  of  rice  has

increased?  If price increases are the  result  of

profiteering,  then  Government  action  to  lower

prices  can  be  taken by taking measures  against

profiteering. But there is rio evidence  that  our

rice  merchants are profiteering. The real  reason

is  that  there has been an increase in the  world

price  of rice because of the general shortage  of

supply. Rice exports from Burma have gone down  in

recent   years.  Thailand  is  suffering  from   a

drought.  The  war in Vietnam has  not  helped  to

increase  rice  production in  that  country.  And

indonesia  continues to be a large  buyer  in  the

world  market.  So the increase  in  the  cost  of

living due to the increase in the price of rice is

due to external factors beyond our control and has

nothing    to    do    with    the    Government's

industrialisaton programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as people want to eat rice, they must

pay for the extra cost. But they can economise  by

eating less rice and more wheat products, such  as

bread  and  noodles, as our Deputy Prime  Minister

has  been  advocating. Wheat flour, of course,  is

half the price of rice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been a substantial increase in

the  price  of  canned meat imported  from  China.

Chinese exporters have increased their prices, and

there is statistical evidence that this has happened. Here again the reasons lie outside our country

and beyond our control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards day-to-day food supplies, certain

items have gone up in price, such as cabbages  and

potatoes,  while others have gone down  in  price,

such  as  red chillies, onions, spinach, chai  sim

and  1ong beans. These are normal fluctuations  in

the market and are not of great significance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some months ago there was an attempt made to

speculate   in  matches  and  sugar.  When   these

commodities  were  produced in  Singapore,  import

duties  were imposed on foreign products  so  that

the  local manufacturer could capture the domestic

market. Some people, thinking that they could make

money,  tried  to raise the prices  of  sugar  and

matches.   But  it  was  soon  found  that   local

suppliers were adequate to meet the market  demand

and  prices reverted to normal. So while  imported

matches are more expensive, the price of the local

product  remains the same. If people want  to  buy

imported  matches at twice the price of the  local

product, there is nothing one can do about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the subject of Government's

policy on industrialisation and its effect on  the

prices   of  goods.  We  must  assure  the   local

manufacturer a substantial portion of the domestic

market for the products he is manufacturing. To do

this,   import  duties  are  imposed  on   foreign

products. Naturally thit means that the prices  of

imported articles go up. The Trade Division of the

Ministry  of Finance keeps a continuing survey  on

prices  of locally-manufactured goods. When  local

manufacturers   commence  production,   they   are

directed not to increase their prices unless there

is  good  reason  to do so, as,  for  example,  an

increase in the price of raw materials. In  nearly

all  cases, the local manufacturers have  accepted

their obligation in good faith and have maintained

good  quality  and reasonable prices.  Here  again

some local consumers are attached to the brands of

goods  which  they are used to buying,  and  these

imported goods definitely cost more than the local

products.  If  you want to pay more  for  imported

condensed milk, mosquito coils, chocolates, toilet

soap,  singlets  and matches, you cannot  complain

about  the increase in the cost of living, because

you  can  buy local products at the same price  as

before  and  of comparable quality. For  instance,

Cadbury chocolates used to cost 35 cents a bar. As

a  result of import duties, they now cost 50 cents

a bar. Van Houten



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



chocolates,  which  are  produced  in   Singapore,

continue  to be priced at 35 cents a bar.  If  you

are  very  fond  of  Cadbury chocolates,  you  may

continue  to  buy them. You will  then  be  contributing

to  the revenue of the Customs Department.

If you buy the local product, you do not make this

contribution but you will be contributing  to  the

income and employment of your fellow citizens. You

can take your choice in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two or three instances there are grounds for

suspecting  local manufacturers of  either  having

inefficient   high  cost  management   or   making

excessive  profits. The cure here,  in  the  first

instance, is to improve management efficiency.  In

the second case, it is to ask the manufacturer  to

reduce  his  prices.  The  sanction  that  can  be

applied  in  both  instances is the  reduction  or

abolition of import duties on these commodities. I

will  not  hesitate to apply this sanction  should

the  circumstances of the situation  justify  such

action.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for

Finance    if   he   will   consider   introducing

legislation   to  provide  that  all  departmental

stores  and  retail  shops display  Singapore-made

goods.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The spirit in which the hon.

Member has asked the question is good. However,  I

do  not  think  this is a very good  idea.  First,

there  are countless shops and departmental stores

in  Singapore.  Implementation  of  this  proposal

would,  therefore, cost a lot of money. The  large

variety  of  locally-manufactured goods,  together

with  the large numbers and sizes of shops selling

them,  would  make  it almost impossible  to  have

orderly  legislation and effective implementation.

We  cannot, for instance, legislate that all shops

display  all  types  of  locally-made  goods.  The

variety is too large. There may be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



inadequate space in some shops. On the other hand,

if  it  is  provided that not all the locally-made

goods need be displayed, a shop could display only

one  product and claim to have complied  with  the

law.   This  would  defeat  the  purpose  of  such

legislation.  To specify a minimum  variety  would

also  be difficult, as shops vary so much in size.

What  is  adequate for one shop  is  probably  not

adequate for another. These are only a few of  the

problems that we will encounter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that compulsory display of

locally-made  goods will not necessarily  increase

sales.  The Singapore consumer is a discriminating

buyer  and  purchases on the basis  of  price  and

quality.   As   competition  is  extremely   keen,

departmental stores and retail shops cannot afford

to  be  without lines which sell. In other  words,

the  availability of consumer goods is not  a  pro

blem. The manufacturer will have to compete on the

basis  of price and quality rather than depend  on

compulsory display to push sales. I have no  doubt

that this is what they are doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Manufacturers' Association has now

taken over from the Economic Development Board the

Products  and  Design Centre at Raffles  Place.  I

understand  that  they intend to make  the  Centre

even bigger and better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let us not forget that freedom of

choice  is important in our free society.  Freedom

in  merchandising  is not only a  good  thing  but

serves as a practical stimulant to competition. So

while  I  think the hon. Member has got the  right

sentiments  in  putting forward this  question,  I

suggest that there are other ways of achieving the

objective he has in mind.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> With effect from 2nd August,

1966,  specific  licensing  was  imposed  on   the

importation  of  apples, pears,  grapes,  mandarin

oranges,  peaches and plums. For  some  time,  the

importation  of  some of these fresh  fruits  from

certain  countries  came  under  the  control   of

importers' committees. These committees or  panels

of  importers restricted imports to keep prices at

a  high  level. Previous importers and wholesalers

were  not  only excluded from importing direct  by

the    committees,   but   even   their   members'

proportionate share of imports and their sales  to

wholesalers  were  frozen  over  the  years.  This

cartelization  of  our  imports  is  contrary   to

Singapore's  tradition  of  free  trade  and  free

competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after such specific licensing was

implemented, the various importers' committees  in

Singapore  were dissolved and import licences  for

fresh  fruits  have  been  issued  freely  to  all

applicants, although some restrictions are imposed

to  prevent the formation of the panel system  and

the  reintroduction of restricted  practices.  The

Trade  Division does not restrict  the  number  of

fresh fruit importers or the issue of licences. It

is  estimated  that there are about  70  wholesale

companies with specific provision to safeguard the

interests  of persons who deposit money with  such

companies.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The term "finance companies"

generally  applies  to  companies  soliciting  and

accepting  deposits  from the  public  and  making

loans  to  the public to buy articles  like  motor

cars, motor scooters, television sets, radios  and

refrigerators.  There is a wide range  of  finance

companies.   They  range  from  the  larger   ones

operating  usually  as subsidiaries  of  banks  to

smaller  ones which include pawnshops that  accept

money from the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operations of these finance companies are, in

some  ways,  similar to banks  but,  unlike  banks

which  are required to be licensed and subject  to

the provisions of the Banking Ordinance, there  is

no   specific  law  governing  the  operations  of

finance  companies. Therefore, it is not  possible

to  determine  the exact number of such  companies

operating here today, as these companies  are  not

compelled  by  law  to report or  register  or  to

inform  the Government that they are operating  as

finance  companies  other than registration  under

the Companies Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My predecessor, who is now the Minister of

Defence,  has  already expressed his concern  over

the  activities of these finance companies in  his

Budget  speech last year. He announced that Government

would be introducing legislation to regulate

and  control  such companies. This legislation  is

with such companies?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think it is best to leave

the exact details of safeguards in the legislation

first,  let  me  say  that  Government  is  in  no

position to guarantee deposits by members  of  the

public  either in finance companies  or  banks  or

anywhere  else.  If you give your money  to  other

people  and  they run away with it, then  that  is

your own bad luck. You cannot go to Government and

say,  "Pay  up." But what we can do is  to  ensure

that  finance companies do not fiddle around  with

other  people's  monies, that they  have  a  sound

investment  policy,  and that  they  refrain  from

certain  acts which may endanger the  security  of

their customers' deposits.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  the  total amount of old  currency  notes

redeemed  in the Republic from 12th June  to  31st

August, 1967, and if he is satisfied with the rate

of  exchange of the old currency notes for the new

ones in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> As at 31st August this year,

Singapore has redeemed $271 million of the old currency.

This amounts to 34.65 per cent of the total

currency of the old notes redeemed so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 12th June, the Board of Commissioners of

Currency,  Malaya  and  British  Borneo,  was  the

issuing  authority  in  Singapore,  Malaysia   and

Brunei.  The  old  notes therefore  circulated  in

these  territories  and it  was  not  possible  to

determine   the  exact  amount  of   these   notes

circulating  in each territory. This  problem  was

especially acute in Singapore and Malaysia because

the territories are so close to each other.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no figures of the exact circulation of

currency notes in these two territories,  and  the

usual  method of estimation has been to  take  the

formula  given in the Currency Agreement  of  1960

and  this formula is used in the distribution  of

profits.  The  formula estimates that  Singapore's

currency circulation will be between 15 and 18 per

cent,  the actual percentage varying from year  to

year  depending  on population and other  factors.

For  1966,  the percentage was taken at  15.4  per

cent. Our present rate of redemption of 34.65  per

cent  of the total note issue so far redeemed  can

therefore be regarded as quite satisfactory.  This

experience   in   redemption  also   proves   what

Singapore  has always maintained - the  amount  of

currency circulating here is higher than what  was

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr

Ho See Beng -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.To ask the Minister for Finance if he will

make a statement on the comparative prices per ton

of  imported rice and locally-milled wheat  flour;

what  are  the  respective tonnages of  these  two

staple  foodstuffs  consumed or  estimated  to  be

consumed per month by the people of Singapore; and

what  will  be  the  estimated  annual  saving  in

foreign  exchange by the increase  of,  say,  four

thousand  tons  in the consumption  of  wheat  per

month.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Question No. 12.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The price of Siamese white

rice  100  per cent is 49 cents per katty  retail,

whereas  locally-milled wheat flour  of  excellent

quality  sells for only 25 cents per katty.  Wheat

flour, therefore, costs only half as much as rice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore consumes in an average month about

12,000 tons of rice and 4,000 tons of wheat flour.

If  we  can  persuade our population to  eat  more

wheat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



than  rice, as the Deputy Prime Minister has  been

doing  for  some time, there will be a substantial

saving  of  foreign  exchange. Assuming  that  the

people of Singapore can increase their consumption

of  wheat by another 4,000 tons, we will save $1.8

million  a month or $22 million a year at  present

prices of wheat and rice. Further, since wheat  is

milled  into flour in Singapore, we will  also  be

giving more income and employment to our citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister for Finance has made a

comparison  of  the prices of rice  and  wheat.  I

would like to ask whether the Government has taken

any  steps  to prevent the rise in the  prices  of

wheat and wheat products.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have already explained that

where  we reduce imports of goods either by import

duties,  or in in the case of flour, I  think,  by

quota restrictions, the manufacturers of the local

products - in  this  case,  the  millers  of   wheat

flour - will  have  to discuss with  Government  any

changes in the price of their products before they

put   that  into  effect.  In  other  words,   the

opportunities  of  millers of  wheat  to  increase

their  prices are very limited unless they have  a

reasonable  case,  such  as  an  increase  in  the

international price of wheat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Sim Boon Woo</b> asked the Minister for

Health  if  he will take steps so that more  dust-

bins are provided, and more labourers are employed

to  clear all the rubbish, in all the kampongs  in

the Changi Constituency and other Constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

answer  to  the question posed by the  Member  for

Changi would best be answered in two parts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to his question as to what steps the

Ministry of Health will take to provide more dust-

bins  in  all  the kampongs in Changi Constituency

and  other constituencies, the answer is none.  We

intend    to   bring   home   to   all   Singapore

householders, whether living in kampongs or  urban

areas, that every householder is required to  have

his  own  dust-bin  (not a  dust-bin  provided  by

Government) with a proper lid (not one  without  a

lid)  to contain his household refuse. It is  then

the  duty  of  the Public Cleansing Department  to

clear   it  daily.  This  service  is  now   being

performed free of charge, but we intend to  charge

a nominal monthly fee of $1 per month from the 1st

of  January  next  year and this  charge  will  be

included  in  the  householder's  monthly   Public

Utilities  bill.  Should  a  householder  fail  to

provide  a  dust-bin after due notice has  already

been   served  on  him  by  the  Public  Cleansing

Department, he will be provided with  one  by  the

department but he will be charged for  it  in  his

monthly Public Utilities bill too.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to the Member's suggestion that more

labourers  should  be employed to  clear  off  all

refuse, the answer is that after reorganisation of

the  Public Cleansing Department in February  this

year (more than six months ago), it has been found

that  even with the reduced work force of 3,500  -

made  up of 2,000 from the Public Daily-Rated work

force and 1,500 from the Emergency Cleansing Corps

as  compared with the work force existing prior to

the  strike - there are, generally speaking,  more

staff  than  the  work that is required  of  them.

There is, therefore, no question of employing more

workers  for public cleansing. What is  needed  is

more  reorganisation  within  the  department  and

closer supervision and reallocation of duties,  so

that  the  work can be more equitably  distributed

amongst workers. This is being undertaken, but  it

will  take some time as it involves work schedules

for thousands.

<div align="center"><b>LICENSING OF EATING-SHOPS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Complaints of unnecessary requirements)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Minister for

Health  (i)  the number of complaints received  by

his  Ministry alleging that his Ministry officials

had  insisted on unnecessary requirements for  the

licensing  of eating-shops, etc.; (ii) the  number

of  cases  in which he has over-ruled or rescinded

the  actions  of  the officials;  and  (iii)  what

actions  have been taken against the officers  concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, the answers to the

queries by the Member for Aijunied are as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is not possible to list out all the

complaints received from the public from  time  to

time,  as  after  investigation the  decisions  of

officials are generally upheld.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the number of cases in which the

Minister  had personally to over-rule  or  rescind

the decisions of officials is 12.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, no disciplinary action had been taken

against  the officials concerned except to  advise

them to the effect that they could have adopted  a

less  bureaucratic attitude and approach, and that

more  than  just health requirements  should  have

been   taken   into  account  when   arriving   at

decisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is admitted that the job of licensing

premises is not an easy one, and the Minister  has

accordingly  appointed a Public  Health  Licensing

Board  of  five members to deal with this problem,

of which only one member is an official.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng</b> asked the Minister for

Health  how  many  cases of complications  arising

from criminal abortions were treated in Government

hospitals  in  1966, and what  was  the  mortality

rate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, accurate

figures of the number of criminal abortions cannot

be  given, as women do not readily admit to  interference

with   their  pregnancy.  An   estimate,

nevertheless, can be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of patients admitted for abortions to

the  Kandang  Kerbau Maternity Hospital  over  the

years  is  as follows. These figures were reported

by the Medical Superintendent of the Hospital at a

seminar  of  the  Family Planning  and  Population

Board on the 15th of January this year.



<pre>

                      Total

                    number of     With

                    abortions    Sepsis   Deaths



            1962      4,279       425       1

            1963      3,829       465       2

            1964      4,295       450       5

            1965      3,386       258      10

            1966      3,432       265       5

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approximate average may be taken as around

4,000  cases  admitted to the hospital  per  year.

This  represents nearly 8 per cent  of  the  total

number of births per year in Singapore. As it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



estimated that abortions of all types occur at the

rate  of 10 per cent a year, it may be taken  that

there are about 5,500 abortions per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Yong Kiat, who is a physician attached

to  the  Medical III Unit of the General Hospital,

when  he was Medical Superintendent of the Kandang

Kerbau  Hospital,  wrote an  M.D. thesis  on  the

subject   of  "Non-clinical  aspects  of   induced

abortions  in  Singapore", which was published  in

1965.  His study was over a period of seven months

from  1st July, 1964, to 31st December, 1964,  and

it  covered  1,676 cases. I should  like  at  this

stage,  Sir, if I may, to quote page  102  of  his

conclusions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The yearly incidence for Singapore would be

5,000 abortions. The total number of abortions  is

usually  estimated  to  be  10  per  cent  of  all

pregnancies, which in Singapore would work out  to

be  about 6,000 a year. It is my contention  that,

of this, 5,000 are criminally induced. 5,000 cases

is  83 per cent of all abortions, or 8.3 per  cent

of all pregnancies.'



<br><br>That,  Sir,  is  the study of  an  expert  on  the

subject, and therefore I am inclined to accept the

opinion of a man who has made a special study  and

compiled a thesis of the subject.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> The position is that

exemption would be given on economic grounds,  but

the  appeals of those affected would  have  to  be

considered by the Advisory Board. Therefore, those

who  are affected and who consider themselves that

on economic grounds they could not be drafted into

national service, would have to make an appear  to

the  Advisory  Board  according  to  the  National

Service  Ordinance, and the Advisory  Board  would

duly  consider their appeals. As I have said, this

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the strength  of  our  marine

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Force (Women) did not participate in

Member  will, of course, realise that the  problem

of  retraining  some thousands of local  employees

who  will  be  affected by  the  run-down  of  the

British bases is a task of considerable magnitude.

Before any concrete plans can be formulated, it is

necessary   to  obtain  detailed  information   of

civilian employees who will be retrenched, such as

age,    type   of   work   currently   performing,

qualifications, experience and so on to  enable  a

detailed study to be made of the type and scope of

retraining  that is required for alternative  jobs

in  commerce and industry. This matter  cannot  he

isolated from the fact that increasing numbers  of

youths  who  are entering the labour  market  will

also  need  vocational training to  fit  them  for

jobs, it will, therefore, be necessary to consider

this problem as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, however, assures the hon. Member

that  it will make every effort to formulate plans

for  the  retraining of retrenched  employees  and

training  for  our youths as soon as the  required

information  which will be made available  by  the

British  authorities is studied  in  detail.  This

matter  is now receiving the earnest consideration

of my Ministry.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Labour how many cases of false identity cards were

discovered in the last two months and what  action

he intends to take in the matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, eight

cases  of Singapore identity cards which had  been

tampered  with  for  illegal use  were  discovered

during the last two months. The persons have  been

prosecuted and convicted. The eight identity cards

in   these  cases  were  reported  lost  by  their

rightful  holders. These are the only  cases  that

have  been discovered since the issue of  the  new

plastic  laminated  identity  cards.  The  plastic

laminated identity cards cannot be easily  forged.

Hence  in  all these cases genuine identity  cards

have  been used. Only part of the cards  had  been

tampered with to fit in with the features  of  the

illegal  holders.  As  in  all  these  cases,  the

identity  cards  had either been pick-pocketed  or

stolen from the rightful owners. One effective way

of  control  is to warn the public to  take  great

care in carrying their identity cards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the National Registration Office has

taken  steps  to  have  very  strict  scrutiny  of

persons  who  make  frequent reports  of  loss  of

identity cards. Officers in Government departments

and statutory boards who inspect identity cards in

the  course of their duties have also been advised

on  how  to  detect identity cards that have  been

tampered with.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, is the Minister aware that recently there

has  been talk around town that there is a  racket

involved  in  the  fabrication of  false  identity

cards for persons from outside Singapore and  inducing

them, particularly women folk, to conic here

and work as bar waitresses, dance hostesses and in

other  undignified professions? At the same  time,

is  the Minister aware, too, that these people are

making  use of a loophole in the laminated plastic

identity  cards for illegal purposes? The loophole

is  that  there  is  no  seal  or  chop  over  the

photograph. That means the photograph  can  be  re

placed  or  substituted easily with  that  of  the

false  holder  of  the  identity  card.  Has   the

Minister any means to deal with the situation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, I have not

received any information of whether there is a

racket in forging identity cards. As I have

pointed out just now, this laminated identity card

cannot be easily forged. So the only thing that

these racketeers can do is to tamper with the

identity card in the way the Member for Delta has

mentioned just now. They may take out the

photograph from the identity card and substitute

it with another one which would fit in with the

illegal immigrant. But in doing this, the tampered

identity card will be very easily detected as

there will be a hole and an uneven surface will be

present on the card.

through  the distribution of hand-bills to  advise

farmers to have their pigs vaccinated as early  as

possible.  In addition, the import and  export  of

pigs  have been temporarily suspended. The disease

has  been  brought under control, but its complete

eradication cannot be expected in the near  future

in  view  of the fact that territories surrounding

Singapore  are  also infected  with  the  disease.

Further, some ignorant farmers are adopting a wait-

and-see  attitude  instead of getting  their  pigs

vaccinated as soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Minister  say how long will a pig so immunised  be

immune from such a disease?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Vaccinated pigs are protected for at

least one year, probably more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Now that the disease is under

control, what other steps can be taken to immunise

the  entire  pig population so as to  prevent  any

possible outbreak of swine fever?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Although a large number of pigs have

already  been  vaccinated, I agree with  the  hon.

Member  for Punggol that the only effective method

is  to vaccinate all pigs. But as I have said just

now,  many  a farmer is reluctant to come  forward

and  have his pigs vaccinated. The only way we can

do  it is to pass legislation to compel farmers to

have their pigs vaccinated. But for the moment  we

do not think that such a measure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



is  called  for.  We would rather  use  methods  of

persuasion than methods of compulsion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

Minister say that the reluctance of the farmers  is

due  mainly  to economic considerations?  Will  the

Ministry lower the cost of the injections, so  that

reluctance would disappear?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am sure the amount charged for

vaccination  is not the prohibitive factor.  It  is

rather ignorance and hoping for the best until  the

disease  strikes  the  farm.  And  then  they  come

running to the Primary Production Department.  When

that  happens, sometimes it is rather late. So once

again  I say that if all farmers will come forward,

if the vaccination is free, we will give it to them

free. But they will not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Would the Minister consider rendering assistance to

the affected farmers to restore their business?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> So far the assistance we have given

is  to  vaccinate the pigs. But the only method  of

assisting  farmers  would be  for  my  Ministry  to

liaise  with the Ministry of Social Affairs. Though

my  Ministry  is  in  charge of  pigs,  it  is  the

Ministry of Social Affairs that assists farmers who

lose  their  pigs.  But  so  far  no  requests  for

assistance have reached us.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Once the

Primary  Production Department has discovered  that

there  is swine fever in an area, will the affected

pigs  be  taken  over  by  the  Primary  Production

Department or returned to the farmers? This poses a

threat  to  the consumers, as they are afraid  that

they might buy the diseased pork.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I can assure the hon. Member for

Delta that no diseased pork is sold in our markets.

Whenever swine fever is reported or detected  in  a

farm,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



the  farm  is  completely isolated.  No  pigs, are

allowed  to go in or to be taken out. And any  pigs

that  die as a result of the disease are buried  on

the  spot. So consumers need have no fears that the

meat  or  the  pork  that  they  are  consuming  is

infected pork.

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill intituled

"An  Act  to  amend  the Criminal  Procedure  Code

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to hon.

Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill that

is   now   before  the  House  contains   proposed

amendments   to  section  368  of   the   Criminal

Procedure  Code. The reasons for  this  Bill  stem

from  recent  disturbances in the Republic,  which

had  led  to the arrest of a few hundred offenders

accused of rioting and other cognate offences. The

subsequent proceedings in court and the  behaviour

of  the accused persons when produced in court had

emphasised  certain inadequacies in  our  Criminal

Procedure Code, especially in regard to the powers

of   a   subordinate  court  exercising   criminal

jurisdiction  to  punish  offenders  for   alleged

contempt of court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular case which hon. Members are no

doubt  familiar with relates to the occasion  when

the  alleged  offenders, when  produced  in  court

being jointly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



charged  for  committing the same offence  at  the

same time and place, had misbehaved in so unruly a

manner as to have destroyed furniture in the court

itself.   This   extraordinary  behaviour,   quite

unprecedented  in the history of our  courts,  had

brought  to  the fore the inadequacies of  certain

portions   of  our  Code  of  Procedure  governing

proceedings in our Magistrates' Courts, especially

so  with  regard  to the powers of  the  court  to

commit for contempt even where the acts complained

of  are  committed in the presence  of  the  court

itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands, Sir, the sole provision -

section 368 of the Criminal Procedure Code - under

which a subordinate court may summarily punish  an

offender  for contempt only permits the  court  to

impose a fine not exceeding $50. And it is only in

cases  where default in payment of the fine occurs

that  imprisonment for a term which may extend  to

two  months may be imposed by the court.  Even  in

such  circumstances the period of imprisonment  is

terminated the moment the fine is paid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only summary power which a magistrate

has  in imposing his will or in attempting to  lay

down law and order in his court. The authority and

dignity of the court, it may be said, depend  very

much  on the traditional respect normally accorded

to  members  of  the judiciary. Indeed,  Sir,  the

occasion where a magistrate has felt the desire to

call  in  the  aid  of  such  provisions  as   are

contained  in Chapter 32 of the Criminal Procedure

Code in order to maintain the dignity and order of

proceedings in court, limited though these  powers

are,  have  been  quite  uncommon.  But  what  had

transpired in the course of the morning  when  the

cases  of the rioters were mentioned in the  Ninth

Magistrate's  Court  in June last  emphasises  the

need  to  enhance the powers of the magistrate  in

this  regard.  Hon. Members will agree  that  this

must  be so, especially when flagrant insults  and

deliberate acts of unruly behaviour calculated  to

bring  the courts into contempt and ridicule  must

be met with means to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



impose sufficient deterrents. In order, therefore,

that the administration of criminal justice in our

subordinate  courts  may not be  solely  dependent

upon  traditional respect and in  order  that  the

smooth functioning of the machinery of justice may

not be in any way impaired, even though these acts

of  hooliganism are very much the exception rather

than the general rule, the Government have thought

it necessary to introduce this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the proposed amendments to section 368 of our

Criminal Procedure Code, adequate powers  will  be

conferred  upon a subordinate court  to  safeguard

its   dignity   and  to  ensure  its   proper   ad

ministration  of  law  and  order.  Thus  the  new

section  368 will empower a subordinate  court  to

impose  sentences  of imprisonment  in  the  first

instance, should the need arise, for the court  to

exercise  its  summary powers, to commit  for  con

tempt. Furthermore, the maximum fine has also been

raised ten times to $500. The court will now  have

a  discretion  of  imposing  either  sentences  of

imprisonment in the first instance or  a  fine  or

impose   a   sentence  combining  both  forms   of

punishment.  The Bill which I am  now  seeking  to

move  has  been  introduced on  a  Certificate  of

Urgency  because  of  recent events  in  Singapore

which are well known to Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want

to  make  a general comment on the Bill introduced

by  the Minister of Defence. As far as I know, the

Criminal Procedure Code has been in existence  for

many   years,  both  in  Singapore  and   in   our

neighbouring  country,  Malaysia.  In  the   past,

magistrates and district judges were held in  high

esteem  by whoever appeared in court. But nowadays

conditions have changed and anti-national elements

who are misled by their leaders go around flouting

the law



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



and   destroying  public  property,  for  example,

breaking   traffic  lights,  street   lights   and

defacing   decorative,   colourful   arches    and

scribbling   anti-national   slogans   on   public

buildings and so on. Therefore, not only  do  they

make  a nuisance of themselves but they also cause

serious damage to public property by way of public

funds.  However,  those caught in  such  acts  are

subsequently  charged  in court.  But  when  these

culprits  are produced in court, they even  behave

in  an  unruly manner and they do not even respect

the court of law. All that the magistrate could do

is  to  impose  a  fine, a mere sum  of  $50,  for

contempt  of  court or, in default of payment,  to

imprisonment  for a term which may extend  to  two

months  unless  such  fine is  sooner  paid.  This

measure,  I  think,  would  not  be  a  sufficient

deterrent. Therefore, with the amendment  of  this

Bill,  the magistrate is given the necessary power

to increase the fine ten times, as the Minister of

Defence  has  said, that is, $500,  and  impose  a

sentence  of  three months. This is an  essential

measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is universally known that the judiciary

is  independent, in which case, in exercising  its

powers,  it makes its authority felt. It therefore

upholds  the  respect for law and, therefore,  the

flouting  of  the  laws of  a  country  cannot  be

condoned. This is not a lawless society  and  when

those  charged under the appropriate  sections  of

the  law  of the country persist in showing  utter

contempt for the sanctity of the law, they must be

severely dealt with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, if I may, if I were to be the

Minister of Defence, I would seek heavier terms of

punishment,  such as flogging. One stroke  of  the

cane  would do these anti-national elements a  lot

of good and, if not, three would definitely do it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I   fully   support  this  amendment   Bill

introduced  by  the Minister.  Sir,  in  order  to

uphold           law           and           order ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I meant to make this remark before

Mr  Ng  spoke.  I just wanted to  remind  Members

carefully to avoid any reference to pending  cases

in the course of their speeches.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I fully

support  this amendment Bill. In order  to  uphold

the  dignity  of our courts and maintain  law  and

order  so  that  our  country  may  march  forward

progressively and become an industrialised country

and thus provide a better life for our people,  we

must   deal  with  these  anti-national   elements

severely  and  prevent them  from  committing  any

malicious   acts.  Recently  these   anti-national

elements openly flouted the law. They carried  out

illegal  parades  and demonstrations  and  damaged

community  centres, breaking traffic lights,  etc.

They  have openly shown their contempt of the  law

in  court. They have entirely disregarded law  and

order. They have caused a lot of inconvenience  to

members  of  the  public. They have  also  brought

about  disrepute and great losses to  our  country

internationally.   Ours  is  a   newly-independent

country.  We  are now proceeding with our  nation-

building.  In  the  past  two  years,   with   the

harmonious co-operation of the various  races  and

under  the judicious leadership of our Government,

construction activities have been going on in many

flelds,  and,  as  a result, we  have  made  great

progress.  But  it is regretted that  these  anti-

national  elements are trying every means  to  des

troy our nation and prevent our progress. They are

able to do so because ours is a democratic country

and our law is rather lax. It is not strict enough

to deal with them. If such acts had been committed

in  any Communist country, the culprits would have

been  severely dealt with. For example, they would

have  been  sent  to  a  labour  reform  camp   or

sentenced to death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So today it is very timely that this Bill is

introduced in this House. I feel that it  will  be

very effective in dealing with such people. At the

same time, I hope that it will also help those who

have gone astray to wake up. I hope they will turn

over  a  new  leaf  and  become  good  and  useful

citizens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the anti-national elements are

already  bankrupt in political theories. This  can

be  shown  by  the  statements  made  by  the  ex-

detainees over T.V. Singapura. I hope these  anti-

national  elements will learn from the experiences

and  the new thinking of their elder brothers.  If

we want to prevent effectively these illegal acts,

in  my  opinion, other than this Bill,  public

cooperation  and  Press  editorials  are  also  very

effective  means in achieving this  purpose.  With

all  of them applying their pressure on the  anti-

national  elements, they will achieve  the  effect

desired. I fully support this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister of Defence has sufficient reasons  to

introduce this Bill and I support it. If  law  and

order is to be maintained in the country, there is

a  necessity  for  strict laws. According  to  the

existing  legal provisions, there  is  a  possible

imposition of a fine of $50 and up to two  months'

imprisonment.  The  proposed amendment  imposes  a

$500   fine   and  a  maximum  of  three   months'

imprisonment, or both. Even this increase in  fine

and  the  term  of  imprisonment  is  not,  in  my

opinion,  sufficient. The fine has been  increased

ten  times, but the imprisonment period  has  been

increased  by  only  50  per  cent.  The  Minister

apparently  has  done this with consideration.  In

the present circumstances, it is not difficult for

a person to pay a fine of $500. Those who have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



the intention of repeating the same offences would

be  quite willing to pay a fine of $500.  But  if,

instead  of  a  bigger fine, a  longer  period  of

imprisonment  is to be imposed, then  people  will

think  twice about committing an offence.  In  any

case,  this  amended  provision  is  necessary  to

maintain   law.  Normally  we  do  not  bring   in

amendments  to  the law unless  it  is  absolutely

necessary. In view of the trouble and difficulties

created  by certain people, the amended  provision

is really welcome and I fully support it. Further,

if  we  do not bring in this amendment, it is  not

possible to maintain law and order. Justice cannot

survive without stricter legal provisions. The law

must help people and people must help the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, I praise the Minister

and give my support.



<br><br>5.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  support this amendment and endorse  fully

the  words spoken by the Minister of Defence  when

he moved the Second Reading of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old section 368 of the Criminal Procedure

Code   would  have  been  satisfactory  in  normal

circumstances  when the politics of Singapore  ran

on  an  even tenor. Unfortunately for us,  certain

groups  of  people  in  Singapore  have  of   late

deliberately  taken to the path  of  bringing  the

administration   of  justice  in  Singapore   into

hatred,  ridicule  and contempt.  I  think  it  is

imperative and important indeed that the hands  of

our  judicial  officers are strengthened  so  that

they  are  able  to deal with situations  of  this

kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in mind, Mr Speaker, Sir, certain events

that   occurred  in  the  9th  Magistrate's  Court

recently where, on the magistrate coming into  his

court, certain persons stood up on the benches and

showed  their  rears  to  him  -  a  very  serious

business indeed. I believe that the amendment,  as

it  stands,  goes a long way towards acting  as  a

deterrent against this kind of behaviour. We will,

however,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



have to watch the working of this amendment

and the efficacy with which it acts as a deterrent

to  see if any further extensions become necessary

in  the future, because I personally believe  that

these actions are politically motivated. They  are

not  the  actions of criminally motivated  people;

they    are    politically   motivated.   Provided

sufficient  funds are forthcoming, they  would  do

the same thing in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise one or two points of a

more  technical nature, Mr Speaker, Sir.  Section

368  of  the  Criminal Procedure Code  provides  a

sanction  for  offences defined by  sections  175,

178,  179, 180 and 228 of the Penal Code. For  our

purposes  the  most  relevant  section  is  really

section  228. If I may briefly refer to the  other

sections,  section  175  refers  to  omission   to

produce  a document required to be produced  by  a

public officer. Section 178 deals with refusing to

take  an oath. Section 179 deals with refusing  to

answer questions by a public servant. Section  180

deals  with  refusing  to sign  a  statement,  and

section 228, which is the relevant one, deals with

intentionally insulting or interrupting  a  public

servant   sitting  in  any  stage  of  a  judicial

proceeding. I fear that section 228 may not go far

enough. The ambit of section 228 may not cover the

specific  situations that we are  faced  with,  be

cause  it  says, "- a public servant... sitting  in

any  stage of a judicial proceeding". It could  be

argued  by  any  lawyer that persons  standing  on

benches and showing their rears to a magistrate as

he  came  into his court were not covered  by  the

words  of  section 228. If this  is  so,  then  of

course  the  amended section 368 of  the  Criminal

Procedure Code will not come into play. This would

stultify what we are trying to do and I would urge

that  section  228  of the Penal  Code  itself  be

looked into by the officials concerned with a view

to extending its ambit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that it is

very  important  indeed that  the  procedures  and

processes of the judiciary, being one of the three

main pillars on which the democratic structure  of

the Republic of Singapore rests,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>

are  not brought into ridicule and contempt, which

is  what certain political groups have been trying

to  do  to  show the people of Singapore that  the

institutions of our State are not worth supporting

and  that they do not represent the people at all.

These  groups  seek to subvert and jeopardise  the

whole fabric of political life in our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

The  Minister  has just introduced this  amendment

Bill  and  I lend my full support to it. First  of

all,  one  must  know that the Criminal  Procedure

Code is one of the basic laws of our country. This

is  not  a  minor  Act,  unlike  other  subsidiary

legislation. So this law should be made  effective

in  order to achieve the purpose for which  it  is

intended.  It is possible that in other  countries

where  there  is a different but ideal  system  to

achieve  the purposes intended, there is  no  need

for such a law. They may have precedents and other

systems. They can still import some legal  aspects

into  their  systems,  but  they  are  limited  in

personnel to implement the same law. But Singapore

is  in a different situation. We have a democratic

system  and our laws are based on long traditions.

We  should  try to help the Minister  perfect  our

existing laws to suit our present situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent past, certain anti-national

elements tried to disrupt law and order, but  they

could  not achieve their purpose. The laws of  our

country are intended to benefit the people but not

to  restrict  or suppress them unreasonably.  This

amendment Bill imposes only a minor penalty on the

anti-national elements. What is important  in  law

is  that  there should be a clear-cut  demarcation

between penalty and reward



-  what  merits penalty and what merits reward.  A

$50  fine  may  be  too small a sum  to  have  any

deterrent  effect. We have read in the  newspapers

of  events  taking  place in  Hongkong  and  other

places. When a riot or civil commotion is  at  its

height,  the people involved will go to the  court

and  write slogans on the walls. Of course, we are

not involved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



in  this at the moment, but we should take  action

to  forestall such incidents taking place  in  our

country.  There  should be certain  limits  within

which  activities can be carried out  outside  the

courts.  The  law  should not allow  anti-national

elements  to go beyond these limits. So  they  now

turn  on the law itself. This is a situation  that

we  cannot  allow to be perpetuated. We should  at

least  improve our present law in order to prevent

such occurrences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress one point. Singapore is a

democratic country, but it does not mean  that  we

should weaken the rule of law. That is not what we

want,  if the anti-national elements want to avail

themselves  of  our democratic system  to  further

their  nefarious ends, then I stress that the  law

should  not allow them opportunities to do  things

for  their  own enjoyment. What is wrong  must  be

wrong.  There must be a clear demarcation  between

right  and  wrong.  We must  first  lay  a  strong

foundation  in our task of nation building.  Every

nail  should  be  hammered down  securely  in  its

proper place. So now and then we must keep an  eye

on  our  law  and adjust it to meet  any  possible

situation. It does not mean that an increase of  a

$50  fine  to a $500 fine is the imposition  of  a

very  heavy  penalty. The fine  is  increased  ten

times. This ratio indicates that the demand is now

tenfold for more perfect laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of what I have said, I give my full

support to this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose

of this amendment Bill is to increase the power of

the  Subordinate  Courts to punish  offenders  for

contempt  committed  in the  face  of  the  court.

Section 368 of the Criminal Procedure Code,  which

this  Bill  now  seeks to amend,  confers  special

powers  on the Courts, other than the High  Court,

to  deal  summarily  with five kinds  of  contempt

under the Penal Code. These five kinds of contempt

have been briefly referred to by my colleague, the

Member  for Bukit Panjang, and I need not go  into

them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to draw the Minister's attention

to  section  228 of the Penal Code which  provides

for  the  punishment of intentional insults  to  a

public  servant sitting in any stage of a judicial

proceeding.  If  the Minister's  intention  is  to

prevent a recurrence of what took place in one  of

our  Courts in June this year, section 228 of  the

Penal  Code  may have to be looked  into  and,  if

necessary,  amended. What happened  in  the  Ninth

Magistrate's  Court in June this year  was,  as  I

gather  from  the Press, that the accused  persons

deliberately  insulted the Magistrate  by  turning

their  backs towards him when he entered the court

room  to  start the proceedings. If that was  what

happened, the present wording of section  228  may

give  rise  to legal arguments as to whether  such

insults  were  offered while  the  Magistrate  was

sitting in any stage of a judicial proceeding. The

words of section 228 of the Penal Code are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whoever intentionally offers any insult or

causes  any  interruption to any  public  servant,

while  such public servant is sitting in any stage

of  a  judicial proceeding shall be punished  with

imprisonment  for a term which may extend  to  six

months,  or  with  fine which may  extend  to  one

thousand

dollars, or with both.'



<br><br>The  operative words are "is sitting in any  stage

of  a judicial proceeding". Does the very entrance

of a Magistrate into the court house constitute  a

sitting  in  any  stage of a judicial  proceeding?

These  are  the thoughts I have on this  amendment

Bill  -  thoughts  that came to my  mind  in  what

little  time  I  had during the  tea-break  to  do

research. I am glad that my colleague, the  Member

for  Bukit Panjang, agrees with me and appears  to

have  the  same thoughts. I commend these thoughts

to the Minister for his consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that the purpose

of  this  amendment is to prevent a recurrence  of

the  disgraceful spectacle that took place in  our

lower Court in June this year. This is a necessary

measure and I am sure that nobody either inside or

outside   this  House  will  disagree   with   it.

Consequently, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



Speaker, Sir, I support this amendment Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there

is  a  consensus of opinion among Members of  this

House   that  we  should  bring  about  sufficient

deterrent   to   prevent  any  contempt   of   the

judiciary. In fact, some Members have gone so  far

as to say that the penalties should be increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that not only Members

of  this  House  feel that we should  prevent  any

contempt  or ridicule of the judiciary,  but  also

members  of the public do feel the same about  it,

because, as has been said by the Member for  Bukit

Panjang, this attempt to ridicule the court is not

the  result  of  a  desire to  commit  a  criminal

offence  but  is purely for political motives.  At

this  stage  when all of us are concentrating  our

energies  on our work and the public has  accepted

the  fact  that  we  must, in  order  to  survive,

discipline  ourselves, it therefore  goes  against

public  sentiment  to allow a small  anti-national

group to bring ridicule into our courts of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the technical points referred to by

the  Member for Bukit Pan jang and the Member  for

Choa Chu Kang, I can only say that, as a layman, I

will  give  this amendment a trial. I feel  I  can

depend  on  the wisdom of the magistrates  in  the

subordinate  courts to apply the law and  that  it

would  not be difficult -- here again, I will  not

get into a legal argument with the Member for Choa

Chu  Kang - for a magistrate to call the  court  to

order,  if that is the right term, as soon  as  he

comes  in.  But  if these people still  insist  on

behaving as before, the court could be said to  be

sitting  in  proceeding when he enters the  court,

and the law will be put into effect.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

Hon. Members will recall that consequent to an

Oral Question raised in this House at its sitting

on the 20th December last year by the Member for

Bras Basah on the Moneylenders Ordinance, 1959. 1

stated that consideration would be given to amend

the Ordinance. The Bill before the House

accordingly gives effect to Government's

intentions in this regard,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, exemptions have been granted under

section 2 of the Moneylenders Ordinance, 1959, far

too  freely to any body corporate or society which

applied to be exempted from the provisions of  the

Ordinance.  This  practice has been  found  to  be

undesirable  and will be discontinued.  Clauses  2

and  9  accordingly empower the Minister to impose

conditions when granting exemptions in future  and

initially restrict the period of exemption  for  a

period  of  three years. Any body corporate  which

has  been  exempted  up  to  the  time  that  this

legislation comes into force will continue  to  be

so  exempted until the end of this year. Thereupon

it follows that such bodies corporate will have to

apply for future exemptions to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many borrowers complain that they receive from

their moneylenders smaller sums of money than  the

amounts  they  were  made  to  sign  for  on   the

promissory notes. Subsection (2) of section 16  of

the   Ordinance,  which  attempts  to  remedy  the

situation by requiring the moneylender to issue  a

crossed  cheque,  a  crossed postal  order,  or  a

crossed  money order niade payable to the borrower

if the loan is $100 or above, has been found to be

inadequate,  as  moneylenders can  with  a  little

ingenuity evade the provisions of the subsection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 proposes to remedy the situation by

requiring moneylenders to make a loan of $100 or

above in the form of a crossed cheque with the

words "Licensed Moneylender" endorsed thereon. Any

moneylender or his agent shall not present to any

bank account any crossed cheque drawn by another

moneylender or his agent and made payable to a

borrower - sub-clause (3) . By sub-clause (4) a

person who is not a moneylender shall not present

to any bank more than two of such crossed cheques

in any one month. A bank manager may be required

to furnish information to the Public Prosecutor to

facilitate the identification of any person

suspected of having committed an offence under

this clause, having an account with his bank -

subclause (5).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 requires a moneylender to afford the

Registrar  access  to the cheques  issued  by  him

which  have  been  cleared  and  to  any  note  or

memorandum  setting out a contract  in  which  the

moneylender is or has been concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 is an important provision, for it

requires   moneylenders  to   endorse   on   their

promissory notes the amounts of money they receive

from  their borrowers immediately after  receiving

such  repayments.  A penalty is provided  for  con

travention of this provision. This clause seeks to

remedy  the  usual complaint that moneylenders  do

not  give receipts for or make any records of  the

sums  they receive from their borrowers on account

of  principal or interest. And it further provides

that  if a moneylender has been convicted of  such

an  offence,  he  will be unable  to  enforce  the

contract for the recovery of any monies due to him

from the borrower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, by sub-clause (6) , the court is

empowered to endorse details of such conviction on

the  note  or  memorandum. This should effectively

prevent  the moneylender from suing in  more  than

one court on the note or memorandum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 is also an important amendment, for it

proposes  to  make  it a seizable  offence  for  a

moneylender  to  watch or beset the  residence  or

place of business or employment of a debtor with a

view to harassing or intimidating him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of this amending Bill should not

give   rise   to   any   objection   from   honest

moneylenders.  It is, however, designed  to  deter

dishonest moneylenders from continuing the harmful

and   unfair  practices  that  have  come  to  the

attention of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill is designed  on

the basis of experience derived from the operation

of  the  Moneylenders Ordinance of 1959 to tighten

up  provisions  and to make it more difficult  for

moneylenders to evade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



those  provisions.  Any  Bill  so  designed   must

receive  support  from  all except  the  dishonest

moneylenders  who  are regarded  by  many  as  the

unavoidable parasites of society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly welcome the proposal to make it a

seizable  offence for a moneylender to harass  his

debtors  at  home  or  at  the  office.  All   too

frequently we see on pay day the furtive departure

and  sneaky  homecoming of  poor  victims  in  the

clutches  of the moneylenders. Many of these  poor

souls  fell  prey to the moneylenders  through  no

fault  of  their  own, as they  had  sometimes  to

borrow money because of family sickness and  other

misfortunes.  These  unfortunate  people  must  be

protected   from   the   excessive   demands   and

harassment by moneylenders.

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are aware, the Public Authorities

Protection Ordinance of 1912 provided, inter alia,

that  legal proceedings against public authorities

should  not  lie  unless instituted  within  three

months  after  the  act, neglect  or  default  com

plained  of. This Ordinance remained in  operation

in  Singapore until 1955 when it was  repealed  by

the   Public   Authorities   Protection   (Repeal)

Ordinance.  The  object  of  the  repeal  was   to

assimilate   the  law  applicable  to  proceedings

against public authorities with that applicable in

other   cases,   with  the  result   that   public

authorities   ceased  to  enjoy   any   privileged

position  in  litigation.  The  repeal  was   also

designed to bring our law in line with the law  in

the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the formation of Malaysia, the Public

Authorities   Protection   Ordinance,   1948,   of

Malaysia   was  extended  to  Singapore   by   the

Modification  of Laws (Government Proceedings  and

Public  Authorities  Protection)  (Extension   and

Modification) Order, 1965, made under the Malaysia

Act on the 25th of February, 1965. This Orthnance,

which still operates in Singapore, provides, inter

alia,  that  actions  against  public  authorities

shall be commenced within 12 months next after the

act,   neglect  or  default  complained   of.   In

consequence of the independence of Singapore  upon

separation   from  Malaysia,  it   is   considered

desirable  that the Public Authorities  Protection

Ordinance, 1948, of Malaysia should cease to apply

to Singapore and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



that  we  revert  to  the position  where  the  law

applicable    to    proceedings   against    public

authorities is similar to that in other cases.  The

Bill now before the House seeks to do this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, several projects are under

consideration   for   making   Singapore   a   more

attractive   tourist  centre.  Tourism   has   vast

untapped  potentials  which we  are  determined  to

exploit  to  the full. This reclamation,  which  in

volves an area of about 104 acres of foreshore  and

sea-bed  fronting  Haw Par  Villa,  is  part  of  a

development   scheme  estimated   to   cost   about

$414,000. The reclaimed land, together with a small

area of adjoining State land, will be developed  to

provide  tourist  amenities  such  as  night-clubs,

restaurants  and shops and will be an embellishment

to the already well-established and popular Haw Par

Villa.  It is envisaged that the development,  when

completed, will give a further boost to our rapidly

growing tourist industry.

<div align="center"><b>AND PUBLIC PLACES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the subject matter I propose to raise  today

on  the  Motion  for  the  Adjournment  is  not  a

pleasant  one. But, nevertheless, it is  a  matter

and  a  problem which most people face and  suffer

daily.  I  refer  to  the  filthy  and  unhygienic

conditions of the toilet facilities in most of the

Republic's    coffee   shops,    eating    houses,

restaurants  and  public conveniences  which  have

been  allowed  to  continue under  such  unhealthy

conditions for such a long time. Mr Speaker, Sir,

this will certainly not attract tourism. Are we to

remain complacent and tolerate such filthy and unhygienic    conditions   indefinitely?    It    is

acknowledged  that  we  have  one  of   the   best

standards of health in this part of the world. Are

we   not  going  to  maintain  and  improve   this

standard?  Toilet  facilities  are  one   of   the

essential  items  which is being used  daily.  Yet

most  coffee  shops, eating houses and  restaurant

owners   pay   very  little  concern   for   their

cleanliness.   In   quite  a   number   of   these

establishments,  the  water  closets   have   been

deliberately  jammed and spoilt in order  to  save

water expenses. I need not describe the untidiness

of  the  water  closets  in these  public  places.

Members will undoubtedly have faced the situation.

In  quite a number of these public places, food is

also  being  prepared for consumption adjacent  to

these  filthy lavatories. So far the Public Health

Division  has  had no effective  control  of  this

problem. It is appreciated that effective  control

may  be  difficult because it would need  a  large

force to police these establishments. But are they

not operating on licences issued by the Health



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  under regulations with which they  would

have  to  comply? There is now a campaign to  keep

Singapore  clean.  We  want to  make  Singapore  a

clean,  fragrant  and attractive  garden  city.  A

poster   competition   is   being   organised   in

conjunction  with the campaign. Enormous  sums  of

State  money are being spent to level off roadside

ways, plant trees and flowers to make the Republic

attractive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from next year we were told that a $5 fine

will be imposed on a householder not in possession

of  a  dustbin. There will also be a  campaign  to

select   the  cleanest,  best-kept  and  organised

community centre in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, health education and effective

control is needed to remedy this problem. So  long

as  filthy  and  unhygienic conditions  of  toilet

facilities  in  coffee shops,  eating  houses  and

restaurants  are  permitted  to  continue,  it  is

incompatible with the efforts now being pursued to

make Singapore a clean garden city.



<br><br>6.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I am grateful to  the  Member  for

River  Valley for raising this subject for  debate

and  drawing attention to what he has called  "the

filthy   conditions  of  toilet   facilities"   in

licensed  premises selling coffee,  eating  houses

and  restaurants  besides public places.  He  has,

however,  been  fair  to  indicate  that   it   is

acknowledged  that  we  do  have  a  fairly   high

standard  of  health in this country  as  compared

with  that of neighbouring territories - not  that

we  should  be satisfied and complacent with  that

statement,  because  we  can  always  improve   on

present standards to bring them to a higher level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, however, indicate certain difficulties

which  are  being encountered in the  Ministry  of

Health. Perhaps much more can be done and a higher

standard  of  cleanliness  can  be  maintained  in

Singapore  if the social habits of our people  are

of  a  high order. I think it is well known  that,

unfortunately, such a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



standard of social behaviour is certainly  lacking

amongst  large sections of the public.  Take,  for

example,  public places like parks, the  Esplanade

and places where people congregate together. There

is  a  very  shocking  lack of  dustbins  in  such

places.  We  do  not  even see  a  single  dustbin

around.  Nowhere  else in the world  does  such  a

situation exist. This means that the thousands who

do  go to these places for entertainment are liter

ally  being  invited  to throw  their  litter  and

rubbish on the ground and make it a filthy  place.

If  it  is an accepted form of behaviour  just  to

throw  litter  around, then when they  go  to  the

water  closet, especially if it is a public  water

closet,  they just do their business anywhere  and

care nothing about it. It is very difficult indeed

to  get  public health inspectors prowling  around

parks to catch people throwing litter, or prowling

near  water closets to make sure that the man  who

has  gone in to do his business will go on  to  do

the needful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say, Sir, that it may take some time to

educate   our  population  to  behave  themselves.

Perhaps  we  will  have  to  start  off  with  our

children in schools and teach them to have  better

health  habits  - habits of personal  hygiene  and

good  habits  of  not throwing litter  around.  Of

course, we should have more litter bins, and  this

is going to be done very soon. We shall be placing

at  least 2,500 litter bins in bus shelters and in

parks. That is the first lesson. We cannot provide

20,000   litter   bins  because  the   expenditure

involved will be considerable. But we are making a

start and it is very likely that very soon we will

be able to maintain a campaign of higher standards

of  public  health with poster competitions,  with

public  health lessons being introduced  into  the

schools  curriculum and so on, so that  ultimately

we will have not only young children playing their

part  but  they will be telling their  elders  who

have filthy habits to behave themselves at home as

well as in public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this will take some time. But that is not an

excuse.  If  the  Ministry's officials  should  be

failing   in  their  duties  to  inspect  licensed

premises, as stated by the Member for River Valley -  here  again  there are problems concerning  the

volume  of  work involved. There are in  Singapore

today  close  to  1,900  licensed  eating  houses,

restaurants  and coffee shops. We  have  a  Public

Health  Inspectorate  of  under  100.  They   are,

therefore,  expected to inspect licensed  premises

once  a month. For the first eight months of  this

year,  as many as 12,738 visits have been made  by

the Public Health Inspectorate. Of this number, on

344  occasions - three per cent of their visits  - they  did  find  that  the toilets  of  the  1,900

licensed  premises were in a filthy condition.  It

is then the duty of the Public Health Inspector to

tell  the  proprietor  to do something  about  his

toilet, to keep it in a clean state, flush it, and

so  on, and to return a few days later to see that

the  work is done. It has been found that in  most

cases  the proprietors do comply. It has not  been

found  necessary so far to cancel any licence  for

failure to clean the toilets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley has indicated that

there   has  been  deliberate  jamming  of   water

connections in water closets. When this arises and

if  a  specific report is made to us, we shall  be

able  to  follow it up and put matters right.  But

where  the coffee shop or eating house is situated

in  a  strategic place, like being close to a bus-stop,  or  near  public places  of  entertainment,

there  is  a  tendency for gross over-use  of  the

toilet  facilities, because members of the  public

just  walk  into the shops concerned  and  relieve

themselves but do nothing about it, and  therefore

mess up the place. So some shopkeepers have become

so desperate that they have decided to lock up the

water  closets.  When  this  was  brought  to  our

knowledge, we naturally had to tell the proprietor

that   he  could  not  just  lock  up  the  public

convenience  and that he should  open  it.  It  is

possible  that  in certain cases, the  proprietors

were  so  desperate  about the over-use  of  their

water closets that they thought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



that  by closing the water connections the  toilet

would be so filthy that people would not make  use

of  it. But l am afraid that is not exactly what is

happening, because people still do their  business

and make things worse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would prefer that this question be tackled in

a  different  way.  It is no  use  just  making  a

sweeping  statement that everything is filthy  and

what can we do about it, and so on. Naturally, the

answer will be, "Of course, we will try to do  the

best  we  can."  But  surely the  problem  can  be

tackled in this way. If a Member of Parliament  or

a  member  of  the  public  knows  of  the  filthy

conditions of a particular shop, he can just  give

us  a note to that effect, and we will be able  to

follow  it up and rectify the situation.  We  will

then be tackling specific instances, whether it is

in   the   River   Valley  Constituency,   Punggol

Constituency or Jurong Constituency, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about Geylang West?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Geylang West is very well

behaved, because it is the first constituency that

has  had its hawkers licensed and resited. Hawkers

on the five-foot ways have been cleared. About 200

hawkers  over  a  stretch of 100 yards  outside  a

market  in  Lorong  Taha dispersed  of  their  own

accord.   They   took   down  their   unauthorised

structures  and got everything nicely  reallocated

in  Lorongs  5  and  7. The drains  were  cleared;

mosquitoes got less; there were less flies. Surely

Geylang  West is now a model constituency for  any

Member of Parliament to come along to see!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one little correction which I have to

make.  The  Member for River Valley has said  that

there will be a $5 fine for a householder who  has

no  dustbin. I am afraid he has got it all  wrong.

The  penalty will not be just $5 - it will be very

punitive.  What  we say is this. We  expect  every

householder, whether he stays in the  kampongs  of

Sembawang  or  urban areas like  Geylang  West  or

Anson  or Tanjong Pagar, to provide a dust-bin  of

his own. But should some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



householders be found without a dustbin,  we  will

have  to  give them adequate notice saying,  "Look

here,  we find that you have no dust-bin. Can  you

please  provide a dust-bin within seven days,  let

us  say, or else we will provide you with one  and

charge you for it? It might be $5, or it might  be

$10  for  the dustbin." But we are going to  amend

our legislation so that there will be a very heavy

penalty  for  people who just throw  rubbish  from

their  houses on to the roads and into the drains.

The  first offence will be $150, not $5  which  is

chicken feed. The second offence will be $500. The

third one will be $1,000. The social habits of our

people - mainly the hawkers - are bad because they

are  irresponsible, and that is what is  happening

today.  Hawkers  are  only  interested  in  making

money.  We  like  them  to  be  able  to  earn   a

livelihood, but the way in which they throw  their

refuse  on to the roads and into the drains  is  a

ridiculous state of affairs which has  got  to  be

stopped.  When  we go along the  streets,  we  see

people  sweeping refuse into the drains as if  the

drains  are  dust-bins.  We  have  to  stop   this

nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with this new legislation, we will be able to

bring  home to our people the fact that they  have

to  learn how to dispose of their refuse properly,

by placing it in a dust-bin with a proper lid. Our

workers  will then be expected to perform a  daily

cleansing  service,  and if  that  does  not  come

about,  please  give us a report and  disciplinary

action   will  be  taken  against  the  particular

cleansing worker who fails to do his duty. We will

therefore  have,  as a first  stage,  to  get  our

workers in the Public Cleansing Department  to  do

their  work.  I think we have reached  that  stage

now.  The second stage is to get the public to  do

their  share of putting their refuse inside proper

dust-bins,  failing which we will  have  to  be  a

little   hard  on  theni  if  they  cannot  behave

themselves. There is every possibility that within

the next few months, things will be tightening  up

and that there will be more cleanliness around the

city. In fact, it must be admitted that things are

looking  better than before. The city is certainly

much cleaner



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



now  than before the February strike. As we  begin

to  tighten  up supervision of our  work  force  -

whether in public cleansing or even in the  Public

Health   inspectorate  who  go  round   inspecting

licensed premises - we should be able, with the co-

operation  of  the  public,  to  bring   about   a

situation  to  which we are all  looking  forward,

that is, our Singapore can be a garden city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful, therefore, to the Member for

River Valley for having brought up this matter  so

that  I  am able to impress upon the Public Health

Inspectorate  that they must do much  better  than

what they have done in the past.

We expect them to make more frequent

visits,  more  than  just once  a  month,  and  to

maintain a much cleaner atmosphere not only in the

lavatories  of  eating  shops,  coffee  shops  and

restaurants, but even in the premises  themselves.

By  next  year,  we  should see less  flies,  less

mosquitoes and breathe less smell.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the

Minister  for  Finance if he will consider  asking

shopkeepers  to  display price tags  on  important

consumer goods such as rice, sugar, flour, etc.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The increase in

the  price of rice in Singapore has been due to  a

general  increase in prices of rice in  the  world

market.  There  is adequate rice in Singapore  and

the retail price of rice in Singapore, although it

has  been  higher  than in  the  past,  is  mainly

determined by the supply and demand of  the  world

market for rice, since Singapore produces no  rice

of its own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the increase in the price of rice, the

prices  of  sugar, flour, cooking  oil  and  other

essential   commodities   have   not   shown   any

substantial increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore no pressing need to ask

shopkeepers to display price tags. Apart from  the

fact  that  price tags do not serve a very  useful

purpose,  in  view of the grades  of  the  various

commodities  concerned, especially that  of  rice,

such  a  display  of price tags  may  mislead  the

public to think that there is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



shortage of these essential commodities,  and  may

unnecessarily   cause  a  rush  to   hoard   these

commodities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements, however, are being made to

broadcast  twice daily in the four  languages  the

average  price  of rice, sugar,  wheat  flour  and

other essential commodities.

<div align="center"><b>PIONEER INDUSTRIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for

Finance (a) how many firms have been given pioneer

status since 9th August, 1965, and how many  firms

which had been accorded pioneer status have closed

down  or  terminated business  since  9th  August.

1965; and (b) why pioneer status has been given to

many  firms in the same industry, such as the four

firms in the plywood industry, and whether this is

not harmful to the promotion of local industries.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Since Singapore Day on 9th

August, 1965, 73 pioneer certificates were awarded

to  firms, making a total of 187 pioneer companies

to  date.  12 of these firms had to abandon  their

projects  for  various reasons.  One  because  the

owner fell seriously ill. Several others which are

textile  mills  had  to  close  down  because   of

imposition of textile quotas by the U.K, and  the

U.S.  Governments and the rest because  the  major

shareholders could not agree among themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has in its industrial promotion

efforts  put  particular  emphasis  on  industries

which  show  promise  of high export  performance.

Thus,  in a number of cases more than one  pioneer

certificate has been issued in the same  industry.

In   most   of  these  cases,  a  minimum   export

performance  is  a condition of  the  award  of  a

pioneer  certificate. In the case of  the  plywood

industry,  any one of the firms would be  able  to

supply  the  entire  local  demand.  However,  the

export  potential of this industry is  very  great

and, therefore, the Government has thought it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



fit to award more than one pioneer certificate  in

order  to encourage this type of export-orientated

industry.  Ours  is essentially a free  enterprise

economy and if there is no profit to be made in an

industry, investors would not be prepared to  risk

their  money in starting a factory when  there  is

already  another  factory in  production.  If  the

investor  is  convinced that it is worthwhile  for

him to risk his money in an industry and if he can

convince   us   that  he  has  sufficient   export

possibilities, we are prepared to grant a  pioneer

certificate even if there are other firms  in  the

industry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for

Law  and National Development whether his Ministry

will  publish  a pamphlet with a map  showing  the

areas  in Singapore subject to flood at times  (a)

when  there  is  heavy rain, (b) when  heavy  rain

coincides with high tides, and containing guidance

on  alternative  routes to  persons  who  normally

travel  through  such areas; and whether  he  will

request  the  assistance of  the  Commissioner  of

Police  and the Director of Broadcasting in  order

to   give  early  warning  on  flooded  areas  and

frequent  guidance on alternative routes at  times

of  flood so that workers and school children will

not  be delayed on their way to or from places  of

work and school.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> The Ministry of

National Development has prepared maps showing the

areas  affected by floods early this year and  the

depths  of  the  floods.  These  maps  have   been

circulated  to the Ministry of Education  and  the

Ministry   of  the  Interior  and  Defence.   This

information,  if necessary, could be published  in

the  form  of a pamphlet for the guidance  of  the

general public. However, a pamphlet alone would be

inadequate to alleviate problems caused by floods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Commissioner of Police and the Director

of  Broadcasting have assisted in past  floods  in

giving early warning on flooded areas and guidance

on alternative routes at times of floods. Even the

Army  has assisted by transporting school children

in  badly affected area. However, these are only

flood relief measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real answer to the problem is to eradicate

flooding completely. This is a difficult task  but

is being attended to. In fact several projects are

being  undertaken to eradicate or reduce  flooding

in  certain areas, like the cutting of two  canals

in two phases from Bukit Timah Road to deviate the

storm waters to Ulu Pandan and Kallang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and National Development what industries or trades

affected by the urban renewal and the Golden  Mile

schemes   are   relocated  in  the   Tanjong   Rhu

Resettlement Area.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> The industries or trades

affected by the urban redevelopment and the Golden

Mile  Project which are relocated in the Tan  jong

Rhu  Resettlement Area are those which require  to

be sited near the water-front. These include boat-

builders, charcoal and firewood importers and such

obnoxious  industries  or  trades  as  wooden  box

makers,  and blending and re-packing of black  oil

and other wood preservative oils.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National Development whether he is  aware  of

the  existing facilities of a boatel near the sea-

front  at  Kallang  Park,  and  whether  he   will

consider  including boating and yachting amenities

in  the new redevelopment projects for tourism  in

Kallang Park earmarked for private development.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Yes, I am aware that there is

an existing boatel operating near the sea-front at

Kallang Park on a Temporary Occupation Licence  at

which boats can be moored, serviced or hired.  The

operator is also a distributor of outboard  motors

and  accessories. Boating and ferry  service  faci

lities   are  being  included  in  the   "Floating

Restaurant  Project", one of the 4  sites  in  the

Kallang  Park offered for lease by tender  by  the

Government.

<div align="center"><b>WAREHOUSE FACILITIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development whether the  Government

will  consider  providing more facilities  in  the

suburbs   or  near  industrial  areas  to   enable

commercial   houses  or  local   distributors   of

merchandise to rebuild their warehouse affected by

the  urban  renewal  development,  as  warehousing

forms  an  integral part of the entrepot trade  of

the Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> I would like to assure the

Honourable Member that my Ministry has indeed been

looking  into  various possibilities of  providing

more warehouse facilities both in the suburbs  and

near  industrial areas to enable commercial houses

and   distributors  of  merchandise  to   relocate

warehouse  affected by urban renewal. The  problem

is  not  a simple one as the site selected  should

ideally  be  close  to  the  harbour  and  railway

station  and preferably not too far from  business

centres  for  easy  and  cheap  transportation  of

goods.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More investigations and feasibility studies are

being undertaken by the Urban Renewal Department.

Eventually, land may have to be reclaimed from

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



sea along Pasir Panjang to provide a warehouse

zone that will be generally acceptable. In the

meantime, existing warehouses which are affected

by urban renewal are given priority wherever

alternative sites are available.
