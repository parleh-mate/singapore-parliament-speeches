<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Finance who

advises  Government-owned  and  Government-linked  companies  on

acquisitions and investments.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  Government-linked  companies,  like  all   other

companies,  have their own managements and boards  of  directors

and  they decide on acquisitions and investments.  If necessary,

they may seek the advice of investment banks or consultants.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask

the  Minister, particularly in the case which we were discussing

yesterday  when  Question Time came to  an  end,  in  regard  to

Micropolis,  from whom did this company seek any advice,  if  it

did, that is, before Singapore Technologies acquired Micropolis?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Although I could not finish the

Oral  Answer  in  Parliament, I think the full answer  has  been

circulated to all Members, including Mr Jeyaretnam.  And just to

recap,   they   consulted  their  own  investment  bankers   and

professional consultants before the decision was made, and  this

was made clear in my answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I know who finally makes the decision

for Singapore Technologies?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Can I suggest that he reads my

answer?  It is the Board of Singapore Technologies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May we know from the Minister: is the

Cabinet at all informed or consulted before Government-owned and

Government-linked   companies  take  over   or   acquire   other

businesses?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The answer is no. In a general

response  to his question, there is a Ministerial Committee  set

up  to  oversee  very large investments exceeding  $500  million

acquisitions,  and  this is chaired by  DPM  Lee,  Minister  for

Finance  is a member of the Committee, DPM Tony Tan  is  also  a

member, the Minister for Trade and Industry and BG Yeo are  also

members.   But  this Committee only concerns  itself  with  very

large acquisitions of $500 million or more and particularly with

reference  to overseas investments where  there may be political

overtones.  Other than that, the companies themselves have their

own  boards  and  they  are responsible  for  making  their  own

decisions  on  a  commercial basis.   It  is  not  feasible  for

Government  to nanny every company it owns.  Do not forget  that

Temasek  Holdings,  which is a Government-holding  company,  has

shareholders'  funds totalling $34 billion,  and  it  is  making

profits  averaging $1.6 billion per year over the last 10  years

and  it  includes a huge stable of companies of large size,  eg,

SIA, DBS, and so forth, and they all have responsible boards who

take  investment  decisions on their own after  consulting  with

their professional advisers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  Minister on the issue of Micropolis.  The loss, I  believe,

in  the  reply  he gave me yesterday, amounts to  about  half  a

billion  dollars.  I would like to ask whether any of  these  is

coming  from CPF or is it some other source that has drawn  into

our reserves.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The answer is no. The acquisition

was funded from ST's internal resources plus bank loans.  So CPF

is not involved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether after it was

decided to wind up Micropolis, a statement was made or a  report

was  submitted  to  this Ministerial Committee  to  examine  the

acquisition of Micropolis by Singapore Technologies?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The position has been reviewed by

the  holding  company, which is Temasek Holdings,  and  that  is

where the matter rests.  No report has been made to Cabinet, nor

is it required.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It may not be required. But if you have a

Ministerial Committee, is it not the function of the Ministerial

Committee, chaired as he said by BG Lee, to inquire closely into

huge  losses  suffered by Government-owned companies?   Here  we

have a case of half a billion dollars gone down the drain.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The Ministerial Committee, as I

explained   earlier,   is  basically  responsible   for   making

acquisitions and would of course be interested in the details of

any  major losses which Temasek would in due course, after their

own  study,  advise.  However, I would like to  point  out  that

although in absolute terms, the loss looks very large, the sizes

of  the  operations are also huge and our companies  anyway  are

venturing into the high-tech areas.  I think you should  realise

that  the  nature  of the business is highly volatile  and  very

capital-intensive, and if you are going to be in  that  business

at  all, you have to accept the consequences.  I will refer  you

to  a  report  - I think it was yesterday or before  yesterday's

papers  - about Seagate, the largest disk drive company  in  the

world,  incurring  a first quarter loss of over  US$300  million

because  of  the downturn in this business.  So  the  nature  of

business  requires high risk, you make money,  you  lose  money.

But  overall,  Temasek group of companies has been  accumulating

assets  at  a rate of, as I mentioned earlier, $1.6 billion  per

year  over the last 10 years and without drawing on Government's

equity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> A final question, Mr Speaker, Sir. Is the

Minister  saying  then  that even  if  there  is  a  high  risk,

Government-owned companies will still go into the acquisition or

take-over, in the hope that they can turn round the company  and

make  profits?   We  are  dealing  with  people's  money.    The

companies are trustees.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> That is the nature of a business

decision.   Either  you do it or you don't.  Would  he  like  to

suggest  an  alternative?  Perhaps he would like  to  vet  every

decision made by Government companies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I should have thought that was obvious.

There  should  be  a  proper  committee,  not  chaired  just  by

Ministers  but also by public people who know about investments,

to  advise  the Government-owned companies and Government-linked

companies on acquisitions and take-overs.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> People like himself who knows about

business investments?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I would ask the Minister not to be

personal.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> No. What I am saying is ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am saying you could, could you not? You

have  BG  Lee  and his wife, I take it, is the Chairman  of  the

Board ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, I thought you said that

was your final question.  Have you any other questions?  If not,

Dr Lee.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Is it correct then to

assume that except for these very large investments of over $500

million,   to   all   intents  and  purposes,  Government-linked

companies  run  and  operate like commercial  companies  in  the

private sector?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Indeed, that must be the case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  ask  the Minister whether he would give an assurance  to  the

House that despite Micropolis, the Government will not get  cold

feet  and will go on investing where there is a possibility that

the public fund will benefit from investment, because there is a

perception  that because of Micropolis, the Government  may  get

cold  feet.  I would like to have an assurance to this House  by

the  Minister  that  despite  Micropolis,  he  will  make  sound

investment where he thinks it will benefit the economy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> We do not take fright from Members'

criticisms.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> One final question. From the lesson

that  we have learned from Micropolis, have we put in place  any

additional  safeguards to ensure that such future  problems  are

avoided,  although  I  do support that  we  should  continue  to

participate   in   these   high-risk,   high-return   types   of

investments?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am afraid there are no safeguards

against  business  risks.  You have to make your  judgement  and

take  your punishment or your rewards accordingly.  I would just

like  to  remind him that in assessing Singapore's  investments,

whether  you  lose or gain, you take a long view.  I  have  said

again  and again that over the last 10 years, in aggregate,  the

companies   have   made  substantial  profits   and   added   to

Government's  coffers.  That should ultimately be the  criteria,

not criticisms or critics on individual investments.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Is there a sense now, because of what

happened  with Micropolis, that Government-linked companies  are

subject  to  greater public accountability and  public  scrutiny

than private sector companies?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Indeed, this must be the sense and

therefore  I would assume that the management of these companies

would take this into account.  It must be so.  In fact, it  acts

as  a  check of sorts that they are aware that they are  dealing

with public money.  It makes them a little more cautious and  it

also may make them more risk-averse.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Is it not there in a sense then a sort

of fundamental dilemma with Government-linked companies because,

on  the  one  hand, you do want them to be publicly  accountable

and,  on the other hand, you do want them to be entrepreneurial,

and  for  that you would indeed have to take risk, and when  you

take risk, there is indeed a risk of failure?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Indeed, that is true. There is a

fundamental dilemma.  In fact, a desirable outcome would be  for

the Government to divest itself fully of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



companies  with  commercial activities, and that  is  still  our

intention  over  the long term.  But many of our new  companies,

particularly  the  statutory boards which are being  privatised,

require a period of nurturing, so to speak, before they are  let

loose  completely.   But over time, companies,  like  SIA,  DBS,

other than policy considerations, should be entirely privatised.

And this still remains our long term objective.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> If indeed that is the longer term

objective, would it be possible for the Minister to outline what

actually  are  the criteria for these companies to be  divested?

Perhaps  then  they  could  be divested  earlier  because  these

criteria can be satisfied.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The only companies which Government

would  want to retain de facto controlling interest are defence-related companies.  Other than that, the other purely commercial

companies  have  not  been divested completely  over  the  years

because  of  their  huge size.  It would be  very  difficult  to

unload Government shareholdings overnight without disrupting the

market.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> If it is because of the huge size, would

it  not be possible actually to break them down into small bits,

so that the private sector can then chew on them?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Yes and no. How do we break

Singapore Telecom or Singapore Power into little bits?   We  can

do  it  within  limits,  but to divide  a  company  as  huge  as

Singapore  Telecom  into little bits so that  they  become  more

digestible may not be very easy.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Finance why

there are no accounts made available to Parliament annually of

all investments made by Government-owned and Government-linked

companies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The Government is not required

under existing legislation to present the accounts of the

Government-owned and Government-linked companies to Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government-owned and Government-linked companies are

set  up  under  the  Companies Act.  Like  all  companies,  they

operate  on  a commercial basis, and have to respond  and  react

quickly  to  changes  in  the business  environment.   It  would

therefore  be difficult for these companies to operate  if  they

were  to  be  made  accountable to Parliament  for  their  every

action.  Like any other companies, they are subject to the  same

reporting and disclosure requirements under the Companies Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, companies which are listed on the Stock

Exchange  are  accountable  to  their  shareholders  for   their

performance and operations.  They have to circulate their annual

reports to their shareholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strategic companies which are owned by the Government, such

as  Temasek  Holdings  and  Government of  Singapore  Investment

Corporation,  are  included  in  the  Fifth  Schedule   of   the

Constitution.  These companies are subject to the provisions  of

the  Elected President in the use of their accumulated reserves.

They are also required to submit yearly financial statements  to

the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing system is adequate in monitoring the

investments   and   performance  of  the  Government-owned   and

Government-linked  companies,  and  we  should   not   make   it

unnecessarily  more  onerous  for  them  to  operate  as  purely

commercial entities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister how does this answer

reconcile  with  his  earlier answer  on  Micropolis  about  the

accountability  of Government-owned companies because  they  are

dealing with public funds?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not see the contradiction in

it.   These companies are commercial companies.  They have their

own reporting requirements.  Just because they incur a loss, are

we going to change their reporting relationships?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister not realise that the

taxpayers  remain  in  the  position of  shareholders  of  these

companies because it is their monies, and is there not a duty to

report to Parliament?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> As I explained before, it is the

overall   returns  which  we  should  be  concerned  with,   not

individual  companies. What is the objective of  reporting  just

pure  losses  without  taking  into  consideration  the  overall

profitability of these companies? To make sure that they do  not

operate  as companies at all?  Should we just get rid  of  them?

When you are running a business, I assume that Mr Jeyaretnam has

never run a business, ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> No, I have not.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Exactly. This is the problem. He

does not really understand business and that is precisely why he

asked the question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> But I am concerned with protecting the

public's monies.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Protecting the public's monies is

the function of the Government, and the Government is adding  to

its reserves every year.  That is the best way of protecting it,

not the way that you are suggesting.

charged  to motorists using the second causeway and whether  the

Singapore  Government had considered the amount of  fees  to  be

charged  when  the  decision was made to  construct  the  second

causeway.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>

<b>Phun) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

under  the Inter-Government Agreement (IGA) for the Construction

of  the Second Crossing, each government may independently  levy

any toll on vehicles using it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Crossing is a project jointly developed by

Singapore  and Malaysia.  We had no specific tolls in mind  when

we  decided  to  construct the Second  Crossing.   Malaysia  has

announced that it would be collecting toll from motorists  using

the  Second Crossing.  Singapore has also announced that it will

do  the  same.   For  a start, we will peg  our  toll  rates  to

Malaysia's toll charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that Malaysia will decide on tolls that are fair

and  reasonable taking into consideration the investment in  the

bridge  and  its ancillary facilities, as well as  the  need  to

optimise traffic flow across the Second Crossing as well as  the

Causeway.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> I would like

to  ask  the  Minister of State whether, in  view  of  the  poor

reception of motorists and businessmen in Singapore, he has made

any representation to the Malaysian authorities to ensure a more

rational  and feasible fee structure for the use of  the  Second

Causeway.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have made

known to the Malaysians that we will match their toll rates



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



and I have also commented publicly that the Malaysian rates,  as

reported by the press, were too high and expressed the hope that

they be lowered.  So let us wait for their announcement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> In view of the expression by

some motorists that they may not want to use the Second Crossing

and  there  could  possibly be more congestion on  the  existing

Causeway and the likelihood that the Second Crossing may not  be

utilised and become a white elephant, has the Minister of  State

considered plans whereby this will not happen?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, this is also our concern and

this  is  why  I said publicly that we hope the rates  would  be

reasonable.  We have not finalised the rates.  So we  will  have

to  look  at what the actual rates are and, as I said, initially

we  will  match the rates and we will decide later on  what  the

rates would be in order to optimise traffic flow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> I am sure that the Singapore

Government has its own reasons for proceeding in the first place

to  build  the  Second  Crossing and I am  very  sure  that  the

interests of motorists and Singaporeans are consistent with this

objective.  But if the Malaysian government were to consider not

imposing more feasible charges for the Second Crossing, would he

consider   imposing  different  charges  for  Singaporeans   and

Malaysians using the Second Crossing?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, when we determine the toll

rates,  we  have to look at two considerations:  the  investment

made by the Singapore Government and also the traffic objective.

Since  it is a joint project, it is in our interest to  make  it

successful.  And I am sure it is also in their interest to  make

it successful.  So let us do not prejudge that it would not be a

successful project.  We are hopeful that it would be successful.

<div align="center"><b>HDB EXECUTIVE FLATS IN NORTH-EAST ZONE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Selling price)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for National

Development (a) why is the selling price of executive  flats  in

the  North-East Zone for the first quarter of 1998, as announced

by  the Housing and Development Board (HDB), lower by more  than

$12,000 compared to the last quarter whilst at the same time the

selling prices of four-room and five-room flats are increased by

$8,200 and $9,100 respectively; and (b) what contributed to  the

much  higher  selling price of HDB flats in the North-East  Zone

compared to other zones.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the prices of new HDB flats vary according  to

the  location,  floor  area, design features  and  finishes.  In

addition, factors like good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



view, proximity to MRT/LRT stations and commercial centres, etc,

are also considered in the pricing of the flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first explain the price differences for the 4-room

and  5-room  flats in the 1st quarter 1998 compared to  the  4th

quarter 1997.  In the 4th Quarter 1997, only flats from Sengkang

were  available for booking whereas in the 1st Quarter of  1998,

flats from both Sengkang and Hougang Towns are being offered for

booking.   As  Hougang  is  a  more  developed  town  with  more

established amenities than Sengkang, the selling prices  of  the

new  flats  in Hougang are higher than those in Sengkang.   This

accounts for the slightly higher average selling prices  of  the

new 4-room and 5-room flats in this zone in the 1st Quarter 1998

offer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Executive flats, those in Sengkang that were

offered  for booking in the 4th Quarter 1997 are located  closer

to  the proposed Sengkang MRT station and Town Centre. They were

therefore more attractive and command higher prices compared  to

those offered for the 1st Quarter 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the second part of the question, flats in the North-East Zone enjoy greater popularity than flats in the North and

West  Zones.  This is reflected in the higher resale  prices  of

the  flats as well as the demand for these flats.  In the  queue

for the new HDB flats, 57% of the applications are for flats  in

the  North-East  Zone. In view of this, flats in the  North-East

Zone  are priced relatively higher compared to similar units  in

the other zones.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, is the Minister saying

that  if  the flats in any specific area are more popular,  they

will  accordingly be priced higher?  Is that one of the  factors

that the HDB prices its flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If an area is more desirable, this

should be reflected in the higher land prices.  HDB pays for the

land  price  and this would then be reflected in the pricing  of

the HDB flats and therefore reflect the higher prices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister when did HDB acquire

the land?  Was it not acquired many, many years ago?  Or was  it

just recently acquired?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The land on which HDB flats are built

comes  from  different  sources: some  are  acquired,  some  are

reclaimed,  while some are crown land reverted to the  Singapore

Government.  HDB purchased land from Land Office at  the  market

rate,  based  on  the  location, size and density  that  we  are

allowed  to  build.  So every year, HDB will buy land  from  the

Land  Office and the land prices will reflect the attributes  of

the site and location.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister agree that most of the

land  for HDB flats was acquired three or four decades ago at  a

pittance?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The Government has a land bank built up

of  land  from  different  sources.  Let  me  take  an  example.

Recently,  Gillman  Camp has been reverted  to  the  Government.

Gillman Camp was an old army camp and it is on crown land, so it

was  given to the Government at $1.  Does that mean that we will

price the land at $1?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why not? It is public housing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> In which case, HDB flats built on

Gillman Camp will cost only $100,000 per unit whereas HDB  flats

built in Jurong West or Punggol which are on reclaimed land  and

at a very high cost would cost $300,000 or $400,000.  How do you

then  allocate flats in Gillman which would only cost  $100,000?

The Workers' Party can do that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is not a question of Workers' Party or

not.   It  is  a question of properly accounting to the  public.

How do you arrive at the costs?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, can I remind you not to engage

in  outbursts  of this nature?  This is Question  Time  and  you

should rise to ask questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is the Minister aware that based on

the  Internet  version of the HDB's final  tender  results,  for

Sengkang Neighbourhood 3 Contract 1, Neighbourhood 2 Contract 28

and  Contract 27, the average price for building and  electrical

work is about $88,000 per unit, consisting, I suppose, of 4- and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



5-room  flats.  The average selling price of a 5-room flat,  for

instance, is about $285,000.  Would the Minister explain further

and  give details as to how HDB flats are being priced?  Besides

the  construction cost, how much is the land cost, and  whatever

costs like design that command a premium?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> What the Member is quoting probably

constitutes the building contracts that we gazette or  publicize

upon  receipt of the tenders.  There are several components that

go  into the pricing of HDB flats.  First,  the land cost  which

today  constitutes about 50%-60% of the total cost of HDB flats.

Secondly,   infrastructure to build up the town.  Before  we  go

for   building  contract  tender,  HDB  acts  as  an  agent  for

Government,  putting in the major roads, major  sewerage  pipes,

major  water pipes, etc.  The Government gives a grant  to  HDB.

So  HDB acts like the PWD for the Government, building the roads

and  all  the facilities.  Once the land is prepared,  then  HDB

will tender the land.  And what the Member is quoting now is the

building contract prices.  Beyond that, of course, will  be  the

administration  cost.   HDB  also  employs  architects,  project

managers,  etc.  and that would add another  5%-7%  of  building

supervision  and administration costs.  So that will  constitute

the total development cost of the HDB flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister mentioned land cost of 50%-60%. Would it not be lower in terms of unit price calculated

based  on  land cost?  Because the plot ratio is now  higher  in

building  HDB flats compared to previously, and also  the  floor

area of HDB 5-room flats is relatively smaller now.  Would it be

a cost saving in that case?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second supplementary question is: does the HDB also take

into  account  the  infrastructural development,  for  which  it

receives  a  grant from the Government? Is it a  factor  in  the

pricing of HDB flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The approximate contribution of the land

cost that I quoted just now, 50%-60%, is on a per square foot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



built-up area basis.  The HDB operates as an agent of Government

and  the  infrastructure cost is part of the work to  develop  a

town.  As you know, most HDB towns are green field sites.   Some

are  even  sea  that  we have to reclaim  and  put  in  all  the

infrastructure.  And from there, a town is built up.  All  these

constitute the total development cost of  HDB flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Has the infrastuctural development

cost  of the town been all the while taken into account as  part

of  HDB's  selling  price of flats?  Or was there  a  change  in

policy for taking that into account?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The costing of HDB flats and the way the

HDB accounts are built up have been in place since 1985.  As you

will remember, we had consultants like Price Waterhouse, etc, to

come  in  and build up the HDB accounts.  There has not  been  a

change since that basic structure was built up in 1985.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> What about before 1985? Was the

infrastructural development cost of the town taken into  account

as a factor in the pricing of HDB flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As you know, before 1985, HDB operated

more like a  Government department by using cash accounting.  In

1985, we decided that the HDB should present its accounts on  an

accrual  basis, like most statutory boards.  And on that  basis,

we  moved  from  cash accounting to accrual accounting,  and  we

built  up  the  cost structure of HDB and how to  determine  the

total  development of each HDB flat on that basis with the  help

of outside consultants.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I clarify with the Minister whether

before 1985 the infrastructural development cost was taken  into

account  in the pricing of HDB flats?  Was it taken into account

as a factor in the pricing of HDB flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Before 1985, on a cash accounting basis,

whatever HDB spent in its development was expensed off  in  that

year.   And  the  pricing of HDB flats was  based  on  how  much

subsidy you want to give out.  So there was no clear attribution

of how much each HDB unit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



would  cost.   Because  like all cash accounting,  whatever  you

spend that year, in 1979, you would expense it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister agree that after

1985,  once you take the full costing of the flat, the price  of

the  flat  would  increase because of the different  factors  in

costing?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> It is not so. I think the whole

objective  of  the 1985 exercise was to give HDB management  and

Government   a   better  evaluation  of  what  goes   into   the

construction and the development of  HDB flats.  As you know, we

had  a big debate between Mr Chiam See Tong and the late Mr  Teh

Cheang  Wan  in  the  early  days on how  much  HDB  flats  were

subsidised.  And there was no way you could explain to Mr  Chiam

unless  the  accounts were presented every year in  a  generally

accepted  practice  of accrual accounting.  Today,  whether  you

like it or not, the cost that goes into each HDB flat is clearly

reflected,  clearly  explained  and  totally  accountable   for.

Therefore,  what it costs, what we sell the flats for,  and  how

much subsidy per unit  are reflected in HDB accounts every year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for the Environment

(a)  what  means the Singapore Government will have of  ensuring

that  all  countries involved in the ASEAN Regional Haze  Action

Plan fulfill their obligations under the Plan in due time so  as

to  avoid  a recurrence of the haze pollution and (b)  how  much

Singapore  will  spend  in its follow-up to  the  Regional  Haze

Action  Plan, both for its own activities as well as in  support

of  joint  activities or activities carried  out  by  its  ASEAN

neighbours.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir,

the   ASEAN  Regional  Haze  Action  Plan       sets   out   the

cooperative  measures  needed among ASEAN  member  countries  to

address  the problem of smoke haze.  While it may not be legally

binding,  the  plan specifies the national and regional  efforts

needed in each member country to prevent the recurrence of smoke

haze due to land and forest fires.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan was developed by the ASEAN Haze Technical Task

Force  chaired by Indonesia and unanimously adopted  during  the

ASEAN  Environment  Ministers' Meeting on  23rd  December  1997.

There are no mechanisms under the plan for any member country to

ensure that the other member countries fulfil their obligations.

However,  the lead countries in the plan are the countries  that

were badly affected by the smoke haze last year.  They therefore

have  a vested interest to make their best efforts in preventing

the  recurrence of the problem.  The Task Force would be meeting

regularly to coordinate the implementation of the plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the action plan, Singapore's role is to spearhead

efforts to strengthen the region's early warning and monitoring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



capabilities.   To  this end, the Government would  provide  the

ASEAN   Specialised  Meteorological  Centre  (ASMC)   based   in

Singapore  with  the necessary manpower and technical  expertise

for  it  to fulfill its role and functions under the  plan.   We

will install an Intranet system in the Centre at a cost of about

$300,000  to  enable  ASEAN  countries  to  expeditiously  share

meteorological forecasts and satellite monitoring information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also be hosting a regional workshop in Singapore

next  month  where meteorological experts in ASEAN  can  discuss

weather   forecasts  for  this  year  and  compare   forecasting

techniques with international experts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will support the other ASEAN countries in their

implementation of the plan in areas where we have the  technical

expertise.   During  the  last haze period,  we  had  helped  by

sending  teams of experts with high-tech equipment to  the  Haze

Command  Centre  in  Jakarta.  We will  continue  to  do  so  if

requested in the future.  We will have a clearer picture of what

total  support  is  needed from Singapore  and  what  this  will

translate  into  in monetary terms when detailed discussions  on

the action plan are completed in April.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the plan has no

mechanism  for supervision and the Minister mentioned that  they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we have not received any official

confirmation   of  Singaporean  companies  being   involved   in

activities  causing  or  contributing to  the  forest  fires  in

Indonesia.   I  understand that the Indonesian  authorities  are

investigating  some Indonesian companies for  their  involvement

and we would have to await further word from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local companies doing business overseas, be it directly or

through subsidiaries or partnerships, must comply with the  laws

of  the countries that they operate in.  They will have to  face

the  penalties of the countries they operate in for breaking any

local laws.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister if there are

active  investigations by the authorities of Singapore companies

involved in such activities?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> The investigation of such activities

must  necessarily be done by the Indonesian authorities, and  we

have  requested  our  counterparts to keep  us  updated  on  the

progress of their investigations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Though the haze originates from elsewhere,

it  does  come  into  Singapore  airspace.   Will  the  Minister

actually consider local prosecution by the Singapore Government,

rather than depend on Indonesia?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, these companies are operating in

Indonesia, be it wholly-owned Indonesian companies or Indonesian

companies  that  are  in partnership with nationals  from  other

countries.   And  they must comply with the laws  of  Indonesia.

Therefore, if they break any Indonesian laws, it must be  up  to

the  Indonesian  government and authorities to  take  the  legal

action.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Would the Minister not agree that the haze

actually  comes into Singapore airspace?   Like the  oil  spill,

can the polluters also not be prosecuted under Singapore law?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the oil spill took place in

Singapore  waters and therefore we were obligated  to  undertake

those  investigations and enforcement actions.  In the  case  of

the fires, they took



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



place  in  Indonesian  territory and we have  no  resources  and

capabilities  to go into Indonesia to investigate, firstly,  who

started  the  fires;  and,  secondly,  the  ownership  of  those

companies that were involved in those fires.  I think it is best

that we leave it to the Indonesian government to undertake those

investigations  and to prosecute those companies.   We  are,  in

fact, monitoring the efforts at prosecuting those companies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> When we monitor the Indonesian government's

prosecution  and if they fail to prosecute either Indonesian  or

Singapore companies, will the Minister reconsider the position?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> The Indonesian Minister has assured us

that  the  Government is actively investigating.  In fact,  they

have already taken steps to prosecute one company.  I understand

that they are now at  the stage of finalising investigations  on

several  other  companies in order to take legal action  against

them.

<div align="center"><b>GREEN LABEL SCHEME</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for the Environment

if  he  will consider broadening the Green Labelling  Scheme  to

advise  consumers  against  products  connected  with  companies

causing or contributing to the haze pollution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the objective of the Green

Labelling Scheme is very specific.  It is to recognise  selected

consumer products which are more environmentally friendly.   The

scheme encourages companies to be environmentally friendly in  a

positive   way  rather  than  discriminate  against   particular

products  or  companies.   This is in  line  with  similar  eco-labelling  schemes introduced in other countries, and we  should

not depart from international practice by broadening it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Would the Minister like to elaborate how it

is  different  in favouring an environmentally friendly  product

from disfavouring an environmentally unfriendly product?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the differences are huge. One is

the scheme encourages a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



positive  effort  and it poses no threat to the other  companies

that  have not received the green label.  The approach  that  is

being  proposed  by  Mr Tay has very adverse  implications.   In

fact,  one  of  the great concerns expressed by many  countries,

especially   developing  countries,  is  that  some   countries,

especially  the  developed  countries,  may  resort   to   using

environmental   measures  as  a  disguise  for   protectionistic

measures,  and  the approach that has been proposed  by  Mr  Tay

would set a very uncomfortable precedent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> In view that companies may use land clearing

by  fire  as  a  cheaper means while other  companies  use  more

expensive  means, would it not be fair to reward  the  companies

which  use  more expensive and non-pollutive means  by  awarding

them  a  Green  Label  to recognise their good  efforts  towards

reducing  the  haze problem, rather than lumping  them  together

with environmentally harmful companies?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the Green Labelling Scheme or eco-labelling schemes that have been adopted internationally do

contain certain criteria.  We will also abide by those criteria.

I  think  it  is  not wise to mix up all these criteria  with  a

specific incident, which is the use of fires to clear land.   It

is  better that that problem be resolved in a proper way, ie, if

those  methods for clearing land are illegal, then  the  country

involved  takes  the  necessary actions to  enforce  their  laws

against those companies.  This is what the Regional Haze  Action

Plan sets out to do.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> What then can the Singaporean individual or

the  Singapore  Government do beyond hoping that the  Indonesian

government will fulfil their obligations?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> First, we will have to await word from

the Indonesian Government as to which are the companies that are

guilty.   After  that, it is left to the public to  decide  what

they  want to do.  But as the Government, we would not  want  to

engage in any precedent setting approach which may be used in  a

very detrimental way against economies around the world.

that  MOE  and NUS would study the proposal to set  up  a  South

Asian Studies programme at the NUS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE and NUS have now completed the study and have concluded

that  it  is  indeed  feasible to start a  South  Asian  Studies

Programme at NUS from the Academic Year 1999/2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme will enrich the university curriculum and

give  our under-graduates exposure to South Asia.  The programme

will  also complement the academic activities at the East  Asian

Institute  as  well as the Southeast Asian Studies Programme  at

NUS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South Asian Studies Programme will be structured to

allow students to either take modules as non-major electives  or

take South Asian Studies at the General Degree level as a Double

Subject Major, without the Honours component.  It will initially

consist  of  10 modules, with eight South Asian Studies  modules

conducted in English, including political, social, economic  and

cultural  aspects  of  South Asia.   There  will  be  two  Tamil

language modules to meet the needs of those wishing to  keep  up

with  the  language  at  the tertiary level.   However,  as  the

purpose of the programme is not language training in Tamil or in

other  Indian  languages, the language component in  this  South

with  the Indian community is whether the Government would  take

steps  to  see that the Tamil language is taught at  the  higher

institutes  of learning.  This being the first time,  would  the

five modules?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> If this is the case, then it will have to be

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education, in our new focus on the heartware of Singapore,  what

national  policies  can  be developed  at  the  junior  college,

polytechnic  and university levels to attract young Singaporeans

into  the  caring profession to meet staffing needs  at  various

social services.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mdm Chiang

has  rightly  pointed  out that developing  the  "heartware"  of

Singapore should begin with our young people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is fundamentally about developing the whole

person.  An educated person, in addition to acquiring skills and

knowledge,  should  be  morally  upright,  socially  adept,  and

responsible  to  his  family, community and country.   Imparting

values   and  inculcating  social  responsibility  are  integral

components of the education process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member knows, we have recently introduced the

Community  Involvement Programme in our schools.  This programme

was  introduced earlier this year to drive home the  point  that

caring  for the less privileged in society is the responsibility

of  every Singaporean, not just of those with a special calling.

This  complements existing community service efforts by  schools

and  tertiary  institutions, like the fund-raising projects  and

blood donation drives which these institutions regularly do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, choosing a profession is a matter of individual

choice.  Education policies cannot dictate what professions  our

students eventually choose.  Choices are influenced by a variety

of factors,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



including  perception  of  monetary  and  non-monetary  rewards,

inclinations of the individuals and, in particular,  a  person's

aptitudes and values.  By providing sound moral education, as we

do  in  our  schools,  we may encourage more  of  our  young  to

consider the caring professions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much that education can do to shape the values of

the  society.   But what we can do in the schools  and  tertiary

institutions  must  be reinforced by the  home  and  society  at

large.  It is a shared responsibility to encourage people to  go

into the caring professions.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> I agree that

it  is  a  shared responsibility.  I merely was asking if  there

were  provisions made in terms of expanding the intake into  the

polytechnics   and  in  giving  certificates  or  diplomas   for

particular fields created within the polytechnics.  So it is not

just  aptitudes.  It is really providing at the curriculum level

and meeting the needs of manpower in the social services.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Yes, indeed at the polytechnic level, about

five years ago, at the Nanyang Polytechnic we set up a School of

Health   Sciences  in  the  areas  of  nursing,   physiotherapy,

occupational therapy, radiography and so on.  This programme has

met with substantial success and we were able to attract quite a

large number of people into nursing.  But this was after quite a

lot  of efforts on the part of the professional associations and

the  polytechnic.   So  now we are having  a  steady  stream  of

polytechnic students doing these allied health courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Member's information, in July 1997, the Nanyang

Polytechnic also introduced a 3-year full-time diploma course in

Community  Services Management.  This has attracted 44 students.

The  course  aims  to train students to operate  community-based

organisations and also work in other types of organisations with

a  humanistic orientation in society.  The expected career paths

of  these  diploma  holders include youth development  officers,

probation    officers,   social   development    officers    and

rehabilitation  officers.   In  this  way,  through   curriculum

planning

and  expansion of courses, we are making it more accessible  and

more recognised among the school population to choose the caring

professions as a career.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Will the Minister clarify that

under the University Act, the Department of Social Work can then

become  a  School of Social Work?  Does the Minister think  that

this is an appropriate course of development in the long run  to

attract students to the Department to meet the manpower needs in

social services?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> In the planning for higher level manpower,

one  has to take into consideration the overall picture, eg, the

proportion of tertiary educated people in our workforce and  how

they  should  be  distributed among the  different  professions.

This is something that we can certainly look at in the long run,

ie,  how  to  increase the proportion of people who are  in  the

caring  professions.   I must stress again  that  no  amount  of

education   planning  can  force  people  to  take   a   certain

profession.  There is a whole host of factors being  taken  into

consideration  by the students and parents.  So  it  depends  on

whether  over the years our society changes its attitude towards

the position, the status and the worth of the work of the caring

professions.  Then we have to change and adapt accordingly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> If the policy is to increase the supply

of manpower to train specialists for the caring profession, then

in  as  much as income is also one factor in considering working

in  the caring profession, should not measures also be taken  to

look  into  the salary structures for the people in  the  caring

profession?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> As far as the health care profession is

concerned, MOH has been continuously revising its salary scales.

As  far  as social workers are concerned, I am afraid the Member

has to ask the Minister for Community Development.

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House recognises tripartism as a key competitive

advantage  of Singapore, and calls on Government, employers  and

unions to further strengthen tripartite partnership in Singapore

so  as to enhance Singapore's competitiveness as we face new and

greater economic and social challenges in the 21st century.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions affiliated to the NTUC have always looked

after  the interests of the workers.  We make sure we know  what

the  workers  want  and  what they are worried  about.   As  our

economy is closely linked to the world economy, we have  to  pay

close  attention to outside forces.  We must anticipate  changes

and not be overtaken by events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, the NTUC used scenario planning tools to

plan for the next few years.  We have identified a number of key

concerns.   I  will share with this House today  our  top  three

concerns, and how we propose to deal with them.

<br><br><i>Key concerns</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our first key concern is how to make our trade unions

more useful to our members, to companies and to society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stay relevant, we must have programmes that workers find

interesting and of practical value.  We must mobilise workers to

make their companies more competitive.  We must always consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



national interests before taking any action.  In other words, we

must add value - to workers, to companies and to society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers are better-educated and many have travelled

quite a bit.  They are more sophisticated, more discerning,  and

even  more  demanding.  And they have different needs  which  we

must  cater  to.  We must find new ways to recruit members,  and

deal  with workplace problems.  That is why we must respond well

to  the changes.  That is why our membership has been going  up.

In  many  parts  of  the world, where trade  unions  operate  in

traditional ways, membership has declined sharply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies, too, have to cope with rapid changes. They have

to  become  more productive, innovative and nimble.   If  we  as

trade  unions  hamper  their efforts to restructure,  to  become

competitive, then they will resent our presence.  But if we  can

work with them to move ahead of competition, they will accept us

as  partners.  Indeed, there are some employers who have  openly

described unions as useful partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our unions have helped make Singapore a better place to

live  in  and  do  business.  Because we prefer negotiations  to

strikes, our streets are no longer battlegrounds.  Indeed,  each

year  brings  in more investments - to create more, and  better-paying jobs.  Our cooperatives help moderate the cost of living.

Our  NTUC Club has several outlets.  We have resorts and country

clubs.  So workers can now spend their leisure in style, and  at

prices  well  within  their reach.  We  must  continue  to  help

workers  stretch  their hard-earned dollars,  where  it  matters

most.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second key concern is whether workers can stay

employable through their working lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 40% of our workers have low education, only up to

lower secondary.  They are older, many above 40 years.  They  do

low-skilled jobs which create low value.  It is hard for them to

upgrade.   But  Singapore is restructuring.  It  is  becoming  a

knowledge-based economy.  So the low-skilled jobs will go.  Yes,

EDB has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



working  very hard.  It brings in new investments.  But the  new

factories  require workers with high skills.  Look at the  wafer

fab, petrochemicals, and the pharmaceuticals.  They need workers

with  at least `A' levels.  So when workers are retrenched  from

low-skilled  jobs, can they find work in wafer  fabs?   If  not,

what can they do?  How can we help them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some workers may remain unemployed, not because there are

no jobs, but because they do not have the skills for these jobs.

This  is  what  we  call structural unemployment.   We  need  to

improve our workers' skills.  But this is something that  unions

cannot  do  on their own.  It requires the combined  efforts  of

government, employers and unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third concern is how to cope with foreign labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had foreign workers for many years. So far, they

are  found  only  in certain industries, and at certain  levels.

But,  in his National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Goh  Chok

Tong  spoke  of  the  need to bring in more foreign  talents  to

supplement  our  limited local talent pool.  We  in  the  labour

movement  support this move, as long as Government and employers

work  with us to retrain and upgrade our workers.  We will  make

these  foreign talents feel at home in Singapore.  If the better

ones  want  to stay and make Singapore their home, so  much  the

better.

<br><br><i>Critical uncertainties</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we face critical uncertainties which can affect our

future development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, will our workers stay employable? In 1996, NTUC

launched  the Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) to  help  our

workers  upgrade their skill levels.  We are encouraged  by  the

response  of our workers and are grateful for the support  given

by  Government and some employers.  We must do more.  We need to

make  SRP  a national programme.  It is not enough to  run  such

programmes  only for the unionised sector.  Government  must  be

prepared to invest more in worker training.  So, too, employers.

Workers must accept lifelong learning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the PAP Convention on 11th January, Prime Minister Goh

said  he thought it was a good idea to have a new ministry  that

could  focus  on  manpower development.   So  workers  can  look

forward to even more systematic training programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I was in an NTUC team that made a study tour of

three  highly  developed  countries -  Switzerland,  France  and

Germany.   What  did  we  find?   We  found  a  high  level   of

unemployment: 5.3% in Switzerland, 12.6% in France, and 11.1% in

Germany.   Seven  out of 10 unemployed in these three  countries

will  remain unemployed or without a job for a long, long  time.

They  are  caught in structural unemployment.  They do not  have

skills to take on high-paying jobs that are being created.   Can

we  upgrade  our workers' skills fast enough to avoid structural

unemployment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another critical uncertainty: Can we continue to attract

quality investments?  Practically all countries in the world are

now  pursuing  the market economy, with slight variations.   And

many have two factors which potential investors find attractive:

a  large domestic market and an abundant natural resources.   We

do  not have such advantages.  Business and wage costs are  also

higher  in  Singapore.  Of course, we have many plus  points  in

Singapore  going  for  us.   We  have  political  stability  and

industrial harmony.  Our workers are more skilful than those  in

developing  countries.  But these countries are improving  their

capability.  We are also competing with developing countries for

quality investments.  Can we continue to get such investments?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third concern is whether NTUC's symbiotic ties with the

PAP  will  remain strong.  PM Goh touched on the symbiotic  ties

when he addressed the PAP Convention.  He said, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We should strengthen our symbiotic relationship with the

NTUC  and  the unions.  Union members and workers have benefited

from the policies and the attitude of the PAP towards them.  For

example, the PAP Government has helped workers to enjoy  similar

leisure   facilities   as   their  employers,   management   and

professionals.  Union members, in turn, have supported  the  PAP

in implementing its programmes."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To underline this symbiosis, he has asked the PAP and the

NTUC to jointly organise a seminar to discuss the impact of  the

regional  currency  and economic turmoil.  During  our  scenario

planning sessions, we did consider various joint efforts by  the

NTUC and the PAP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symbiotic ties will be maintained, only if the young in

both  the  unions and the PAP forge a close understanding.   The

young  have  not  had the kind of shared experiences  the  older

generation  had  - in working together to overcome  crisis.   We

have  a difficult year ahead of us.  It would be useful for  the

trade  unionists and PAP activists to work together to  overcome

problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP-NTUC symbiosis has led to Singapore making good

progress.  This symbiosis is based on trust, on mutual  benefit.

Membership  of the two organisations will remain and  depend  on

personal choice, as it has been all along.  There is no law that

says that the NTUC and the PAP must work together.  For example,

if  the Government were to ignore workers' interests, there will

be  calls  from  the labour movement to review the  relationship

with  the Party.  Also, if unions act irrationally, there is  no

reason  for  Government to offer a helping  hand.   So  we  must

continue to nurture the PAP-NTUC symbiosis, and not take chances

with  it.  Without this symbiosis, it is not possible for us  to

operate the tripartite system.

<br><br><i>Towards Stronger Tripartite Links</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to meet the challenges ahead, we have to review our

current  approaches.   We  will strengthen  methods  which  have

worked  to  our advantage and discard old mindsets  and  methods

which are no longer relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tripartite framework has served us well. Our objective

as  trade  unions is to safeguard the interests of workers.   We

can  do  so effectively only if companies become more productive

and  competitive.   Government must  continue  to  provide  good

infrastructure, transparent regulations and stable conditions to

attract investors.  Then workers can continue to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



have good jobs and look forward to fair wage increases.  This is

the basis of our tripartite relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has succeeded so far because Government,

employers  and  workers have worked together.   Where  there  is

industrial  harmony,  there is social and economic  development;

where there is constant strife, it is difficult for businessmen,

local  or foreign, to make long-term plans.  A strong tripartite

relationship is not just critical in maintaining this industrial

harmony.   It  is also a key competitive advantage  to  help  us

become a developed economy early in the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of

the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tripartism has worked uniquely for Singapore in the

past.   For the future, Singapore needs a vision, a view of  the

success  that  is  only possible with a synergetic  relationship

between Government, union and employer.  We need to envision and

shape  the future together in a proactive manner.  Rose coloured

glasses  and a complacent hope that the future will work  itself

out  will  never guarantee jobs, neither will it  guarantee  the

high  morale,  productivity and skills level of workers  and  to

support the economy in bad times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, we stand at a crucial point in our economic

history  amidst the regional currency crisis.  If steps are  not

taken to further strengthen the tripartite partnership, we  will

not  withstand  the  onslaught of change.   The  time  can  come

instead  when  a  lot  of finger pointing will  take  place,  as

everyone  blames someone else for the mess, and no  one  accepts

responsibility.   Key  issues in the  economy  and  business  of

Singapore  have  to  be  addressed  before  they  become   major

problems.   Only then can we realise the interests  of  workers,

the  needs of companies, and the hopes of the Government for the

nation's future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three partners in this relationship must continue to

function  like  the legs in a tripod to support each  other  and

ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



that  each  leg  remains  standing  firmly  so  that  the  whole

structure is stable.  However, a tripod does not exist as an end

in  itself.   It supports a greater entity; in the case  of  the

tripartite partnership, the entity being the nation itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the hopes for tripartite partnership in the

future?   Tripartism  can  be  described  as  kaleidoscopic.   A

kaleidoscope  is primarily made of three strips of mirrors  that

are  equilaterally  situated to reflect the  best  of  patterns,

shapes  and  colours.  The kaleidoscope always makes fascinating

viewing.   The  positioning of the mirrors is  strategic.   Even

when  the  different "stones" in the kaleidoscope get  relocated

and  mix  with other "stones", the views are always  interesting

and  appealing.  Needless to say, all these views are impossible

without  the strategic alignment of the mirrors.  In fact,  when

one  of  the  three strips of mirrors gets damaged,  the  entire

kaleidoscope  is  ineffective and thus ruined.   Similarly,  the

idea  of tripartism is to create the best pattern of cooperation

and bring out the best in each worker, with the collaboration of

the  employer and the union, with government.  The end  product,

the  beautiful  pattern, represents the  wonderful  nation  that

results  from a true tripartite partnership.  However, when  any

strip of mirror, representing the employer, union or government,

is  ruined, the damage is felt by each partner in the tripartite

alliance, and the end product is a nothing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tripartite partnership must be strengthened for the primary

reason  that  the international business world is  going  to  be

constantly changing and increasingly competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, I would like to focus my speech on three key

areas.   The first two will touch on how the PAP Government  can

further  add value to the labour movement and the third area  on

how the labour movement can further add value to companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it has been just pointed out by the NMP, life long

employability is a key concern of our workers.  About 700,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



workers  or  about 43% of our workforce have at best  perhaps  a

Secondary Two education or less, and many of them are above  the

age  of  40.   So  they  are relatively  slower.   It  would  be

difficult for them to cope as we become a knowledge-based and IT-plugged economy.  Keen competition demands that our workers  are

trained,  retrained and are multi-skilled.   Jobs  are  becoming

intertwined   and  inter-dependent  that,  for   instance,   the

traditional lines between the blue-collar and white-collar  have

blurred.   Jobs  are fast becoming a pale-blue  or  bluish-white

kind of work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the regional economic crisis, the neighbouring

countries  are  becoming  significantly more  cost  competitive.

While  Singapore  can still succeed in attracting  higher  value

added  investments  and white-collar jobs  into  Singapore,  our

problem will be the hastened pace at which low value-added  dark

blue-collar jobs will disappear.  What this means for Singapore,

given  the  lower educational profile of the Singapore workforce

is,  as Mr Cyrille Tan has pointed out, structural unemployment.

We  have  to take preventive action before it bites our economic

jugular  veins  like a werewolf.  Europe has  been  bitten  very

badly.  Seven out of 10 workers face structural unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer home, just look at what has happened to Hong Kong's

manufacturing  sector.  I am not sure whether it  is  structural

unemployment, but it is a very serious job displacement problem.

In  1990,  the colony's burgeoning manufacturing sector employed

more   than  a  million  people.   Due  to  restructuring,   the

manufacturing industry shrunk drastically in 1995 and shed  two-thirds  of  the workers and only employed 350,000  workers.   We

could  potentially face a more serious situation than  what  the

Hong  Kong  lesson  has  shown.   Smaller  economies  under  the

pressure  of  rising  costs  due  to  resource  constraints  can

restructure  their  industrial  base  much  faster  and  deeper.

Presently,  the manufacturing sector's share of Singapore's  GDP

and employment is 27% and 23% respectively.  In other words, GDP



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



contribution  from manufacturing sector, 27%, number  of  people

employed   in  the  manufacturing  sector,  23%  of  the   total

workforce.   Given  the  lack of focus on skills  upgrading  and

given  the  present  gloom and doom, it is  not  an  unrealistic

scenario  to  imagine the manufacturing employment in  the  next

four  years shrinking from 23% of the workforce to 12%, in other

words,  halving in four years' time, which would result  in  job

losses of at least 200,000 workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no glance at the crystal ball. It is a very real,

highly  likely possibility, if nothing is done.  And the workers

of  Singapore are already starting to see the first  signals  of

the `looming storm'.  In yesterday's Business Times, a survey of

100  companies indicates that job security rather than  pay  now

tops  workers'  concerns.  And,  Members  also  must  have  read

yesterday  that  Seagate Technology, Singapore's second  largest

private sector employer, will announce major layoffs this  week.

As  industry rumours have it, 20% of its staff will  be  cut  in

Singapore and that this is only but the `tip of the iceberg' for

all Singapore manufacturing industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is most worrying is that the most vulnerable

group  amongst the 700,000 less-educated Singaporean workers  is

that  more  than  220,000 of them are male  bread-earners  whose

household  incomes are less than $2,000.  These are workers  who

live  in  3-room  HDB flats, or maybe 2-room, or  1-room  rental

flats  and they are working as production workers or as cleaners

in commerce and services industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question that the Members of this House have to

ask  is: how are these workers going to cope with the storm that

is  looming when it hits them and their families?  And they  are

no  less  Singaporeans than all of us in this House.  They,  and

the  many more thousands of workers, urgently need the attention

of  the  frontbench, and not just the sympathy of the frontbench

or the backbench.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the clarion call is for the Government to focus more and

invest much more funds on skills redevelopment of the workforce.

While  Government  talks about `Thinking  Schools  and  Learning

Nation', it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



has  given  a disproportionately low attention to the  education

and  training  of  the less educated mid-career  adults  in  our

workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me illustrate why. In the Budget for FY 97, there

were  a  combined total of about 470,000 students in our primary

and  secondary schools.  The Government allocated $1.83  billion

to  educate  these 500,000 students.  In addition, it  allocated

$78  million in Edusave bursaries and scholarships and for other

scholarships.   And it has set aside over a number  of  years  a

total  of  $5  million  from  our  surpluses  into  the  Edusave

Endowment Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In stark contrast, very little has been spent on educating

or skilling our workforce.  The Government funds worker training

mainly through the Skills Development Fund (SDF).  In FY 97,  it

has  only disbursed something like $47 million to companies  and

of  this $47 million, $22 million was actually collected through

the  Skills  Development  Levy  from  companies.   Perhaps,  the

Government could have spent a few more millions of dollars  here

and  there through some other training programmes.  But that  is

the amount allocated for worker training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are 700,000 workers out there with less than

eight  years  of  formal education and yet what  the  Government

invests  on  them  sounds like `peanuts'  compared  to  what  is

invested  in  our school children.  So they say peanuts  attract

monkeys.   Perhaps in good times, the workers  may  be  swinging

from  job  to job, but in bad times, they will have  no  job  to

swing to.  They may have to swing from tree to tree.  Sir, these

workers too need schemes like the Edusave.  How about initiating

`Train-Save' Schemes and training bursaries and scholarships for

workers?   What about emulating the $5 billion Edusave Endowment

Fund  with a Worker Training Endowment Fund which could  go  far

beyond  the scope of the Skills Development Fund as the SDF  has

got many limitations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, please do not get me wrong about spending money on our

children.  I support every cent that is spent in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



educating  our  school going children.  We must invest  on  them

today  to reap the benefits tomorrow.  But what I am also saying

is that the Government must spend just as much, if not more, and

spend  it  today  for workers who missed out on their  education

yesterday  for various reasons.  And if we do not do enough  for

them today, then there may be no tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is really committed to life-long

employability   and  implementing  the  concept   of   life-long

learning,  it must recognise that it has to go beyond  investing

in  the education of the young.  It must develop a comprehensive

national   infrastructure  to  develop  and  coordinate   skills

upgrading, continuing education and training.  It must provide a

mechanism,  a  nexus,  beyond the schools  for  continuation  of

learning from the school to the workplace.  It must provide  the

flexibility to ensure life-long employability of workers so that

it  can  respond  effectively to the  changing  skill  needs  of

industry   and   business.   It  must  provide  incentives   and

motivation for workers to want to upgrade and learn a new  skill

even in good times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with great hope, anxiety and high expectations that

the workers look forward to the establishment of the Ministry of

Manpower,  as announced by our Prime Minister.  It is  also  our

hope  that the new Ministry will coordinate the work of  various

agencies   to  develop  a  comprehensive  continuing   education

infrastructure.   A  wide range of Government-funded  programmes

that  allow  for  modular  learning,  and  the  accumulation  of

training  credits  leading  up to  various  levels  of  national

certification   should   be  conceptualised,   implemented   and

coordinated.  A tripartite National Training Committee needs  to

be  formed  to coordinate these efforts and to provide feedback.

Schemes  like  the  ITE's  Company  On-the-Job  Training  Centre

(COJTC)  and  NTUC's  Skills  Redevelopment  Programme  must  be

strengthened  and beefed up to become national programmes.   And

as  I  have said earlier, Edusave concepts must be extended into

Train-Save Schemes for workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in short, we need a paradigm shift in the way that we

look  at continuing education and skills upgrading.  We need  to

take a holistic approach to succeed.  We need the Government  to

act  and  act fast.  We in the labour movement keenly await  the

formation of the Ministry of Manpower.

<br><br><i>Symbiotic relationship between PAP and NTUC</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now like to move on to the second area in which the

Government can further add value to the labour movement and that

is the symbiotic relationship between the PAP and the NTUC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PAP has always had the support of workers. In

fact,  trade unionists were amongst the convenors of the  Party.

At  the  inauguration of the PAP, most of those who were present

were  union  members.   Half  the Protem  Committee  were  trade

unionists.  Once in power in 1959, the PAP Government set  about

to  implement  its election pledges - to strengthen  the  labour

movement.   Laws  were  passed to check  employers  from  taking

advantage  of  workers.  Trade unions were given their  rightful

place in society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1961, the labour movement was split into two, with one

group  (the  NTUC)  backing  the PAP and  the  other  supporting

Barisan Sosialis.  The NTUC stood shoulder-to-shoulder with  the

PAP  in the struggle against colonialism, then against communism

and,  subsequently, against communalism.  It is  this  symbiotic

relationship  that  has  enabled us to  weather  the  storms  in

earlier  decades.   With  the support of organised  labour,  the

Government has been able to take tough decisions to overcome one

crisis after another.  Let me state here and now that we in  the

labour  movement stand fully behind the Government as  it  takes

steps to minimise the impact of the regional currency crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may ask why this unflinching support. Because the

workers  know that their destiny and that of the nation  depends

on good and effective government.  Without good government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



we could not have full employment, 90% home ownership, universal

education, medical and other social benefits.  But I  am  afraid

that  a  growing number of younger Singaporeans take  this  good

life  for granted, and this good relationship for granted.   The

old  guards  in the NTUC and the PAP have made way  for  younger

leaders  who  have  not  gone through the  same  experiences  in

tackling life-and-death issues.  So will the symbiotic relations

betweeen the PAP and NTUC remain strong in the years ahead?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Cyrille Tan has mentioned, we have to continually

nurture  this special partnership which is so unique to  us  and

not  take  chances.  Last Sunday, the Secretary-General  of  the

PAP,  PM Goh has called for closer ties between the PAP and  the

NTUC.  This call has certainly reassured the labour movement  of

the  continued commitment of the PAP and particularly under  the

younger leadership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to move to this area where unions can

add  value to companies.  While we pride ourselves in having the

world's  best  workforce, there is still  tremendous  scope  for

improvement.   One  area  where  we  lag  behind  as  a  nation,

especially as seen in the BERI survey, is in workers' attitudes.

Workers'   attitudes  are  shaped  largely  by   the   workplace

relationship  with management and therefore the level  of  their

motivation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an excellent working relationship at the top level,

between  the  CEOs of companies and the NTUC leaders.   But  the

area that needs further strengthening is at the middle level and

at the workplace where better  rapport needs to be built between

branch  union  officials  and  the middle  management.   Greater

effort  is  needed to build mutual trust and understanding.   We

need  to develop shared vision and show that if the relationship

is  stoked the right way, the unions can galvanize the workforce

to contribute significantly and add much, much more value to the

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the unions, there is a need to perhaps

review  the  traditional  way that  we  do  things  and  conduct

negotiations.  In Japan, for example, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



collective  bargaining process which is done in  the  months  of

spring  is  called  the  "Spring  Offensive".   It  sounds  very

confrontational and I am sure Mr Matthias Yao will agree that it

sounds  like  a military maneouvre. While collective  agreements

(CAs)  still serve a very important role for unionised  workers,

we have to change the modus operandi.  For example, a collective

agreement (CA) is a document that captures what compensation and

benefits that the company will provide for the workers.  But, in

my  opinion, it is one sided.  Time has come for us to move from

collective agreements to partnership agreements -  from  CAs  to

PAs.   A  partnership agreement can go beyond the CA and include

the  commitment of the union and workers to a shared vision  and

add  value to the company.  One of the key ways in which  unions

can  add  value  to the company that they work  for  is  through

productivity improvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are many scientific ways in which we can

approach productivity improvement, to me, the fundamental factor

that  contributes to productivity is human attitude.  The  right

work   attitudes   of   staff  can  do  wonders   in   enhancing

productivity.   Therefore, if branch unions and  management  can

forge  a  closer working partnership, there can be so much  more

value added to companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC and the PSB have set up a task force to find ways

for  unions to add value to their companies.  The NTUC will move

its  emphasis  from  productivity  awareness  to  developing  an

integrated and action-oriented approach to push productivity  at

the  unionised workplace.  These could include training, quality

action programmes, job redesign and enlargement.  The details of

these programmes will be announced in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let us reaffirm our commitment to tripartism

in  the  light  of  the  present regional  scenario.   The  most

scintillating  views  on  the  kaleidoscope  are   obtained   in

brilliant sunlight.  With sunlight, the views sparkle and gleam.

Similarly,  in  boom  times,  the  tripartite  relationship   is

obviously  working  well.   In  the  absence  of  sunlight,  the

patterns of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



colour   and  light  are  still  a  fascinating  sight  in   the

kaleidoscope,  because  the mirrors  are  still  reflecting  all

available  light off each other.  The economic climate  that  we

are in now is like the weak rays of sunshine.  The financial and

currency  turmoil in the region is casting a shadow of pessimism

and  caution.  The situation that we are in now is all the  more

needy of a tripartite partnership so that the three partners can

reflect  and  bring  out the best in each  other,  to  create  a

beautiful pattern, a lovely society.  In the absence of a strong

sunlight,  when  the economy is down, we must  ensure  that  the

mirrors  of  tripartism  pick  up the  best  of  colours,  hues,

brilliance and intensity of productivity, so that we  can  yield

the maximum of benefit for the worker, employer and nation as  a

whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concern of the NTUC, as Mr Cyrille Tan put it,

is:  how can trade unions add value to their members and to  the

tripartite partners?  Really, the fundamental question  is:  how

can  trade  unions remain relevant?  To remain  relevant,  trade

unions  will  have  to add value to workers,  employers  and  to

society at large.  It cannot keep on doing what it used  to  do,

but to do what is useful today and in the years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of any movement depends on the quality of its

leaders.  We have been fortunate that our unions have thrown  up

good leaders.  In the past, unions could draw from more than 90%

of  the workforce for members, and hence leaders.  In 1970,  84%

of  all  workers  at best had primary school education.   Today,

that  same group of workers with that kind of qualification  has

shrunk to 39%, which means the rest have better education.  That

has been the success story of Singapore.  And drawing from that,

if  the traditional way in which we think about union membership

remains  the same, then unions must draw from a poorer  pool  of

members  or  grassroots leaders.  So the difference between  the

past leaders who still continue today and what we may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



draw on in the future would be the quality.  If we are going  to

have  the same balanced relationship that we have had all  these

years,   then   we   should  re-examine  the  scope   of   union

representation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest worry today, as Mr Cyrille Tan and Mr

Sinnakaruppan said, is whether our workers will remain  employed

throughout  their active working life.  This is the  second  key

concern  mentioned by Mr Cyrille Tan.  Conventional thinking  is

that  it  is the duty of the State to educate the young  to  the

best  of  their  ability,  until they go  to  work.  Thereafter,

further  education, or upgrading of skills is the responsibility

of  the  individual, or his employer.  With faster technological

change,  is  this still valid?  Each worker now has to  re-learn

skills  three to five times in his working life.   The  cost  of

keeping workers employable with relevant skills throughout their

working lives has gone up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Sinnakaruppan mentioned that the Government

through the SDF spent only $47 million in 1996.  That is not the

full story.   For every dollar which the SDF funds, another  $10

is  paid for either by the employer or the individual.   So  our

total  spending  on continuing education and training  today  is

more of the order of $400 million to $500 million.  And yet this

is  not enough.  Therefore, the cost of upgrading the skills  of

our  workers in the light of the changes around us will be very,

very  high.   So this means that we cannot rely on old  thinking

about how we deal with continuing education and training.  There

should  be  a central agency to plan the manpower needs  of  the

economy,   coordinate  a  national  infrastructure  for   skills

upgrading,  and  to devise programmes to support the  individual

and the employers.  Without this, we will be trapped in the rut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers will say that they do not know what courses to take

up,  or that they have no time for training, since they have  to

earn  a living.  On the other hand, the employers will say  that

they  cannot afford to train if the worker will leave  for  some

other employer at the end of the training.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



In  this period of uncertainty, there will be a natural tendency

to  cut  back on spending.  To the employers, I say, "Don't  cut

back  on  training."  If you do so, you will  be  making  a  big

mistake.   Of course, you can make training more cost effective,

but  we  should  not  stop training and upgrading.   It  is  the

quality of the workforce that will give you the cutting edge  in

competition.  And one more point: It is not enough to train only

the young.  You need to train the not-so-young and also the old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training has to be a national effort, a shared

responsibility.   We  need  to  find  more  effective  ways   of

upgrading and channeling workers from the declining sectors (for

example, consumer electronics) to new growth sectors like  wafer

fabrication.   If  not, Singaporean workers will  become  under-employed  while new growth sectors will be overly  dependent  on

foreign skilled workers.  This is not desirable.  It is also not

sustainable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the structural unemployment in Europe. New jobs

have been created, but large numbers of workers do not have  the

skills  that  these  jobs require.  Each government  knows  that

retraining has to be done, if structural unemployment is  to  be

overcome.   But  money  is scarce.  And  even  the  billions  of

dollars they squeeze out of tight budgets will make only a small

difference.   This is the price they pay for the  past  thinking

that  the  upgrading  of  skills is the  responsibility  of  the

individual  and  the employers.  It is now  a  problem  for  the

Government, and there is just not enough money.  If we take care

of  the  continuous  retraining of workers now,  whilst  we  can

afford  it,  then the development of new sectors in our  economy

will be successful, because our workers will truly feel that  it

has all been done for their benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I welcome the proposal to expand the functions

of  the  Ministry of Labour into a Ministry of  Manpower.   When

there  is  a  lead  agency to deal with  the  matter,  then  the

individual  efforts of different agencies will  move forward  in

the right direction.  Workers will know that there is a Ministry

looking after the development of our own workers.  It will be  a

clear focal point.  Continuing education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



and training will then be coordinated.  Our workers' skills will

be  upgraded  continuously, so they will remain employed  as  we

bring  in  new  investments.   Otherwise,  some  may  think  the

policies  we are putting in place to attract new growth  sectors

are for the benefit of foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, as we move more and more into the knowledge-based

economy, we need more knowledge workers.  What is more, we  need

a  critical  mass of skilled workers in a sector before  it  can

take off.  So we need foreign talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, the financial services sector. If we

are  to  grow  the business in new financial services,  we  must

build up a critical mass of expertise, with a heavy injection of

foreign talent.  It is one thing to look at this from the  macro

view.   What  is  the impact, seen from the perspective  of  the

individual  Singaporean?   Let  me  cite  an  example  from  the

financial  services sector.  Just a few days ago,  a  couple  of

employees  in  this  sector told me that some Singaporeans  feel

marginalised,  or sidelined.  A foreign boss will  recruit  more

foreigners, and Singaporeans are shut out.  There does not  seem

to  be a transfer of expertise.  We should expect such problems.

A critical mass of talent versed in new areas has to be built up

from recruiting foreigners.  The volume of business at the start

is  not  large,  so  they  do not employ so  many  Singaporeans.

Singaporeans do not seem to be given a role.  They have  yet  to

be  trained in the skills.  It is only when the business  volume

grows  big  enough  that Singaporeans will be brought  into  the

business.    So  on  the  one  hand,  we  need  to  explain   to

Singaporeans  what to expect, and at the same  time  monitor  to

ensure that competent Singaporeans are also given the chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also be aware of social problems when large

numbers  of  foreign  workers from the same source  country  are

concentrated in one place.  I am not referring only  to  Orchard

Road or Serangoon Road, but also in the factories.  They tend to

stick  together  as  a  social group.  This  leads  to  friction

between foreign workers and Singaporean



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



workers,  in the same factory.  Fortunately, these problems  are

not serious so far.  But we should be mindful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the turbulence in the East Asian economies,

there  is  some fear among Singaporeans of lay-offs.   Yesterday

morning,  as Mr Sinnakaruppan said,  for the first time  one  of

our  papers  reported, in a long while, that the key concern  of

our  employees is now job security.  Little wonder.  We read  in

the newspapers that over two million Indonesians have lost their

jobs  as a result of the current crisis.  They may be joined  by

another   million   whom   Malaysia  intends   to   send   home.

Unemployment  in  Malaysia  itself  among  Malaysians  is   also

expected  to  rise.   There  are already  more  than  a  million

unemployed  in Thailand.  Another million jobs will be  lost  in

Korea  through the restructuring required to restore its economy

back to health.  When our workers read or hear of such problems,

naturally they are a little bit worried.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite naturally, employers are concerned about prospects in

the  coming  months.  Management will be thinking of  strategies

for survival.  How to weather the next year or two and cost will

have to be trimmed.  One option is to retrench workers.  We have

faced  such  situations  before.  We  have  worked  together  to

overcome  problems.  What is more, we have  also  put  in  place

systems which should allow us to face downturns with less  human

cost.  Companies should thus be better prepared to cope with the

downturn.  We did this through the practice of tripartism.   Let

us not forget that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did we put in place, as a result of the last

recession?   We wanted a system which should allow employers  to

reduce wage cost without having to resort to retrenchment  as  a

first  measure.   We  have put in place the  flexi-wage  system.

What is this flexi-wage system?  In the flexi-wage system, there

are  two  basic  components: the monthly wage and  the  variable

bonuses.  The variable bonuses should make up about 20%  of  the

total  annual  wage.   So in a downturn the company  can  reduce

annual wage cost by up to 20% and still pay their workers the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



full monthly wage.  Employers should therefore trim wage cost by

reducing  the  variable bonus before they consider retrenchment.

We  put in place a flexi-wage system, not a flexi-worker system,

to  allow companies to cope with downturns.  It is cut wage cost

first,  not  cut workers first.  Unions accept that retrenchment

is   a  management  prerogative.   But  if  after  working  with

employers to implement the flexi-wage system, employers  do  not

use it, but resort to retrenchment when the company shows losses

for  the  first  time in one quarter, it will  not  be  fair  to

workers and the unions who represent them.  If in making use  of

the  flexi-wage system and other cost cutting measures are still

not  enough, then we can accept retrenchment to keep the company

viable  and to save jobs.  So I urge all employers not to resort

to  retrenchment at the first sign of trouble.  If  we  have  to

accept retrenchment, who goes first?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is popular to say that in a downturn, the foreigners

should be retrenched first.  But when a company has to retrench,

it  should retain the best team, to be competitive.  So when  it

comes to deciding who should go, we should adopt the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between two persons, the one who is clearly better than the

other  stays while the weaker one is retrenched.  If the  better

worker  is a foreigner, the Singaporean is retrenched.   If  the

better worker is Singaporean, then the foreign worker goes.   If

both  are  equally  good,  then the Singaporean  stays  and  the

foreign worker goes.  This is a sound basis to protect the  jobs

remaining.  Most of these jobs will be held by Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenchment, we hope, will be a short term problem. The

well-being of our workers depends on our ability to attract  new

investments.  It has to be knowledge intensive, and high  value-added  investments.  We have to be more productive  to  overcome

our  lack  of  a  large  domestic market  and  lack  of  natural

resources.   That  is  why closer cooperation  among  the  three

social  partners  will be more important.  Our past  success  in

attracting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



investments  is  not  something we can take  for  granted.   The

competition  today is much more intense than it has  ever  been.

We   are  competing  with  developed  countries  for  high   end

investments.  We have to make Singapore a profitable place to do

business  despite our lack of a large domestic  market  and  our

lack of natural resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a valued partner of employers, our unions must

continue  to  do what they have done well in the  past:  working

with  employers  to  foster  a harmonious  industrial  relations

climate,  and ensuring that the labour  market remains  flexible

and workers employable, as my colleagues have said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining a flexible labour market means the critical re-examination of hard-won terms of employment. We cannot assume

that what we put in place in the past are still right today.  We

cannot assume that they have not become rigidities that make our

labour  market less flexible than other economies.  It will  not

be  easy to discard these hard-won terms of employment.  Some of

these may have been regarded in the past as essential to prevent

employers  from exploiting workers.  So how can  such  terms  be

varied  or modified without allowing abuse?  That is a  question

together we must address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions can also add value to employers through

helping  to implement programmes to raise productivity -  skills

upgrading,  promotion  of  Quality  Circles,  setting  up  Total

Quality  Management Programmes, 5S programmes,  and  suggestions

schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we do this, we will not be the only union movement

which  helps management, although conventional wisdom may  think

otherwise.  Toyota, for example, acknowledged in the 1980s  that

it  was  union  support that helped them to  develop  what  they

called  the  Toyota Production System, a highly regarded  system

which  other  car  manufacturers wanted to also  put  in  place.

Toyota  knows  that  it is through the years  of  close  working

relationship  between  management and unions  and  workers  that

makes the system possible.  So it is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



easy for any other company to replicate.  So Toyota welcomes  GM

and  the like to look at their system.  This shows how at  least

in one company, management regards cooperation with the union as

a critical factor for success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our present circumstances, union support for

management is most important today in the area of reducing  unit

costs,  to  enhance  competitiveness and then  it  will  make  a

difference to how well we weather the storm ahead.  The NTUC and

the  unions aim to be a valued partner of employers.   When  the

companies are profitable, then jobs are secure, and the  economy

as a whole benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what other ways can unions add value to society? In the

past  30  years, the labour movement had embarked on  two  major

programmes.   The  first is the development of  the  cooperative

movement,   which  has  benefited  consumers,   especially   the

consumers  from  the working class.  The second is  in  bringing

social  and recreational facilities previously enjoyed  only  by

the higher income within the means of the lower income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years ahead, there are two areas where our unions

can   play  a  social  role.   The  first  concerns  the   aging

population.   This will create new needs, such as the  care  for

the  elderly.   With smaller families and nuclear families,  the

lower  income will require help most, because both  husband  and

wife  have got to go to work.  Such assistance will fall outside

the  scope  of  volunteer  welfare  organisations.   The  labour

movement  can,  and should, play a part, with support  from  the

other two social partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area is the effects of globalisation.

Globalisation  means  that  the  labour  market   becomes   more

competitive, indeed a global one.  High end wages will be set by

the  world-wide shortage of such talent, whilst the  low-skilled

wages  will  be  depressed by the overwhelming surplus  of  this

group  of  workers.  This widening of the wage  gap  can  create

social  problems.  It can create social tensions.   So  far,  we

avoided those problems.  Why?  Because our education, health and

housing policies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



have  kept the real net gap narrower than if let to pure  market

forces.   You  take housing - a perennial subject of  debate  in

this House.  Our home ownership policy has given each one a roof

over  their heads, and nine out of 10 own their homes they  live

in.   We take this for granted now.  But this is one reason  why

we  do not have people sleeping on the sidewalks, as the jobless

do in the cities of the developed nations.  For Singaporeans who

have  been  prudent with their home buying decisions, they  need

not fear being turned out into the streets through unemployment.

You  see  in the developed countries, a high proportion of  rent

accommodation.   When they lose their jobs and  cannot  pay  the

rent,  the  landlord who is from the private sector will  demand

the keys back to their apartments.  That is why every winter you

have  photographs  of people sleeping on the  sidewalks  in  New

York.   We should build on what we have built up so far and  try

to  narrow the wealth gap further.  So, in this, we will have to

be  more creative to ensure that the asset enhancement programme

benefits the lower income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unions can play a role and add value to society with the

continued  support of employers and Government.  But  will  this

close  partnership  built up over the past 20  years  last  -  a

question  which Mr Sinnakaruppan asked.  Will it grow  stronger?

This will depend on what each of the social partners does.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partnership between the NTUC and the PAP Government is

built on personal relationships, on trust, on shared beliefs and

shared goals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at each general election, there is leadership

renewal  in the PAP Government.  We also have leadership renewal

in    the   unions   through   periodic   elections.    Personal

relationships cannot be handed from one generation  to  another.

It  has to be forged anew by the successors.  Therefore, to keep

tripartism  strong,  the interaction among leaders  of  the  PAP

Government  and the NTUC and the unions has to be  managed.   It

takes  time  for  trust to develop.  Therefore, we  welcome  the

Prime  Minister's suggestion on Sunday that joint  seminars  for

the PAP be held with the NTUC.  It is as much an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



opportunity for the PAP to better understand the workers  as  it

is  for  union  leaders to influence PAP leaders  who  form  the

Government   so   that  national  policies  remain   pro-worker.

Strengthen  the  links, and we can be assured that  the  working

relationship,  which has been one of our unique strengths  as  a

country, will continue well into the next century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, quite clearly the key concern of everyone is how

soon  the  current  economic problems  in  the  region  will  be

resolved.  These problems are external but they affect  us.   To

solve this problem, international cooperation is critical.   Let

us  hope  that there will be close cooperation and the  will  to

accept the remedies however painful they may be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our response internally, in our country, must be to follow

what  we  have done before.  We have weathered different  crises

before, through everyone pulling together.  We overcame the 1985-86  recession  through  the practice of tripartite  cooperation.

Now is the time to reinforce this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the outset, let me

first  state  that  I have been a member of the  National  Wages

Council for two years.  The NWC is one of the key instruments of

tripartism in Singapore and I have therefore had the opportunity

to observe the workings of tripartite partnership at first hand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make four points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I would like to make is that I agree that

tripartism has been a key competitive advantage.  It is  one  of

the  main  socio-economic institutions that has  contributed  to

peaceful industrial relationship in Singapore and has helped  to

achieve  labour  market reforms in order to lower  the  cost  of

doing  business  and  increase  productivity.   This  tripartite

partnership  has served Singapore well in three  respects.   The

good  industrial relations that we have had in Singapore  cannot

just be attributed to our labour laws alone which permit workers

to  strike only after recourse to arbitration.  Rather it is due

to the meeting of minds of unions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



business   and   Government  representatives,   achieved   after

considerable  discussions and negotiations.  This  tradition  of

dialogue  is now well established in Singapore.  Its  anchor  is

the  NWC  which meets intensively for several months  each  year

principally  to negotiate wage increases.  In its  25  years  of

existence, the NWC has indeed contributed significantly  towards

peaceful industrial relations in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, during the 1985-86 recession, the most important

policy  change  that turned the economy around was  the  one-off

reduction  in total labour cost when employers' contribution  to

the  CPF  was  cut from 25% to 10%, reducing total  labour  cost

overnight  by 12%.  Without the push from the labour unions  and

Government, this would not have occurred peacefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, NTUC and tripartism have also been instrumental in

encouraging labour market reforms, such as the switch from fixed

to  flexible wages that Minister Lim Boon Heng mentioned, and in

raising the retirement age from 60 to 62.  It is often difficult

to  change  established practices.  But tripartism  has  enabled

these adaptations to be made to the Singapore labour system  for

the good of workers and employers alike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to make is that Singapore's

competitive  edge  in  the  future will  increasingly  entail  a

greater  dependence  not  on  the  hardware,  such  as  physical

infrastructure but on the software.  This includes an innovative

culture, quick response time and continued flexibility to  adapt

to  rapidly  changing circumstances.  All these attributes  have

one  denominator - the ability to bring about change in society.

The  speed  of change is crucially dependent on the organisation

of  that  particular  society and in particular  on  its  socio-political institutions.  That society which is organised in such

a  way  that  desired changes can be brought about  rapidly  and

peacefully  will  be  that society that can survive  shocks  and

adapt, even ride on trends in the external environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to outline some of the forces which are

relevant to the labour market and how tripartism as a key labour

market  institution  can  help us  to  successfully  meet  these

challenges  head-on.   The cutting edge  issues  in  the  labour

market  have  to do with responding to three key trends  in  the

world  today  - technological change, globalisation  and  aging.

Technological  change  and  globalisation  both  accelerate  the

obsolescence  of  skills  and  make  re-training  essential  for

continued  productivity.  An aging society has to  consider  the

institutional  arrangements for health care  and  employment  of

older  workers.  These two have already been elaborated  by  the

union speakers before me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In labour-short Singapore, we have yet to attain that

balance  of encouraging women to work on the one hand, while  at

the  same time enabling them to continue to look after not  just

children  but  also  aged  parents on the  other.   Also,  since

foreign  work  permit  holders constitute  a  not  insignificant

proportion  of  our workforce, we need to think of  how  we  can

increase  the productivity of foreign work permit holders.   The

solutions  to  these  issues are not easy because  they  involve

changes to established norms and practices. They will take time,

determination and much effort.  Government cannot  handle  these

issues  alone, nor can business, nor can unions.  They are  best

handled  and discussed, implemented in the tripartite framework.

The  benefit of tripartism is that it forges a common vision and

a  common determination to implement change for the common good.

I  therefore agree that there is a need to strengthen tripartism

to meet the challenge of change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to make is to raise a proposal

as  to how tripartism can be strengthened.  At present, the main

instrument of tripartism is the National Wages Council.  The NWC

was  established in 1972 with the objective of recommending wage

increases.   Over  the years, it has shifted  from  recommending

quantitative wage guidelines to qualitative wage guidelines.  It

has  also  been  active in encouraging other aspects  of  labour

market reform, such as the flexible wage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



system,  and there has been discussion on co-payment  of  health

care  cost  and increasing the female labour force participation

rate.  In the light of the labour issues which have come to  the

forefront and the need to raise tripartism to a higher plane,  I

would  like to propose that the mandate of the NWC be  broadened

to  include a regular discussion and recommendation on  manpower

issues,  such  as  skills  retraining,  health  care  financing,

working mothers and foreign worker productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there is limited discussion within the NWC on

these  issues as the predominant topic is wages.  What  I  would

like  to  see  is an enlargement of the agenda  of  the  NWC  to

include  manpower  issues  as well as wage  negotiations.   This

would  amount to a formalisation of the existing system  of  the

NWC  supplemented by ad-hoc tripartite committees.  In order  to

reflect its enlarged mandate, the Council could be renamed,  for

example,  the  Tripartite Advisory Council  on  Manpower.   This

Council  could  be  a body which the proposed  new  Ministry  of

Manpower could tap for advice and recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point I would like to make is to reflect on the

Asian  currency  crisis and its implications for  Singapore  and

tripartism.  The Asian currency crisis has come as a  tremendous

shock  to us in Asia because of its magnitude and the suddenness

of  the  contagion  effect.  It reminds us of how  volatile  the

international economic environment can be.  And that  no  matter

how  strong  a  country's economic fundamentals, interdependence

means  transmission of this volatility.  It is in these volatile

and  uncertain times that the strength of a country's social and

political institution is tested.  The ability to rally a country

in  times  of  crisis  is  primarily a  task  of  the  political

leadership.  But that task is made easier if there were  already

in  place mechanisms to achieve that common mindset to take  the

pain  and bite the bullet.  This is where the consensus building

practice  of  tripartism has a significant role  to  play.   The

tripartite  partnership, built up carefully over  the  years  in

good times, is there when you need it in bad times.  I therefore

see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



tripartism  not  merely  in economic  terms,  not  merely  as  a

competitive advantage.  I believe it goes beyond economics.   It

is  an institution that contributes to the very fabric of socio-political stability in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that the Asian currency crisis has added an

urgency  to  the task of productivity enhancement in  Singapore.

Right now, we are affected by the crunch in regional demand  and

liquidity.  However, it is during the recovery phase and  beyond

when  the  affected  countries are on their  way  out  of  their

present  troubles  that  there will  be  a  stronger  effect  on

Singapore's competitiveness.  We should therefore strengthen the

tripartite  partnership  now  in  order  to  implement   further

productivity  enhancing  and  other  labour  market  reforms  in

preparation for a more competitive future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I am optimistic about Singapore's future in

the  midst of the currency crisis not only because of our strong

economic  fundamentals but also because of strong socio-economic

institutions, such as tripartism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I also believe in

tripartism  partnership  among  the  Government,  employers  and

workers.   But tripartism to me must be real.  As I  see  it  in

Singapore  today,  tripartism  seems  to  be  dominated  by  the

Government or the PAP.  We have a Minister who heads the  labour

movement and, as I look through the NTUC magazine, I notice that

almost  all or every one of the unions is headed by an MP  or  a

Minister.   As an outsider who looks at the situation today,  it

would appear that the labour movement is controlled by the  PAP.

Therefore, under these circumstances, I do not think that  there

is  true  tripartism.  I hope that the NTUC can  be  given  more

independence, let it mature and let it have more leaders  coming

from  the  ranks.   This in the long term would serve  Singapore

well  because if we have patriotic, honest, good and true  union

leaders, the workers will surely follow.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, or at least the average Singaporeans seem to

see  it,  the NTUC seems to be more interested in doing business

rather than taking care of the workers.  The NTUC leaders appear

to  be entrepreneurs rather than union leaders.  So I hope  that

the  union leaders are not too interested in the business aspect

of NTUC but concentrate more on the interest of the workers.  An

important  area  in  which the NTUC can do  is  to  improve  the

educational  level of the workers.  The Minister has  said  just

now  that  the  education of the workers has  improved.   Twenty

years  ago, 84% of the workers had either primary or lower  than

primary  school  education. Today,  the  figure  is  about  39%.

Probably, this is due to the fact that 89% comprises all the old

workers and they are just dropping out of the labour force,  and

not through the efforts of NTUC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I read the latest copy of the NTUC News, it says that,

in  fact,  74%  of  Singapore's workforce in  the  manufacturing

sector  are semi-skilled or unskilled and 43% of the workers  do

not  have  secondary education.  This does not  augur  well  for

Singapore to go into the 21st century where technology,  as  you

have  heard many speakers say, would be advancing by  leaps  and

bounds.   Unless you have a basic secondary education,  how  are

you going to learn all these new skills?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for foreign workers, apparently 93% of them are

unskilled,  as  expected.  I do not think the foreign  countries

would be sending their skilled workers to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real big task of the NTUC is to improve the skills and

education of the workers and this is not an easy task.  This  is

in  fact  a  tremendous task and is going to cost,  as  we  have

heard,  about $400-$500 million.  So every possible help  should

be  given  to Singaporeans, ie, parents, young Singaporeans  and

workers,  to  improve their skills.  This is a priority  of  the

NTUC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the other priority would be to improve the

attitude of the workers, ie, to motivate them, to want  them  to

work and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



to  learn new skills.  I think these are the twin tasks of NTUC.

One, train and improve their skills.  Two, motivate the workers,

change their attitude and make them willing workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make a few suggestions as to how this can be done? I

know  the  NTUC  has suggested that the ceiling  of  the  Skills

Development  Levy  be raised from $1,000 to $1,500,  to  collect

more  money  from the companies to train workers.  That  is  one

way.   May I suggest other ways?  The NTUC should look  into  an

apprenticeship scheme to improve the skills of the  workers,  to

make  them skilled and semi-skilled workers, and not only  that,

perhaps  also to craftsmen.  They should try to find a way  from

the   many  precedents  in  other  parts  of  the  world   where

apprenticeship  schemes  are  successful.   We  should  try   to

implement one in Singapore which suits our condition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that we should scrap early streaming in

our schools.  This is not a good thing educationally, especially

in  terms of motivating our future workers when these kids leave

school  to  enter  the workforce.  We should give  the  workers'

children  an  equal chance in education.  In fact, I  have  been

suggesting for many years that we should build libraries in  all

HDB  precincts.  As books are expensive, the children of workers

are  not  exposed  to books, so they do not  have  a  chance  of

learning  the reading habit early.  So if the workers'  children

are  taught to read from young, we will definitely get a  better

educated workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is perhaps the HDB could help. I have

travelled to many countries and in fact, training is done not by

the  government  but by the private enterprise.   In  the  other

countries,  they have one advantage and that is they have  cheap

rents.   Anyone who has the skill and wants to teach  it  for  a

living, he could do so because he could easily rent the premises

to do it.  But in the Singapore context, rents are very high and

so  small  institutions or schools cannot be started because  of

the  high  rents.  If HDB could give facilities to  Singaporeans

who  have  some skills and who want to teach, we should  try  to

charge them at a lower rent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



because,  in law, education is in fact considered to be charity.

So people who want to impart their skills to others, in fact, it

is  a  charitable act and this cannot be clamoured for by  other

professions or trade unless they can be proven to be a  charity,

just  like HDB has already made a precedent by giving space  for

childcare  and  kindergarten centres operated by some  religious

bodies.   They  should  also do that by giving  space  to  other

Singaporeans who would like to teach some skills to workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the apprenticeship scheme, in fact, for many

centuries already, Europe has built up an apprenticeship scheme,

in  particular  Germany has a very modern one.  Germany,  as  we

know,  has  very  skilful workers.  In fact,  their  engineering

skills  are  the best in the world.  So perhaps, we  could  also

look  into this.  And England, of course, has a law to  regulate

apprentices.  Perhaps, we could look into all these  schemes  in

the  other countries.  In fact, in Italy, they are very good  in

the   crafts   and  skills.   They  also  have   a   very   good

apprenticeship  scheme  in regard to  handicraft.   I  think  we

should also look into this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educationally, telling a child that he is a dud, a failure

and that he cannot make it at an early age will in fact ruin the

child  for  the  rest of his life.  This is  probably  why  BERI

reported  that the attitude of workers in Singapore is not  very

good.   From very young, we have already put them in a frame  of

mind  that they cannot fit into society and thereafter, in fact,

they  cannot fit into society, even if you really want  to  give

them all the opportunities because it has already been implanted

in  their minds. So how can they have the right attitude towards

work?  How can they be motivated?  I think the NTUC should  look

into  this area with the Ministry of Education.  There  must  be

other  ways  of  educating our young, rather than  resorting  to

streaming  at  a  very early age.  I think  streaming  has  been

delayed from the third year to the fourth year.  But it is still

too early educationally to stream a child.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is not willing to pay money to build

libraries  in  HDB precincts, I think they can get  the  private

sector  to do it.  If the private sector would like to cooperate

with  the  Government in building more libraries, I  think  this

should  be welcomed.  Again, I hope the NTUC will push for  this

step.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards educational facilities to be built in HDB

premises, again, I think this should be looked into seriously by

the NTUC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make a last comment? I heard from the Minister that

if  we  do  have  a depression and workers are retrenched,  when

there is a skilful foreign worker and a Singaporean who has  got

no skill, the Singaporean will go first.  From the point of view

of  business, of course, this is right.  But from the  point  of

view  of  leaders of a country, I  wonder whether we  should  do

something  about  it.  I have, in fact, made a comment  that  if

this  were true, I think it could easily lead to abuse.  Because

I  have  already  heard of cases where companies  have  employed

unskilled foreign workers and used our SDF funds or some kind of

funds  to train them.  In the particular case, I heard that  the

foreign  workers  were trained to be crane operators,  and  they

became  skilled  crane operators.  In fact,  instead  of  hiring

Singaporean crane operators, they hired foreign crane operators,

because  they were cheaper.   So if the Government were to  make

known that skilled foreign workers would be maintained and  that

Singaporeans  would be retrenched first, I am  afraid  companies

would start to train more and more foreign workers, so that they

can be retained at a cheaper rate when retrenchment comes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, let me

reply  to the point raised by Mr Chiam See Tong.  Just  now,  Mr

Chiam  said that many of the advisers of NTUC affiliated  unions

are  controlled  by  PAP  MPs.  Maybe  Mr  Chiam  has  not  paid

attention  to the development of trade unions in Singapore.   In

fact,  in the past few decades, a lot of union leaders want  MPs

to  be  their advisers.  For example, for a new Member like  me,

when  we  work  with the unions we get to know the feelings  and

sentiments  of the workers and issues which concern  them  most.

We  can  bring  them  up  on their behalf with  the  authorities

concerned and get things solved.  Similarly, because of the MPs'

advice and guidance, the unions are better operationally and the

workers get more benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Chiam said that the NTUC has been doing too

many things.  We have been doing many things and more has to  be

done.   The  Secretary-General has already mentioned  about  the

training  and retraining of workers, and we have discussed  this

both  in  and outside Parliament.  Maybe Mr Chiam has  not  paid

attention  to this.  He does not quite understand  what  is  the

meaning of tripartite relations.  The Member for MacPherson,  Mr

Matthias  Yao,  has described the working of  tripartism  and  I

shall quote him.  He says, "In the tripartite relationship, NTUC

takes  care  of  the workers' interest as well as  that  of  the

management.   The management looks after their own  interest  as

well  as the national interest.  And the Government is concerned

not  only  with national interest but also the interest  of  the

workers as well."  This is what we mean by tripartism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give him another example. In 1967, when we were

busy  preparing  for the Lunar New Year, a few  thousand  public

daily-rated cleansing workers went on strike in response to  the

union's  call.  They were protesting against the Government  for

not adjusting their pay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



and  claims.   Subsequently, the leaders of the  illegal  strike

were   arrested.   These  illegal  strikes  caused  a   lot   of

inconvenience to the people of Singapore.  The streets and  side

lanes  were  full of filth and rubbish. Families without  modern

sanitation had to clear their own night-soil buckets.  Today, 30

years  later, 100 workers who are engaged in cleansing work  and

environment  protection have been selected as model workers  and

they  have received awards from the Prime Minister, Mr Goh  Chok

Tong.  They flew to Perth for a holiday.  I do not know how many

of  these  100 people took part in this illegal strike 30  years

ago.   But to everyone of them, this is not only affirmation  of

the  Government  in  recognition of their contribution  to  make

Singapore  a  garden  city,  it  is  also  affirmation  of   the

management  for  their work performance.  It is also  the  trade

union's recognition of their contribution.  One worker said that

he  can  never  imagine  receiving  the  award  from  the  Prime

Minister.   He has never thought of travelling to Australia  and

this is the first time he has travelled by air.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this example clearly shows that 30 years ago there was

confrontation between labour and management, but since  we  have

tripartism, Singapore has turned from a filthy and chaotic  city

into a beautiful garden city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion in the name of Mr Cyrille Tan.

This  motion  reminds  us  that true tripartism  is  not  easily

achieved.  It is worth our preserving it.  In the midst  of  the

regional  currency  crisis and when we  are  entering  the  next

century  facing keener competition, this is even more important.

As  a matter of fact, tripartism is a model that has been looked

upon  as a point of reference by unions of other countries,  eg,

before becoming Prime Minister of Britain, Mr Tony Blair came to

Singapore to look at our model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for tripartism to succeed, we need a good

Government,  an enlightened management, and responsible  unions.

There  must  also  be a commonality of purpose among  the  three

parties.   The  trade  unions look after  the  interest  of  the

workers  by   giving them training, retraining and upgrading  to

improve their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



quality of life and this is consistent with the objective of the

Singapore Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the self renewal of PAP MPs and leadership changes in

the  unions  and  industries,  it is  timely  to  reiterate  the

importance  of tripartism and further strengthen and consolidate

the spirit of tripartism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give you another example to show that

tripartism benefits everybody and that the trade union  movement

will  give  added value to society.  For example, to  solve  the

problem  of  shortage of bus drivers and to improve productivity

and  save  cost, the bus companies implemented the  OMO  system,

which  means  that the conductor's job has become redundant  and

taken   over  by  the  driver.   Without  the  cooperation   and

understanding of the National Transport Workers Union,  it  will

be  difficult  to  implement this system.  The drivers  accepted

retraining and the challenge.  They not only drive but they also

enlarge  their  job  to cover the work of conductors.  They  now

drive longer buses, double-decker buses and as a result they get

better  pay.   Both the passengers and bus companies  have  also

benefited.   The  bus  companies could contain  the  cost  while

passengers enjoy the bus fares at an affordable level.  Sir,  if

we  go to London and board a double deck bus, we can still  find

conductors.   I  believe we can then really appreciate  our  bus

drivers for their increased productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will soon be in the Year of the Tiger. Tiger Year is a

tougher year.  The regional monetary crisis has caused people to

worry  about their job security, their income and in this period

of  hardship, it is time for tripartism to give more play to its

functions.  We have gone through the difficult period of the 70s

and  the 80s.  We are confident that we can also go through this

difficult period in the 1990s.

<div align="center"><b>TRIPARTITE PARTNERSHIP IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I support the

motion tabled by NMP Mr Cyrille Tan.  Please let me first of all

comment  on  the views of the Opposition Member,  Mr  Chiam  See

Tong,  by  referring to a small incident at the meeting  of  the

International Labour Organisation for the Asian region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this meeting, Singapore labour movement's representative

at  the  tripartite meeting spoke on how NTUC and the  Singapore

trade unions have developed human resources through training and

retraining  programmes for our workers. The report includes  the

Skills   Redevelopment  Programme  initiated  by  the  NTUC   in

collaboration  with the employers and funded by the  Government.

The  report  also touched on other areas of cooperation  in  the

tripartite  partnership,  ie, the  workers,  employers  and  the

Government.   The  report also drew attention of  the  ILO  when

Singapore was named specially in this session report.  Normally,

the   session  report  of  ILO  will  be  more  general  without

mentioning any country which had addressed the meeting. Why  was

this  so?   This  was  because ILO,  as  a  world  organisation,

involving three parties, has an objective to develop cooperation

among  the  three parties so that it will be beneficial  to  the

workers and the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in most other countries, tripartism is

only  a  wish  or  a  dream because the  parties  are  still  in

conflict.   Therefore, the ILO often hopes that  all  the  three

parties,  especially in the developing countries,  are  able  to

work  together.   In such a situation, I found that  the  speech

made  by  Mr Chiam is wayward and my colleagues in the NTUC  who

had  delivered their speeches earlier had already shown how  the

NTUC  wants  to  add value for the employers and  also  for  the

people  so that this benefit from the value-added aspect may  be

enjoyed  by the workers and the people.  But to carry  out  this

responsibility,  NTUC  has to appeal to the  employers  and  the

Government to make more contribution towards such an effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the interest of the Singapore workers which has

been neglected now as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



compared  to the period when there was no cooperation among  the

tripartite partners?  Will Singapore be more capable to face the

possible  economic crisis in Southeast Asia?   It  is  predicted

that there will be many incidents of riots in many countries  in

the  Asian region.  Are we able to face these problems if  there

is  no cooperation among the NTUC and the Government led by  the

PAP  and the employers?  On the other hand, contrary to what  Mr

Chiam  said that the NTUC is dominated by the PAP, the  workers,

through NTUC, have a voice in the Cabinet because its leader  is

a  member  of  the Cabinet.  Our workers also have  a  voice  in

Parliament  because its leader is a Members of Parliament.   The

benefits are many and obvious in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to go back to the ILO meeting. In my opinion,

Singapore's  successful experience in achieving this cooperation

of tripartism as shown at the ILO meeting, lies in many benefits

enjoyed by the workers, the employers and the Government.  We in

Singapore are aware that the training programme, which  we  hope

will  become  a national programme, is not the only evidence  of

the beneficial cooperation enjoyed by the workers, the employers

and  the Government.  My colleagues who have spoken earlier have

already  shown  how  the  partnership  has  helped  to  maintain

peaceful  labour  relations, greater growth and a  comprehensive

progress  which the people have enjoyed.  For many countries  in

this world, the tripartite relationship is only a wish, if not a

dream.  The challenge now is how the three partners are able  to

strengthen this partnership to meet the greater challenge of the

future, especially in the short term, to meet the economic,  and

in the long term, to meet the challenge of world globalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the short term, the economic crisis which has come

about  here  because of the economic crisis and slow  growth,  I

hope   the   employers  and  the  Government   will   give   due

consideration to the interest of the workers.  I admit  that  in

this  economic situation there are many firms which will  reduce

the number of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



workers.   They  will  downsize their manpower  and  restructure

their  operations.  As a result, many workers  will  lose  their

jobs.   For  this group, I hope the employers and the Government

will  work together with the unions to reduce the plight of  the

workers who will be suffering from the loss of jobs, by offering

them  alternative jobs and to find a way to avoid  retrenchment.

The  unions have been working together with some firms to assist

workers,  who  have  lost  their  jobs  recently,  to  take   up

alternative jobs.  In future, when more workers lose their jobs,

it is better for us to resolve this matter collectively with the

unions, employers and the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective way to face this global economic crisis

and the keen competition in most countries, including Singapore,

is  to  expand training and retraining opportunities, especially

for  those who are low-skilled workers.  Otherwise, most of  the

700,000  workers who possess only Secondary 2 education will  be

redundant  or  they will be displaced by their  company  or  the

economy  in  future.   For that reason, NTUC  has  launched  the

Skills Redevelopment Programme and this ought to be granted more

funds  by  the  Government,  and  should  be  supported  by  the

employers.    In   view  of  the  concern   of   possibly   more

retrenchments,  we  require  the  tripartite  partners  to  work

together  to resolve the issue.  I support the plea made  by  Mr

Lim  Boon Heng that the employers should only retrench as a last

resort  and  not  resort to it simply as a way to  reduce  their

operations  by  terminating the services of their  workers  whom

they do not want.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this motion tabled by the NMP, Mr Cyrille Tan,

a labour leader, shows how the NTUC and the labour movement want

to  increase  their contribution for the benefit of the  workers

and the community.  Therefore, the essence of this motion tabled

by  him  and  my  colleague  is how  to  enhance  the  value  of

contribution to the members, the employers, and the community in

general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC 21 is a long-term programme, consisting of five

principles   which   were  mapped  out  by  the   whole   labour

organisation.  It is an effort to contribute to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



quality of the members and the community in general.  Our labour

movement announced details of NTUC 21 recently and I would  like

to  remind Members about the five principles.  The first  is  to

enhance  employability  for life for  our  workers;  second,  to

strengthen competitiveness through shared responsibility.  And I

would  like  to  emphasise here that  the  key  word  is  shared

responsibility.  Third, to build a healthy body, a healthy mind,

because  a worker who aspires to perform well would not be  able

to  do  it without good health.  Fourth, to care more and  share

more  with  the community.  And fifth, to strengthen the  labour

movement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these principles is not only to bring benefit to

the members of the unions, but it is also for the benefit of the

employers  and  the  community  in  general.   What  the  labour

movement wishes to achieve is a better quality of life where the

needs of every Singaporean are given attention and support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the labour movement pays particular attention to

the  interest of Singaporeans generally and likes to  share  the

benefits  with others, and this can be achieved more effectively

if NTUC and the members work together with the leadership of the

PAP  more  earnestly.   And  on this basis,  our  unions  should

continue  to  receive support from the social partners  of  this

tripartism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC and the Singapore labour movement are the first to

respond to resolve the national issues involving the workers and

the  community.  Through child care centres, NTUC has helped  to

cater  to the need for child care while the mothers are at work.

Through  NTUC FairPrice, our labour movement helps us to control

increase  in  prices  of  the daily necessities.   Through  NTUC

Income,  we  attempt  to  provide  insurance  for  our  workers,

especially  the low-income group who is not reached out  by  the

other insurance companies.  Our labour movement also works  fast

to  encourage more women to return to work.  And now,  realising

that  Singaporeans  have  a long life expectancy  and  that  the

families require help to take care of the aged and sick parents,

our labour movement has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



formed  a  new cooperative, that is, NTUC Eldercare Cooperative,

which will be of great service to the low-income group.  At  the

beginning, NTUC Eldercare will set up a day-care centre for  the

elderly,  especially those who are sick.  We are aware  that  in

future,  the need for the care of the elders will be  a  greater

responsibility and it will overtake the responsibility of taking

care  of  children.  Therefore, to maintain this  centre,  which

will  soon  be set up, the cooperative will expand its services,

for example, by managing homes for the aged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in Singapore we have a concerned and caring

labour  movement.  NTUC and the Singapore trade unions  want  to

contribute  to society.  Year by year, its members' contribution

to social work and to the labour movement continues to increase.

This  includes services such as home adoption scheme, home visit

scheme, blood donation and also meals for the needy.  There  are

also   plans  to  promote  volunteer  service  and  fund-raising

projects  to assist the welfare organisations.  In other  words,

the  spirit of voluntarism is flourishing in NTUC and our labour

movement.   This is one way for our labor movement  to  increase

its value to society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when we are facing greater difficulty due to

retrenchment  and economic crisis, our workers and  the  general

public  would  need more support.  Employers can  work  together

with  the  labour  movement  to promote  social  services  among

workers  and  the  general  public,  whether  in  the  form   of

cooperation  within the companies or in the form  of  tripartite

cooperation at national level.  In this way, we can  extend  the

cooperation in other areas for the public benefit, and  we  will

be  able to build up the people's confidence towards Singapore's

integrity.  In difficult times, we need the people's  trust  and

confidence  for  our  leadership, so that we  can  preserve  and

enhance social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at what had happened in South Korea where the

workers are often in conflict with their employers, they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



now  questioning the calibre of the newly elected President, who

has  been  elected  but  yet  to be  installed,  and  whom  they

previously  supported  during the  general  election.   In  this

situation,  the  nature of the labour relations in  South  Korea

will continue and certainly it will affect not only the national

interest but also the Korean community's interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, there is an anticipation that there will be

a wave of riots and crisis in Asian countries resulting from the

economic  crisis which we are facing today.  So is it  time  now

for  us to discuss whether NTUC is dominated by PAP or not?   Or

whether we want to look into the future to step up our effort or

cooperation between the NTUC and the PAP, not only enhancing the

relations  but  also to expand it, with the involvement  of  the

employers,  so  that we will have tripartite partnerships  which

form a strong basis for Singapore.  In Singapore, a relationship

based  on trust should be strengthened, more so during difficult

times,  like  what we are experiencing today.  The thrust  among

the  tripartite  partners  could  be  stepped  up  by  renewing,

intensifying,  and  expanding  the  cooperation  which  we  have

achieved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  Singapore's achievements in economic  and  trade

development   are   attributable  to  the  joint   efforts   and

cooperation  among the Government, employers and  trade  unions.

In  the  development  of this tripartite  partnership  based  on

peaceful  co-existence, we have experienced many challenges  and

difficulties. Sometimes, we may have some disputes  and  we  may

not  fully understand or agree with certain Government policies.

However, at the end of the day, we have always been able to sort

out   our  differences  through  discussion,  consultation   and

compromises.  So,  it  is  correct to say  that  the  tripartite

partnership's  approach  towards the  common  goal  and  problem

resolution  is  a very important success factor  to  Singapore's

economic development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the spirit of solidarity and unity, our unions,

employers  and Government have been able to cooperate  and  work

together  to  maintain this long-lasting harmonious partnership.

The  resulting economic environment has enhanced the  confidence

of  local  and  foreign investors. This is  also  the  strongest

weapon  we  have  in dealing with the current regional  economic

crisis. Therefore, I agree with the views of Mr Cyrille Tan  and

support his motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this tripartite partnership, the employers

are  involved  in  two bilateral relationships.   The  first  is

between  the  employers and the trade unions or  the  employees.

The  second is between the employers and the Government.  In the

relationship between the employers and the employees,  the  most

serious  problems  faced by employers are: (1)  high  labour  or

personnel  costs, (2) job-hopping, (3) the quality and  training

of staff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three problems are inter-related. If the quality of

an  employee  is  high,  a  higher pay is  justifiable.  If  the

turnover  rate  is  high, the incentive for employers  to  train

their workers will naturally be reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the largest and most precious asset of

Singapore is its human resource.  Training is very important  if

we  want  to  enhance the value of this asset.   If  the  labour

turnover rate is too high, businesses will not be able to obtain

a  reasonable  return from their investment in  training.   This

will  undoubtedly lower their willingness to put in  efforts  to

train their employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to encourage employers to strengthen the training

of  employees, the business sector has proposed in the past that

the  vesting  of  employer-contributed  CPF  be  linked  to   an

employee's  length of service. In other words,  if  an  employee

leaves  the job before fulfilling the pre-set minimum length  of

service,  he  will  not be able to enjoy the whole  of  the  CPF

contributions  made by the employer during his  employment  with

that  employer.  The employee's entitlement should be pegged  to

the length of his service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of grasping the information technology

cannot   be   underestimated.    There   is   no   doubt    that

computerisation  will enhance the productivity  of  a  business.

However,  many small and medium size enterprises still lack  the

required  expertise to use computers and apply  the  information

technology.   Therefore,  I would suggest  that  the  Government

provide  a  special fund to encourage employers  to  send  their

employees  for related training.  The use of the fund  could  be

for direct sponsorship, double tax allowances for employers,  or

tax deductibility for employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the relationship between the employers and the

Government,  the employers face several problems, such  as  many

regulations  and charges, resulting in ever increasing  business

costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relatively speaking, our Government has a larger hand in

Singapore's  economy.  As  a result,  many  Government  measures

directly  affect  the  operating cost of  businesses,  including

personnel  cost,  cost of utilities, rentals  of  factories  and

shops, all kinds of taxes and levies, etc.  Naturally, employers

keep  a  close eye on Government policies.  They very much  hope

that the Government will also look at the problems they have  to

face seriously and provide assistance as and when necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of personnel costs, I think it is fair to say that

the  Government is the largest employer in Singapore.  As  such,

the  pay  adjustment in the public sector sets the lead for  the

private  sector.   Each year, when the civil  servants'  pay  is

adjusted  upwards and the bonus is generous, the private  sector

immediately faces the pressure to follow suit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, the Secretary-General of NTUC, Mr Lim Boon

Heng, told the workers that they should not expect too much  pay

rise  and  bonus this year unless productivity is  substantially

raised.  Such openness and straight talk are much appreciated by

the business community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the financial results of our businesses

may  have  yet  to  reflect the impact of the current  financial

storm sweeping through this region.  So far, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



level  of retrenchment may not have markedly increased.  But  we

must  not underestimate the impact this  financial turmoil  will

have  on our economy.  Therefore, I would like to appeal to  the

Government to appreciate the difficulties faced by the  business

community  and take the lead in adopting austerity  measures  in

terms of salary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of business cost, I feel that we should seriously

consider risk sharing between the Government and the businesses.

I would suggest that business costs such as energy costs and the

rental  of  factories,  offices and shops  be  linked  with  the

economic  condition.   This way, in times  of  slowing  economic

growth,  the  Government would be able to flexibly  adjust  such

costs more quickly, helping businesses when they need such  help

most.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to stress that in the midst of

this  regional  financial crisis, the economic  difficulties  we

will soon face will be daunting.  I would like to appeal to  the

Government,  in keeping with its character of tackling  problems

head-on  without  being  rigidly  confined  by  conventions,  to

propose  a  balanced  budget for the coming  year  to  help  the

business  community  to ride out the severe  difficulties  lying

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government has no foreign debt. The foreign debt of

the  private  sector is not excessive either.   During  economic

downturns  when the private sector consumption drops, investment

slows  down,  and  the net export is likely  to  fall,  the  net

expenditure  in  the public sector is the only  factor  left  to

provide  the  needed stimulus for the recovery of  the  economy.

While  the  business community is busy weathering  the  regional

economic  storm, our economy will need the Government  to  adopt

relatively  expansionary fiscal policies such as  tax  cuts  and

increased development expenditure to mitigate the impact of  the

economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government has always been extremely

prudent.  It has always insisted on fixing the small holes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



here and there during the sunny days.  Often, even though things

appeared  all  right, the Government still wanted to  strengthen

the  roof,  the wall, and the pillars.  Some of us  indeed  felt

that the Government might have been too risk averse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it was with such unparalleled prudence and

conservatism  that, year after year, during the  time  when  the

economy  was  well and sound, Singapore was able  to  accumulate

large  surpluses to generate the huge reserve we now have.   All

Singaporeans  should  be  grateful to  the  Government  for  its

foresight   and  discipline.   The  Government   was  absolutely

correct  in  repeatedly stressing that we need to save  for  the

rainy  days.  Well, seeing the financial turmoil blowing through

the  region, it appears that such rainy days have finally dawned

on us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said last Sunday that, if the

region's   economic   crisis   was   confounded   by   political

instability,  we  would  also be adversely  affected  and  could

expect more hard times ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, given what has been happening in the stock

and foreign exchange markets and the way events are unfolding in

the neighbouring countries these few days, I think the hard time

is already with us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries which sought IMF assistance have no choice but to

exercise  austerity. The business community I represent  however

feels that our Government should not propose an austerity budget

at  this difficult time. On the contrary, the Government  should

fill  the  gap  resulted from the private  sector's  cutback  by

increasing the development expenditure to stimulate the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY1987, we had a deficit of $1.16 billion. The year

1987  was  the year of recovery following the 1985-86  recession

and  the 2.6% (of GDP) fiscal deficit reflected the Government's

measures to tackle the economic problem at that time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, what we are facing is a regional economic crisis

which has the potential to blow up to a global scale. It will be

more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



complex  and  far more challenging than what we  faced  back  in

1985. Therefore, it warrants a balanced budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, undoubtedly, as a very small country,

Singapore  alone  cannot resolve the regional financial  crisis.

The  recovery  of our economy relies on the improvement  of  the

economic  climate  of  the  regional  countries.  However,   the

Government can take certain suitable measures to give a shot  in

the  arm  to our domestic economy. This will be consistent  with

our  cooperative  and harmonious tripartite partnership  spirit,

with which we can work together to ride out this extraordinarily

difficult crisis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to counter the comment by Mr Chiam, the

Member  for Potong Pasir, that somehow the unions, the  NTUC  in

Singapore,  are controlled by the PAP and that for some  strange

reasons  because  of  this, the tripartism  that  we  have  been

building  and  working  along this  while  is  somewhat  hollow.

Perhaps,  he  forgot that many unionists have been  the  leading

founders of the PAP in the 50s and the working relationship with

the unions has always been a symbiotic part of the PAP political

set-up.   He  made  the comment also that because  the  Minister

without Portfolio is the Secretary-General of the NTUC, for that

reason  the workers' interests are somehow compromised.   But  I

take  the  other  view that because we have a  Minister  in  the

Cabinet  who  knows  deeply the issues  facing  the  workers  in

Singapore  that the PAP Government shows concern and  value  the

input by the Secretary-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tripartism has served Singapore well and Singaporeans, in

general, have benefited for the last 25 years.  And in the  face

of  these new global challenges we are seeing in the new  global

market  and the new open integrated economy that we are  facing,

it  is  timely  that  we have this motion in  the  name  of  the

Nominated  Member of Parliament to urge this House to renew  and

express our new commitment to this new tripartism.  This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



task  has  equal  urgency,  not just for  the  Government  whose

responsibility is to ensure good governance and improve the well-being  of  the people, but also to employers whose more  mundane

aim  is  of  course to ensure good profitability and growth  for

their respective lines of businesses.  And in this respect, I am

really very impressed by the speech made by the Nominated Member

of  Parliament just before me who is also an employer  with  the

Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce for his very deep and very

fruitful contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial market turmoil in the region does not detract

us  from this over-riding task of renewing tripartism.     After

this  financial and currency turmoil is over and a new alignment

of  the exchange rates takes place, the regional economies  that

adjust   themselves   appropriately  to  further   deepen   this

integration with the open international economy, or  as  in  the

words  of the previous NMP who spoke, those who bite the  bullet

to adjust will be the stronger than before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tripartite partnership forges this unique Singaporean

understanding, an implicit social modus operandus,  short  of  a

social  contract, whereby workers who are led by the  NTUC,  the

Government and employers, including the more enlightened foreign

employers,  work towards the common objectives of stability  and

overall  economic growth within a more moderate  and  reasonable

wage  system, in line with productivity growth in an environment

of industrial peace and goodwill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tripartite model has served us well for the past

quarter  of  a  century.  There are four main  factors  why  the

present  situation  is slightly different  or  quite  different.

First,  the population is aging.  Within the next 10 years,  20%

of our population will be aged 60 and above.  This is a sobering

thought.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the economy being more mature will no more be

growing at the high rate that we have been accustomed to.   With

a  more  mature  economy, emphasis on productivity  improvement,

rather than just growing by adding more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



foreign  labour  and  capital,  will  become  more  crucial   to

sustaining real growth to ensure a rising standard of living for

our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, is the increasing use of information technology to

all  areas  of business - in design, manufacturing and services.

Those  countries  with the most appropriately relevant  type  of

education system will be able to produce the people to work  the

new  manufacturing design systems.  And a young flexible  modern

educated workforce will be necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the irresistible and irreversible drive of

globalisation  will  throw up new game rules  for  transnational

corporations, to invest, to reward management and workers across

the  globe,  and  to manage MNC business in an integrated  world

economy.  The foreign direct investments we are attracting today

are  no  more the cheap labour investments 25 years ago.  Today,

our investments are in high skill-intensive and high value-added

industries requiring high capital intensity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With further skill training needed for new jobs and more

intensive global competition, all parties must re-examine  their

part in this partnership to ensure their relevance.  Labour with

skill and knowledge base will be in demand. Because of this, the

growth  potential for wages in this high technology sector  will

be  relatively higher, commensurate with their growth and  their

contribution.  In the same way, there will be certain sectors of

the  labour  market  which  will  run  the  potential  risk   of

structural  under-employment or structural  unemployment.   This

problem is not unique and is not new.  The American and European

workers faced this problem in their economies more than 10 years

ago,  when  their  very own MNCs and businesses relocated  their

factories from their home countries to the developing countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we will see in the likely scenario will be unequal

development  in  the labour market, and unequal  development  of

wages  in  the  industrial  sector.   The  skill-intensive   and

knowledge-intensive sector



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



will see a higher trend of growth.  The less skill intensive  or

knowledge   intensive  or,  worse,  technologically  obsolescent

sector, will see slow, no growth or decline,  At the lower  end,

we  may  even  have  the  risk  of structural  under-employment,

especially among our older and not-so-well trained workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem faced here is compounded by the rising aging

working population.  Also, the fact is that there are 700,000 in

our  workforce of 1.8 million, ie, 40% who have less than  lower

secondary level of education.  This makes the retraining of this

group of workers a daunting and challenging task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This call for a new commitment to tripartism, therefore, is

a  call  for  a  new awareness for all parties to recognise  and

prepare  ourselves  to  manage this ambiguity  in  the  not  too

distant future.  The policies we develop and pursue must  answer

to  the  competitive needs of the global economy in  high  value

added,  high  productivity and high capital or  skill  intensive

industries.   They must also answer to the need to  upgrade  the

skill of our workers by constant retraining.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for this tripartite partnership is not just

to manage the threat of structural under-employment, but also to

manage the need for high skill and knowledge intensive labour in

high  technology.  It is a paradox with a dual.  The neglect  or

the  failure  to  do  so in one will have  repercussion  on  the

overall  economy, leading to friction in the social  integration

of our people.  And as the Secretary-General of the NTUC said  a

moment  ago, solely relying on foreign labour is only a  partial

solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, retraining and training are crucial elements

in  the  solution.  I urge the tripartite partnership, with  the

Government as the spearhead, to think of more ways and means  to

provide retraining for our lower skilled workers to enable  them

to  carry on to contribute to the economy, which they have  been

doing  for so long up to now.  Various schemes are presently  in

place  - skill certification scheme, skill redevelopment scheme,

etc.    However,  more  are  needed.   More  support  from   the

Government and the employers is needed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To appreciate this particular problem, I have just said

that 40% of our workers  of 1.8 million in the workforce have  a

lower  secondary  education.   To  train  these  workers  in   a

classroom is not so effective.  But I believe these people  have

plenty of commonsense if we can get the message to them in their

own language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, the total amount of grants committed for skills

development training was, according to the annual report that  I

read,  $67.8  million  for  483,000  places  for  all  ages  and

education class.  The average training grant per training  place

was  therefore  about $140.  About 26% of the  grants  committed

goes  to workers with below secondary and NTC 3 education,  with

the  total grant for this category at $17 million.  The  average

training  grant per training place in this category is therefore

at  about $107.  If you work at a standard $6 per hour of  wage,

this  works  out  to  approximately 18 hours  of  training.   Of

course,  at full cost, which means if you consider not just  the

skills development funded but the other part of the cost that is

borne  either by the trainee or by the employer, the  full  cost

could  well  be six to seven times, as was pointed  out  by  the

Secretary-General.   I  believe that this  is  not  too  high  a

figure.  In other words, the urgency of the task is actually  to

raise this amount.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe a hand holding kind of approach on-the-job

training by the private sector with specific targets, monitoring

and output evaluation according to performance criteria combined

with  a compensation scheme by the Government for the period  of

hand holding OJT should be initiated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, there is a scheme for On-The-Job (OJT) training

administered  by  the  Skills Development Fund  for  a  National

Competency  Certificate.  It is training about 2,000 places  per

year,  according  to the SDF Annual Report,  administered  by  a

limited number of companies.  I believe the urgency of the  task

before  us  is so great that a more flexible OJT scheme  with  a

wider net of companies is needed.  And time is not on our side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary manual workers can be retrained to operate control

panels in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



automated mechanical systems in modern factories and warehouses.

I  have  seen  how  it worked at the SIA latest flight  kitchen.

Senior citizens can be trained to operate user friendly Point of

Sales (POS) machines in retail outlets.  The next time you visit

McDonald  restaurant, please take a look at their POS  machines.

The  key  buttons that the senior citizen is punching the  order

for  you  are  all in pictures, not in words, to facilitate  the

senior  citizens  who work there.  The days  of  the  macho  guy

operating  the port container lifting crane, sitting on  top  of

the  world,  are  numbered, because modern port  cranes  can  be

controlled on the ground, two at a time even by a female staff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally it takes longer for confidence building and hand

holding and familiarising with a new job environment.  Companies

in  operation should be encouraged to retrain their staff and to

have  another option through this hand holding OJT.  They should

be compensated for the full cost of the retraining period, and I

suggest  even  including any under-productivity variance  during

this  period  of retraining.  I am here referring to  retraining

assistance  for those genuine workers who are under-trained  who

genuinely need and seek work and to add value to the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the World Development Report of 1995, Workers in an

Integrating  World, it was reported that the success  of  public

retraining  schemes  generally,  in  the  experience   of   most

countries,  has not been very positive.  Hence, I am  suggesting

we should embark on more private retraining schemes, provided by

employers  and  support them, before the workers are  laid  off,

when  they  become public retraining cases, which is always  too

late and not specific and targetted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Development Report 1995 reported that careful

targetting, monitoring and evaluation of retraining schemes  are

keys to ensuring their effectiveness and preventing the waste of

scarce public resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tripartite partnership should reaffirm its commitment

to the global integration of the world economy.  By virtue of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



our  openness,  Singapore  has no choice  but  to  compete.   By

competing internationally, our businesses have to find their own

niches   and  fortes.   Capital  investment  and  talents   will

gravitate towards those areas most suitable to reward  them  and

most  efficient  to compete.  Fortunately, for a  small  country

like us, the world economy is only global; it is not all round.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In embracing the reality of globalisation and our need to

integrate  into  it,  the NTUC is actually checking  itself  and

ensuring   its  own  relevance.   The  best  way  to  face   the

competitive market challenge is to embrace it; to think and  act

global,  and  not to claim to think global and act  local.   The

NTUC  will also have to manage the stress and the strain of this

emerging  duality  in  the  labour  market,  and  to   work   in

partnership to come up with various retraining schemes in  place

sooner rather than later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the NTUC has been ever conscious of the

larger role that it can play and has played.  Under the guidance

of  the PAP Government, it has developed successfully the social

goal.   It has developed successfully many NTUC cooperatives  to

advance  the  welfare  of  workers and  Singaporeans.   In  this

respect,  I must also say that we need to have no apologies  for

it.   Just  now, Mr Chiam claimed that the NTUC is getting  more

and  more  into business.  Definitely, with a social  aim.   For

example, the NTUC Fairprice has been a major player in the  food

retailing scene to ensure stable and reasonable prices for basic

consumer  necessities.   INCOME  has  also  served  workers  and

Singaporeans  with  a  broad range  of  insurance  needs.   NTUC

Childcare  is  also  a  leading childcare service  provider  for

working  mothers.  There are others such as FOODFARE, DENTICARE,

HEALTHCARE  for pharmaceutics, and the latest, the  NTUC  Choice

Homes  for executive condominiums.  These are all extensions  of

cooperative  businesses which have the ultimate aim  of  serving

the interest and welfare of the workers.  Various NTUC Clubs and

Lifestyle Centres have also served workers' interests and  their

families' needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These social services that the NTUC provides through its

cooperatives are all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



done  through the competitive markets.  The social role  of  the

NTUC Cooperatives often go unsung and unnoticed.  They make  the

workers'  dollars stretch more and help raise their standard  of

living  by moderating the cost, and showing the private business

sectors  and competitors, whether they are French, local,  Dutch

or  Americans,  the  standard and the  benchmarks  in  cost  and

quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC Cooperatives are meeting the tripartite challenge

on   equal   grounds.    If  the  NTUC  Cooperatives   can   run

supermarkets,   insurance,   childcare   services,    healthcare

services,   taxi  services,  recreation  clubs  or  golf   clubs

successfully, there is no reason why it cannot run buses, before-and-after-school  care,  eldercare  services,  or   HDB   estate

maintenance services equally well, if we choose to do  so.   The

role  of  the unions is not restricted to collective  bargaining

for  collective  agreements  and to maintaining  the  industrial

peace.   That is the old mindset.  They have a social  role  and

today  the  NTUC Cooperatives and the NTUC is even a launch  pad

for  information technology in a joint project with the  NCB  in

launching  the  smart  card for electronic  cash  and  retailing

transactions for the unions and cooperatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new vision to tripartism, I urge the Government and

the  employers to join hand with the NTUC unions in widening the

social  role  for all three parties. They meet on equal  ground.

Businesses must also shift towards a more social perspective  in

their  longer range thinking.  After all, they can only  survive

if  they  can  find  a customer whether the  businesses  are  in

computers, software, IT or food retailing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One meaningful social role the employers and Government can

do  is  to  join  hands with the NTUC in a redoubled  effort  at

upgrading skills and retraining of our workers.  Broadening  OJT

is  a  good  way.  I urge the Government to help by  encouraging

more  private employers as well to obtaining easier  grants  and

compensation in a more flexible skill retraining scheme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Sir, before I speak

on  the  motion proper, allow me to say a few words on  what  Mr

Chiam had said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, we are in the midst of the fasting month

and no matter how tempting it is to partake in a debate with  Mr

Chiam,  I  would rather opt for food for the soul.   So  in  the

spirit  of  Ramadan,  I shall not belabour the  point.   Enough,

however,  for it to be said that although this is the  month  of

enlightenment,  unfortunately, there are still some  people,  as

the Malays would say, sudah terang, lagi bersuluh, meaning still

looking for light when it is very clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, Sir, I think we were all reminded yesterday

by  the NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam, that he is not only here as an NCMP

but  also as the leader of the Workers' Party, but unfortunately

when we are here discussing a very important issue of tripartism

and  the  fate  and  welfare of the workers,  Mr  Jeyaretnam  is

nowhere to be found.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me also, Sir, to use a glaring, and if you will

excuse  the  pun, the Blair-ing example of how even the  British

Labour  Party had to bow to certain pragmatic realities to  live

up  to contemporary demands.  Mr Blair's visit to Singapore  and

his tribute to our labour movement speaks well of our system.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.35 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My message is simple. Be realistic. Accept facts. Most

workers do and the results speak for themselves, be it in  terms

of  continued  employability,  rising  standard  of  living  and

quality of life for workers and a meaningful role for workers in

shaping their own future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now see how best the workers have shaped their past,

through  tripartism, and create their future, through  teamwork.

After  all, tripartism is not only about understanding the  past

but also gearing for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise in support of the motion by NMP Mr Cyrille Tan,

a highly respected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



leader  of  the labour movement.  First, allow me to declare  my

interest.   I  am  currently  the  Executive  Secretary  of  the

Singapore  Port Workers' Union (SPWU) and a member  of  the  PSA

Board of Directors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may be allowed to share my personal experience.

I  have  been  in management for about 25 years, but  my  recent

immersion  in  the  NTUC  and the SPWU is  most  educational  in

appreciating  tripartism.  Not only is it alive  and  well,  but

thriving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SPWU takes teamwork among the union, management and

Government  very  seriously, for it benefits  the  workers.   In

fact,  it  benefits all.  But I must hasten  to  add  that  this

harmonious state of affairs did not appear like magic.  It  came

through blood, sweat and tears.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPWU, the oldest union in Singapore, had a colourful and

chequered  past.   Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew  can  personally

vouch  for  the tumultuous years the union went through  in  its

early  history.  There was so much distrust then that  no  union

leader  worth  his  salt  dared even to  think  of  constructive

engagement.  It was Mr Lee's strategic intervention  that  saved

the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPWU never looked back since then. In many ways, the SPWU-PSA industrial relationship is exemplary now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When PSA corporatised last year, the spirit of tripartism

showed  its  human face. Whether during bargaining for  the  new

Collective  Agreement  or when adjusting  the  former  statutory

board's  prerogatives to the Employment Act's requirements,  the

union and the management worked constructively well to secure  a

win-win  situation for all.  The Ministry of Labour  was  always

there  to  lend  a  hand.   In fact, a tripartite  workshop-cum-dialogue on the Employment Act proved very successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This practice of tripartite consultation and decision-making has been institutionalised in many key policy-making

institutions,  for  example, in NWC, NPB  (now  the  PSB),  CPF,

ComChest,  HDB, IE, EDB, the polytechnics and the  universities,

even in the ad hoc committees to review and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



formulate recommendations on national and economic policies such

as  the  Economic  Committee (1986), Wage Reform,  Cost  Review,

Flexible Wage System and Employment Act of 1994.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here a picture, and possibly it was the first NWC

meeting, where most participants looked very solemn, in fact, at

first  very sullen, but compare it with the recent NWC  meeting.

You  can see very happy faces.  This is because they realise and

they  acknowledge  the contributions made by tripartism  through

institutions like NWC.  I quote Prof. Lim Chong Yah:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The National Wages Council could not have been formed (in

1972)   without   the   support  of   the   NTUC.    The   union

representatives were there to look after the workers' interests,

but  at  the same time they were also prepared to take  national

interests into consideration. There has always been cordial  but

tough  bargaining  among the three parties  in  the  process  of

coming  to a consensus.  Over the years, the NWC has contributed

to the building of tripartite cooperation and goodwill."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we look at the history of tripartism in

Singapore,  we will see that from the time when the economy  was

coming out of the doldrums in the early years of independence to

the  recession of the mid-80s and the many good years  following

that, tripartism had withstood the test of time.  I am confident

it  will  continue  to  do so.  Whether in economic  turbulence,

tranquillity or transition, tripartism triumphs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is effective communication and understanding of each

other's  role,  even trust.  While each has its own  perspective

and  interest,  when it comes to the crunch, national  interests

prevail.  As SM Lee once said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Each generation of union leaders must earn afresh the

trust  and respect of the workers they lead and of the  managers

they  negotiate with.  Similarly, managers must  also  earn  the

trust and respect of their workers to do well, they must balance

the  needs  of  their workers with those of management,  and  of

Government.   That  is  the  context  in  which  tripartism  can

succeed."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no masak masak or kelong of relations, like some

Members  may like to suggest that unions are controlled  by  PAP

MPs or PAP personalities.  Tripartism has indeed succeeded.   In

the words of PM



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



Goh,  "let's  not  change formulas which have  proven  to  be  a

success  and useful for us."  But obviously, we cannot  rest  on

our laurels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just how important a close working relationship among the

three  parties  is will be clearly shown in the near  future  as

Singapore, together with the rest of ASEAN, fight to restore the

confidence  and  stability shakened by the  current  turmoil  in

regional  economies  caused  by plunging  currencies  and  stock

markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three steps which we can take in preparing for

the 21st century, as far as tripartism is concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Understand the lessons of the past and pass them down to

subsequent  generations  for tripartism went  through  different

phases during difficult times and good times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Learn from other experiences and refine our models of

tripartite relationships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Find ways to strengthen workers' stake and role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is about understanding mutually reinforcing roles.

There  is a need to try to bring aims and aspirations of  labour

and  management to a happy middle ground.  Labour will  have  to

work   hard  towards  helping  businesses  succeed  via   higher

productivity and no unnecessary demands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is after all basic commonsense. It is like a three-legged stool. It will stand if all three are strong. If any

of  them  is weak, the stool will collapse.  It is therefore  in

everyone's  interest  to  see  all  succeed.   It  is  like  the

"prosper-thy-neighbour" concept.  All  must  pull  in  the  same

direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also look at different models of tripartism working

(or  not working) today, including those outside Singapore,  and

improve  ours where and when necessary.  The question of  giving

workers  a  bigger  stake, for example, the question  of  worker

representation on company boards can also be looked into.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a time when tripartism will be put to a test.

We  need to be creative to see how each party will have to  play

its  role.  Take training and retraining, for example, not  many

companies will be keen to do it during difficult times, when  it

is all the more important.  Unions and the Government could help

to  look  into  this and also the plight of those who  might  be

affected by the likely economic turmoil in the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to sound alarmist, but in these troubling

times,  businesses will face difficult conditions and some  will

fail.   Some,  if not many, workers will lose their  jobs.   The

Government will have a harder time charting the economic  course

of  the country.  But if all work together, the damages would be

lessened.   Fewer business failures, fewer retrenchments,  lower

unemployment and fewer social and political problems.  And  when

the  time comes for sacrifice - on everyone's part - we must  be

prepared to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have shown what we can do collectively in the mid-80s

recession, and we can do it again, if need be.  When things  get

really critical, as they could well turn out to be for Singapore

and  the region in facing the current economic turmoil,  as  the

saying goes, we must hang together, or most assuredly, we  would

hang separately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I have a

clarification on the speech by the Member for Cheng San GRC?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Did he misunderstand any part of your

speech?  I do not believe he misunderstood your speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No. I want a clarification from him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> All right. Make it short.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Much obliged, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that the Member for Cheng San GRC should be

bringing  religion into this matter that I spoke.  He says  that

this is the month of Ramadan and therefore he is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



more  tolerant,  otherwise his criticism  of  me  will  be  more

severe,  if I have got him right.  I must inform the Member  for

Cheng  San  that I am not a new MP.  If I had been taken  in  by

criticism,  I  would not be in this House.  This  is  my  fourth

term.  So he can criticise me as he likes, whether it is Ramadan

or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clarification, Sir, in regard to this tripartism which I

have  attracted criticisms from the last four speakers.  To  me,

probably  to  any  ordinary  person in  Singapore,  you  have  a

Minister from the political party, who is also the head  of  the

trade  union movement, how can there be true tripartism  if,  in

fact,  the trade union is controlled by a Minister?  A  Minister

must  abide by Cabinet's collective decision.  You cannot  stray

away from it.  So if the political party has made a policy, when

this  Minister  goes  to  sit as the head  of  the  trade  union

movement,  he  must abide by the decision of the Cabinet.   And,

therefore, if you look at it truly, this is not tripartism under

this  system, although it works well.  Whether it works well  is

another issue.  What I am talking about is just looking  at  it,

whether  it  is tripartism or, in fact, it is dualism,  I  would

say.  It is not true tripartism.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, that is not a clarification

at all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I want the speakers to see whether

or not what I said is correct.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> We are running short of time. I will

not allow any more clarification.  Mr Lim.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

this  motion  is about tripartism in Singapore and  how  we  can

strengthen  tripartism to prepare Singapore  for  an  even  more

challenging  future.  But it is not easy to understand  what  is

tripartism.  So a little boy asks his father,  "Daddy,  what  is

tripartism?  How does it work and how does it affect the life of

the people and their future?"  The father says, "Son, it is very

simple.  Look at this family.  I represent the capitalist.  Your

mother,  she is the government.  You represent the people.   Our

maid,  she  represents the labour.  And your  baby  sister,  she

represents the future."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I interrupt, if Mr Lim is willing

to give way?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The example he is giving is way out.

There  is  no comparison between this tripartism and members  of

the family.  As the mother ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, that is not a

clarification.  Can you resume your seat?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Thank you, Sir. So the son asks the

father again, "Yes, I understand all these components.  But  how

do  they link together?"  So the father says, "Son, don't expect

me  to teach you everything.  Just observe how we interact among

ourselves  and  you  will  understand the  relationship."   That

night,  in the middle of the night, the son was trying to  sleep

but  could not, still thinking about tripartism.  Then he  heard

his baby sister crying very loudly for quite a while and somehow

nobody attended to her.  Finally, he decided to call his mother.

He  went  to  the master bedroom.  His mother was sound  asleep.

The strange thing was that his father was not in the bedroom. He

thought, "Okay, since mummy is sound asleep, maybe I should call

the  maid  to attend to my sister."  He groped in the  dark  and

went to the maid's room.  Before he could knock on the door,  he

heard  his father's voice in the maid's room.  And the maid  was

telling  his  father,  "Sir, please leave  me  alone.   If  not,

tomorrow morning I am going to report to your wife."  He went on

to the baby's room and found that the reason why his baby sister

was  crying was because she did a big job.  Anyway, he went back

to sleep.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, during breakfast, his father asked him,

"Son,  have you figured out what is tripartism?"  His son  said,

"Daddy, it is very simple.  When the government is sleeping, the

capitalist will try to exploit the labour.  The people will have

to grope in the dark, and the future will be in a big mess."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I use this story to illustrate the point that it is

not easy to achieve harmony in tripartism.  In fact, if you look

at the world



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



today, because of rising unemployment, tripartism today is under

even  greater stress.  In June this year, I was in France.   The

French  union recommended that the government should reduce  the

working hours from 39 hours to 35 hours a week by the year 2000.

The   socialist-led  government  endorsed  the  proposal.    The

employers'  federation  objected  violently  to  that  proposal.

Finally,  the  head  of  the employers'  federation  decided  to

resign.   His members called on him to stay on.  But his comment

was, "What you need now is not a negotiator, not a collaborator.

What  you  need now is a fighter to be your leader."  Basically,

the tripartite partners in France had decided to go to war.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, I was in Japan to attend the biennial

convention of RENGO, which is the equivalent of NTUC, in  Japan.

When  the  new  leader of RENGO was elected,  the  next  day  he

appeared on the front page of a Japan newspaper and the headline

was  something along the line that "RENGO new head calls on  SDP

to  quit LDP."  Basically he was quoted as calling on the SDP to

end  its  alliance with the LDP, so that the opposition  parties

can  go against the government.  Here is another example of  how

tripartism is not working in a harmonious manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made use of these two examples to illustrate that at

the  end of the day, if the tripartite partners cannot work well

together,  it is the people, the workers, who will  suffer.   In

the  case  of  Singapore,  the  NTUC,  the  Government  and  the

employers' federation would always work closely together under a

spirit  of  mutual support and mutual respect.   But  sometimes,

unfortunately, this spirit is being misunderstood as the  labour

movement  under the control of the Government.  I want  to  take

this  opportunity to highlight, firstly, that within the  labour

movement,  the highest level of decision-making is  the  Central

Committee of the NTUC, comprising 21 members.  These 21  members

are  elected  by the 260,000 union members that we have  through

their  delegates  once every three years.  Of these  21  Central

Committee  members, a majority of them, in fact,  two-thirds  of

them, are grassroots leaders, leaders who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



respected, like Cyrille Tan, and so on.  Basically, anybody  who

wants  to  go into the Central Committee would have to gain  the

trust  and  the respect of the labour movement, of the  members,

because  if they are not elected, they cannot be in the  Central

Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Secretary-General of the NTUC - I want to make it

very  clear  -  is  not appointed by the PAP  Government  to  be

Secretary-General of the labour movement.  He is elected by  the

labour  movement and elected by the Central Committee to be  its

Secretary-General.  Some may have the impression that if the MPs

are  advisers to affiliated unions, the labour MPs  are  running

the  unions.  Here again, I would like to point out  that  under

the NTUC, we have 78 affiliated unions and the affiliated unions

do  not  have  to be affiliated to NTUC if they do not  see  the

benefit  of being affiliated to the NTUC.  There is  no  law  in

Singapore to say that unions must be affiliated to the NTUC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the affiliated unions are run by the Presidents

and  the General Secretaries.  Take, for example, the electronic

unions.  NMP Cyrille Tan is the General Secretary of the  United

Workers of Electronic and Electrical Industries.  So he  is  the

CEO  of the union, and therefore it is not right to say that the

affiliated unions are being controlled or managed by the  labour

MPs.  My main point is this - even though the labour movement is

an  independent movement, it does not mean that we must adopt  a

confrontational approach towards tripartism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we have this symbiotic relationship with the

PAP  Government is for very simple reasons, and  very  often  we

forget about these.  We must always remember who are the members

of the labour movement - they are the workers of Singapore.  And

who  are  the  workers of Singapore?  They are the  citizens  of

Singapore.  And if you think about it, when the labour  movement

talks  about  helping our workers to live a better life,  it  is

completely in line with the PAP Government's objective of making

Singapore the best home for all Singaporeans.  It is because  of

this  complete  alignment  of our interest  that  we  have  this

symbiotic relationship, this harmony in tripartism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the labour movement, we believe that the best way to

serve the interest of our workers, as our Secretary-General  has

said many times, the best welfare that we can give to any worker

of  Singapore, is to give him a job.  The best protection we can

give  to our workers of Singapore is to achieve full employment.

Because  in  a full employment situation, no employer  would  be

able  to try to exploit the workers even if he wants to.  Guided

by  this  end  objective  of protecting and  looking  after  the

interests  of  the  workers,  who  are  also  the  citizens   of

Singapore,  the tripartite partners have always worked  together

under  this spirit of mutual support and mutual respect.   As  a

result,  let me remind this House that since 1973 to 1996,  over

this  period  of about 23 years, according to labour statistics,

the  real income of Singaporeans has gone up by 5.4% a year over

the  last  23  years.  I believe that this is an achievement  no

other country is able to match.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having talked about how tripartism has succeeded up to

now, I would like to touch on the future.  Why do we debate this

motion in this House?  Because the Asia-Pacific is going to be a

very  different  Asia-Pacific by the year 2000.   And  for  that

matter, the whole world is going to be a very different world by

the  year 2000.  The reason is very simple.  Today, with  rising

unemployment all over the world, with 35 million people  in  USA

working  on  part-time basis; 18 million in  Europe  unemployed;

2.31  million  workers in Japan jobless, every  country  is  now

taking tough measures to reform themselves.  The OECD countries,

just  two months ago, held a two-day job conference in Tokyo  to

discuss  how they can create employment for the youths  and  how

they  can  work together to retrain the workers.   In  Korea,  a

tripartite  panel  has been set up to look  into  how  they  can

legalise  layoff of labour.  By the year 2000, I  am  very  sure

that  all  these countries are going to be much more competitive

because they are prepared to bite the bullet.  They are prepared

to  take tough measures.  In Singapore, today we are in  a  much

better  position  than anybody else.  The question  is:  are  we

prepared to take tough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



measures  today  so that by the year 2000, we will  continue  to

remain ahead in a more competitive world?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong disagreed with what the Secretary-General

said  on the retrenchment sequence and I think his point is that

foreign workers should go first and local workers ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No. I did not say that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> So you agree with Mr Lim Boon Heng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I said they can be abused.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> My apologies. Let me repeat again, if

there is such an idea, I like to explain why such an idea is not

the  right  idea.   Because the important issue  which  we  must

understand is that the challenge facing Singapore today  is  not

an  employment  problem.  It is an employability problem  and  I

think this is an issue most people do not understand fully.   If

I  may  quote  an example and this is a real life  example.   In

October  last year, a consumer electronics company  closed  down

their  operation in Singapore.  They had 938 workers retrenched.

Of  the 938 workers, a majority were unskilled workers.  So  the

union  talked to the workers and we identified 240 of them  whom

we  thought could have the potential to be retrained to go  into

the new growth sector, like wafer fabrication.  After six months

of  hard work, we finally managed to channel about 40 of them to

go  into  the  wafer fabrication operation.  We found  them  the

employment.   We  provided the training  to  them.   Within  two

months,  more than half of them had left the jobs.  And,  today,

we are down to about 15 of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my point here is this. In

Singapore today, we are not having an employment problem.   What

we  have  here is a problem of employability. If our  retrenched

workers who are unskilled or semi-skilled and if they prefer  to

remain as unskilled workers, then in time to come, they may find

themselves not able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



to  take on the job, not because there is no job in the economy,

but  because  they do not have the right skills to take  on  the

job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDB is now targeting to bring in about $8 billion to

$10  billion worth of investments every year.  Our understanding

is that, in the past, for every three jobs created through these

foreign  investments, two jobs are semi-skilled  and  unskilled.

Today, the situation has changed.  Today, and in the future, for

every  three jobs that will be created in the economy, only  one

job will be unskilled and semi-skilled.  The other two jobs, two-third  of  the  jobs,  will require skilled manpower,  technical

manpower,  or  professional  manpower.   So  in  the   face   of

retrenchment, many of our unskilled workers will be  retrenched.

The question is: can they move on to this new growth sector like

wafer fabrication?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, in the newspaper, we read about the speculation

that  Seagate was retrenching 20% of its workers.  But,  at  the

same  time,  in the same newspaper, we read about EDB announcing

that  the  tenth  wafer fabrication plants will  be  set  up  in

Singapore.   Every wafer fabrication plant will  create  800  to

1,000  jobs.   With 10 wafer fabrication plants, there  will  be

8,000 to 10,000 jobs.  And over the next five to seven years, if

we  are able to remain competitive and if we are able to achieve

the  target  of having 25 wafer fabrication plants in Singapore,

there  will  be  employment opportunities for  about  20,000  to

25,000  workers.   But  the catch is this.   Every  one  of  the

workers  must at least preferably be a semi-skilled  or  skilled

worker.   So the issue here is how fast can we move to help  our

unskilled  workers  in Singapore to upgrade themselves  so  that

they can take on this better paying job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, here, I would like to propose that

it  is  now  time  for  action.   We  have  been  talking  about

structural unemployment for the last one to two years.  We  have

been  talking  about training and retraining for the  last  many

years.   But  the problem is that training does not  necessarily

lead  to  enhanced employability.  According to SDF records,  of

the  training supported under SDF, less than 10% led  to  skills

certification,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



meaning  that  the  majority  of  the  training  are  functional

training,  ie,  helping workers to be more productive  in  their

current  jobs.   What we need now is to focus  on  training  our

workers for future jobs which will enable them to become skilled

workers  of  the  future.  So in that regard, I  would  like  to

propose  that  it  is about time that we brought  the  level  of

tripartism in Singapore to a higher plane.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan, the NMP, suggested the setting up of a

Tripartism  Advisory  Committee to advise  the  Government,  the

tripartite  partners.  I would like to go one step  further.   I

propose we set up a Tripartism 21 Action Committee because it is

time  for  action.  Time is not on our side.  With  the  current

financial  turmoil, I think we are going to have even less  time

now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the Tripartism 21 Action Committee focus on

two  areas.   The  first  area  is how  to  remain  competitive.

Secondly, how to enhance employability.  For example, the Action

Committee,  through the collaborative efforts of the union,  the

employer and the Government, can firstly identify what kinds  of

skills  are needed in our economy for the next five to 10 years.

These skills should include not just technical skills, but  also

skills  relating  to technology, thinking skills,  interpersonal

skills  and  language skills so that the workers will  be  well-rounded  workers.  Secondly, I propose that this committee  look

into  a  comprehensive skills certification system.  We need  to

put  in  place  a skills certification system for  all  the  new

growth  sectors,  in the manufacturing sector  as  well  as  the

services  sector, so that there will be a systematic roadmap  to

guide  the  skills development of workers.  Thirdly, the  Action

Committee should work on the whole idea of skills redevelopment.

We  have said enough about 39% of the workforce being unskilled,

under-educated,  and so on.  The question is: how  can  we  help

them to go through this whole process of skills certification?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SRP was launched in December 1996 at the initiative of

the  NTUC.  And, today, we have managed to convince 27 companies

to  sign  up 3,100 workers and everyone of them is going through

training that will lead to skills certification.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



By  next month, when we launch the third batch of SRP companies,

we  are targeting to have 50 companies supporting at least 5,000

workers.  The progress is promising and we believe that if  this

programme is expanded into a national programme and if given the

full  support of the union, the employer and the Government,  we

believe  we  can  convince  enough  unskilled  workers  to  take

training seriously so that they can enhance their employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Action Committee should seriously look into

how  we can channel workers from the downsizing sectors to  move

into  the new growth sectors.  The consumer electronics  sector,

for  example, is downsizing very rapidly.  In 1997, we saw a few

companies moving their operations to other lower cost locations.

At the same time, we are seeing many new operations being set up

in    Singapore,    in    wafer   fabrication,    petrochemical,

pharmaceutical and other services sectors.  What we have  to  do

is  to concentrate on these workers who are going to be affected

by  the downsizing of the lower value, relatively speaking,  the

more  labour-intensive sector and move them into the new  growth

sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area that we are going into is on the need to

redesign the jobs in the industry.  The workforce is aging.   In

fact,  many workers who are in their 40s have already  expressed

concern  that if and when they are retrenched, they do not  have

the  confidence of finding new jobs.  Because if you look at the

job advertisements in the newspapers, quite a number of them  do

specify  that they are looking for workers who are  either  less

than  35  or 40 years old.  And, increasingly, we are  concerned

that  middle-aged  workers and not so  young  workers  may  have

greater  difficulties re-entering the job market should they  be

retrenched.   Therefore, I think this is  an  area  whereby  the

tripartism  committee  should look  into  and  see  how  we  can

incentivise, and encourage the employers to restructure jobs  so

that they can be more suitable for the not-so-young workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Singapore, the

Government has the Singapore 21 Vision.  For the NTUC, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



have the NTUC 21 Vision. The employers' federation has the SNEF 21 Vision,

and all of us are working towards the same objective,

which  is to make sure that the economy will remain competitive,

the  companies will remain profitable and that the workers  will

remain  employable.  We hope that this motion will  be  endorsed

strongly  by this House.  We hope that concrete action  will  be

taken  to  bring the tripartite partners closer so that,  as  we

move forward into the future, we can continue to strengthen  the

competitiveness  of Singapore, and continue  to  strengthen  the

employability  of our workers so that in the 21st  century,  our

workers can live a better life in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you,

Sir, for giving me this opportunity to speak.  I rise to support

this  motion.   In the face of very difficult circumstances  and

the bad times ahead, it is necessary for us to come together  to

tackle  the  growing challenges.  I think there  will  be  tough

choices, probably tougher than the ones we had in 1985  when  we

had  a recession.  We survived that and I hope this one we  will

do better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to raise five issues, Sir. During the last

recession in 1985, the Government resorted to temporary  cutting

of  the  employer's CPF contribution as a measure to revive  the

economy.   Given  that, nowadays, most people  have  drawn  down

their CPF contribution to service their housing loans or to  buy

shares, thus reducing the security nests for old age protection,

does  the  Government consider cutting the CPF as still possible

this time round?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second issue. Employers are looking closely at cost

cutting  and  cost  containment  strategies  to  ride  out  this

turmoil.  One of the key factors in this exercise, and I am sure

is the focus of this tripartite discussion, is wage control.  In

1986,  the  Government  called for  wage  restraint  policy.   I

remembered the protests of the workers and the applause from the

employers  at  the same time.  And I would like  to  know  if  a

similar strategy is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



considered appropriate this time round to ease the cost  burdens

of struggling enterprises.  And to reinforce Mr Tay Beng Chuan's

proposal  earlier on, since the civil service sector is  by  far

the largest employer in Singapore and its wage policy inevitably

sets  the  tone  for  the  employers  in  Singapore,  will   the

Government  take the lead to set the example and impose  a  wage

restraint policy similar to the one in 1986, if possible with  a

wage freeze?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third issue is about productivity and opportunity costs

caused  by the workers who job-hop.  We have heard Members  from

the   floor   today  who  propose  changing  workers'  attitude,

increasing productivity and upgrading skills.  As an employer, I

ask  who  is  going  to pay for all that.  I have,  as  a  Human

Resource  Director  in my company, trained a number  of  workers

and, at the end of the course, they left for another company for

a few dollars more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give some figures. According to a Business Times'

report,  the  average labour turnover in 1997  was  38.4%.   The

highest  turnover  rate  being 56.4%  in  the  commerce  sector,

followed  by  the  clerical  and  sales  sector  at  50.4%,  the

professional  and  technical  sector  at  28.8%  and  production

workers at 39.6%.  These figures were based on the first quarter

of  1997.   I hope it was more encouraging in the last  quarter.

The  Political  and  Economic Risk Consultancy  report  in  1997

marked Singaporean workers, in terms of company loyalty, at 6.03

in  a  scale  of  0-10  with 0 representing the  best  situation

possible  and 10, the worst.  We are at 6.03.  In the sample  of

12 countries, Vietnam is the worst, scoring a high 7; Japan, the

best  in  company loyalty, scoring 2.5; Singapore is  the  third

worst.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned, Sir, that a lack of company loyalty among

Singaporean  workers  is  not  helpful  during  difficult  times

because now more than before, employers need organisational  and

operational stability to ride out the currency turmoil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures could we consider to stem out workers' job-hopping behaviour?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



Will  the  Government  support employers  by  returning  to  the

company some portion of the personal CPF contribution of workers

who leave with no valid reasons within six months of employment?

Will  the  Government consider not renewing the work permits  of

foreign  workers  who job-hop within a few  months  of  service?

These  measures,  as  argued by some employers  and  by  Mr  Tay

earlier  on, could serve as disincentives for job-hopping  while

helping  employers  regain  some payments  as  compensation  for

productivity loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this may seem to skew towards the side of employers,

but  employers  here  argue that the model  of  tripartism  must

include  in  it an ethos of mutual obligations, work  commitment

and  company loyalty, which workers themselves must  commit  to.

Without these fundamental commitments to work and company, there

cannot  be enduring worker and company growth and, in  the  long

run, sound economic development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth issue, Sir, is helping employers lower overall

labour cost by tapping on a large source of labour for part-time

employment.   The  tripartite partnership in  1996  between  the

Ministry  of  Labour, in conjunction with  SNEF,  NTUC  and  the

Productivity  and Standards Board, attempted to  get  women  and

retirees  back to work.  However, despite the offer of  training

courses and grants and with 4,000 vacancies being created by  18

employers participating in this programme, the take-up rate  was

low.  If we look at our workforce today, while there are workers

who  are  going to be retrenched, there are already one  million

economically  inactive  persons.    They  form  35.4%   of   the

population.   Among  these, there are  700,000  who  are  women,

210,000  have  `O'  level, 77,000 have `A' levels,  diplomas  or

degrees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1996 survey, 59,000 indicated that they wanted to

work.  Most of these people who had indicated that they intended

to  work  were  women, most of them married, home-makers,  young

between  20-49  years old, had secondary education,  had  worked

before, but liked to work part time.  There were correspondingly

11,700



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



potential  male  entrants.  I hope the Ministry  will  tap  this

large  labour resource, which is young, educated, trainable  and

employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Business Times report from interviews they carried out

in the back-to-work programme launched in 1996, there were women

who  liked  to work but they did not know where to work.   There

were also those who wished to work part time, but companies only

offered  full-time work.  Others would like to set up  "virtual"

offices  at home, but offers were very limited.  And there  were

complaints about mismatch of skills and job vacancies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the tripartite partners in the back-to-work

programme  will seriously review their strategy,  find  out  the

reasons  why  these employable, educated men and women  did  not

respond  to re-employment opportunities and create new  ways  of

mobilising them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few suggestions: strengthen the mechanism for

recruitment  of  part-time  workers in  the  Employment  Service

Department of the Ministry, by serving as an effective  one-stop

clearing  house  facility  to match worker  attributes  and  job

specifications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second suggestion: launch regularly an awareness campaign

island-wide  through a variety of media channels  and  reinforce

this effort by offering a toll-free jobline information service.

And  I think the National Helpline recently launched by CDC  may

want  to  consider  offering an information  and  job  placement

service to its constituents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, broaden up supply base to offer part-time work to

industries  such  as financial, insurance and business  services

with  proper pre-work training and orientation.  Currently, most

of  the  part-time  work  is  still  concentrated  in  commerce,

community and personal services, and the manufacturing  sectors.

These  are low-end jobs and they are not attractive in the first

place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, give specific attention to women workers'

expectations  by helping them get jobs within their  residential

vicinity and design flexi-time schedule to help them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



balance   work   and   family  needs.    There   were   numerous

recommendations being made to the Institute of Policy Studies in

September   1997,   ranging   from   fiscal   measures,   labour

legislation,  family policies to management  practices.   Please

consult this report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of current and future labour shortages and our

wish  to  cut  down on foreign labour cost for enterprises,  the

ability  to attract females who had left the workforce and  want

to  work,  or to retain those who are already in the  workforce,

take on an economic significance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth and last point is a call for us to focus on the

vulnerable  groups.   I would like to highlight  one  vulnerable

group   who   needs,  during  these  difficult  times,   special

attention.   These  are the single parents, largely  female  who

have  little  education,  low skill,  in  daily  paid  jobs  and

irregular  work.   The 1990 census reported that  single  parent

family   households  comprise  60,999  households  with  widowed

parents   and   17,585   households   with   divorced   parents,

representing  approximately 10% of all family-based  households.

The  typical profile of a single parent who is a client  in  our

Family Service Centres is likely to be a divorced person in  her

thirties, young, with low education, earning a monthly salary of

less  than $1,000 per month and mother of at least two dependent

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a case of them being women that we need to

protect.   It is more a case of protecting our workers  who  are

vulnerable, who happen to be women with young children.   Facing

the threat of retrenchment during these difficult times, how  do

unions  and Government protect their capacity to generate income

to  help them fend for their children and, eventually, their old

age?   As  non-unionised workers, what recourses do  they  have?

What  kind  of  special  community-based childcare  options  can

unions   and  Government  offer  to  this  group  of  one-income

households?  What kind of family-sensitive housing policies  can

be specially tailored to meet the needs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



of single parent households to offer them stable, affordable and

adequate housing?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tripartite policy agenda in restructuring, training and

raising  productivity - all these suggestions brought up  by  Mr

Lim  Swee Say earlier on were very convincing - but this has  to

be  balanced with a family policy agenda to minimise the strains

and  stresses  our workers may face in the home front,  so  that

they can concentrate in their work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not need to over emphasise here that when we

allow  family  life  to  become  weak,  the  society  begins  to

deteriorate.   In the end, the strength of the  nation  will  be

undermined.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, I rise in support of the motion standing  in  the

name of the Nominated Member of Parliament, Mr Cyrille Tan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too believe that tripartite cooperation between

employers, trade unions and the workers they represent  and  the

Government  is  a key factor in our competitive  advantage.   It

has,  in  fact,   helped  us to maintain  harmonious  industrial

relations  and  established a non-confrontational framework  for

resolving  labour-management issues.   Instead  of  wasting  our

limited  human  resources and efforts on divisive confrontations

between  union and management, we have been able to  concentrate

our efforts, our resources on common goals, teamwork, skills and

productivity improvements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our harmonious industrial relations over the past three

decades  were very different from the experience of  many  other

countries,  particularly those saddled with adversarial  labour-management relations. In fact, our strike-free environment  over

a long period of time may have resulted in harmonious industrial

relations  being  taken  for granted, especially  by  a  younger

generation of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, BERI, in its worldwide ranking of workers, had

consistently ranked the Singapore workforce as No 1, top of  the

list.  This is, to a large extent, due to the labour legislation

which reflect the strong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



spirit and practice of tripartism.  Furthermore, the absence  of

industrial   unrest,  such  as  strikes,  work  stoppages,   had

contributed to the high relative productivity which has  further

enhanced our strong ratings by BERI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, like Mr Zainul before me, I too

would  like  to take this opportunity to remind the  House  that

harmonious industrial relations cannot be taken for granted.  In

the   past,  Singapore  had  experienced  the  consequences   of

confrontational and adversarial labour-management relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 50s and 60s, strikes, work stoppages and other forms

of  industrial action were common.  Just to remind  Members,  in

1955 alone, there were 275 strikes, resulting in the loss of one

million  man-days. In 1961, we had 116 strikes and we lost  more

than  400,000  man-days.  If BERI were to rank our workforce  on

such  performance, I have no doubt that the Singapore  workforce

would be occupying a position quite near the bottom, and not  at

the top of the list.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, frequent strikes not only disrupted the smooth

operations  and  viability of companies; it also undermined  the

well being and livelihood of many workers.  More importantly,  a

poor  state  of  industrial relations had scared away  potential

investors, discouraged business expansion and adversely affected

economic growth.  So it was not surprising that in the  50s  and

the 60s, there was economic stagnation and massive unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the situation in Singapore is very different.

Singapore  has  consistently been  rated  as  one  of  the  most

attractive  places  to  invest  in  and  has  topped  the  World

Competitiveness  ranking. We have enjoyed rapid economic  growth

over  the  years, especially from 1987 to 1997, averaging  about

8.9% GDP growth annually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployment is no longer an issue. In fact, we now face

labour shortage and tight labour market conditions.  We have  to

admit  more than 450,000 foreign talented professional  workers,

skilled  and  even unskilled workers to supplement  our  limited

indigenous manpower resource.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



Singaporean workers have enjoyed substantial wage increases  and

significant  improvement  in  their  terms  and  conditions   of

employment.   Standard  of  living  and  quality  of  life   are

comparable to that of many developed countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these have been made possible through the efforts

of  a  hard-working workforce, sound economic  policies,  and  a

strong  and deep rooted relationship between employers,  workers

and the Government, based on cooperation and shared objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that tripartite cooperation had

served  us  well, not just in times of success, economic  growth

and  prosperity.  Tripartism had enabled workers, employers  and

the  Government  to  work as a team in  times  of  adversity  to

overcome  difficulties.  Several other MPs have  spoken  on  the

recession  in  1985-86.  I think that was  a  real  test  and  a

hallmark   of   the  depth  and  strength  of   our   tripartite

relationship.  In 1985-86, we faced the first economic recession

after  nearly  20  years of steady economic growth.   While  the

onset  of recession was sudden, the Government was equally swift

in  its  response.   An  extensive package of  anti-recessionary

measures was formulated and implemented successfully with strong

support  from  the  employers, trade unions and  their  members.

These  measures included the drastic reduction in the employers'

CPF  contribution from 25% to 10%, and the acceptance of  severe

wage  restraint  and  even wage cut.  The  prompt  and  thorough

implementation of the cost-cutting measures helped companies and

the  economy to turn around quickly.  Growth resumed in 1987 and

since  then,  Singapore has continued to enjoy  strong  economic

growth  and  workers  have been rewarded with  substantial  wage

increases  and  good  bonuses. Coupled with low  inflation,  the

purchasing power of workers has risen significantly and  so  has

the  quality  of  life.  This is reflected  in  better  housing,

better health care, better education, access to more leisure and

recreational  facilities and even the  means  to  travel  widely

during their holidays.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tripartite cooperation has allowed us to adopt a

proactive  approach in tackling difficult issues  affecting  the

economy,   businesses,  and  the  well-being  of  our   workers.

Nominated  Member of Parliament, Dr Lee, has observed  that  the

National Wages Council (NWC) is a tripartite institution.  I too

would  like to highlight the NWC as an example of tripartism  at

work.    The  NWC  comprises  representatives  from  the  union,

employers' organisation and the Government.  It was  set  up  in

1972  to formulate and recommend wage increase guidelines.   The

guiding  principle was that workers should be rewarded equitably

but  wage increases should not undermine our competitiveness  in

the  global  market.   Each year, the NWC issues  wage  increase

guidelines  taking  into  consideration  past  year's   economic

performance, future economic prospects, productivity gains  that

have  been  achieved  and  wage costs as  compared  to  economic

competitors.  For the past 25 years, NWC guidelines have  helped

to  achieve sustainable wage growth and ensure that the  economy

remains   on   track   with  increasing  regional   and   global

competition.  In many countries, wage negotiation is one of  the

most  troublesome aspects of labour-management relations,  often

resulting  in  very  violent  consequences  and  protests.    In

Singapore,  tripartite cooperation has allowed us to  turn  this

process  into a rational and forward-looking system of resolving

the needs of both the workers and the employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from dealing with wage increases, the NWC also

studied  other  wage-related  issues  to  further  enhance   our

competitiveness.   Hence,  in 1986,  the  NWC  proposed  that  a

flexible  wage  system  be introduced to  address  the  problems

caused  by  a  rigid wage system which hampered  the  employers'

ability  to cope with changes in the business cycle.  Currently,

more  than  70%  of  companies in Singapore have  implemented  a

flexible  wage  system  which  has  enabled  them  to  be   more

responsive to changing business conditions and to remain  viable

despite the emergence of more competition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Secretary-General of NTUC has pointed out, the

flexible  wage system has allowed companies to first  trim  wage

cost instead of turning to retrenchment as the first response to

a  downturn  in business cycle.  I hope that all employers  will

heed  this message and adopt this approach of using the existing

flexible  wage  system as a measure to respond to slower  growth

and to avoid turning to retrenchment of their workers as a first

reaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, allow me to quote yet another example of

how  tripartism  had  helped  us to  address  difficult  issues,

especially issues which are going to affect us in the future and

which  may not be immediately apparent to workers in particular.

In  late  1995, we established the Tripartite Committee  on  the

Extension  of  the  Retirement  Age.   The  Committee  comprises

Government representatives and representatives from a wide cross

section of employers' organisations and, of course, trade  union

leaders.   The  Committee set out to study  the  complex  issues

relating   to  our  ageing  workforce  and  came  out   with   a

comprehensive  and bold package of measures  to  cope  with  the

impact  of  an ageing workforce on our economic vitality.  These

measures included the introduction of the base-up wage system to

replace the existing seniority-based wage system, wage reduction

for  workers after the age of 60, an alternative medical benefit

scheme  to  encourage more responsible use of medical  benefits,

and  the  capping of retrenchment benefits to help companies  to

remain  competitive. Some of these measures are major departures

from  current practices and may not be well-understood  or  well

accepted by workers and employers at this juncture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the Tripartite Committee, there was full

consensus  and commitment from union leaders and employers  that

the adoption of these measures is necessary if Singapore were to

overcome the problems created by a rapidly ageing workforce  and

to ensure that the economy remains competitive in the future.  A

Tripartite Working Committee has now been formed to monitor  the

implementation of these recommendations and to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



develop  guidelines for unions and management to smoothly  raise

the retirement age from 60 to 62.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the effectiveness of the NWC and the Tripartite

Committee on the Extension of the Retirement Age would not  have

been  possible  without  a high level of cooperation  among  the

three  social  partners  and the ability  to  work  together  to

address and solve issues that have national implications.   This

is  the essence of tripartism which has served us well and which

we must continue to nurture and strengthen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as pointed out by Mr Hawazi and

several  other  MPs, this debate on tripartism is  taking  place

against  a deeply disturbing backdrop of economic crisis spawned

by the regional currency and stock market turmoils.  Because our

fiscal  policies  have  always  been  based  on  sound  economic

principles,  we have not been affected to the same  extent  that

our   neighbouring   countries   have.    Singapore's   economic

fundamentals  remain  strong  despite  the  regional  upheavals.

Government  will  continue to adopt prudent financial  policies.

The  Government is also aware of the problems facing businessmen

arising  from the recent financial turmoil and economic slowdown

in  the  region.  These factors will be taken into consideration

in formulating the FY 98/99 Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singapore cannot completely avoid the adverse

impact from the regional economic crisis.  We cannot assume that

we  will  be  able to sail through this critical period  without

some  pains. We must, in fact,  be prepared that the tidal waves

which  are  lashing at our neighbours will also  cause  us  some

damage.  We must be prepared for more difficulties ahead of  us,

as it will take quite a few years for our neighbouring countries

to  resume their normal growth.  1998, in particular, will be  a

more  difficult year for Singapore and growth is  likely  to  be

less than what we have enjoyed before. It is thus more important

at  this juncture for workers, trade unions, employers, and  the

Government   to  work  closely  together  to  ride  the   storm.

Therefore, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Cyrille Tan and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



other  MPs  that  we need to further strengthen  the  tripartite

partnership to enhance our competitiveness so that we  can  meet

the  challenges  in the years ahead of us as we enter  the  21st

century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question, Sir, is what must we do and what new ideas or

areas  of  cooperation  will help to strengthen  tripartism.   I

would  now  like to touch on some of the important and practical

ways of strengthening tripartism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in moving the motion, Mr Cyrille

Tan  referred  to  the  need for the  labour  movement  to  stay

relevant  and  focused on workers' needs.  This, I  believe,  is

absolutely  necessary.  For tripartism to work  effectively,  we

must   have  a  strong  labour  movement  capable  of  providing

leadership   and   constructive  input  to  strengthen   labour-management  relation.  This means a strong NTUC  receiving  full

support  from workers, with a growing membership fully supported

by employers and Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has referred in his speech to the labour movement

being controlled by the PAP.  I think my colleague, Mr Lim  Swee

Say, has ably rebutted that point.  What I would like to say  at

this  juncture  is  that the NTUC is a fully  independent  trade

union  movement.  The rights of workers to be a  member  of  the

union  is enshrined in the Employment Act.  It is provided  for,

subject to the laws on trade unions.  So any worker or group  of

workers  who thinks that an NTUC-affiliated trade union  is  not

serving  their  interest  will always have  the  opportunity  of

forming  their own unions, if they believe that it  will  better

serve  their  interest.  The fact is that out of  82  registered

trade  unions in Singapore today, 73 are NTUC-affiliated.  There

are  nine unions that have chosen not to be affiliated to  NTUC.

So  there are plenty of opportunities for workers who feel  that

their  interests  have  not  been  served  to  find  alternative

avenues.   The  truth of the matter is that NTUC  has  over  the

years  proven to have been an effective champion of workers,  to

have  served the interest and addressed the concerns of all  the

workers.   That  is  why  it has remained the  mainstream  union

movement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries, trade unions are mainly concerned with

the  pursuit of sectional interest at the expense of the overall

national  objective. This has often given rise to conflict  with

the  management and the government, which has resulted in poorer

economic performance and inability to compete.  As a result,  in

many  of  these countries where there has been a strong tendency

to  adopt a confrontational and divisive kind of approach, trade

unions  have  become  increasingly  irrelevant  in  meeting  the

challenges  of  a  highly competitive global  environment  which

actually requires a high level of teamwork and cooperation among

all the social partners, rather than more confrontation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, our trade unions have always

placed national objectives before sectional interest, and  long-term benefits of workers over short-term gains. This has ensured

the continued relevance of the labour movement in Singapore  and

has  allowed  the  movement to play an  important  role  in  our

economic development for the benefit of all workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises the constructive and valuable

contributions  made  by the NTUC. The Government  therefore  has

always  been  supportive  of the labour movement's  efforts  and

initiatives  to  improve the economic and social  well-being  of

workers.  For example, the Government has provided assistance to

the  labour  movement to set up many cooperatives so that  these

cooperatives  can  provide more and better  benefits  for  union

membership.  The Government has also provided annual  grants  to

the  NTUC's  Research  and  Administration  Unit  to  carry  out

research  and provide expert assistance to the trade  unions  in

their  wage  negotiation and industrial relations  matters.   In

order  to  assist  the unions in developing higher  quality  and

higher  level  leadership, the Government  had  provided  annual

grants to the Singapore Institute of Labour Studies (SILS) where

they  conduct  courses on leadership development and  leadership

training.  To ensure that the Institute has sufficient resources

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



develop  and  upgrade  the  quality  of  union  leadership,  the

Government  has  given a one-time grant of  $2  million  to  the

Institute's Endowment Fund in lieu of the annual grant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the Government has also supported the

labour   movement  in  the  development  of  many   social   and

recreational  facilities  such as the Orchid  Country  Club  and

Pasir  Ris  Resort  by  allocating  large  tracts  of  land   at

concessionary  rates  through  the Singapore  Labour  Foundation

(SLF).  More significantly, the Government has allocated a prime

site in Marina South for the construction of a new NTUC building

in place of its existing office in Shenton Way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government will continue to

give  strong  support to the labour movement in its  efforts  to

enhance  the well-being of  workers and to enable it to  play  a

constructive  and  important role in  economic  development  and

nation-building. I am confident that the NTUC will  continue  to

be   a   valuable  social  partner  in  our  non-confrontational

tripartite framework.  Because the PAP and the NTUC have similar

objectives to improve the lives of Singaporeans, we have  worked

closely together for the past 32 years.  This is not surprising.

We  have  the same objectives, we want to do the same  thing  to

benefit   Singaporeans.   So  we  work   together.    And   this

commonality has evolved over the years into a distinct symbiotic

relation  between  the  PAP  and the  NTUC.   This  relationship

complements the already strong tripartite relationship which has

served us so well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, the People's Action Party will explore

various  ways and means to strengthen its links with  the  NTUC.

For a start, as the Prime Minister has indicated last Sunday, we

will  be  organising joint seminars to discuss important  issues

confronting workers and the economy.  Such seminars can  provide

additional inputs for our economic policies to further reinforce

our   tripartite   relations  and  also  to   enhance   workers'

understanding  of key issues confronting the country.   We  hope

that through such interactions, we will be able to reinforce the

symbiotic relations between the PAP and NTUC.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure that the economy remains stable, on an even

keel,  in such troubled times, the needs of companies must  also

be  addressed and Government and workers must help employers  to

cope  with increasing competition which follows from the  recent

massive  devaluation  of  regional  currencies.   The  Nominated

Member,  Mr  Tay Beng Chuan, had asked Government to review  its

levies  and charges in order to assist businessmen and to reduce

the  costs  of  doing  business.   I  have  already  earlier  on

mentioned  that Government will take the new economic conditions

into consideration in formulating its financial policies for the

coming  year.  Government will do what is  necessary  to  assist

employers to cope with the economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nominated Member, Mdm Claire Chiang, had said that in

1985-86 we were able to reduce the CPF contribution from 25%  to

10%, a 15% cut, and she asked whether it is still feasible today

to  reduce  cost by cutting the CPF.  I would say,  yes,  it  is

entirely possible and feasible, but the question is whether  our

situation is so serious and so severe that we need to take  such

a  drastic step.  In 1985-86, we were in recession with negative

growth.   But presently, although we are facing serious economic

challenges  and drastic change in the economic environment,  the

likelihood  of  Singapore being able to achieve  growth  in  the

coming year is still very strong although, as I said earlier on,

growth  will  be  slower and harder to  come  by.   So  at  this

juncture,  perhaps  it  is  premature  to  talk  about  reducing

workers'  CPF,  but  certainly the  fact  that  each  worker  is

contributing 20% plus another 20% from the employer to  the  CPF

represents opportunities for us to reduce wage cost, if there is

absolute  need  to  do so.  And it would be  considered  if  the

situation deteriorates to that level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Mr Deputy Speaker, growth will be slower this

year,  and  perhaps  for quite a few more years,  before  normal

growth pattern in the region resumes.  So here I want to make  a

point  that  in view of the new circumstances, the new  economic

environment,  workers must moderate their wage expectations  and

be prepared to work harder and more productively.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



The  current  regional economic crisis may also result  in  more

companies having to downsize and retrench workers.  My  Ministry

will  help  affected  workers to seek  re-employment.   We  will

consider  setting  up  a  tripartite  panel  to  coordinate  re-employment assistance to retrenched workers.  At the same  time,

the  easing of tight labour market, in view of retrenchment  and

slowing  down  of the economy, may well mean that  the  concerns

expressed by the Nominated Member, Mdm Claire Chiang, about job-hopping  will  solve itself.  Because job-hopping to  a  certain

extent is very much a phenomenon linked to a tight labour market

and  a rapidly growing economy.  When jobs are scarce, not  many

people  are  likely to hop around.  The current surveys  by  the

newspapers  reflect the thinking of the workers  on  the  ground

that  their  concern today is more on job security than  bonuses

and  wage increase.  I think the problem of job-hopping may well

be  on its way out and that may be replaced with a more critical

concern on security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Cyrille Tan, in moving his

motion,  also  spoke in support of the need  to  bring  in  more

foreign  talent to supplement our local manpower.  I think  this

requires  courage and it also highlights the far-sightedness  of

our  trade union leaders.  In the present environment, to  stand

up  and  say, we support the Government's move to bring in  more

foreign  talents, requires courage.  Because as a union  leader,

the  standard  reaction would be to protect their members  first

and  therefore keep foreigners out.  But here he is prepared  to

argue  that  in  order  to ensure that the  economy  can  remain

competitive  in  the future, we should continue to  maintain  an

open-door  policy towards talent and to welcome more  talent  to

come  to Singapore to supplement our limited manpower resources.

I think this is the characteristic of the far-sightedness of the

trade  union  movement  in Singapore.   Instead  of  adopting  a

defensive  and sectional interest attitude, labour leaders  have

always embraced the national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



perspective  and  taken  the stand of, for  instance,  welcoming

foreign talents to supplement the local workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with limited manpower resources,

it is essential for us to attract talent to Singapore. Foreign talent

will add experience and skills to our economy and enable us

to achieve faster growth, create more jobs and add value

to   the  economy.   The  availability  of  foreign  talents  to

supplement local talents will make us more attractive to foreign

investors.  We must continue to open our society and economy  to

foreign talents.  Some Singaporeans may not quite understand why

we  should give away jobs to foreigners, especially during  this

period  of  economic uncertainty.  This is where a strong  NTUC,

with  strong  grassroots support, can help  the  Government  and

employers  to  reach  out to the rank-and-file  to  explain  the

benefits that foreign talents bring to us and how they can  help

us  to become more competitive.  The trade union movement has an

important role to play in explaining to workers the rationale of

our efforts in attracting foreign talents and to allay the fears

that foreigners may displace some Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to an area which many Members have spoken

about,  that  of  employability and  skills  training.   Several

Members  have noted that inwith  an increasingly knowledge-based

economy, workers with lower education who are currently employed

in  low value-added industries, may not be able to take up  jobs

in  the high value-added industries of the future if they do not

upgrade  their  skills.  I think this is a very relevant  point.

In  fact,  BERI  in its annual ranking of workforces  round  the

world  has  also noted that our workers are not well  placed  in

terms of skills and work attitude.  These are areas that we have

to  make improvements on.  If nothing is done, many of the  low-skilled  and  low-educated workers may not  be  able  to  remain

employed   asthe  economy  upgrades,  to  cope  with  increasing

competition  from  countries with larger and lower-wage  workers

force  the pace of changelabour force.  As our economy upgrades,

there  is  a  real  danger that lower educated and  less-skilled

workers would be displaced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



and  may  end  up  being the new unemployable in the  workforce.

This  is  the  structural unemployment currently experienced  by

many  European countries, which has been observed by Mr  Cyrille

Tan and the other speakers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, knowing that this can happen, we can, and we must,

take  steps to avoid or minimise this undesirable outcome.  What

we have to do is to upgrade workers' skills.  As several Members

have  pointed out, nearly 40% of the labour force have less than

secondary  education.  We will have to invest more  in  workers'

training  and  skills upgrading.ence, it is crucial  for  us  to

upgrade workers' skills.  This is another area where the  spirit

of  tripartism can provide a synergistic effect. The  effort  to

upgrade workers' skills requires changes in the attitudes of the

workers  and the employers.  It will require, in fact, a  strong

spirit  of tripartism to achieve the best results.  On its  own,

Government   would   have  great  difficulties   in   overcoming

resistance from workers who may not be convinced of the need for

skills upgrading or are just simply unwilling or unable to  find

time  to  undergo  such  skills upgrading upgrading.   Likewise,

Government  will  also  have  difficulty  overcoming  employers'

mindset,  such as unwillingness to release workers for  training

because  they  are unsure of the benefits or unwilling  to  bear

their  share of the cost.  A tripartite effort with inputs  from

all three parties - Government, unionsworkers and employers - is

more  likely  to  succeed in making workers and  employers  more

aware of the importance of skills upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such example of a tripartite effort was mentioned by Mr

Lim  Swee Say.  This is the Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP)

which  is initiated and administered by NTUC, supported  by  the

Government, and and the employers.  Under the SRP, workers  with

lower education in low value-added industries are given training

in   skills  that  are  needed  by  the  new  high-value   added

operations.   SRP  will  enhanceIn the process,  these  workers'

skills  and employability would be greatly enhanced to we  could

avoid the problem of structural unemployment.  SRP is an example

of  how  tripartism can synergise the resources  of  Government,

trade  unions  and  employers to achieve the  objective  of  Our

objective  is  to  produce  a well-trained  and  highly  skilled

workforce.   This will enable us  toenable Singapore to  attract

high quality investments which would create more and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



better  paying jobs for workers.  Government will expand on  the

scope  and outreach of the SRP to reach out to more workers  and

employers.   We will develop, apart from the SRP, new programmes

to  provide training and skills upgrading for mature workers  to

help them to cope with the changes in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next I would like to touch on an integrated approach

in manpower training.  Manpower is ourwill always be Singapore's

only resource - I think this was mentioned by the Nominated  MP,

Mr  Tay  Beng Chuan.  It canwill also be a major limiting factor

in  our  growth and could become an impediment to  new  business

investments  and  business expansion.  We must  therefore  fully

develop  our  manpower resources so as to hone  our  competitive

edge  and remain relevant in an increasingly competitive  global

environment.   This  is  why, as Mr Lim  Boon  Heng,  Secretary-General  of  NTUC, and several other MPs before him  noted,  the

Prime   Minister  welcomed  the  suggestion  made  at  the   PAP

Convention   last   Sunday  for  the  Government   to   consider

establishing a central national agency to undertake the task  of

manpower planning, development, and management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, these crucial economic functions are undertaken

by several Ministries and Government agencies.  For example, the

EDB  is responsible for anticipating meeting the manpower  needs

of  new  investments; the Productivity and  Standards  Board  is

tasked  with  skills and productivity upgrading; the Immigration

Department is in charge of granting Employment Passes to foreign

talents;  whilst  the while the Ministry of Labour,  apart  from

many other duties, is responsible fortasked with regulating  the

inflow of mainly unskilled foreign workers.  Such an arrangement

is  not  entirely satisfactory and can result in a mismatch  and

lackslack of coordination and an an overall strategic direction.

We  shouldneed to look at manpower issues from a total  national

perspective  and adopt an integrated and comprehensive  strategy

for   meeting  the  national  manpower  needs  in  numbers   and

quality.approach  to  achieve  better  results.   An  integrated

approach  would ensure that manpower planning, development,  and

management remains well-coordinated and relevant to the needs of

an evolving economy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by adopting an integrated approach, we can develop a

world-class workforce with capabilities and skills to succeed in

the  new  global knowledge economy.  The development of  such  a

world-class workforce requires total commitment and  efforts  on

the  part  of  Government, trade unions, workers and  employers.

The Government, in considering the need for an enlarged Ministry

of  Labour with manpower planning and development function, will

also study closely how to involve the participation rate of  the

labour  movement and employers' organisation in the  formulation

and   implementation  of  manpower  policy,  including  workers'

training and skills upgrading programmes.  This is in line  with

our tripartite approach in meeting the challenges ahead and will

enable  us  to  reap  the  full  benefitssynergy  of  tripartite

cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in summary, tripartite cooperation

has  benefited Singapore  in at least three major areas. It  has

brought  about  industrial harmony, thus creating  a  favourable

investment climate for rapid economic growth. It has enabled the

three  social  partners  to work closely  together  to  overcome

adversity  during  bad times and share the  fruits  of  economic

success  in  good  times.  Equally important, ourthe  tripartite

framework ofor cooperation has enabled the three social partners

to  participate in and contribute to the formulation of national

policies.    The   tripartite   partners'   participation    and

contribution have enabled us to more effectively tackle  complex

and difficult national issues that have long-term implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the task ahead of us is to build on the already sound

tripartite  foundation.  We must strengthen  the  bonds  between

workers,  employers  and Government,  so  as  to  build  a  more

resilient  and  adaptable  framework  fornetwork  of  industrial

relations  to prepare Singapore for the challenges of  the  21st

century.  While existing approaches have served us well, we must

consciously  review  their relevance  as  the  world  around  us

changes  and the regional economic crisis begins to  affect  us.

We  must examine our mindsets and make innovative use of  theour

tripartite framework to address national manpower issues.  My



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



Ministry,  therefore,  welcomes new ideas  and  suggestions  put

forward  by MPs on how tripartism could be elevated to a  higher

plane  to  help develop a more efficient and highly  competitive

workforce.   Hon. Members have made many suggestions.   We  will

study   these  carefully  and  we  will  discuss  them  in   the

appropriate tripartite fora, such as NWC, tripartite  committees

and  working  groups that have been formed to  address  specific

issues.   Where feasible, we will implement these new ideas  for

the  benefit  of  workers and employers.  We  will  continue  to

strengthen our  work for a stronger tripartite relationship  and

institutions by exploring new areas for tripartite cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to

thank all the Members who have spoken in support of the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please let me state again clearly. Mr Lim Boon Heng was

elected  as  the Secretary-General of the NTUC by the grassroots

leaders,  ie, by myself and others.  Also, he has been appointed

as the Minister because he was elected as a Member of Parliament

and the Prime Minister finds him fit to be a Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs who are advisors to unions, to put it bluntly, have a

tough  job.  Sometimes, when they have dialogues with our  union

leaders  and members, they were scolded for explaining unpopular

policies.  And our leaders are very blunt because some  of  them

from  the ground can be very rough.  But they are doing  a  good

job and I think we should thank them for continuing to do a good

job.   This  is  because  of  the PAP  and  the  NTUC  symbiotic

relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere in the world have unions taken the initiative to

visit developed countries to study unemployment problems.  It is

because  40% of our workforce today are 40 years and above  with

low  education  and they have contributed significantly  to  the

economy  for  the past years.  It would be a waste if  they  are

caught in structural unemployment.  That is why Mr Lim Swee  Say

said  that we need action now and it is very serious because  we

know the problems of structural unemployment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC-PAP symbiotic relationship has been an important

factor  in Singapore's progress.  With the support of the  trade

unions,  the  PAP Government has been able to create  conditions

for  wealth creation.  This has benefited employers and workers.

The  Government  has  helped workers in  many  other  ways,  ie,

through home ownership schemes, savings in the CPF, good medical

and  social  programmes.  As a result, workers have  seen  their

assets  enhanced.  Because we have this symbiotic  relation,  we

have  been  able  to  forge a tripartite relationship  with  the

Government,  employers  and  unions  working  together  to  make

Singapore a better place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Lee Boon Yang, the Labour Minister, says, "For

tripartism  to  work effectively, we must have a  strong  labour

movement."  This means a strong NTUC receiving full support from

workers, employers and Government.   A strong labour movement is

one  of the five pillars of NTUC 21, our blueprint for the  21st

century.   Without a strong labour movement, we  cannot  achieve

the  other  four  objectives,  which  are  to  enhance  workers'

employability for life, to help make companies more competitive,

to build a healthy body and a healthy mind, and to care more and

share  more.  A strong NTUC needs constant infusion  of  leaders

from  the rank and file as well as from other sources,  a  point

made by Mr Lim Boon Heng, Secretary-General of NTUC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tripartism to succeed, there must also be strong

government and strong employers as well.  As a trade unionist, I

know  what  it  means  to  deal with  strong  as  well  as  weak

management.   With a strong management, you strike  a  deal  and

that  is  it.  With a weak management, you can never come  to  a

satisfactory  arrangement.  Likewise, if union leaders  are  not

strong  and  cohesive, then we cannot serve our workers'  needs.

If  we  bicker for power, we will not have time to plan for  the

future.   Then  we  can forget scenario planning.   Dr  Lee  has

mentioned  many  projects  of  the  labour  movement  that  have

received strong support from the Government.  I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



sure  my  fellow  unionists  would want  me  to  thank  the  PAP

Government for this strong support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face a difficult year ahead because of the regional

financial  crisis.   There will be more  retrenchments.   So  we

welcome  the proposed formation of a tripartite force that  will

help  retrenched workers get alternative employment as  soon  as

possible.   I  hope employers will also heed Mr Lim Boon  Heng's

call  on  training.  Mr Lim told the employers that they  should

not  cut  back on training just because they face  a  period  of

uncertainty.  I also hope that employers will see money spent on

training as an investment for their well-being.  Because we have

tripartism  in  place, we have the mechanism to  deal  with  the

problems confronting us today, we need to face them in the  same

way  as we did in the past.  Now is the time for all parties  to

reaffirm their commitment to tripartism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our job as a labour movement is to safeguard workers'

interest.  We know we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



can  do  this  job well if we can work only in tandem  with  the

Government  and employers.  So I hope the House will support  my

motion.   We  have seen how tripartism helps us in  all  fields.

What we are asking the House to do is to recognise tripartism as

a  key competitive advantage of Singapore.  It will be a vote of

confidence for a better Singapore in the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House recognises tripartism as a key competitive

advantage  of Singapore, and calls on Government, employers  and

unions to further strengthen tripartite partnership in Singapore

so  as to enhance Singapore's competitiveness as we face new and

greater economic and social challenges in the 21st century.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

whether, in granting licences for amusement arcades, he will ban

games which promote violence and reckless road usage in view  of

the large number of juveniles frequenting such places.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, licences to operate amusement arcades are issued

by  the  Public Entertainment Licensing Unit of the Police.   As

video  games fall within the ambit of the Board of Film  Censors

(BFC),  licensees must obtain approval from the BFC before  they

operate such games in the arcades.  Police will only allow games

which are approved by BFC to be operated in amusement arcades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC adopts stringent guidelines in the approval process.

Games   depicting   excessive   violence,   sex,   nudity    and

objectionable themes on moral, social or religious grounds  will

not  be  approved.  BFC will also not approve racing games  that

are  undesirable  or unhealthy.  For example,  the  racing  game

`Carmegeddon'  was  banned by BFC because  it  contained  vulgar

language,  and  encourage the player to knock down  pedestrians,

awarding bonus points for doing so.  The players also get  extra

bonus points for "stylish" collision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driving video games which are currently allowed in

amusement arcades are those that involve motor racing that  test

the  players'  skills in avoiding obstacles and  completing  the

race  in  the least possible time.  We do not think these  games

will  have any negative influence on the players' actual driving

or riding habits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police carries out regular enforcement checks at the

amusement arcades to ensure that licensees do not operate  video

games  that  are  not approved by BFC and the  Police  Licensing

Unit.   Police would also carry out a review of any  video  game

which it receives negative feedback from the public.  The Member

can  rest assured that both the Police and BFC would not  permit

games  which  promote  excessive  violence  and  reckless   road

behaviour to be operated in amusement arcades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry and the Housing and Development Board are

to prevent such re-occurrences in the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>



<br><br><i>(a)  Cause of Incident</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17th December 1997, a group of boys fought in SBH `A'.

This  fight  was a culmination of some unhappiness and  personal

conflicts  amongst  the  boys over a few incidents,  ie,  verbal

insults,  complaints of kicking and spitting  of  some  boys  by

others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight took place just after the boys had finished their

dinner  and were assembling to return to their dormitories.   It

was  triggered  when one boy hit another boy and this  escalated

with other boys joining in the fight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police was called in to help stop the fighting.



<br><br><i>(b)  Measures Taken to Prevent Such Occurrences in Future</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident is regretted. On measures taken to prevent

such recurrence, my Ministry is reviewing the management of  the

Home  as well as its security.  Since an earlier incident  which

took place in the Home,  the Ministry has taken steps to upgrade

the  security of the Home. The measures include the installation

of  closed circuit cameras in all dormitories, a second layer of

fencing  creating  a buffer zone and a distress  call  alarm  to

alert  all staff.  The Prisons Department is also assisting  the

Home to review its physical security and security management and

conduct  training courses for Home staff to better prepare  them

to deal with an increasingly difficult lot of residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from the incident, the Ministry has also engaged

the services of CISCO Police Officers to enhance the security of

the  Home.   A  distress  alarm system  has  been  installed  to

activate the Police in the event of an incident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present staffing ratio is inadequate and we are

reviewing it to ensure more effective supervision and management

of residents.



<br><br><i>Comments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry together with the Ministry of Home Affairs is

reviewing  the  current regime and the types  of  boys  who  are

admitted into the Home.  The profile of offenders admitted  into

SBH   `A'  and  our  other  juvenile  institutions  has  changed

particularly  over the last three years.  SBH `A'  continues  to

face  an  overcrowding  problem  with  an  increasing  rate   of

admission.  The current population of boys is more aggressive in

nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50% of them have committed violent offences such as

rioting,  involuntarily  causing hurt,  robbery,  assault,  etc.

Three years ago, the group constituted about 20%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premises of SBH `A' are a century old and its premises

have  been  encroached  upon with the development  of  the  Open

University  next  to  it.   Current  facilities  and  space  are

inadequate for the conduct of programmes and activities for  the

boys.   Fortunately in 10 months' time, SBH `A' will  be  moving

into a new Boys' Complex in Jurong by the end of the year.   The

new  Boys'  Complex  with better security  features  and  better

facilities will provide a better and more secure environment.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Community Development how far has his Ministry progressed in its

commitment, after the Winnie Ho enquiry, to amend and strengthen

the Children and Young Persons Act.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NMP Mdm Chiang has asked about the progress on the

Ministry's  plan to amend the Children and Young  Persons's  Act

(CYPA).   First, let me stress that the review of  the C&YP  Act

is not prompted by the Winnie Ho case but came about as a result

of   a   recommendation  of  the  Inter-Ministry  Committee   on

Dysfunctional  Families,  Juvenile Delinquency  and  Drug  Abuse

which  was made in 1995.  This Committee among other things  had

proposed that the C&YP Act should be amended to provide for more

sentencing  options to be made available for the management  and

treatment of juvenile delinquents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The C&YP Act had been quite extensively reviewed and

amended in 1993.  In the current exercise we will look at  three

broad areas, namely the:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- treatment of juvenile offenders and children and young

persons who are beyond parental control;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- investigation and management of children and young persons

in need of care and protection; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- administration and supervision of institutions for children

and young persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of child welfare and protection, one of the

amendments proposed aims to strengthen provisions to obtain  the

cooperation  of  parents or guardians in seeking  treatment  and

help  for  themselves, other than the victims.   This  provision

will  ensure  that  the perpetrators and  the  children  can  be

directed  for  necessary  assessment  and  treatment.   Such   a

provision is already available under the Women's Charter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to report that the review has been completed and

an amendment Bill will be tabled later this year.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  (i)  what is the current status of the development  of

electronic commerce in Singapore and (ii) how this compares with

that in the United States.

<br><br><i>Status of EC Development in Singapore</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Computer Board (NCB) has been working with

other Government agencies and the industry to promote electronic

commerce (EC).  For a start, it launched the Electronic Commerce

Hotbed  (ECH)  programme  in August  1996,  with  the  following

objectives :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To deploy infrastructural services to enable EC;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To address policy and legal issues associated with EC;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To showcase EC applications; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) To promote acceptance of EC by industry and the

general public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ECH Policy Committee was formed in January 1997 to

address policy issues and concerns affecting the conduct  of  EC

in Singapore.  The committee has recently completed its work and

its  recommendations  have  been accepted  by  the  National  IT

Committee chaired by Minister Teo Chee Hean.  We will proceed to

carry out the recommendations.

<br><br><i>Security of Transactions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For EC to flourish, transactions must be secure and

obligations  of contracting parties must be legally  recognised.

Each  transacting party must be assured of the identity  of  the

other  party,  that  the  transactions  are  verified  and  that

information  flow  is  secured.  Digital  certificates,  digital

signatures and encryption keys serve these functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 1997, NCB and the Network for Electronic Transfers

(NETS) jointly set up Netrust to issue digital certificates  and

manage  them  for  individuals and  organisations.   Netrust  is

Southeast Asia's first certification authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For on-line payment, NCB has set up the Secure Electronic

Transaction  (SET)  system with VISA and MasterCard.   The  NETS

Cash Card for Internet payment is now being piloted.



<br><br><i>Legal & Policy Framework to Support EC</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will enact new legislation to recognise contracts formed

electronically  and  protect  the  rights  of  the   transacting

parties.  We  are also reviewing existing laws against  computer

crimes  in  order to ensure that penalties are proportionate  to

the damage caused.



<br><br><i>EC Applications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCB has been working with industry to develop EC

applications.   To  date,  we  have  more  than  120  local   EC

applications.   Several  directory  services  have   also   been

developed.



<br><br><i>Promote Acceptance of EC</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCB has been working with other Government agencies and

industry  to  promote EC through seminars  and  workshops.   For

example, NCB and the Singapore Tourism Board organised the "Shop

On The Net" event in July 1997.



<br><br><i>Comparison of EC Development with the United States</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, EC development is spearheaded by the private

sector.   The US Administration's EC framework is based  on  the

following five principles:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Private sector should lead;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Governments should avoid undue restrictions on EC;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Where governmental involvement is needed, its aim

should  be  to  support  and enforce a predictable,  minimalist,

consistent and simple legal environment for commerce;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Governments should recognise the unique qualities of

the Internet; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) EC on the Internet should be facilitated on a global

basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government has adopted a more promotional

approach involving both the private and public sectors.  EC is a

strategic  area  and  Singapore should  take  advantage  of  its

headstart to build up its capabilities quickly in this new area.

<div align="center"><b>CHANNELS FOR PUBLIC FEEDBACK ON INTERNET REGULATIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Information

and  the  Arts, as regards the recent revisions to the  Internet

Code  of  Practice,  what channels are available  for  continued

public feedback regarding Internet regulations, in order to meet

the twin objectives of promoting the growth of the Internet, and

protecting children from pornographic material.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA will serve as the primary channel for public feedback

on  the  regulation of Internet content.  The public can provide

SBA feedback by letter, telephone or e-mail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other channels for feedback are the National Internet

Advisory  Committee (NIAC) and its various sub-committees.   The

Ministry  of Education also takes a special interest in Internet

content.  Members of the public can also call the Feedback Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent revision of the Internet Code of Practice, and

the  issue  of  new Industry Guidelines, were  done  after  wide

consultations with various groups.

<div align="center"><b>HARI RAYA AIDILFITRI</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for

Community  Development  whether the  Government  plans  to  have

official and national functions to celebrate the Lunar New  Year

and  Hari Raya Aidilfitri to be jointly organised this year,  to

highlight racial harmony and understanding and multi-culturalism

in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunar New Year, Hari Raya Aidilfitri and indeed all major

public holidays are good occasions for Singaporeans of all races

to  celebrate  together.  We encourage activities which  promote

racial  harmony and bring the various races closer to understand

and  appreciate each other's culture and tradition.   Organising

joint  functions on this special occasion where  the  Lunar  New

Year  and  Hari  Raya  Aidilfitri fall so close  together  would

certainly be appropriate.  However, I feel that it would be more

meaningful for such activities to be organised spontaneously  by

community  groups  rather  than done  at  official  or  national

levels.   This  is in fact already happening.  I  am  told  that

several  community  centres, RCs and  CCCs  will  be  organising

functions to jointly celebrate Lunar New Year and Hari Raya this

year.  We should encourage such initiatives.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE ONE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  (i)  how  the households for the Singapore  ONE  pilot

project  were  selected  and (ii) whether  it  is  possible  for

interested households to request for a link-up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore ONE pilot was launched in June 1997 and is

still in its pilot phase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households can access Singapore ONE through two network

operators:  Singapore  Telecom  (SingTel)  and  Singapore  Cable

Vision  (SCV).   Island-wide service is  not  available  at  the

moment,  but both operators are upgrading their systems  with  a

view  towards  island-wide service by end  1998.   There  is  no

selection   process  for  the  Singapore  ONE   pilot   project.

Households which are located in the areas serviced by  SingTel's

or  SCV's  network will be able to participate in the  Singapore

ONE pilot by subscribing to either network operator's service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households interested in participating in the Singapore ONE

pilot,  or  subscribing to the service in future,  can  approach

SingTel, SCV or the National Computer Board for assistance.

<div align="center"><b>RAIN SHELTERS UNDER FLYOVERS FOR MOTORCYCLISTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Minister for

Communications whether his Ministry will consider rain  shelters

under  flyovers to provide relief to motorcyclists during  heavy

downpour and to enhance road safety.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorcyclists usually congregate and wait under flyovers on

the  left lane during heavy downpour. Hence, LTA has constructed

rain  shelters  under flyovers for motorcyclists to  take  cover

during  heavy  downpour.  These are concrete bays  located  away

from  the main traffic to ensure the safety of the motorcyclists

and  other  motorists.   LTA will extend such  shelters  to  all

flyovers where space permits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA will be improving the existing rain shelters, such as

the  one along East Coast Parkway at the Tanjong Katong Flyover,

by  expanding  the  bays  to  allow  them  to  accommodate  more

motorcyclists.  However, this may not always be possible at some

of  the  other shelters given the space and physical constraints

at  some  of these locations.  LTA will explore how to  overcome

these  constraints  without  compromising  the  safety  of   the

motorists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 15 such rain shelters. Two more will be

added  at  the  flyovers  at the junction  of  the  Seletar  and

Tampines Expressways.
