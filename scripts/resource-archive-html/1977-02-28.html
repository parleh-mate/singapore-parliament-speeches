that I communicated to the President the Address agreed to

by  resolution  of this Parliament on the  24th  February,

1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received a reply from the President acknowledging

<div align="center"><b>PUB METER READERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  and Communications whether the meter  readers

employed  by  the Public Utilities Board  at  present  are

enough  to read all meters in every district and, if  not,

whether  the Board is considering the recruitment of  more

meter  readers as complaints have been received from  some

constituents  that the charges for public utilities  based

on estimates were not accurate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Utilities Board has enough meter readers to read the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



1,107,163  utility  meters in service  on  a  bi-monthly

basis.  For  the  months when the  meters  are  not  read,

consumptions are estimated and these estimates  are  based

on  the  average of previous actual consumptions. For  the

great  majority of consumers whose consumptions are fairly

stable and fluctuate only marginally, these estimates  are

accurate.  However,  because  the  utility  meters  record

consumptions progressively, any deviation is automatically

adjusted when the meters are next read.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had previously spoken of the PUB's campaign to

encourage  consumers  to read their own  meters.  I  think

complaints  of  inaccurate estimates would  not  arise  if

consumers  submitted their own readings for  billing.  The

hon.  Member for Geylang Serai should consider urging  his

constituents to take advantage of this offer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether  he

is  aware  that there are many meter readers who are  very

lazy.  They  do  not  take the trouble  to  calculate  the

estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about asking the consumers to read the

meters themselves. If this is put into practice, will  all

the meter readers be out of job?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, as the Member for Sembawang has

said, meter readers do make mistakes in reading meters.  I

quite  agree. Some of them do. But as I said, any  mistake

made would be readjusted at the next reading.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no danger of meter readers losing their jobs as

a  result  of  consumers reading their own meters  because

from  time  to  time meter readers will be sent  to  check

whether  the  consumers themselves have  read  the  meters

correctly.



<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, two or three years ago, I received  a  bill

from  the  PUB  and if I am not mistaken, the  amount  was

around  $30. Subsequently, I lost this bill. Then I  wrote

to  the  PUB  for  a copy of the bill. One  week  later  I

received  a  reply  from the PUB sending  me  a  different

duplicate  bill asking me to make payment for two  months'

consumption.  This shows that the meter  readers  are  not

discharging  their  duties satisfactorily.  If  the  meter

readers  are not discharging their duties conscientiously,

what is the reason for this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I think I have replied to the

question  just  now  when  I  said  that  there  will   be

adjustments.  There may be one or two  meter  readers  who

probably did not do their work properly. On the whole,  Mr

Speaker, Sir,I do not think the Member for Geylang  Serai

has asked a supplementary question.

<div align="center"><b>RESITING OF PROPOSED COMMUNITY CENTRE AT BEDOK NEW TOWN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin</b> asked the Minister for

National Development and Communications if he will ask the

Housing  and  Development Board to consider  resiting  the

proposed community centre at Neighbourhood II of Bedok New

Town in Neighbourhood I in view of the urgent need of  the

residents in the latter area for a centre.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

choice  of  the  present community centre  site  in  Bedok

Neighbourhood  II  was made with the  concurrence  of  the

People's Association.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the planning viewpoint, the present location is

suitable  being  at the centre of the Bedok  Constituency,

and  convenient to both Neighbourhood I and  Neighbourhood

II.  The  present site is also unencumbered and  poses  no

clearance problems for construction purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all the buildings in Neighbourhood II are expected to

be  completed  sometime this year,  it  is  therefore  not

recommended to resite the proposed community centre  which

is  for the use of the residents in both Neighbourhoods  I

and II.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development and Communications how many families

in  the Kampong Kembangan Constituency whose premises have

been acquired by Government to make way for the Paya Lebar

Pan  Island  Expressway and the extension of  Sims  Avenue

have been given priority in the allocation of Housing  and

Development Board flats.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

proposed  Expressway project affected 272 families  within

the Kampong Kembangan Constituency. Of these, 182 families

are   eligible   for  priority  rehousing.  Six   families

undertook to find their own accommodation and 84  families

do  not  qualify  for  rehousing  because  of  citizenship

qualifications and the cut-off date rulings.  So  far,  25

families  were  relocated  to HDB  flats  on  resettlement

priority.  The  majority of these families were  allocated

flats  at  the  Bedok New Town. Of the remaining  priority

families, 157 are waiting for alternative accommodation in

the Geylang Serai/Bedok vicinity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed extension of Sims Avenue involved the

resettlement  of  235  families in the  Kampong  Kembangan

Constituency.  Of  these. 181 families  are  eligible  for

priority rehousing. 36 families undertook to find their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



own  accommodation while 18 families do  not  qualify  for

rehousing either because of citizenship qualifications  or

because  of  cutoff date rulings. A total of 133  families

were  already relocated to HDB flats mainly at Jalan Eunos

Estate on resettlement priority. Of the remaining priority

cases,   48   families   are   waiting   for   alternative

accommodation in the Geylang Serai/Bedok vicinity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the heavy demand for public housing in the

Katong/Bedok Zone, it is very unlikely that the  remaining

families  who are eligible for priority rehousing  can  be

given alternative accommodation in the Geylang Serai/Bedok

area.  They may have to be relocated to Ang Mo  Kio  where

accommodation is adequately available

<div align="center"><b>OPENING UP OF CENTRE DIVIDER ALONG BEDOK HIGHWAY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development  and Communications  if  the  Public

Works  Department  will  look  into  the  feasibility   of

constructing  an  opening from Bedok  Highway, which  has

light traffic, into the car park between Blocks 2 and 3 so

that traffic coming from Upper East Coast Road can make  a

right turn into the car park instead of having to go up to

New  Changi  Road to do a "U" turn, an extra  distance  of

approximately one kilometre.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Bedok

Highway  is  a  dual two-lane road with a  centre  divider

connecting  New Changi Road to Upper East Coast  Road  and

East  Coast Parkway. It is also the only link road between

Bedok New Town and East Coast Parkway. At present, traffic

volume  along  Bedok Highway is light but is  expected  to

increase  over a period. Because of this, it is  necessary

that  traffic disruption from side roads and  accesses  be

minimised.  There  have  been similar  requests  from  the

junior  college and factories in the vicinity to  open  up

the  centre divider along the Highway. These requests have

been turned down as traffic disruption from side roads and

accesses through the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



numerous  gaps  in  the  centre divider  will  defeat  the

purpose  of  the Highway. Therefore, it is not recommended

to  open  up  the  divider along Bedok  Highway  to  allow

traffic from Upper East Coast Road direction to turn right

into the car park between Blocks 2 and 3.

National  Development and Communications  when  the  earth

roads  at  Jalan  Masjid, Lengkong  Tiga,  Pachitan  Tiga,

Pachitan Empat, Pachitan Lima, Pachitan

Sepuloh and Jalan Wijaya will be metalled.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

metalling of kampong roads is normally carried out on  the

recommendations of the Citizens' Consultative  Committees.

Work will commence as soon as the Urban and Rural Services

Committee  has  approved the project and  the  landowner's

permission  is obtained. In the case of Lengkong  Tiga,  a

proposal  to metal the road was received in 1975. However,

the  project is delayed because the landowner's permission

has not been obtained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other kampong roads, so far no official

request  has  been  received from  the  Kampong  Kembangan

Citizens'   Consultative  Committee.  If  the  Member   of

Parliament  will put up proposals for metalling  of  these

roads,  the  Urban  and  Rural  Services  Committee   will

consider the request.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, these roads mentioned in the  Question  are

earth roads which have been pot-holed very badly, and with

earth  drains  always clogged up. If, as in  the  case  of

Lengkong  Tiga,  we  have  to  wait  for  the  landowner's

permission, then I think it is going to be very  difficult

to  get  the  work done. Is the Senior Minister  of  State

considering  any other way to facilitate the metalling  of

such  roads,  either  by  getting  the  approval  of   the

landowners more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



expeditiously  or to carry out the project  without  their

permission?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I share the sentiments of the

hon.  Member for Kampong Kembangan. But there  is  such  a

thing as procedures and requirements. If he owns a private

property,  I assume that he would not want us to  move  in

without his permission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member should differentiate between the temporary

repairing  of pot-holed roads and clogged drains  and  his

request for a proper metalling of the whole road.  In  the

case  of  repairs to roads, like the filling  up  of  pot-holes,  the procedure is to request the URSC to carry  out

the  repairs on an urgent basis. In fact, the Chairman  of

the  URSC has the authority to give the necessary approval

without going to the full Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's suggestion on expediting the process,

I  have  indicated  during the debate on  the  President's

speech  that for major road metalling projects,  the  URSC

will  consider getting bigger allocations from the  Budget

Division provided such indications are given, say, a  year

ahead of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his suggestion to go ahead and carry out the

project  without the landowner's permission,  it  is  most

undemocratic to do so.

Quarters; 43 blocks of Barrack Buildings; and 55 units  of

other  buildings  (churches,  schools, etc),  of  British

Services  properties  at Changi were  taken  over  by  the

Singapore  Government in two phases, one in 1970/71  and

the other in 1975/76.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 1,375 units, 1,285 units are fully utilised; 35

units    are   undergoing   renovations/alterations    for

alternative use/affected by development; and 55 units  are

vacant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "loss in revenue" or rather the additional income

that   would  accrue  to  Government  if  the  vacant   55

residential units were all let out, is estimated at around

$11,000 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cases of vandalism have occurred, especially during

the transitional period of the handover of the properties,

but the damage on this account was minimal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 55 vacant units are housing units made available to

members of the public for rental. Sale of the units, which

would   put   undesirable  constraints   on   the   future

development of this area, has been ruled out.

housing  units including the 55 vacant ones  in  the  area

bounded  by  Tanah  Merah  Besar  and  Upper  Changi  Road

accommodation. The distance from the City and the size  of

the  houses  and  compounds are  added  factors  dampening

demands  from  members of the public for  rental.  Rentals

have  been  reduced, in fact, from the original  range  of

$350-$500 per month to $200-$350 per month in an endeavour

to  get  all  of them occupied. This has met with  partial

reduction at all?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, that question should be directed at the

assessors. The Member did make representations in three of

26  cases  where  owners,  who originally  claimed  vacant

possession  compensation, subsequently requested  for  the

purchase    of    HDB   flats.   Consequent    on    these

representations, acquisition awards were adjusted in three

cases.  In one case, the original vacant possession  award

was  $26,000, the  adjusted increase  went  up  to  about

$29,000;  and $10,000 was subtracted for the  purchase  of

two  Housing and Development Board flats. In another case,

the  award was $56,500, that went up to about $60,000  and

$5,000  for the purchase of one flat left behind a balance

of   $54,850.  In  the  last  case,  the  original  vacant

possession   award  was  $85,000.  This  was  subsequently

adjusted to $99,000. $12,000 had to be put aside  for  the

purchase  of two HDB fIats and the rent of two HDB  flats,

leaving  a  balance of $87,000. Offers on the above  basis

have been made to the respective owners who have, however,

yet to indicate acceptance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why it should be 5% and not 2% or 1%, I do not

know.  Surely  that  question should be  directed  at  the

assessors  in  the  Land Office. But  the  Member  may  be

interested  to  know  that of the 144 owners  affected  by

these  acquisitions. 19 lodged appeals  with  the  Appeals

Board.   15  of  these  appeals  have  been  withdrawn,

consequent on adjustments in the awards. Since acquisition

proceedings  involve  legal rights  with  appeals  to  the

Appeals  Board, it is best that representations  on  these

matters be made either by the owners' solicitors or by the

owners  in  person, or through their Member of Parliament,

to  the  particular Collector of Land Revenue  responsible

for  assessing  and making awards under these  acquisition

proceedings. There are four Collectors of Land Revenue  in

the Land Office handling these acquisitions.

special  consideration to applications from blue  identity

card  holders  who are the only members in their  families

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the preparation of the Annual Report of the

Commission on a financial year basis;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) exemption of the National Statistical Commission's

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment was made in 1972, to provide for the

financial year of the National Statistical Commission,  to

be  brought in line with the Government's financial  year.

The  accounts  for  the Commission have  since  then  been

prepared  on  a financial year basis, ending  31st  March.

However,  the  Annual  Report of the  Commission  required

under the Act, is still being prepared on a calendar  year

basis.  Clauses 3 and 5 of the Bill would provide for  the

Commission's Annual Report to be prepared on  a  financial

year  basis,  enabling  the  Commission  to  present   its

accounts and its Annual Report together to Parliament.  In

Commission  with  the Statistics  Department  on  1st

has  been  delegated  to  the Statistics  Department.

Funds  previously under the control of the Commission

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament. pursuant to section 7 of the Civil

List and Pension Act (Chapter 52), resolves that the

Schedule to the said Act be varied by deleting the figures

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to increase the provisions for

the  Privy  Purse  by  $6,300  and  the  Salaries  of

Personal  Staff by $12,200. The increase  is  largely

required to meet the 1976 NWC wage supplement and the

annual increment of salaries of staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decrease of $4,520 under Expenses of Household

is  due  mainly  to  an  expected  reduction  in  the

consumption of public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



utilities because the staff no longer qualify for

free water. A lesser provision is also required for

Special Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, necessary to vary the provisions

in the schedule to the Civil List as follows:-



<pre>

 for the "Privy Purse" from $208,200 to $214,500;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1977 to 31st March, 1978."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have distributed in advance to Honourable

Members  my  Economic  Survey  of  Singapore,   1976.

Honourable  Members  will find it further  simplified

and  improved from last year's Survey to give them  a

better  appreciation of our economy's performance  in

1976. I would like nevertheless to highlight some  of

the  features of the Survey before going on to  speak

of the financial policy for the coming year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Singapore's Economy in 1976</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1976 saw the gradual recovery of the world economy, with

the  industrialised  countries  in  the  Organisation  for

Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) making a  real

growth  of  5%.  There  was also less  inflation  in  most

countries, with the OECD as a whole registering  8%, down

from  11.2% in 1975. Singapore benefited from the  world

economic  revival, with real growth at  7.0%.  At  current

prices,  growth was 9.6%. The GDP deflator  was  a  modest

2.4%, indicating the stable price conditions in 1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More remarkable, the Consumer Price Index fell by 2% in

1976.  This  was, in large measure, due to the  relatively

stable  food  and  oil  prices.  But  Government's   anti-profiteering measures and consumers' efforts also played a

role  in  keeping prices down. The unemployment  rate  for

1976  remained  at  a low 4.5%, the same  as  a  year  ago

Unemployment,  measured by the number of  persons  seeking

work  at  the  Labour Exchange, fell from  39,500  at  the

beginning of the year to 30,750 at the end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing industries, with the exception of

shipbuilding, staged a comeback, with a real growth of 10%

in 1976 in contrast to the negative 2% in 1975. Trade also

increased a welcome 21% after a decline of 7% the previous

year. Tourism remained buoyant. Tourist arrivals increased

by  13%,  very near the average growth rate of the  pre-energy crisis years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although below the average growth for the past five

years, our  7%  economic growth in 1976  may  perhaps  be

considered  not unsatisfactory. The policy of diversifying

our economic activities has made us less vulnerable to the

violent fluctuations of the world economy.



<br><br><i>Prospects for 1977</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World economic recovery, which was strong in the first

half  of 1976, slowed down in the second half as the major

industrialised  countries feared, by setting  too  fast  a

pace, to trigger off another round of inflation. As a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



result,  there was some stagnation in growth and increased

unemployment.  However, the  Governments  of  the   major

industrialised countries have since considered measures to

stimulate their economies again to provide more  jobs  and

reduce  unemployment  in their own  countries.  For  their

trading partners, such renewed growth will have the effect

of providing an increased demand in export markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of causing unacceptable increases in inflation,

however,  remains. The recent two-tier oil price increases

by  the  OPEC countries will impose further restraints  to

economic stimulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, therefore, the world may grow more slowly

this year than in 1976. The OECD countries are expected to

make only 3 3/4% in real GNP growth, down 1 1/4% from

1976. Inflation is forecast to increase by

7 1/2%, the  same as last year. World trade is  expected  to

grow at 6%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's own performance in 1977 will naturally be

affected by these external circumstances. We can, however,

try  to take advantage of differences which appear now  to

exist   between  the  developed  countries  in  the   less

synchronised economic conditions of 1977. We can also,  by

appropriate domestic policies, counteract some of the more

negative effects of a world economic slowdown.



<br><br><i>Economic Strategy Programme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been five years since I announced in this House

our  Economic Strategy Programme for the 1 970s. This  was

aimed at modernising and transforming Singapore's economic

structure  so  that  it would become  a  `brain'  services

centre.  A  package  of public policies  was  designed  to

fulfil  the  five  basic objectives of  the  Programme  in

manpower, science and technology, infrastructure, taxation

and  promotion. The Programme was intended to be flexible.

In  the event, it had to accommodate the energy crisis and

the worldwide recession which followed it. We had to scale

down  our  expectations. It may be useful  to  review  the

present status of the Programme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us start with our manpower development programmes in

education  and industrial training. The annual  output  of

graduates  from the technical institutions, including  the

Singapore   Polytechnic,  Ngee  Ann   Technical   College.

Industrial   Training  Board  and  the  Joint   Industrial

Training  Centres administered by the Economic Development

Board  has increased from 5,240 in 1972 to 8,930 in  1976.

The training of skills was concentrated on the engineering

trades,  metal  machining and fabrication as  well  as  on

selected  fields of precision engineering. There  are  now

5,155  apprentices  under training in  various  industries

compared  to  574  five years ago The demand  for  skilled

manpower  by  our  industries is being  largely  met.  The

technical  bias  introduced a year ago  in  our  education

system  will  further  provide the  essential  element  of

correct  work  attitudes to complement the inculcation  of

skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for development of science and technology, our

manufacturing  industries have become  more  technological

and  sophisticated. A good indicator of this technological

advancement  is  the  value-added  per  worker.  This  has

increased in real terms from $8,814 per worker in 1972  to

$10,088  in  1976. Investment commitments  in  the  higher

value-added  industries  accounted  for  84.7%  of   total

investments  compared  to  78.2%  five  years  ago.   Such

advancement was achieved across a wide range of industries

from   electrical  machinery  and  appliances, transport

equipment, and textiles to metal fabrication and precision

engineering.  Our industrial base has also been  broadened

by  greater  diversification which  gives  flexibility  in

meeting ever fluctuating external demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps more visible are the results in infrastructure

development.  We  have now adequate  industrial  land  and

buildings  to  meet the demands of investors.  The  Jurong

Town Corporation has in the past five years prepared 1,800

hectares  of  industrial land and completed  252  standard

factory buildings and 207,200 square metres of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



flatted  factory  space.  Communication  links  have  been

expanded  to meet the needs of our manufacturing, trading

and  business  communities. They can now communicate  with

175  countries through the much improved telecommunication

facilities. Automatic telex services are now available  to

88  countries. Such services are well used. The number  of

outgoing  telex  calls  rose  from  356,000  in  1972   to

2,312,000  last year. Domestically, there are now  374,000

telephone  links, almost doubling the number in 1972.  The

rapid  growth  in  the industrial and  commercial  sectors

would   also  not  have  been  possible  without  expanded

utilities supplies. The Public Utilities Board has now  at

its disposal an installed capacity of 1.390 MW electricity

compared  to 704 MW five years ago. We are now in  a  much

better position to meet demand for infrastructure services

at short notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, our efforts to promote Singapore as a centre of

international finance and tourism have also achieved  some

success.  Financial operations have expanded  greatly  The

number  of banks established in Singapore was 72 in  1976.

There  is  a  swing  towards  offshore  and  international

banking  with  the  setting up of  offshore  and  merchant

banks. The Asian Dollar Market is now serviced by 69 Asian

Currency  Units and has expanded from US$2,980 million  of

deposits  in  1972 to the present US$17,350 million.  With

the  raising  of  15 Asian Dollar Bonds, our  financial

centre  may  be  said  to  have  attained  maturity.  Such

development  has  been made possible by fiscal  incentives

and by rationalisation of banking procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid growth of the tourist industry is shown in

tourist arrivals, which increased from 880,200 in 1972  to

1,492,200 last year. We should now be adding to our 10,255

hotel  rooms. Of interest also is the convention  business

which  has  expanded  significantly. 133  conventions  and

exhibitions were held last year compared to 80 in 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, therefore, we have laid a sound foundation for

sustained growth through the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



five basic elements of our long-term development strategy.

My  Ministry's Economic Planning Model predicts  that,  on

this  strategy and barring major upheavals  in  the  world

economy, we should be able to achieve an annual growth  of

6 - 8%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning from consideration of our development strategy,

I  would  now like to discuss the tactics we can adopt  to

foster economic growth in 1977.



<br><br><i>Industrial Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite difficulties and by employing many of its best

staff overseas, the Economic Development Board's promotion

efforts succeeded in attracting investment commitments  of

$364.2  million  in  1976. However, 58%  of  this  is  for

expansion  by  industries  already  operating  here  Large

unused  production capacity and high unemployment  in  the

industrialised countries no doubt affected the drop in new

investments   from  overseas.  The  task   of   investment

promotion for the coming year remains difficult



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we can only sometimes offset adverse external

developments,  we  must continue  to  press  on  with  our

promotion efforts in the United States, Japan and  Western

Europe.  On  the home front, however, we shall maintain  a

healthy  investment climate. We shall do what  we  can  to

keep  our  major production costs stable, and ensure  that

industrial   facilities  and  services  will  be   readily

available for investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall pay special attention to the relatively smaller

but  more  technology-oriented industries. More industrial

finance  will  be  given  through the  Capital  Assistance

Scheme  beyond  the  $16  million so  far  approved.  Such

finance   will  also  be  available  through   the   Small

Industries Finance Scheme, in which 14 cases have  already

been  approved, involving a total of $1.73  million.  This

Scheme  should  gather greater momentum this  year.  As  a

further  step, the Jurong Town Corporation will  construct

smaller  factory  buildings to suit supporting  industries

and services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Trade Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard our economic interests, our trade,

investment and diplomatic offices will be strengthened  in

key  centres.  Government and traders  must  work  closely

together   if   we   are  to  counter   the   increasingly

protectionistic  attitude of some  of  our  major  trading

partners,  consolidate  our  established  markets  in  the

United  States, Japan and Western Europe, and explore  new

markets especially in West Asia. In the development of new

markets, it is vital that we build up as many contacts  as

possible. We shall therefore consider setting up permanent

exhibition  centres in West Asian markets to  promote  our

manufactured products and services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist our exporters to meet the very keen

competition in international trade, cheaper export finance

is  being  made available. The MAS rate to the  Banks  for

rediscounting  export bills has been made more  attractive

by pegging it at 2% below the average prime rate. Further.

the  rate  is now being adjusted frequently to  take  into

account  the regular fluctuations in the prime  rate.  Our

exporters  should  also make more use  of  the  facilities

provided  since  June  last  year  by  the  Export  Credit

Insurance  Corporation, especially  for  sales  to  lesser

known new markets and customers.



<br><br><i>ASEAN Economic Cooperation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Conference of ASEAN Heads of Government held

in  Bali  a  year  ago, some progress  has  been  made  by

Economic  Ministers  and officials  of  the  five  member-countries  on  the establishment of five ASEAN  industrial

projects  and  on  the  terms  for  according  each  other

preferential  trading  arrangements.  The  ASEAN  Economic

Ministers have approved an Agreement on ASEAN Preferential

Trading  Arrangements and have defined  in  the  Rules  of

Origin   the   nature  of  the  products  to  which   such

preferential  arrangements may be extended. The  Agreement

will  provide  the  framework  for  any  multilateral   or

bilateral  agreements  for  preferences  between   member-countries. Accordingly, our bilateral agreements with  the

Philippines and Thailand respectively for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



a  mutual  across-the-board reduction of 10%  of  existing

tariffs  on all products traded between us will be brought

within  the  framework of the Agreement  for  Preferential

Trading  Arrangements. Under the terms of  the  Agreement,

however, any  bilateral Preferential Trading Arrangements

must  also  be  extended, if so desired,  to  other  ASEAN

members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore made some modest beginnings in ASEAN

economic cooperation. If there were a sense of urgency  in

the  political Ieaderships of the ASEAN countries to  meet

our long term problems, then I am confident there will  be

the political will and a spirit of give and take, and much

more development may be expected in the coming years.



<br><br><i>Services Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By improving transportation and communications

facilities,  as  well  as finance and insurance  services,

Singapore  has  developed rapidly as a  regional  services

centre. We are now well organised in the offshore banking,

insurance  and oil businesses. We are equally  well-placed

to   become   a  centre  for  regional  and  international

warehousing activities, especially for capital  goods  and

equipment.  We shall therefore try to encourage  over  the

next  few  years international corporations  to  establish

their   distribution  operations  here.  As  some   fiscal

incentive  may be necessary for this purpose,  the  Fiscal

Policy Implementation Committee has been asked to consider

appropriate measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should also be further development of our

Financial  Centre,  Facilities in the forward  market  for

foreign  exchange will be further expanded  to  provide  a

sufficiently  large market in foreign exchange  to  enable

commerce  and industry to hedge their future receipts  and

payments in foreign currencies. The Monetary Authority  is

also considering further measures to develop the secondary

markets  in  fixed  interest securities and  Asian  Dollar

Negotiable Certificates of Deposit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for tourism, we shall encourage more convention

business  in  Singapore by both regional and international

groups.  We  would therefore have to expand our convention

facilities  with  more hotel rooms and  convention  halls,

with  perhaps  one  large convention centre  which  hotels

might   participate  jointly  in  developing.   Convention

business  can best be secured at source and our hoteliers,

airlines  and travel agents must redouble their  promotion

efforts  overseas  to woo more such business.  Government.

through  the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board and Sentosa

Development Corporation, will supplement their efforts  by

developing more tourist facilities and attractions.



<br><br><i>Wages Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our past performance in manufacturing, trade and

services  has  been assisted by policies of  orderly  wage

increases  and good labour-management relations.  We  must

ensure  that this situation continues, The National  Wages

Council  should now consider the full offsetting from  the

annual single wage increase award of all increases granted

since  the  last award whether from increments granted  in

wage  scales or from any form of fringe benefits. In  this

way,  we  can perhaps hope to keep our wages at reasonable

rates  for  industries competing in an extremely difficult

world   market,   against  countries   beset   with   high

unemployment and spare manufacturing capacities  Countries

so  afflicted will provide stiff competition not  only  to

the  products  but  also  to the  services  we  sell.  Our

shipbuilding and shiprepair industries know this only  too

well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While workers must put in their best efforts, employers

have  an  equal responsibility to improve their management

of  personnel  or  of  plant  and  machinery  to  increase

productivity.  Employers should consider the  introduction

of  appropriate  incentive  schemes  to  reward  efficient

workers   for  their  productivity.  The  initiative   for

formulating  such schemes is clearly their  responsibility

as  they have the greater resources and experience in this

area.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Manpower Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manpower development programmes must now emphasise

training  in more and more specialised skills,  To  instil

correct  work  attitudes  in our workers,  employers  must

provide  a  proper  working  environment,  Good  employers

usually have hardworking dedicated workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With basic manpower needs largely met, we should next

develop  the  quality  of  our  managerial  and  executive

grades.   The  new  managers  should  possess   not   only

management  and  entrepreneurial  capabilities,  but  also

technical competence in the new industries. These managers

may  need  to learn their skills by working their  way  up

through  as many plant operations as possible.  They  will

after all merely be repeating the experience of so many of

the  top  management  executives  in  the  biggest  multi-national corporations.



<br><br><i>Concluding Remarks on Economic Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall continue to pursue our long term economic

strategy programme for our economy's transformation to  an

industrial   centre   and   a  base   for   regional   and

international  services. In dealing with the uncertainties

and  difficulties of the next few years, we shall  need  a

more  flexible approach to developments in the  region  as

well  as  the  major  industrialised countries.  To  react

quickly to unfavourable trends, our manufacturers, traders

and  businessmen must devote more effort  to  develop  new

markets,  Government will, on its part, do all it  can  to

assist  and to safeguard and promote Singapore's  economic

interests.



<br><br><i>FY 77 Budget Estimates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to move on to the Main

and Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detailed analysis in the Memorandum on the Main and

Development Estimates, together with the review of  public

finance  in the Economic Survey, should provide Honourable

Members   with  all  necessary  information.   I   propose

therefore to be brief in my remarks. But I should  perhaps

first comment on the changes in format that have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



been  introduced  to the Establishment List.  These  have

been  made  necessary because the Government establishment

system  has been improved. It has been found desirable  to

do away with the system of grading of appointments and the

payment   of  acting  allowances  for  such  appointments.

Officers  will now hold appointments in their  substantive

grades.  Promotions will not depend on  vacancies  in  the

civil   service  but  be  on  the  basis  of  merit.   The

Establishment List for FY 77 will therefore no longer show

grades  of appointment under Heads of Expenditure. Instead

the  authorised  manpower of each Ministry  is  classified

according  to  Personnel groups and the  number  of  posts

approved  for  each  group is shown in  the  Establishment

List.



<br><br><i>Expenditure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total expenditure being budgeted for FY 77 is $5,459

million,  but  almost  half  of  this  will  be  spent  on

Development. This is in line with the rate of  expenditure

on  development that has occurred over the past few years.

In  FY  75, budgeted development expenditure  was  $2,188

million and in FY 76, $2,610 million. In FY 77 it will  be

$2,708  million.  The  object is  to  help  stimulate  the

economy and accelerate economic recovery. To this end  the

major  expenditures  have been allocated  to  those  areas

where Government spending has been most effective in pump-priming  the economy, that is, to public housing which  at

$980  million represents 18% of total expenditure  and  to

airport  and  road  development at  $394  million,  Direct

Government expenditure on economic services will be $1,174

million or 43% of expenditure on development. Of this.$553

million  will  be spent to further promote  public  sector

investment  in industrial and commercial development.  The

money  will  be disbursed largely as loans to  the  Jurong

Town   Corporation  and  to  industrial   and   commercial

enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This large expenditure on development will be made

possible  because  of stringent pruning of  the  recurrent

expenditure estimates especially on staff and manpower  in

the civil service. This will enable a transfer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



of $611 million to be made from the Main Estimates to the

Development  Fund.  The amount of $611  million  compares

with  $625  million in FY 76 and $500  million  in  FY  75

Excluding  the  $61  1 million transfer,  total  recurrent

expenditure  under  the Main Estimates  will  be  $2,751.1

million. This is only 11% higher than for FY 76. It is the

minimum   required  to  maintain  the  present  level   of

Government services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff increases have been provided only for new

functions or the expansion of present activities. The  net

increase in the permanent establishment for FY 77  is  144

posts  or 0.2% over the FY 76 establishment, a record  low

for  the civil service for the past few years. At the same

time, it must be recognised that the posts which have been

approved  are  essential and must be filled  substantively

The organisation and staffing of the civil service plays a

crucial  role  in  the  ability of the  administration  to

expand judiciously and economically the very large sums of

money  allocated  in the Budget. There  are  shortages  of

officers  in a number of Ministries, especially Education,

Home   Affairs,   Health  and  Defence.   Recruitment   is

progressing  and  will be closer to establishment  in  the

coming year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Other Operating Expenditure the increase

of $239.4 million or 13.8% has been kept down by stringent

controls over expenditure and the more stable price levels

that have prevailed in FY 76.



<br><br><i>Revenue</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must now consider how the large expenditures in FY 77

are to be financed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated revenue for FY 77 at existing tax

rates  is $3,362 million This represents an increase  over

the  revised estimate for FY 76 of 6.3% and an improvement

over the expected growth rate for FY 75 of 2.3%.



Income tax is still the largest single source of revenue,

with 41% of total receipts, or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



$1,380 million for FY 77, up 15% over expected receipts in FY 76.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue of $3,362 million will be sufficient to

cover the current expenditure and leave a balance of $611

million   which   will  be  available  for   transfer   to

development account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of this large contribution from revenue account

of  $611 million to finance development, there remains  a

deficit  of  $1,505 million. Would it not be  possible  to

cover part of this by new or increased taxes?



<br><br><i>Tax Changes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members who have read the Ministry of Finance

Addendum to the President's speech already know that  this

possibility   would   make  no  more   than   a   marginal

contribution towards reducing the large deficit. For  this

FY 77 Budget I am not introducing any new taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> As for changes to existing taxes, I

propose only two small increases in taxes which will bring

in  some  $8.8  million. However, I also  intend  to  give

several  tax  concessions, the cost of which  will  partly

offset this increased revenue.



<br><br><i>Tax Increases</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first take the two tax increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Measures introduced by the Government to discourage

smoking as a grave health hazard appear to be losing  much

of  their  earlier effect and now need reinforcing.  I  am

therefore  increasing the duty on tobacco and  cigarettes.

Duty  on leaf tobacco will rise from $35 to $36 per  kilo.

Import  duty on cigarettes will rise from $43 to  $45  per

kilo while excise duty will increase from $3.70 to $4  per

kilo Cigars and cheroots will rise from $40.60 to $45  per

kilo  and  pipe tobacco retail and pipe tobacco bulk  will

rise  from $28 to $30 per kilo and $22.40 to $25 per  kilo

respectively.  Increases are also made  on  other  tobacco

products,  namely, beedies, snuff, cut rag, ang  hoon  and

tobacco which is not elsewhere specified or included.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revision of duty which is expected to yield an

additional  $2.3 million in revenue will come into  effect

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)With effect from today also, I am raising the import

duty  on intoxicating liquors. Import duty on brandy  will

rise  from $165 to $200 per decalitre (dal) while the duty

on whisky will rise from $165 to $190 per dal. Rum and gin

will  also  increase from $165 to $190 per  dal,  liqueurs

from  $165 to $185 per dal and other spirit beverages from

$215  to $240 per proof dal. Import duties on malt liquors

and  samsu will also increase. Beer will rise from $25  to

$27  per  dal, stout from $25 to $26 per dal and samsu  at

60%  proof  strength  from  $125  to  $130  per  dal.  The

additional revenue yield is $6.5 million.



<br><br><i>Tax Concessions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be four tax concessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To encourage home ownership and the more stable

society comprised of home owners, the present tax rates on

estate duty will be revised with effect from 1 April  1977

The  exemption  limit will be increased  from  $50,000  to

$100,000   and   the   remission  limit   will   also   be

correspondingly  raised  from $230,000  to  $280,000.  The

effect  of  this  concession will be that  all  properties

under $100,000 will pay no estate duty at all. This should

cover  all  HDB  and  most HUDC flats  and  possibly  some

terrace houses. For properties valued between $100,000 and

$280,000, the  raising of the remission limit  will  also

mean  a  reduction  of tax from what  would  presently  be

payable. For example, a $200,000 house would be taxed at

$3,337.50  only, instead of $8,837.50, payable  under  the

existing  estate  duty  liability.  The  easing   of   the

exemption  and  remission limits  on  estate  duty  should

ensure  that in almost all cases, families will  not  lose

their houses because of too heavy estate duties



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This concession is for about 1,700 resident

pensioners  who  are paying income tax  on  the  pensions

they receive, mostly as Government pensioners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to revise the basis of the tax on their

pensions. The pension periodically paid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



to  them  is  similar  to the annuity  paid  by  insurance

companies  for  which  Members  will  remember   the   tax

concession I previously gave by remitting the tax  on  the

portion of it representing a capital repayment. Similarly,

the  pension  payment  may be treated  as  comprising  two

elements, one element being part repayment of capital  and

the other, payment of interest on the capital. At present.

both elements are subject to income tax. Only the interest

portion should properly be considered as income and  taxed

accordingly. This I therefore propose to do. For  purposes

of  assessment,  it  will be convenient  if  the  interest

element   is   treated  as  one  half  of   the   pension.

Effectively, therefore, tax will be payable on  only  half

of  the pension. This concession will, however, only apply

to  resident pensioners. The revenue loss is estimated  at

$600,000 per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take effect from Year of Assessment 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To further develop Singapore as a financial centre

and its Asian Dollar Market from its present gross size of

US$17.3  billion, the tax on income derived  from  Asian

Dollar  Market  operations will be  streamlined.  The  10%

concessionary  tax  will  now be  extended  to  cover  all

offshore   income   derived  from  Asian   Dollar   Market

operations  other  than exchange profits and  transactions

with domestic banking units and residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, income derived from transactions amongst

Asian   Currency  Units  (ACUs)  and  with  banks  outside

Singapore  will  be  taxed at the rate  of  10%, and  the

necessary  certification requirements from banks  overseas

will be abolished. Such transactions include dealings  and

holdings  of foreign currency, negotiable certificates  of

deposits  and bankers acceptances, broking, and  dealings.

holdings,  floatation  and underwriting  of  Asian  Dollar

bonds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present formula of establishing profits to be taxed

at  the  concessionary rate has not worked satisfactorily.

The  formula  will  be  modified to ensure  that  offshore

operations will enjoy in full the concessionary  tax  rate

of 10%.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concession will take effect from Year of Assessment

1978, that is, to cover earnings in 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Because of our locational advantage and good

business  infrastructure, Singapore has the  potential  to

become  an  important  centre  for  reinsurance  business.

However, the high tax rate of 40% imposed on the income of

resident  companies, whether such income is earned  within

or  outside  Singapore, has offered  little  incentive  to

reinsurance   companies  to  retain  their   premiums   in

Singapore. I am therefore changing the tax on income  from

reinsurance business to a concessionary rate of 10%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concession will take effect also from Year of

Assessment 1978.



<br><br><i>Government Borrowing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the yield from the two tax increases is partly offset

by  the  loss  in tax concessions, the deficit  of  $1,505

million  shown  in  the  Estimates  is  not  significantly

changed  in amount. To meet such deficit, there  could  be

some  drawing  down  from  the  Development  Fund  of  the

surpluses that have been accumulated over the years.



Another  possibility is for the Government  to  borrow  to

make up the shortfall. How much of this will eventually be

met  from  borrowings  and how much by  drawing  down  our

reserves, it is too early to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our capacity to borrow is indicated by the increase in

1976  in our domestic debt by $1,501 million, and  in  our

external debt by $117 million. The recent Swiss  Loan  of

50 million Swiss Francs which was successfully



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



floated at a coupon rate of 5 1/2% and an issue price of  99

shows our high credit standing in international markets.



<br><br><i>Concluding Remarks</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have weathered severe economic

storms in the last 3 1/2 years I hope nothing as shocking  as

the  1973  oil embargo and quadrupling of oil prices  ever

happens  again. The weather is getting fine and  fair  and

our  Ship  of  State is in good shape. The command  should

therefore be "Steady as she goes."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.
