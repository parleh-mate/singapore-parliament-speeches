both  the basic and advanced theory driving manuals for  learner

drivers, and in the syllabus of all the driving schools.     The

importance  of  road safety and road courtesy, including  giving

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorists who do not give way to ambulances and other

emergency  vehicles can be fined up to $160 and given 4  demerit

Estimates be reduced by $100."  [Mr Leong Horn Kee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir, with

your permission, I would like to answer the question which I was

not able to complete at yesterday's sitting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has suggested that the GST exemption

threshold  should be raised from $1 million to $2  million.   He

also  asked whether GST registered businesses could delay  their

payment  to the Income Tax Department for GST collected  by  one

quarter to help ease their cashflow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the current GST annual turnover limit of $1

million is already high and excludes, therefore, practically all

small businesses.  With this $1 million turnover threshold, most

businesses  such as provision shops, retail shops,  hawkers  and

HDB shopkeepers are exempt from applying GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, businesses are already allowed to file returns

on  a  monthly or quarterly basis and pay IRAS the GST collected

within  one month after the returns are filed.  The traders  who

are  in a net refund position from Government usually choose  to

file  returns on a monthly basis.  Businesses with  turnover  of

less  than  $1  million but has voluntarily registered  for  GST

purposes  are  also allowed to file returns  on  a  half  yearly

basis.   As  the  GST payable is, in fact, money collected  from

customers, the traders who choose to file quarterly returns have

the  use of GST collected for two months on average.  Since  the

GST  is  not  a tax on the trader, unlike income tax,  there  is

therefore  no basis to allow companies to keep the  money  which

belongs to Government any longer than what is already provided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, local companies have been lamenting about the rising

cost  of  doing business in Singapore for several  years.   They

have  been encountering cost pressures in terms of increases  in

wages, fees and rentals.  Now, with the economic slowdown, local

companies  are  facing  the  added problems  of  lower  business

turnover and credit squeeze.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier in my speech during the budget

debate,  more than 50% of local firms feel that their businesses

will  be badly affected by the economic slowdown, both in  terms

of  local  and  foreign  sales.  On the other  hand,  they  also

encounter difficulties with banks which are now putting a credit

squeeze on their banking lines.  It is fair to expect that banks

would  wish  to  review their loan exposure and  minimise  their

doubtful  debts.  However, in the process, local  companies  are

being  further squeezed by higher interest cost and fewer credit

facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of cost of doing business, local companies wish

to  see  that the Government could consider reducing  rates  and

fees  such  as  HDB and JTC rentals, instead of just  putting  a

freeze  on  them.  In the area of increasing costs, local  firms

have  found  that  in  the  last two  years,  PSA  has  actually

increased  their  fees  three times.   Now,  with  the  expected

introduction  of ERP, businesses are also concerned  that  their

transport costs will increase, since it is essential for them to

travel,  especially along the expressways so as to  ensure  fast

delivery of their products.  Hence, ERP may, over a longer term,

cause them to incur higher transportation costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local companies are also faced with the burden of higher

financing cost of borrowings.  Most small firms are charged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



2-3%  above  prime  rate for bank borrowings.   In  addition  to

borrowing cost, they also have to incur higher interest  charge,

and thereby weakening their already poor cashflow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Government

would  consider doing a comprehensive review of the  problem  of

cost  of  doing business for local firms, in the  light  of  the

economic slowdown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I also like to urge the Minister to look into

the  problem of credit squeeze faced by local companies.   As  a

result  of  the  higher costs and tightening bank  credit,  many

local  firms  may  be forced to close.  This will  have  serious

repercussions  on  the  economy.   It  will,  in  turn,   create

unemployment and hardship for Singaporeans.  Hence, I would like

the  Government  to  monitor closely the  health  of  the  local

industries.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, as my GPC Chairman

has  alluded to, the number one gripe of the business  community

has  to  be  the rising, if not high, cost of doing business  in

Singapore.    The  attendant  issue  of  the  erosion   of   our

competitiveness is fundamental to our survival.  These  concerns

have  been  made  more pronounced in the light  of  the  current

economic and financial crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our GPC's various feedback sessions, complaints and

concerns range from expensive real estate to high manpower  cost

to  a heavy burden of Government fees and charges.  Most seem to

accept that with the limited manpower resources available, there

is  little  room to artificially raise supply without  affecting

work  quality.  Yet, on the other hand, the Economic Development

Board  has managed to clinch record investment commitments  year

after  year, which is a feat not to be scoffed at.  What  is  it

that  draws  multi-national corporations to Singapore  from  the

wide  range  of choices that they have?  Political and  economic

stability is obviously an important prerequisite, but this  must

be matched by a viable business cost profile.  For at the end of

the day, it is still dollars and cents that speak loudest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister is, therefore, a fundamental

one.   What is our operating cost profile, for the country as  a

whole  or  by  sectors,  in  terms of  the  various  components,

including  real estate, manpower, Government fees  and  charges?

And  how  does  this  breakdown  or  profile  compare  with  our

competition?   More  importantly, is the real  estate  component

disproportionately high as felt by many?  Finally, does our cost

structure resulting from the free market forces in play for real

estate   and   manpower  inherently  disadvantage  the   smaller

operators?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim is not here. Mr Tay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

over the past few days, the debate in this House has focused  on

the  question of the rising cost of doing business in Singapore.

This  is  because  these  are the key factors  that  affect  the

survival and development of our businesses and our international

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the operating cost of doing business, I think the

various  levies  and  charges  imposed  by  the  Government  and

statutory  boards account for a very large proportion,  such  as

factory  and  shop  rentals, utilities charges,  foreign  labour

levies,  property  taxes, GST and port charges.   Recently,  the

devaluation of currencies in our neighbouring countries has made

it  more difficult for us to compete with them in terms  of  our

cost  of business.  Over the long term, this will be detrimental

to our exports and  external trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a recent survey conducted by the Singapore

Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry among its members, more

than  50% of its members fear that there will be rising cost  of

doing business in various degrees, and this includes the charges

and  levies  imposed  by  the Government and  statutory  boards.

Obviously,  any  such  charges  and  levies  and  their   upward

adjustments will accumulate to produce serious negative  effects

on the cost of doing business here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the greatest worry among the business community is

that  adjustments of Government charges and levies appear to  be

made  on  the  basis  of "to each his own",  and  are  aimed  at

balancing  income  with expenditure or accumulating  substantial

surpluses.  Under such circumstances, the Government departments

and  statutory boards,  because of the rising cost, will compete

to  adjust upwards their own charges and levies and neglect  the

overall competitive edge of the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to solve these key issues, I would suggest

that  the  Government  set up a review committee  on  Government

charges  and  levies in order to review and monitor the  various

adjustments by the Government and statutory boards.  This is  to

ensure   that  such  adjustments  are  reasonable  and  properly

coordinated.  In this way, our businesses can then rely  on  the

price-competitive and efficient public facilities  and  services

to maintain our international competitiveness.

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T. E. Lim (Aljunied):</b> Sir, rentals are not usually

a  large component of total business costs, but nonetheless they

are  a significant component.  I would therefore like to address

this  issue.  I will confine my remarks to rentals about factory

spaces  although the same principle would also  apply  to  other

industrial and commercial properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a stable and open market, rentals are set by

negotiations  between  willing sellers and  willing  buyers.   A

price that is produced by this interaction reflects the level at

which  tenants are able to profitably and productively make  use

of rented space.  These market transactions are therefore a good

benchmark  for the HDB and JTC to set their posted  prices,  but

under  stable market conditions.  In a falling market,  however,

these  benchmarks represent only the ability of new  tenants  to

pay this price and are no longer representative of the prices at

which existing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



tenants  are  able  to profitably make use of  this  space.   By

right, existing tenants who cannot afford the rentals should now

give up their space.  And if no new tenants can be found, market

prices will then fall.  But if tenants at the posted prices  can

be  found,  then  market  prices will be  maintained.   But  the

existing  tenants may find it difficult to give up  their  space

immediately,  even though they may be better off doing  so,  and

there are several reasons for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, tenants may be locked into long leases. They

may  not  be  able to break their leases without having  to  pay

stiff penalties.  Secondly, they may not be able to give up just

a  portion  of the rented premises and keep the rest because  of

the  specific configuration of the factory space.  Thirdly, they

may  still need the space even though it is no longer profitable

nor  productive  just to store slow moving inventory.   The  net

effect  of  these  reasons is that businesses will  hold  on  to

rented  premises  at  higher prices for some  time  before  they

finally give up the space.  High occupancy levels, therefore, do

not  necessarily mean that posted rents still reflect the  rates

that tenants are able to pay.  They may simply have no choice in

the short term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many HDB and JTC tenants are already paying less than the

posted prices, but this only proves that not all businesses  can

afford  to pay posted prices.  In a rising market, it  would  be

correct  for  the Government to continue to adjust  these  below

market rentals gradually to the level of the posted prices.  But

in  a  falling  market, it is inadequate for the  Government  to

simply  freeze  posted prices.  The real level of  affordability

has already fallen even though the statistics do not necessarily

show  it,  because  of the lag factors which I  have  enumerated

above.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has said that the Government

should  not  wait for all the statistics to be available  before

taking  action.   He  has  said that we should  also  allow  for

anecdotal  evidence  to  guide us in interpreting  the  emerging

market  trends.   I  hope therefore that MTI  would  accept  the

feedback  from  the many Members of this House who  have  spoken

that   rental  levels  are  too  high  for  many  of  our  small

businesses.  I am glad to hear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



that   MTI  consults  regularly  with  the  business  community.

Perhaps it would be useful also if the Ministry makes some field

trips to speak to small businesses directly, those who rent just

a  few  hundred square metres of space in HDB and JTC factories.

Then  they  can see and hear for themselves the real  impact  on

these small businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they will find sufficient evidence that there is a

case  to  not  just freeze rentals but to adjust  posted  prices

downwards  and to slow down or indeed to freeze the increase  in

rental  rates  for  those who are already  paying  below  posted

rents.  If the Ministry would do this, perhaps for a year or two

or three, until such time as the economy rebounds, it would help

a lot of small companies to ride through this rough patch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the lower rentals, business costs can also

be  reduced  by streamlining operations.  However, some  of  the

current rules by HDB and JTC make it difficult for businesses to

do  so.  For example, an HDB tenant who spoke to me said that he

rents  three  separate units of flatted factory space  from  the

HDB.   To  streamline  his  operations,  he  has,  on  his  own,

negotiated  and agreed with other tenants to swap factory  units

so  that he can have a single contiguous space.  However, he  is

unable  to make this exchange with other tenants for the  reason

that  their rentals would go up if they make the swap with  him.

This  happens because the tenants he wants to exchange the  unit

with  are paying less than posted rental rates.  HDB treats  the

exchange  of  units  as  two separate transactions,  firstly,  a

return  of  each unit to HDB and, secondly, a new allocation  of

each unit to the tenant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that both the HDB and JTC would reconsider this

rule.  The tenant should pay the same total rent as he had  paid

before  the  exchange with his fellow tenants.  Some adjustments

can  be made for technical factors, such as the location of  the

unit  or  the  quality of the finish.  But the rents  themselves

should  not be adjusted to current posted price.  In  this  way,

HDB  or  JTC would not collect less rent than before.   The  new

tenants or the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



existing  tenants  will  also not have to  pay  more  rent  than

before.   But  they  would  still  be  able  to  save  cost   by

streamlining  their operations.  The total space utilised  would

be  more  efficient. This is a "win-win" situation for  all.   I

hope  therefore that the Minister would ask the HDB and  JTC  to

consider this suggestion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Many companies have responded to the

Government's  call  to regionalise by investing  overseas.   The

task of seeking opportunities overseas has been a difficult  and

arduous  one.  Those who have ventured out find the  going  even

tougher  now,  as they are being exposed to the  Asian  market's

financial crisis. These companies venture out to invest  in  the

region  on  their  own  with their eyes open.   Therefore,  they

cannot blame the Government when they encounter difficulties  or

incur losses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics released by the Government in

October last year, the total cost of direct investments overseas

by  Singapore  companies grew 21% to $46 billion as  at  end  of

1995.   About 35% of these companies invested in ASEAN countries

and  about  59%  invested  in  the whole  Asian  region.   These

regional  investments have left Singapore firms exposed  to  the

Asian  economic slowdown.  Sales in these countries are dropping

and  coupled by the appreciation of the Singapore dollar against

the ASEAN countries, the returns are depressed and the risks are

now  higher.   Several  years  of  effort  have  been  put  into

promoting  the  regionalisation  drive.   Many  companies   have

established good connections in neighbouring countries.  I  feel

that  although  there  is a temporary setback  on  the  regional

crisis,   Singapore   companies  should  not   give   up   their

regionalisation  drive.  Those with the financial  strength  and

manpower resources should continue to look for opportunities  in

the  region.  The  idea  is to use the neighbours  as  low  cost

manufacturing bases for Singapore firms.  For example, the  idea

of  promoting  cross border investment holdings  with  Malaysian

companies  may be meaningful, as it would be helpful to  enhance

the comparative advantages of both countries for mutual benefit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our focus on the regional crisis now seems to be on

Indonesia,  and Singapore being its closest neighbour  would  be

particularly concerned with the adverse impact should there be a

major  implosion  in  Indonesia.   I  would  like  to  ask   the

Government  how  it  intends  to  handle  the  situation  should

Indonesia  suffer  a  major  financial  and  political   crisis.

Indonesia's  economic collapse will have an  adverse  effect  on

Singapore's   investment,   trade  and   commerce   with   them.

Singaporeans  are  naturally  concerned  that  a   collapse   in

Indonesia  will have a major impact on Singapore and Singapore's

economy.   Perhaps  there are ways to shield ourselves  from  an

Indonesian fall-out arising from a collapse which, of course, we

hope  will not happen.  I would like to ask the Minister whether

there  are  means  for Singapore to isolate ourselves  from  the

Indonesian difficulties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, regionalisation is

still  very important because the second wing of our economy  is

the  one  important way for Singapore to continue  to  grow  and

create wealth for the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in my Budget debate speech, I hope the

Government  will  not get too easily distracted by the  problems

faced  by the region.  We still should have a long term view  in

mind.   In  fact,  this  is  an excellent  opportunity  for  our

companies  to look for bargains in the region both in greenfield

investments as well as to buy into troubled companies which  can

benefit  from  the management expertise of Singapore  companies.

While  I  am  disappointed at the lack  of  new  initiatives  to

encourage  regionalisation, I would like to suggest a number  of

new short term and long term measures to accelerate the momentum

of our regionalisation drive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, can the Government share some of the costs

related  to regionalisation for some of these companies?   These

include  the  cost of relocating the employees to  the  overseas

operation; the cost of training and retraining employees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



as  they go for assignment overseas and as they return back; and

the cost of higher insurance of offshore operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to provide further incentives and funding for

capital  and  asset  investments made by the  companies  in  the

region.   In   my  opinion, although we have some  schemes,  the

current allowances are too small to be effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to provide tax rebates for individuals (the

employees   of   the  companies)  who  take  up   regional   and

international  assignments.  Rebates can be used to  offset  the

higher cost of the children's education in international schools

in  case the company does not provide the loss of spouse  income

and other incomes for the employees who leave Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, to work with the Ministry of National Development

to allow the period of absence from Singapore to be counted when

computing  the  minimum occupation period of the HDB  flat  into

consideration  when  the individual wants to  sell  or  upgrade.

Currently,  the  period  of absence is  not  counted.   So  this

becomes a big problem when the employees return and they  intend

to upgrade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other issue that I would like to mention, and this was

also  mentioned  by  Mr  Leong just now, is:  can  the  Minister

enlighten the House as to how Singapore will be impacted  should

the  Indonesian  economy collapse?  The  impression  among  many

Singaporeans  is that we are highly dependent and  that  if  the

Indonesian economy collapses, so will the Singapore economy.   I

hope  the  Minister can give us assurances that  this  will  not

happen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee is not here. Mr Rai.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I agree with what Mr Leong has informed

the  House earlier that we should look for opportunities in  the

region  and the fact that the regional economies are  not  doing

well  should  not  deter us.  In fact, we  should  be  bold  and

courageous  and  look for new grounds.  As  pointed  out  by  Mr

Inderjit  Singh,  we  can  seize the opportunity,  and  in  this

regard, I would request the Minister whether he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



and  the  experts  in  his Ministry could  advise  the  would-be

investors what are the areas that our investors could  go  into.

I  think we should also look beyond the region.  We should  look

for  markets.   I was rather surprised that a Malaysian  company

got  a project in Andhra Pradesh in India to build roads.  I  do

not  see  why  with our vast experience in building construction

our  builders  were not encouraged to do so.  If the  Malaysians

can do, so can we.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other question that bothers me is this. We are

focusing  ourselves too much in the region.  I think  there  are

fertile markets that we have not explored, eg, Latin America.  I

am  glad  that  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has  got  roving

ambassadors.  We should examine markets where nobody  has  gone,

and  I  think  we should be the first to go.  Because  in  these

countries - Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean - there may

be some opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area which I think we should seriously explore is that

our  banks should see whether there are openings in other  parts

of  the world, and take an equity participation in viable banks.

Similarly, I think in the world, the United Nations, are  places

for  our  building construction.  We should also  explore  ideas

with  other institutions in other parts of the world on  how  we

can  go  about building houses, and in this area, I think  India

would   be  a  classic  example  where  there  are  a   lot   of

opportunities.  I know that there are obstacles  but  we  should

try to examine our opportunities in the sub-continent as well as

in  Latin America again.  And, if necessary, I think MTI  should

take  a  mission,  make a study on its own,  and  then  get  our

investors interested in the project.  I said this because unless

MTI takes the lead, I do not think we can proceed.  MTI can take

the  lead, convince our people that there is some hope, and this

can be done only if there have been studies done by MTI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I will ask the Minister whether he and his officials

have  done  any  study  as  to  the  opportunities  of  building

properties,  and  construction in Latin America  and  Africa  as

well.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, once again, I would to like to

bring  up  the  issue of the short-term problems  businesses  in

Singapore  are facing due to the regional crisis.  No one  could

have  predicted the extraordinary outcome of the regional crisis

where  the regional economies and their currencies `nose  dived'

at  such a fast pace.  No matter what actions the governments of

the  affected countries took, none were effective and none could

restore  the  loss  of  confidence  in  these  countries.   Many

companies in the region are effectively bankrupt and many of our

own companies used to do business with these companies.  The net

effect  on Singapore businesses has been widely spoken about  in

the  House over the last few days.  The bottomline is that  many

Singapore  businesses are faced with short-term  cash  flow  and

credit financing problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Thailand and Indonesia, as countries, faced similar

problems,  resulting in the crippling of their  economies.   For

these  countries, the IMF rescue package was set up to bail  out

their  economies.   I have a similar suggestion,  on  a  smaller

scale,  but  with the same principles, for Singapore  businesses

that may face the same crippling problems.  I would like to  ask

the Minister to consider the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to create an IMF-style or equivalent bailout

package  for Singapore- based economies and companies which  are

still  viable  for the long term, but are caught by  the  sudden

turn of events that even our Government could not have foreseen.

This  need not be a handout, but in the form of loans which  can

be  jointly administered by local banks and the Government  with

special  interest rates.  The Government can establish stringent

criteria  so  that  we  ensure only the  companies  with  strong

fundamentals  qualify and we do not end up helping truly  `sick'

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can the Minister or the Government also guarantee

letters  of  credit issued by local businesses,  just  like  the

proposal we made for Indonesian companies?  This will be another

avenue  to help ease the cash flow and financing problems  faced

by our companies here in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad is not here. Mr Singh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I will touch on the

competitiveness of the manufacturing sector.  As I mentioned  in

my  earlier speech, I feel that the proposed budget for  1998/99

did  not  adequately address the critical issues  faced  by  the

manufacturing sector.  There are both long term issues  as  well

as  transient issues caused by the crisis and also by  the  long

term  competitiveness of Singapore as costs go up and down here.

Being  one of the biggest contributors to the economy, at around

25%  of  the Singapore GDP, this sector deserves more  attention

than it got in the Budget announced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the long term, I am glad that the Minister for Trade

and  Industry,  a  few  days  ago, reaffirmed  the  Government's

commitment  to make manufacturing and services the twin  engines

of growth for our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to highlight that even in developed

countries, manufacturing continues to be an important  component

that will fuel economic growth in these countries.  I quoted the

success  of the Taiwan economy, which attributed its  growth  to

the  electronics and semiconductor industries by 15 times  in  a

span  of seven years.  I strongly believe that we still  have  a

long way to go and we can follow some of the growth policies  of

the Taiwan government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the short term, the regional crisis has created strains

on many companies, mainly related to the loss of value of assets

invested  in  the  region,  cash  flow  problems  and  also  the

inability  to  collect debts and the loss of  sales  because  of

inability of customers located in the region to purchase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore would like to ask the Minister to consider the

following  proposals, so that we can ensure  confidence  in  our

manufacturing sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short term measures - some Members have mentioned these.

I would like to say it again.  Land and rental costs have always

been a key component that contributed to the high cost of doing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



business in Singapore, other than labour cost.  Can JTC and  HDB

rentals  be lowered by 15% rather than freezing them at  current

levels?   In  fact, rentals in the commercial sector  have  been

coming down.  So, why not JTC and HDB rentals?  Although we  can

understand that the rentals currently for JTC and HDB are  lower

than market rates, our businesses are used to these rates. So as

they face problems, we need to accordingly come down by the same

percentage quantum as the commercial rates have come down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to stop all increases in Government charges, like

utilities  and PSA charges.  In fact, PSA has increased  charges

three  times in the last three years, citing corporatisation  as

an excuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to give a utilities rebate of between 10% and 15%

to all businesses for the next two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, to extend credit schemes like the LEFS to trading

companies which are having problems getting bank loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, how can the Government ensure that 15% reduction

in  the property tax get passed on to the tenants?  Many Members

have  mentioned  this.  I hope that the Minister  can  devise  a

mechanism where the landlords will ensure that tenants get  part

of the savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long term measures - could the Minister consider

preferential   land  pricing  for  new  start-up   manufacturing

companies,  which  invest a minimum amount  of  capital?   I  am

looking  at  land  rent waivers for a period  of  10  years  and

subsidised pricing of the property that they purchase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to allow JTC tenants to more easily sublet their

premises  and  let  them have the flexibility  in  managing  the

premises that they are already renting from HDB or JTC.  So I am

suggesting  that  there should be little interference  once  the

tenants have rented the premises from JTC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly feel that manufacturing and technology will

always   be   important  for  Singapore's  future  growth.    I,

therefore, hope that the Minister will seriously consider  these

proposals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the retail industry has been

facing  slower business in the last three years.   I  understand

from   the  Singapore  Retailers  Association  that  the  retail

industry  will continue to face a difficult period in  the  next

few  years.   Moreover, with the strengthening of the  Singapore

dollar  against  the  ASEAN currencies, the  cost  of  goods  in

Singapore would be dearer by some 20% to 50%, compared to  those

made  in  the  ASEAN  countries.  This will further  impact  the

retail  trade as it would be difficult to attract visitors  from

the region to come to shop in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the retail industry, I have the following

suggestions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Singapore Retailers Association and the Singapore

Hoteliers  Association  wish to request whether  the  Government

could  consider shortening the ALS hours on Saturdays,  so  that

the retailers, shops and restaurants in the shopping centres and

hotels in the CBD zone can do more business during the weekends.

They  suggested the hours of operation could be shortened,  say,

from the present 2.00 pm to even 12 noon.  With the introduction

of  the ERP, this request can be factored into the operation  of

the ERP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second idea is to curb the release of more retail

space, since there has been a reduction of business in both  the

main  Orchard  road  tourist belt as well  as  in  the  regional

suburban  centres.   The request is that the  Government  should

consider  curtailing the supply of additional  retail  space  in

future land tenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the retailers feel that the relevant authorities

such as the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) could help to put  out

more  effort to promote tourism to Singapore.  This is even more

important  now  to  bring  in  more Australians,  Europeans  and

Americans  to  supplement the drop of tourists  from  the  Asian

region.  It would be useful to promote more mega events such  as

the  Great  Singapore  Sale, Aerospace  Show,  and  other  major

exhibitions and events.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government could look into these suggestions to

help the local retail industry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, small and medium enterprises will

always be important and always employ a very large proportion of

our workforce.  I believe an economy focusing on a large network

of  SMEs  will  always result in a more flexible  and  adaptable

economy  that  can respond to changes fast.   In  fact,  in  the

Silicon  Valley in the USA, many such companies  are  playing  a

more  and more important role.  The same is true in Taiwan  -  I

touched about this in my Budget debate speech - which is one  of

the  strongest economies in the region and which was  relatively

unhurt by the regional crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, for the last two years, in the budgets announced by

the  Government, the signals that are given to  our  local  SMEs

have  not  been very encouraging.  I would like to request  that

the Minister look into a few areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to a similar question last year, the Minister

stated  that  there  are numerous schemes available  (I  believe

about  60 schemes or so which are very confusing) to assist  the

SMEs,  both financially in training and in infrastructure.   Sad

to  say, not many SMEs have benefited from these schemes for one

main  reason - it is just too complex and difficult for them  to

process their applications.  I am sure very competent and highly

qualified  civil  servants may have drafted these  schemes,  but

what  they  may not have realised is that the SMEs do  not  have

similar  high calibre people to understand this.  This  mismatch

is  what  our  real  problem may be.  Could  the  Minister  help

simplify  the schemes to make them more user-friendly,  so  that

more  SMEs  can successfully utilise them?  Otherwise,  it  will

only  benefit  the  larger companies who  have  the  appropriate

resources to apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his summary speech on 10th

March  gave some figures of the companies successfully  applying

for some of these grants.  I would like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



know   what   percentage  of  the  total  SME  population   this

represents.  In my own opinion, this number may be very small of

the total population of companies that we have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can the Minister consider changes in the SDF

claims  policy?   I suggest we allow the maximum claimable  from

the  current  30% to 70% to be raised to 90% for the  SMEs.   To

really  benefit  the  SMEs, I would also like  to  suggest  that

management  level workers and foreign workers also  be  eligible

for SDF claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a very specific suggestion is the tax

deductibility of vehicles, which is currently at  $35,000.   Can

this be raised to the full market value of the vehicles?  Today,

the  COE  costs about $35,000.  So the full cost of the  vehicle

comes  up to $80,000 to about $100,000.  So I believe we  should

review this policy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Currently,  through  the Productivity and Standards  Board,  the

Government  is  implementing  the  Local  Enterprises  Technical

Assistance Scheme (LETAS).  According to the Board's statistics,

so  far,  about  2,900  SMEs have benefited  from  this  scheme.

However,  under the scheme, the quantum of assistance is  rather

restricted  whereby engagement of  professional consultants  can

only  be  financed up to 70%.  In other words,  the  enterprises

will  still have to fund the remaining 30% in order to engage  a

professional  consultant  to  assist  them  in   their   overall

business  development.   As a result,  many  new  and  promising

enterprises will not be able to benefit from this scheme due  to

financial  constraints.  They are, therefore, unable  to  get  a

breakthrough in their business development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, I would appeal to the Government to

increase  the  quantum  of assistance to expand  the  assistance

scheme  and  to  liberalise the limitation  and  restriction  by

increasing  the subsidy to 90%.  I would also suggest  that  the

Government  consider  enlisting the  help  of  the  Chambers  of

Commerce to help in the implementation of the LETAS scheme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



At  the  moment,  the  various Chambers of  Commerce  have  full

understanding of the needs and development of the various trades

and  industries.  However, due to lack of funds, they could  not

afford  to  engage enough full-time staff to help their  members

apply  to  the  Productivity and Standards Board for  assistance

under LETAS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government can consider granting funds to

the  Chambers  of Commerce to employ suitable staff  to  provide

full support to their members in applying for the assistance  as

well  as  helping more members to enjoy the  benefits under  the

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and

Industry,  through  the  LETAS scheme,  assisted  seven  textile

member  firms in their computerisation programme.   Through  the

Singapore  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  the  seven

member  firms jointly engaged one computer company to help  them

implement  full  computerisation for their  businesses.   By  so

doing,  the Chamber helped the PSB to save six times the  grants

they   would  have  given  should  the  seven  companies   apply

separately.   Very  clearly,  close  cooperation   between   the

Government  and  the Chambers of Commerce will  achieve  greater

cost  effectiveness.  More importantly, by so  doing,  the  link

between the Government and the business community can be further

strengthened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, the Government has been sparing no efforts

in  promoting  regionalisation, and the active participation  of

SMEs is a force that cannot be overlooked.  But because of their

constraints in size and scale, many SMEs will find it  difficult

to  go  regional  without Government assistance.   Therefore,  I

would  suggest that the Government establish an investment  fund

aimed at the regional market to assist SMEs to venture into  the

ASEAN  region  and  help  them  to  secure  soft  loans   at   a

preferential rate of interest on a dollar to dollar  basis.   At

the  same  time,  I  would  also suggest  that  the  project  be

coordinated   by   a   well  established  business   and   trade

organisation and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



managed by professionals from both private and public sectors to

ensure that the objective of the fund can be achieved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, today, Singapore is still very

dependent on large multi-national companies, and over the years,

we  have  developed a large pool of very qualified managers  who

have  been  helping  these  companies  remain  competitive   and

productive.  While there is nothing wrong with this, I  feel  we

strongly lack a good pool of entrepreneurs who could propel  our

economy  even  further.   I  am highly  impressed  by  the  many

technology  start-ups in the Silicon Valley in the USA  and  the

Hsinchu based Science and Industrial Park in Taiwan.  We have to

ask  ourselves  why  we  are  not seeing  the  same  success  in

Singapore.   Sir, it is my contention that we  do  not  have  an

environment that is conducive enough to promote or encourage the

entrepreneurial spirit.  Unlike the countries I mentioned  where

both  are  the lands of many `second chances', in Singapore,  we

have the exact opposite where there are very few second chances.

The  Singapore environment and its laws do not tolerate failures

and  therefore do not encourage creativity and innovative  risk-taking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a number of proposals, which I think

will greatly help change the Singapore environment and encourage

more risk-taking, especially in technology start-ups.  First, we

have  to  amend our bankruptcy laws - the current laws are  very

unforgiving  and create a long-term stigma for  those  who  have

ventured and failed in the risks that they took.  This for  sure

discourages innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit.   I  hope

changes can be quickly made to our bankruptcy laws to give  such

people more chances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to provide incentives and facilitate a conducive

environment for venture capitalists and technology investors  to

be  easily  set up to support entrepreneurs on high  risk,  high

return projects.  For the few Singaporean venture capitalists we

do have, my experience has shown them to be highly conservative.

We  need  more  competition for them by inviting  and  providing

incentives for

venture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



capitalists to set up funds in Singapore.  Sir, such  funds  can

be  in  the  range  of  $100 million to  $200  million  and  not

necessarily the billions of dollars of funds that we  have  been

trying to invite in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I see a need to set up a consortium of local

private  sector companies who can collaborate in R&D  for  home-grown   technological   ideas.   In  this   consortium,   people

constantly  rotate in from the local companies on  a  secondment

basis  so  that there is a constant flow of new ideas both  ways

from the companies to the consortium.  While it should be mainly

a   private  sector  initiative,  the  Government  can  help  by

providing the infrastructure and some funding.  The funding  can

be shared between the participating private sector companies and

the  Government  and  the  individual companies  can  share  the

technology developed through cross licensing agreements with the

consortium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, individually, many of our local companies do not have

sufficient resources to achieve what the synergy among them in a

consortium  can achieve.  So I truly hope that we  can  consider

setting up such a consortium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I suggest that we allow easier listing of start-up

companies  by  modifying the SESDAQ rules, to  waive  the  three

years' operations and profitability requirements, much like  the

NASDAQ  in  the USA where companies with good ideas  get  listed

even before there is any inflow of cash from the businesses that

they have set up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we try to teach creativity in schools, I believe

teaching  alone is not enough.  We need an environmental  change

to nurture the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, it is common knowledge that tourism

has been and will continue to be a challenging sector, not least

within  the  Asian  region,  given  the  confluence  of  several

negative  trends.   The  currency  and  economic  turmoil   will

seriously  dent  tourism prospects.  Singapore  is  not  spared.

Industry  players  here  are already  struggling  with  a  sharp

downturn in tourist arrivals, particularly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



from  the ASEAN region, less spending power and rising operating

cost.   Given  the  threat of a shrinking pie,  competition  has

intensified,   if  not,  turned  ferocious.   We  have   already

witnessed  the  adverse  impact these negative  trends  have  on

airline  companies and almost certainly the wave  will  hit  the

hospitality and retail sectors equally hard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While most players have accepted certain eventualities such

as  slowing demand from the economic crisis, they are  concerned

that  the situation might be aggravated if the following  issues

are not addressed.  Firstly, the adverse impact of a severe haze

similar  to  that  that  Singapore  experienced  last  year.   A

repetition   of  this  health  hazard  would  erode  Singapore's

credibility as a tourist destination and would put to waste  all

the  past promotional efforts, especially those made in the wake

of last year's haze.  Any pre-emptive or preventive effort would

therefore  be  most critical to the fate of the  entire  tourism

industry.  Secondly, that if tourism promotion efforts  were  to

be curtailed by the overall austerity intent of this new Budget,

then   some  players,  especially  the  smaller  hoteliers   and

retailers, would be rendered non-viable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, on the contrary, it is felt that the Government

should  all  the more pump in extra resources at  this  time  to

sustain the promotion of Singapore as a tourist destination.   I

would therefore like to reiterate my GPC Chairman's request that

the  Government  considers investing more in innovative  tourism

promotion, including the design of packages and programmes  that

takes into account a generally more budget conscious clientele.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I agree with Mrs Lim about the

need  to  review  our  policy  on tourist  promotion.   We  have

achieved  a  great deal and I would like to pay tribute  to  the

Singapore Tourism Board and its officials.  But, nevertheless, I

would urge them not to rest on their laurels.  Opportunities are

coming  up  now  in  the sense that more and more  airlines  are

coming  and  air fares are getting cheaper.  But, unfortunately,

as mentioned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



by  Mrs  Lim  earlier, the haze has created a big  problem,  and

Members  have  also shown their concern.  It is not  within  the

purview  of  the Minister, but it is very important to  minimise

this  problem.   Sometimes  the  media  paints  a  picture  that

Singapore is such a dangerous place.  The important thing is  to

drive  home the message that Singaporeans are more healthy  than

probably those in other parts of the world.  So the messsage has

to be sent.  But in the meanwhile, we should also re-examine the

issue  and I would suggest an angle which has probably not  been

looked into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a growing generation of tourists both from America

and Europe who are coming to this part of the world and they are

looking  at  the Museums and the cultural scene.   Singapore  is

uniquely  situated in the sense that no other country,  probably

with  the exception of Malaysia which is a big country,  whereas

Singapore  has  a very small area, has got the Chinese  culture,

Indian culture, Malay culture and others as well.  What we ought

to  do  is to promote this cultural heritage and I would suggest

that we can take a leaf from the Indonesian experience.  When  I

was there years back, the Ramayana Mahabatra Ballet was superbly

performed.  The tourists enjoyed it.  May I urge the Minister to

examine the possibility of having the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could have Chinese opera, probably in English. We could

have  musicals from China.  We could have musicals  from  India.

The  Indian  and  Chinese cultural scene  could  be  created  in

Singapore and the tourists will enjoy it.  This is an area which

the  Minister  may want to study because we are  having  a  lull

period  now.  We should see what other areas the tourists  want.

I remember reading in the newspaper that the museum tourists are

getting  bigger.  We do not have many museums but  at  least  we

have a cultural scene.  I would go even further.  We should form

our   own  ballet  company.   At  least  we  could  invite   the

Indonesians  and I think they will be willing to  come  here  to

perform on a cultural exchange basis for some months.  We  could

advertise  this to the tourists and they will come.   I  am  not

suggesting that they just come and watch



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



the  procession  of  Thaipusam which has a  considerable  crowd.

There  are other aspects of the Indian and Malay cultural  scene

which  could be put on showcase and the tourists will enjoy  it.

So  I  am asking the Minister to give some serious consideration

to this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. I know the Tourist Promotion

Board  does tie up with Singapore Airlines.  I think they should

also  tie  up  with  other  airlines to  see  how  we  can  sell

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Goh Choon Kang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

recently, a voter came to see me and complained that he had been

conned  by a commodity futures trading company.  Within a  short

period  of  six  weeks, he lost nearly $200,000.  This  happened

some  two years ago.  Over the past two years, he went from  the

Commercial  Affairs Department to other Government agencies  for

assistance, but was unable to recover the money he had lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to him, he responded to a "vacancy for part-time

traders"  advertisement in the newspaper and fell into the  trap

of  the  commodity trading company.   What happened to  him  was

quite  similar to what was described in an article published  in

the  Lianhe  Zaobao  on 17th December last year.   This  article

entitled  "One  has  to  be extremely careful  when  going  into

commodity futures trading" by one named Zhenwei.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this voter, the company first arranged for him

to  attend  lectures and to listen to how the  company  enlisted

their  clients.    Subsequently, he was persuaded   to  open  an

account  of his own, for trading in commodity futures.   He  was

coaxed into signing the contract without looking into the  small

print  therein.   Subsequently, he found that this was  a  legal

contract  authorising  the  traders  to  transact  in  commodity

futures on his behalf.  The people in the company used all kinds

of  incentives and inducements to talk him into putting all  his

money into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



the   account.   The  impression  created  then  was   that   by

"investing" more money, he would be able not only to recover all

his  losses but also make profits  amounting to some $1 million.

So within a short period of six weeks, he put in $200,000.  When

he  had exhausted all his savings, he was even asked to sell his

flat  and get cash for further  "investment".  Fortunately, with

the  advice of friends, he decided to instruct a lawyer to write

to  the  company  to close his account.  At the  time  when  his

account  was closed,  he found that there was only about  $5,000

left in it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moving this amendment to create an opportunity to

tell  Singaporeans that trading in commodity futures is a highly

speculative activity  which entails extremely high  risk.   Some

traders  have resorted to improper means to induce ignorant  and

ordinary  citizens  to indulge in such  speculative  activities.

In  the  process, these people earn huge amounts of  commission,

but  their  poor clients lose all their hard earned  savings  or

even  retirement  money.  I therefore  would  like  to  ask  our

citizens  to be vigilant and not to fall into the trap with  the

hope of making a quick buck.  At the same time, I would like  to

ask  the  Government  to  take proper measures  to  check   such

unscrupulous business activities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, to develop

Singapore  into an international business centre to ensure  that

in the next century we can be the leader in the regional economy

is an important economic strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop into an international business hub, one of the

main  conditions  is  to be able to attract  foreign  companies,

particularly  the  multi-national companies to set  up  regional

headquarters in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics of EDB, up till the end of

1996,  Singapore had approved only 22 companies  to  have  their

offices in Singapore accorded the status of oversea headquarters

or business headquarters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied

with this result.  I would also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



like  to  know whether the concessionary terms presently offered

by  the Government are adequate to attract other MNCs to set  up

their regional headquarters in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with the impact of the current regional financial

crisis,  will it not be necessary  for the Government to  review

the  incentives offered?  In attracting foreign companies to set

up  their  regional  headquarters  in  Singapore,  what  is  the

Government's target?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the objective of the Government is

to  maximise the use of local manpower resources.  Many MPs have

been  exhorting  the Government to concentrate on  training  and

retraining  of  workers,  particularly  during  this  period  of

economic slowdown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is a good time for companies to be given

short-term  assistance  by  the  Government  for  retraining  of

workers,   so  that  local  companies  and  their  workers   can

rightfully adjust to the changes in the economy.  One idea is to

ask  the Government to consider increasing the subsidy level for

SDF-funded training programmes from the current top level of 70%

to,  say,  90%.  This increase can be a short-term measure  for,

say,  two  years, so as to encourage companies  to  devote  more

funds to retrain their workers during this difficult period.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Toh is not here. Mr Lim Swee Say.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to touch

on the subject of economic development and manpower planning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of any government must be to enhance the

quality  of  life and the standard of living of the people.   To

achieve this, economic development is an important means to this

end.   Full  employment  could go a  long  way  in  helping  the

Government to achieve the objectives of enhancing the quality of

life and standard of living of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the late 70s, because we have been able to sustain

full  employment, the life of Singaporeans has  indeed  improved

tremendously.   According to statistics,  the  real  incomes  of

Singaporean workers have gone up, on the average, by 5.4% a year

since  1973.   More significantly, workers who  earn  less  than

$1,500 per month, as a percentage of the workforce, has declined

from  about  80% in 1987 to 42% last year, a drop  of  about  40

percentage points over a period of 10 years.  I think this is  a

very  significant achievement that the Government can  be  proud

of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead into the future, Sir, I feel that we have two

major  challenges.  Firstly, how are we going  to  sustain  full

employment?  And, secondly, how are we going to help more  lower

income workers to move into the higher income group, as what  we

have done in the last 10-20 years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the issue of sustaining full employment, I

think this is going to be a very challenging task. Today, if  we

were  to  look around the world, not many economies are enjoying

full  employment.  I have stated many times in this  House  that

there are 35 million workers in the US who are working on a part-time basis, 18 million workers unemployed in Europe, and in  the

last  two days, I read that unemployment in South Korea has gone

up  to  1.5 million, and every month 10,000 workers are becoming

unemployed.   In other words, many OECD countries and  NIEs  are

finding it difficult to create enough employment to sustain full

employment or to lower unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, I feel that during this period of

slowdown,  we  have  to  take  a  fairly  serious  look  towards

containing  the cost of doing business in Singapore,  so  as  to

slow down the pace of retrenchment, which may be picking up very

soon  or  continue to pick up over the years.  I have looked  at

last  year's Economic Survey, and according to this  report,  it

was   stated   that  the  unit  business  cost  (UBC)   of   the

manufacturing sector continued to increase in 1997 at  the  rate

of  0.4%.  And this report went on to say that last year,  ULC's

(unit labour cost) contribution to UBC's growth was negligible,

because ULC's growth was flat.  Services cost contributed  0.46%

to the growth of UBC while Government rates and fees lowered the

UBC  index by 0.06 percentage point.  From this report, it would

appear  that  the  main  contributors towards  the  higher  unit

business  cost  in  Singapore  is  not  quite  labour  cost  nor

Government rates and charges, but rather it is services cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are services cost? Again, according to the various

reports,   services   cost  would  include  rental,   utilities,

communication, trade and transportation, interest  and  finance.

Of  the  five  items,  I believe the first four  items   rental,

utilities,  communication, transport and trade   are  very  much

related  to the fees and charges imposed either by the statutory

boards  or  corporatised entities.  These include the JTC,  HDB,

PSA, CAAS and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is that since the services cost has been the

main  contributor to higher unit business cost in  Singapore,  I

would  like  to suggest that, if possible, the MTI may  wish  to

take  the lead to take a closer look into this area and  to  see

what  can  be  done  to  encourage these relevant  agencies  and

statutory boards to review their pricing policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are basically two ways of determining the rate

of  charges to  your customers.  Some organisations look at  the

cost  of provision, either a product or services.  They add  the

normal profit margin and from there, they determine the price to

charge  the  customer.  This is known as the  cost-plus  method.

The  second approach is to look at the market place and see what

would be a fair rate to charge the customer, what the market can

afford  to  bear.  And from these, do whatever is  necessary  to

lower the cost of production, so that you can continue to remain

viable without charging too high a price to the customers,  what

is known as price-minus approach.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the business world of today, in the private sector, many

organisations have moved away from the cost-plus method



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



towards  the  price-minus method. The  reason  is  very  simple.

Competition  is  so  keen  that any  provider  of  products  and

services  is no longer a price-setter, but rather a price-taker.

Therefore, they have to accept this is what the market can bear,

and  their challenge is to lower the cost of production so  that

they  can meet the price expectation and yet remain viable.   In

this  regard, I sincerely hope that some of our statutory boards

and  corporatised  entities can really change their  mindset  by

moving   away   from  the  cost-plus  mentality  and   challenge

themselves  to what extent they can move towards the price-minus

mentality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this because two days ago, the Minister for Finance

in  this  House,  in  response to the call  for  containing  the

Government's  rate  of  fees and charges, mentioned  that  these

Government  agencies will continue to do regular revisions  with

small  increments  for fees and charges in  order  to  meet  the

rising  cost of operation.  His statement is probably valid  for

the  ministries  and  departments which are providing  a  public

service.  What I am afraid is that some of the statutory  boards

and  coporatised  entities may misunderstand what  he  said  and

continue  to  adopt  that  kind of business  approach  in  their

dealing of the products and services.  This is the first  point.

It  will  go a long way if MTI can help to contain the  cost  of

business,  in  particular, services cost, so that companies  can

continue to survive in this difficult period and hopefully,  the

pace of retrenchment can be managed somewhat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the issue of helping the lower income workers

to  move  into a higher income group.  According to  the  Labour

Force  Survey  of 1997, among workers who are 30-40  years  old,

there  are  150,000  of them earning between  $1,000-$1,500  and

130,000  of them earning between $1,500 and $2,000.   What  this

means  is  that  there are 280,000 workers  in  Singapore,  aged

between  30-39,  earning between $1,000 and $2,000.   I  believe

that  many  of these workers are trainable and it is  worthwhile

investing in their upgrading because they have another 30  years

of working career ahead of them.  At the same time, I believe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



there will be enough good paying jobs and better paying jobs for

these  workers  to  move  into because under  the  Committee  on

Singapore's   Competitiveness,  I  believe  the   various   sub-committees have identified the growth sectors for the next  five

to 10 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to suggest that MTI may wish to

consider taking stock of all these new growth sectors identified

by the various sub-committees and do a projection on the kind of

employment opportunities that are coming up in our economy  over

the  next five to 10 years, look into the kind of skills  needed

for  the  workers  to  move into these new  growth  sectors  and

provide that information to the Ministry of Manpower so that the

Ministry  of  Manpower, in coming out with new  initiatives  and

enhancing  the quality of workforce, will make sure  that  their

programme and the economic development programme under  MTI  are

kept in sync.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I feel that the setting up of MOM is a

very  timely move.  At the same time, I also feel that  MOM  and

MTI  must work hand-in-hand so that all the new and better  jobs

being  created  in the economy in the future  will  be  able  to

benefit  the Singaporean workers, especially the older  and  the

not-so-young workers who are under-educated.  Many of  them  are

not looking forward to more handouts through wealth sharing, but

are looking forward to be given a chance to participate directly

in  furthering the economic progress of Singapore so that  every

Singaporean can live a better life in the next century.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in this fiscal

year  there  is  a  big budget allocation for  the  Ministry  of

Education.   For  the  preparation of our young  ones,  this  is

understandable and I fully support it.  As our economy  matures,

there  must  also  be a budget for retraining of  those  in  the

workforce.   I  commend  the  Finance  Minister  for  his  quick

response to support the call from Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon for  more

retraining and upgrading of workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to recognise the past contribution of our workers

and  stand  by  them during hard times.  Is  it  not  our  moral

obligation to retrain and upgrade these workers to enhance their

future  employability?  I would like to call on  the  Government

and the employers to recognise this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without retraining, our workers' productivity will remain

stagnant.  Any retraining will enable them to get a higher value

job  which  will imply a higher income for them, as Mr  Lim  has

just pointed out.  This would also generate more profit for  the

employers.   Since we have quite a large pool of  workers  below

Secondary Two education, there should be a large scale  training

programme, including providing a basic education such as primary

and   secondary  education,  IT  training  and  specific  skills

training,  etc.   Some  of these forms of training  are  already

being  carried out by NTUC and MOL.  The NTUC has the  BEST  and

WISE  programmes.   They  also  have  the  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme  (SRP) for which 80% of the training cost is  paid  by

SDF and 20% is paid by the employer.  At the same time, EDB pays

70% of their salary during training with the balance of 30% paid

by  the  company.   These programmes have received  overwhelming

response.   So  it  is necessary to reach out and  convince  all

employers and workers to participate in programmes of this kind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understandable that the employers, especially the

SMEs,  are afraid of losing their employees after training them.

But if all employers can change their mindset and capitalise  on

this  window period of slower economic activities to train their

workers,  there  would  be a better chance  of  success  because

workers are less likely to job hop.  We applaud the NTUC and MOL

for their effort in setting up the programme but I would like to

urge  the Government to upgrade this retraining programme  to  a

nation-wide  programme.  To achieve this, I  hope  the  proposed

budget  that allows for the upgrading of skills of 9,000 workers

only  in  the fiscal year 98/99 will be increased substantially.

At this point, I would like to cite one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



example of what other governments have similarly done for  their

workers in terms of training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Construction Industry Training Authority of Hong Kong

provides   basic   courses  such  as  bricklaying,   plastering,

carpentry  work, plumbing, etc.  Similar to our  SRP  programme,

their trainees for these courses receive training allowances  as

well as free-of-charge training in their basic craftsmanship and

construction supervisory courses.  In addition, there is also  a

subsidy  scheme  for  the  employers  where  the  employers  are

subsidised HK$2,000 per month for two to three years  for  every

single  basic  craft graduate they employ.  This encourages  the

employers  to  employ  such properly trained  persons  in  their

construction work. The Singapore Contractors Association and the

Building  Construction  and  Timber  Industry  Employees'  Union

(BATU)  are  currently discussing to work  out  a  programme  to

intensify skills training in the construction industry.  We hope

the Government will support the effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retraining of workers should be regarded as an

urgent  national issue.  Therefore, I urge the Minister  to  ask

for more off-Budget allocations to do more for the upgrading  of

the national workforce.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my amendment is on

the training of manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hear with great interest what Mr Lim Swee Say has

said.   In  fact, he has brought up many valid points about  the

retraining  of  workers.  But the only problem of retraining  of

workers is that it costs a lot of money.  In fact, the Secretary-General of NTUC has said that two to three times more money  has

to be spent on the retraining of workers than what has been done

now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government only pays lip service to the retraining

of  workers.  There is no provision for funds  anywhere  in  the

Budget  which has been set aside for the retraining of  workers.

Singapore wants to attract high technology industries,  but  the

high  technology industries need plenty of trained workers.   It

was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



reported  that  the  job  growth at  4%  in  Silicon  Valley  at

California is the highest in America, but the problem  there  is

that  there  is a great shortage of skilled workers.   Singapore

shall  also  suffer the same fate if not enough skilled  workers

are  trained.  The wafer fabrication and other  high  technology

industries take in only trained workers.  If Singapore does  not

have enough trained workers, the high technology industries  may

be  reluctant  to  come and as a consequence our  economy  shall

suffer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these times of low economic growth and where the private

sector is not doing well, the Government must play a bigger part

in  the  retraining of workers.  The Government cannot, like  in

the  past,  depend only on businesses and the Skills Development

Fund  to  carry the burden of retraining of workers.   In  these

difficult  times, the urgency for Government to  give  financial

support  for  retraining  of workers is  all  the  more  greater

because of rising unemployment.  I know the Government's  policy

is against paying out freely for welfarism.  But money put aside

for  the retraining of workers is definitely not payment out for

welfarism.   It  is an investment.  I would again  call  on  the

Government  that in these times where retrenchments  of  workers

are  on  the rise it should give generous releases of funds  for

the retraining of workers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, many speakers before me

have mentioned that these are indeed tough economic times and it

is  important that Government spends time, effort and  funds  to

prepare  Singapore  to  face  the  challenges  ahead.   We  have

allocated  indeed some funds for skills retraining and  for  the

training  and development of manpower to help those coming  back

to work and to retrain them to prevent structural unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to consider putting even

more money because this must be seen as an investment for us  to

make  at  a time when things are relatively cheaper and  workers

are able to spare that time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three basic areas that I would urge the Ministry to

look deeper into are as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



follows.   The  first  is  this  group  of  elderly  people  and

housewives who are returning back to the workforce.  With  these

two  groups of people there are certain problems which  I  think

have  not been addressed sufficiently.  First of all, for  those

returning  to the workforce after 10 or 15 years away  from  the

working world they have a lack of confidence. Sometimes, even if

their   skills are still there, they feel that their skills  are

now  obsolete  and out of date because times have changed.   For

example,  teachers  would feel that students  nowadays  are  not

quite  the  same as they were when they first taught  10  or  15

years  ago.  So they lose that confidence.  I think we  can  use

this  quiet  time to spend a little bit more time in orientating

them back to the working world, back to schools or companies  or

whatever  professions  they  are  in.   And  we  must  encourage

companies  to do these things by giving them tax incentives  and

grants.   We also need to have a kind of agency which can  match

the job and the skills with the particular person that needs  to

come  back  to  the workforce.  We do not see too much  of  that

currently  and with the Ministry working perhaps in  conjunction

with  the Ministry of Manpower, some funds can be allocated  for

projects like this.  An agency like this could then be  able  to

match  more  accurately the needs of the market and  the  skills

that are out there waiting to be harnessed.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area that we need to look closer into and more

deeply  is  this area of service skills.  I have just had  lunch

with  a group of businessmen who feel that these are tough times

because  Singapore is costly and the region is very cheap.   And

if  any tourists were to start coming back again, they would  go

to  our  neighbours rather than here.  Our discussion turned  to

this  area  of service skills.  Many of our shops, whether  they

are big or small, are still caught in a time-frame which I think

is  what made us competitive in early days when our labour costs

were  low.   We emphasise the cheapness of what we  sell  rather

than the quality of what we sell and the quality of service  and

the follow-up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



that we give after the sale.  I think we need to spend effort to

give companies and workers the rationale, the incentive and  the

reason  why  they should upgrade their service skills.   Because

right now Singapore is already an expensive place, and if you do

not  pack your products or services at a higher level, then  you

cannot  compete  with  the  crowd.  You  have  to  rise  to  the

situation  where, like on Fifth Avenue in New York,  things  are

very  expensive, everybody knows that, yet the whole world makes

a  pilgrimage there whenever they go to America.  And I think we

must  begin to give Singapore that cachet, that image of a place

where you come because you get good products, you get good after-sales service, and you will not be taken for a ride.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area that I would urge the Minister to look at

and  to give more funds to is this area of preventing structural

unemployment.  This means that there are workers out  there  who

are  not quite so skilled but perhaps have never had time to  go

for  training.  And even if they had time after work,  they  are

too  tired  to  do  so.  Many of the workers would  actually  be

holding two to three jobs and they might say, "Look.  I have  no

time  to go for training."  I think this is an opportunity  then

for  us  to find schemes to give companies the opportunities  to

retrain  the workers on the workers' own work time.  Because  to

ask them to do so otherwise would not be very successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I would like to ask the Minister to continue

looking deeply into these issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the training of

workers  and the upgrading of their skills in this technological

age  are  of  utmost  importance.  Skills training  will  enable

workers  to  reach  the level as demanded of  them.   This  will

enhance their employability.   From the economic point of  view,

the  upgrading  of  our  workers' skills will  make  Singapore's

economy  more competitive.  Although the funds for the  training

of  workers  come  from the Skills Development Fund  (SDF),  the

manner  in  which  the  training is done  depends  much  on  the

employers.  The Government has not been active  in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



providing  the  training and upgrading  of  the  skills  of  the

workers.     The  employers call the shot.  This is  often  very

restrictive because in the curriculum, the courses are  designed

in such a way that they cater only to the needs of the companies

employing them.  More often than not, they do not help to expand

the  vision  of  the workers themselves, and the companies  only

care  for  themselves.   As a result, all this  training  cannot

achieve our overall national objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, because how and when the workers are to

be  trained  is in the hands of the employers, the workers  feel

that  if  there is no more future for them in the company or  in

the  industry, they will not be motivated  to embark on  courses

to   improve  themselves.    Although  there  is  now  a  Skills

Redevelopment  Programme (SRP) to enable  the  trainees  to  get

better and more comprehensive training, I think only about 1,500

workers have benefited under the scheme.  The Government  should

expand such training courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Government consider providing

bursaries  for  workers to encourage and help  them  to  upgrade

themselves  or  to go into another area of higher  skills.   For

example, the Ministry of Education gives bursaries to people who

want  to become teachers and it also gives bursaries to existing

teachers  to upgrade themselves.  I think we should  give  these

workers  a  similar kind of bursary to help them  upgrade.   The

Government should be able to know what kind of industry will, in

the  process  of economic development, be needing  more  skilled

workers,  and  what  kind of industry will be eventually  phased

out.  So they must have objectives charted out to make sure that

these  workers in the sunset industry can upgrade themselves  to

go into the sunrise industry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the spending of

the  Ministry of Trade and Industry for its economic development

programme  is reported to be 1.8% of GDP for this  year.   I  am

also  happy to note that, as reported in this House, a total  of

76  companies participated in the Skills Redevelopment Programme

(SRP) initiated and launched by the NTUC.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



These   76   companies,  together  with  NTUC,  EDB,   ITE   and

polytechnics have committed to retrain and upgrade the skills of

over  5,000  workers.   An estimated $20 million  is  needed  to

complete  the  training of these 5,000  workers.   In  the  next

phase, an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 workers will be targeted to

participate in the SRP.  To train such a large number of workers

is  no  small  task.  But I think the commitment of the  various

organisations,  as  well  as  the participants,  is  not  to  be

doubted.   But what is lacking, however, is the funding required

to  carry  out this skills upgrading programme.  With  the  next

phase  of participants targeted at 20,000, the SRP will  require

at  least $80 million to successfully carry out all its intended

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total number of retrenchment exercises carried out

in  the electronics industry in the last fiscal year, more  than

60%  were  carried out in the last three months.  The  prospects

for these workers in finding alternative employment are tough as

more  companies  are  restructuring and downsizing.   Without  a

proper education and nation-wide recognition of their skills and

experience  they  have  acquired over  the  last  years  in  the

previous  company,  it  is  unlikely  they  are  able  to   gain

alternative  employment.  Moreover, if they  are  able  to  find

alternative employment, even in the best situation,  who  is  to

say that they will not be retrenched two to three years down the

road?  No one can guarantee life employment.  But with SRP, what

can  be  guaranteed is life long employment.  If no  significant

effort  and  funding is provided for the retraining  and  skills

upgrading  of  these  workers, what we  may  face  is  the  very

difficult  problem of structural unemployment.   This  upgrading

will in time increase the productivity of these workers who will

bring  back the increases and other relevant skills back to  the

respective  companies.  Thus, unions do have a  part  in  adding

value  to these companies.  This new partnership direction gives

an added new dimension to the labour-management relation that is

developing in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI's increased spending will create jobs. But if we do

not  train  these  workers  now, when these  higher-paying  jobs

become available, our workers will not have the necessary skills

and qualifications available to take them up.  If no significant

effort and funding is provided to the training and upgrading  of

these  workers, there will be a mismatch between these new  jobs

and the current workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SRP has the ability to confer skills certification upon

completion  of  its programmes.  This was made possible  through

the   development  of  the  national  skills  certification  and

recognition  in Singapore.  It is also progressive,  because  as

existing  industries  continue to innovate  and  new  industries

develop, new skills upgrading syllabus can be produced  and  the

new skills can be certified to meet the needs of the industries.

I  see  skills  upgrading of our workforce as critical.   It  is

necessary because of the 5,000 workers currently in the SRP, 71%

have  Secondary Two qualification and 50% of them are  40  years

old.    If  their  skills  are  not  upgraded,  they  will  find

themselves left behind.  Employers have done their part, so have

the  unions and workers.  It is now up to the third party of the

Tripartite Committee to do its part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Government has Edusave for those in schools.

Sir, may I propose that in the long term, Government should have

"Skillsave",  so that the future workers will not be  caught  in

the same web of circumstances as the current workforce.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chay is not here. Dr Wang.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I am glad to see

that,  despite  belt-tightening in  the  Government's  budgeting

process, the R&D funding for various Government organisations in

the  R&D community has remained very strong.  It is a reflection

of the far-sightedness of our Government and it is also indeed a

preparation  for  the  future.  R&D  is  actually  a  long  term

process.  If you look at the various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



R&D  programmes,  typically, it will take about  three  to  five

years  before  we  see  any  tangible results.   So,  therefore,

funding for R&D cannot be on a roller-coaster basis, but  should

be  on  a  steady  basis.  When we can also  take  note  of  the

effectiveness  of such long-term programmes from the  commercial

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know it is a generalisation, but many American

companies will cut back their R&D funding whenever their  profit

margin  is  being  squeezed.  On the other  hand,  for  Japanese

corporations, they have a long term plan for R&D.  Indeed,  they

capitalise their R&D programmes.  So, in the recent years,  Sir,

if  you  look at the number of patents, R&D outcome for Japanese

companies,  they  tend to be more productive than  the  American

companies.   I do support the funding provided by Government  in

this  year's  budget  for  R&D.   But,  nonetheless,  when   the

Government  budget  is tight, we have to  be  more  critical  in

supporting  the  various R&D programmes.   At  a  time  when  my

colleague,  Nominated MP, Mdm Claire Chiang,  had  lamented  the

small  amount of budget we allocated to MCD, it is all the  more

so  for us to ask whether the R&D money allocated to the various

Government-funded R&D institutes is actually value for money and

value for money well spent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have the National Science and Technology Board,

which  is  the  overseeing organisation, and ask  more  critical

questions  in  assessing how much benefit would incur  from  the

money  we  spend  on such programmes.  I would  suggest  to  the

Minister  that maybe now is a good time to review the whole  R&D

funding  programme to trim the fat and to critically review  the

programmes funded by the NSTB in this financial year.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Sir, as our economy

upgrades to more high-tech industries, I think we will need more

R&D  activities.  I learn from the Economic Survey,  the  latest

release  by the Government, that the number of personnel engaged

in  R&D activities in 1996 grew by 18% to 15,419.  I think it is

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



credible  improvement and progress.  But  I  believe  that  more

could be done.  If you look at the statistics again released  by

Government, you will notice that as far as the gross expenditure

on  research  and development is concerned, it has tripled  from

1990 to 1996.  Similarly, the number of research scientists  and

engineers  has more than doubled from 4,329 in 1990  to  10,153.

However,  if  you were to look at R&D expenditure  per  research

scientist  and  engineer  (RSE),  it  has  increased  only  from

$130,000 to $177,000 for the same period, which is less than 30%

growth.   So  I think here is an indication where in  fact  more

needs  to be pumped into this area to help facilitate the growth

of  R&D  and  R&D  activities to expedite the upgrading  of  our

industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, is that the private sector was the

largest employer of R&D personnel in 1996 employing 57%  of  the

total R&D manpower and the RSEs in the private sector were  most

highly concentrated in the electronics industry cluster which is

about  2,780,  followed by engineering which is  a  low  second,

about  895, and IT and telecommunications at 614.  Here,  again,

we  will  notice that the spread of our RSEs is uneven  and,  in

view  of  that, more could be done to effect a better spread  of

our R&D energy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Science and Technology Board (NSTB), Sir, is

doing  a  good job in continuing to facilitate the  build-up  of

technology   and   its  knowledge  infrastructure   to   benefit

industries  and companies.  And they are doing a  credible  job.

For  example,  in  1997,  14  research  institutes  and  centres

collaborated  in more than 120 joint projects with industry  and

train more than 170 researchers to support the five key industry

clusters, mainly electronics, manufacturing and engineering,  IT

and  telecommunications, chemicals and  life  sciences  industry

clusters.   But, again, here, I think we are very far  from  our

full  potential and I believe MTI could look into it to  provide

more resources for its development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of nurturing greater interest in science and

technology,  Sir,  the  School Adoption  Scheme  (SAS)  saw  the

participation of 144 students in 16 R&D



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



companies  and  organisations, while the national undergraduates

research programme and the overseas R&D attachment programme  in

the  universities encourage the participation of more  than  648

students respectively.  While it is a good start, I think  there

is  room  for  more  participation and I  hope  we  can  provide

facilities for that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, we need to create a more conducive

environment  to  foster a culture of innovation  and  technology

entrepreneurship  in  Singapore.  In  1997,  for  example,  NSTB

facilitated a total of 16 international R&D collaborations  with

Singapore based companies and R&D institutions.  Again, it is  a

credible start, but I think there is room for more collaboration

projects  which  will enable Singapore to leverage  on  overseas

technological capabilities and manpower resources.  One point  I

think  that bears scrutiny is, for example, the problem we  face

in  terms of losing some of our scholars.  As the demand for our

scholars,  in terms of R&D areas, will grow from multi-nationals

and  international companies in America and Europe, we  need  to

provide more opportunities for such collaboration so that we can

also expose our scholars and manpower to such needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I continue with the next cut, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, much has been said about IT

and  its role today.  IT is expected to permeate our daily lives

even  more in the years to come.  May I say that no one will  be

able  to escape the growing tentacles of information technology.

Much also has been done by the Government, NCB in particular, to

prepare  Singapore  and  its people for  IT.   Be  they  in  the

industry  or schools, we can be proud of the proactive  approach

taken by NCB and Singapore to get our island all wired up and IT-friendly.  But we have not achieved the desired results for  all

the  programmes  we  have.  The FAST  FORWARD  by  PSB  and  its

predecessor  for  adult workers, for example,  achieved  limited

success,  some say even failure.  However, in the light  of  the

importance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



about IT and our future, whether it is in our economy or quality

of  life, we should not relent and should instead press on  with

programmes  to bring more people on-line by hardware and  heart-wise.   For  the  latter, that is, to help more Singaporeans  to

cross   the   psychological  barrier  before  they   embark   on

familiarisation and improvement courses, I would  like  to  urge

MTI  and  NCB,  in particular to do more work at the  grassroots

level,  tap  the grassroots organisation network and  reach  and

goodwill  to  bring  home the message of the  importance  of  IT

familiarisation  hands-on and upgrading.  The  grassroots,  Sir,

are an important base to plant the seeds of IT culture.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, in last year's Committee of Supply,

Dr  Ho  Tat Kin raised this problem of the millennium bug.   The

millennium bug or the year 2000 problem is a programming  design

defect  in  some software, hardware and microchips  which  could

cause havoc when computer systems do not recognise the change of

century  from  the  20th  to  the 21st  century,  because  these

computers  are  programmed to only recognise  the  year  by  two

digits  and  so it cannot tell the difference between  the  year

1900  and  the year 2000.  When computer systems are  as  widely

used as they are today and they are so prevalent in all sorts of

equipment and even the cars that we drive, a serious problem can

arise if these computers or chips do not recognise that the year

1999 has changed to the year 2000 and then it stops working.  If

they  stop  working or if they think that the year 2000  is  the

year  1900, then of course banks will be paying a hundred  years

of   interest  and  cars  may  decide  that  they  are  due  for

maintenance  and  therefore switch off so that drivers  will  be

forced to send them for repair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things may be minor but I think in America and in

Europe,  the estimates for potential loss actually go  into  the

region  of billions of dollars.  Because there will be liability

for mishaps if a car suddenly stops and knocks into somebody and

kills,  or  damages  property, or  if  banks  suddenly  have  to

reorientate  the  software because there is a lot  of  financial

recalculation to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



be  done.   There could be a new financial crisis of a different

sort.    And  perhaps  for  companies  that  have  not  prepared

themselves  for the litigation that could arise or the  problems

of  changing  the  computers to meet the 21st century,  suddenly

they may have to report insolvency because so much money has  to

be spent and they do not have it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know NCB has actually been doing a lot of publications

and  publicity,   seminars,  and so  on,  to  help  Singaporeans

realise  that there is this problem out there.  The  frightening

thing  to  me is that as the seminars continue to be  conducted,

there are more and more people attending, that means, there  are

a lot of people out there who are just beginning to realise that

there is a problem.  Banks of course have been warned by the MAS

to  look  into this carefully.  The Government is also basically

ready for the year 2000.  But, Sir, I am afraid that the private

sector  may not be ready.  This is why earlier, at a sitting  of

Parliament some time last year, I asked the Minister whether  it

was  necessary  to legislate for a contingency like  this.   The

answer was of course that it is not necessary to legislate for a

one-off   event  to  ensure  that  companies  prepare  for   the

millennium.   But,  Sir, I would like to urge  the  Minister  to

rethink  that perhaps even if no legislation is required,  there

should  be  some strong directives to tell companies  that  they

must  spend  money  and there must be incentives  to  help  them

recover or pay for the changes that they have to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an article in PC Week Asia on 8th February 1998 entitled

"Asia  not prepared as year 2000 draws near", there was a  study

of  six  countries in Asia and Singapore was one of them.   This

report   alarmingly  stated  that  almost  half   of   Singapore

companies,  47%  to be exact, have not addressed  this  problem.

For  those  who  have  addressed this problem,  only  1.1%  have

completed  it and 33.4% are in the process.  Sir, it is  already

1998.  They have to have the systems ready in 1999 or the end of

1998  to test it for one year before the millennium changes.   I

am afraid, Sir, it might be too late for many of them.  And I do

urge the Minister to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



redouble  his  efforts  to  make sure that  the  private  sector

realises the impact of the year 2000 problem.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Recently, Prime Minister Mahathir of

Malaysia has stated that Malaysia will continue to supply  water

to  Singapore  beyond  the expiration of the  two  water  supply

agreements.  Perhaps, Sir, this is the first time in  my  memory

that  such  a  statement  has been  made  by  such  a  prominent

Malaysian  leader.   To  me, it seems to  present  a  historical

opportunity for us to seal the security of water supply for  our

future generations.  And if we can do so, it will remove a  form

of  contention that has bugged the relationship between our  two

countries and will allow us to ensure that the relationship  and

collaboration between us will be on a sounder foundation in  the

future.   I realise this is a very sensitive subject and perhaps

currently  under negotiation between our two Governments.   But,

nonetheless, I would like to take this opportunity to  urge  the

Minister to be bold to seize the opportunity and to remove water

as  an issue between us and perhaps take this opportunity to ask

him  whether  he would be prepared to share his  view  with  the

House on this very important matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, water resource is a

very  hot  issue.  Our water tariffs have been raised again  and

again.   I  would like to know what efforts have  been  made  to

develop  water resource in Singapore. First,  has the Government

made  any study on the potential of our subterranean water as  a

source  to  augment  our water supply?  Secondly,  what  is  the

progress on the study on sea-water desalination?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, on 14th March 1996, the Minister

stated  in  Parliament  in the Committee  of  Supply  about  the

principle   behind  charging  electricity  rates  in  Singapore,

especially  those  tariffs implemented by Singapore  Power.   On

that  occasion,  he  said, firstly, Singapore  Power's  rate  of

return on total assets is low because our electricity tariff  is

low.   Secondly, I will quote him, "there is a need to allow  SP

to increase electricity tariff by 12% to 14% over the next three

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



four  years or an average increase of 3% to 5% a year to restore

its  financial health."  But we are now in 1998, Sir.   So  from

1996 to 1998, it has already been two years.  Presumably, we are

still in this process of allowing Singapore Power to adjust  its

rate  from 3% to 5% a year.  Recently, in fact, SP has increased

its rate by 5%.  The Feedback Unit has received various negative

feedback  from  the industry and the commercial  bodies.   A  5%

increase  in  today's  terms is in  fact  substantial.   It  has

substantial  impact  on them.  In fact, one  organisation  whose

monthly  electricity bill is $1 million said that a 5%  increase

is equivalent to $50,000 increase per month.  So it is indeed  a

heavy  burden to them. I would like to ask the Minister what  is

the  basis of the recent rate increase.  Is it based on the need

to  increase  the  return on total assets of  SP  or  is  it  an

increase based on the fuel price increase used by SP?  And if it

is  based on this formula that Mr Yeo Cheow Tong formulated more

than two years ago, perhaps I would like to urge the Minister to

defer  or  hold  back  such  increases  until  our  economy  has

recovered to a more sounder foundation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Since we are well ahead of time, Dr Lee, you

can have the floor.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, thank you for

letting me speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's regionalisation effort intensified in the

1990s.   Although Singapore-based companies have been  expanding

overseas   for  decades,  Senior  Minister's  speech  in   1993,

regarding the need for Singapore to develop a second wing gave a

major thrust to regionalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now know quite a bit about the external economy. For

example,  we  know  that the size of the  external  economy  has

continued to grow, and that it is now roughly one-tenth  of  the

domestic  economy.  We also know that Singapore's earnings  from

the  external economy, as a proportion of total income, has also

increased   to   14%  in  1997.   We  know,  for  example,   the

distribution  of  overseas investments in terms  of  region  and

activity.   But what we need is a clearer picture of the  extent

of benefit to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



domestic economy of our regionalisation efforts.  I recall  that

this  was the raison d'etre for regionalisation.  There must  be

clear  and  direct  positive linkages  to  Singapore.   I  would

therefore  like  to  suggest  that  because  of  the  increasing

importance  of  the  external economy,  our  indicators  of  the

economic  performance  should include  the  performance  of  the

external  economy as well as that of the domestic economy.   For

example, in the current crisis, what has been the rate of growth

of the external economy?  What about in boom times?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the Hong Kong economy. In the 1970s and

1980s,  the  average  annual  growth  rates  of  Hong  Kong  and

Singapore  were  roughly the same  9.5% in the 1970s  and  about

7.5%  in the 1980s.  However, Hong Kong's average annual  growth

rate in the 1990s was 5.1% compared to Singapore's 8.4%.  But is

this  an  indication that Hong Kong has become less economically

vibrant  than Singapore?  I would suggest not.  I think that  it

is  more  because  a major portion of Hong Kong's  manufacturing

has  already  shifted offshore, to China, for example,  so  that

Hong  Kong's dynamism is no longer adequately reflected  in  its

GDP  figures.  Similarly, for Singapore, in the next  10  years,

our  GDP  growth  may  no  longer adequately  reflect  our  true

economic activity, because a large percentage of our growth  may

be in our external as opposed to domestic economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the main indicator of economic performance

in  Singapore  is  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  which  measures

economic  activity within Singapore, and we  all  know  how  GDP

growth  rates  are  watched  with an eagle  eye,  regardless  of

whether   one is in the public sector or in the private  sector.

I would urge the Government to consider how the external economy

can  be  taken  into  account in a measure of  overall  economic

activity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are basically two concepts, the Gross National

Product  (GNP)  or GDP plus factor income from abroad,  which  I

shall call GDP plus, for short.  At present,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



neither  of these are computed in real terms, so we  do  not  at

this  present  time know the real growth rate of either  GNP  or

this other term called  GDP plus factor income from abroad.   As

the discussion is quite technical, I would not want to elaborate

here  in  Parliament.  But I realise that there are a number  of

statistical  difficulties  in  doing  so  and  that   very   few

countries,  for example, compute this concept of  GDP  plus  the

factor  income from abroad, which I believe is really  the  best

measure that we can have of the overall economic activity of our

domestic economy plus the external economy;  in other words, the

first wing as well as the second wing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic point is that because of the increasing

importance of the second wing to Singapore, we should  begin  to

develop  a  measure of economic performance that  includes  both

wings.   The  fact  that there are problems and  that  very  few

countries  do  this  are  surely  not  sufficient  reasons   for

Singapore not to pioneer the effort.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, we are ahead of time, in fact, by a

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> I would like to urge other Members who

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> I am much obliged, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was most happy to hear the Finance Minister, Dr Richard

Hu,  announce  the approved cyber trader scheme.   This  clearly

indicates  that  the  Government recognises  the  importance  of

electronic  commerce and that the industry needs help  to  grow.

More should be done to grow the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume of electronic commerce world wide is expected to

expand  some  four to six folds from the current  US$46  billion

within five years.  If the astounding development and growth  of

the information technology industry is any clue,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



I  am  confident that this prediction will come true.   We  must

encourage our companies to go into electronic commerce.  It  has

many advantages.  We can make more efficient use of manpower and

resources.   We  can  operate around  the  clock.   It  provides

convenience to the customers.  Electronic commerce is a  concept

of the global world.  It links the markets of the world into one

big  marketplace and thus expands the economic space of nations.

Electronic  commerce  is  thus  ideal  for  small  nations  like

Singapore  to serve the world.  Many who are local entrepreneurs

and  companies have dreamt of venturing overseas, but  the  cost

had been prohibitive.  Electronic commerce will change this.  It

would  allow  our companies, at affordable cost,  to  offer  our

goods and services to the world and we can do it from Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have many of the infrastructure to support

electronic commerce.  Singapore is highly computerised.  We have

good,  advanced and efficient telecommunications, shipping,  air

and  logistics  services.  If we look at the transaction  cycle,

while  many of the steps can be carried out electronically,  the

physical goods must still be physically delivered to the door of

the  customer.  It is conceivable that an efficient  company  in

Singapore, supported by our efficient air and service links with

the  world,  will  be  able to serve an overseas  customer  more

speedily  from Singapore than the customer could from a  company

in his own country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans understand the importance and potential of

electronic  commerce. President Clinton set up a task  force  to

spearhead its development.  The task force released its findings

and recommendations last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic commerce requires various sectors of the economy

to  work  together.  At the moment, I am aware that efforts  are

being   undertaken  by  various  bodies  to  develop  electronic

commerce in Singapore.  This approach does not provide a  common

focus  nor  does  it  appear  a concerted  effort.   Given  this

potential, I ask the Government to consider setting up a central

agency to plan and spearhead the development and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



growth   of  electronic  commerce.   Such  a  body  will  accord

electronic commerce the importance it deserves, champion it  and

hasten its development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For electronic commerce to work world wide, common

practices, rules and regulations must be evolved and adopted  by

countries.   Initially, countries may resist  to  protect  their

markets, but unless they relent, they will shut themselves  from

the world and the benefits that electronic commerce brings.   We

saw this with the Internet.  I would like Singapore to work with

world  bodies  to quickly evolve these much needed international

standards  and  rules to support electronic commerce.   I  would

urge  our universities and relevant research institutes to study

the  subject  and  carry  out research to  provide  much  needed

knowledge and information in electronic commerce.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, let me first declare my

pecuniary interest  as a director of Singapore Power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent power failure in Auckland, New Zealand, was

a  very  serious one.  We are talking of a power failure on  the

scale  of not hours but weeks, and now it is running to a month.

A power failure of this scale, not only causes a lot of personal

inconveniences,  but will be very disastrous  for  commerce  and

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the now privatised electricity and gas of the former

Public  Utilities Board (now part of Singapore  Power),  we  are

encouraging  competition to make sure that  we  provide  a  good

service  at  reasonable cost to consumers.  Tuas  Power  Station

will be coming on stream sometime next year as reported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst competition is good and necessary for efficiency and

lowering  cost, as quite well demonstrated in the  case  of  the

cellular phone system, competition may also mean a ruthless look

at cost cutting that may, over a period of time, mean a negative

impact  on  performance.  A major power failure in Singapore  on

the  scale  of  New  Zealand will be  a  disaster.   Right  now,

Singapore's power supply is one of the best, if not the best, in

the world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister, whilst encouraging

competition,  to keep a close watch on the regulation  of  power

supplies,  to  watch  not  just the  cost  but  to  ensure  that

performance  will  be tip-top, and that we must  never  allow  a

major power failure to happen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, JTC's IT 21

actually  is quite a good plan.  I think it will put Singapore's

land  to  best  use  in  years to come.  However,  I  have  been

receiving quite a number of feedback pertaining to JTC's way  of

conducting  business, in that it has been  very  inflexible  and

rigid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially in view of the currency and economic situation,

many  private sector enterprises are going through a tough time.

They  are all trying to tighten their belts.  In fact, they  are

fighting  for  survival.   I feel that JTC,  being  one  of  the

largest  landlords  in Singapore, should  try  to  help  various

enterprises  which are going through financial  difficulties  in

that  probably JTC should consider not just holding  on  to  the

current rental charges and other charges, it should instead take

a  bold  step  to reduce rentals, and also take a bold  step  to

understand   various  problems  which  are  faced   by   various

enterprises in terms of their financial difficulties  and   non-fulfilment to make payments to JTC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on a number of occasions, businessmen have complained

to  me about JTC's demand pertaining to the utilisation of  land

and buildings.  With this kind of economic downturn, it would be

very difficult for many companies to accede to JTC's demand  of,

for example, fulfilling the gross ratio requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Minister should enlighten the House as to

whether  JTC  will take any major steps to help enterprises  and

businesses in Singapore to tide over this difficult period.



<br>2.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, first on electronic commerce.

Singapore  is  positioning itself to be the  hub  of  electronic

commerce (EC).  This is evident from the fact that we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



a  national project called the Electronic Commerce Hotbed  (ECH)

programme  and  from the incentives given in  the  Budget  under

discussion.  For the uninitiated, EC is a broad term to refer to

all  manner of buying and selling services and products  through

the  use of electronic communication channels, foremost of which

is  the  Internet.  Some people even consider  the  transfer  of

funds through bank ATM machines as electronic commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, I believe, a committee which has sat and made

some  recommendations  to the Government on  how  Singapore  can

position  itself  to  become an EC hub.   These  recommendations

include   laws  and  other  regulatory  policies.   Unlike   the

recommendations of the banking sub-committee which was  released

and  made  public and largely approved recently, the efforts  of

the  ECH Committee have been kept relatively under wraps.  There

was  a  reply  by  the Minister to Dr Lee Tsao Yuan's   question

earlier  this  year,  I believe, which sketches  some  of  these

recommendations,  but  I  would urge the  Minister  to  consider

revealing what these plans and recommendations are more  broadly

so that investors and EC participants would know what to do, how

much  to  invest in, when to invest and so on.  Because if  they

are unable to obtain information on what is in store for them in

future,  how are they going to prepare themselves.  I also  hope

that  the  new  Law Reform Unit set up in the Attorney-General's

Chambers  will  look specifically into all aspects  of  the  law

which  relate to electronic commerce as a priority and not  just

incidental  work, and to seek private sector input before  these

laws are formulated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these recommendations, I understand, have been

formulated  with input largely from academics and public  sector

officials.  This is an area for which more private sector  input

is  required.   There is much promotional and  educational  work

that also needs to be done to ensure that consumers take readily

and  kindly  to  EC.  I wonder if the Government would  dedicate

funds  to do these things, and whether Government would allocate

funds to the private sector if there can be found champions  who

would take these tasks upon themselves.  Here, Sir, I must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



declare  my  interest  as the founder of one  such  organisation

called CommerceNet Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister also brief the House on our

participation  in  international  fora  which  are  working   on

research,  policies and laws which will facilitate  EC.   Again,

would the Minister say if the Government would fund some of  the

work  which  is being done by Singapore organisations  that  are

representing  Singapore's interest and  views  in  international

fora,  such  as  the  United Nations, International  Chamber  of

Commerce, SWIFT and other similar private sector initiatives?  I

know  of  some private individuals who are regularly invited  to

present  Singapore's  perspective and expert  opinions  in  such

international  fora,  but who have to spend  their  own  private

funds  for this national service.  I have for many years  called

for  the  setting  up  of  an agency to support  these  efforts,

privately  and  publicly, but my calls have not  been  answered.

Indeed, there is also a need for an agency to discuss and gather

all  these  learning experiences from different conferences  and

projects  to  which Singaporeans have attended and  to  transmit

this  to  other Singaporeans, businesses and Government agencies

alike.   We  need a concerted effort of both private and  public

sectors,  perhaps even a Government Ministry to  plan,  monitor,

coordinate or even regulate such efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the Committee of Supply debate last year, I argued

for a Ministry of

Information Technology.  Perhaps what I should have  argued  for

is  not so much a Technology Ministry as a Ministry which  would

lead  and envision the different ways we can harness technology.

We  can  harness  this to use and manage information  so  as  to

promote    trade   and   the   competitiveness   of   Singapore.

Additionally,  as  IT related agencies are all  over  the  place

currently, with the NCB, TDB and EDB in MTI, SBA in MITA, TAS in

MinCom,  etc, it is perhaps time we pooled all of them  together

in one Ministry to prevent confusion to investors and the public

and send a message to the world that we are serious about making

IT and EC work in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a question to the Prime Minister's Office about the

formation of a Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



Information Technology, I received  a

reply  that  Singapore  already has the  NCB  and  the  National

Information Technology Committee which actually has done  a  lot

of  things and kept Singapore very much up-to-date and the plans

like IT 2000 have all been going on track.  I would suggest that

perhaps  one  of  the most important things is when  we  have  a

Ministry  that pools together all these agencies, even  if  they

have  been working well with an inter-agency committee like  the

National  IT  Committee.  It is perhaps time to  emphasise  that

Singapore  really  cares  about making IT  work  and  Electronic

Commerce  as  a  strategic matter that  Singapore  is  concerned

about.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, actually what I want

to  say is on a later amendment, but since this subject has been

brought  up earlier by two other Members, I thought I would  say

it  now  so that the Minister can reply in one go.  This  is  to

follow  up  on the issue of structural unemployment  brought  up

earlier by Dr  Toh See Kiat and Mr Cyrille Tan.  Like them, I am

fearful  that  the  unskilled and the  poorly  skilled  workers,

mostly aged 40-plus and above would face structural unemployment

as  Singapore's  economy  takes  on  the  characteristics  of  a

developed country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 1997 Labour Force of Singapore showed that we

still  have  about  722,000 with lower  secondary  education  or

worse.   This  is  not a small figure and is about  39%  of  our

workforce of about 1.8 million workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would be earning about $1,000 to $2,000 a month and

supporting  a  family with teenage children.  Essentially,  this

means that this group of workers has very little savings and can

ill-afford  to  be  out of work.  Yet, in a  competitive  world,

these  workers  will  be  the first to be  retrenched  and  when

retrenched they will be forced by circumstances to look for  any

unskilled job to keep self and family alive.  Therefore, I would

like  to propose that the Government take the responsibility  of

training  them and also other similarly unskilled  workers,  and

that  during this period they be given a salary to fulfill their

financial requirements.  Sir, this is not a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



new  idea.  Companies today pay, in fact, the normal salary  for

their  staff  on training courses.  Therefore,  if  we  were  to

consider  that all economically active citizens are  workers  of

Singapore,  ie, on the payroll, being economically active,  then

giving  them a salary while they are under training is  actually

akin  to  the  practice  being presently  prevalent  in  private

companies  and  also  the  private sector  as  well  as   public

organisations which send their workers for training.  If this is

not  acceptable, could the Minister consider some sort of grant,

as  Mr  Cyrille  Tan  has said, skills fund,  or  some  sort  of

interest-free  loan?  The important thing to  remember  is  that

these workers need an income to fulfil their financial needs. As

long as such income is not forthcoming, all the exhortations  on

the  need for training will be wasted on them, not because  they

do  not want to be trained but because they cannot afford to  be

trained.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You can take your other topics.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> I will take all my related cuts together

in this speech.  The first issue I want to talk about relates to

fair and ethical trading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore market place is an orderly one and most

businessmen  are  prim  and  proper persons  earning  an  honest

living.   In  recent years, however, there has  been  a  growing

number  of  persons  who have been skilfully skirting  the  grey

edges  of  our  current law to perpetrate all sorts  of  schemes

which exploit the naive, the gullible and the poorly-informed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a growing mass of persons who are selling goods

and  promises  which are useless or not exactly what  they  have

been  promised.   Our  current laws on misrepresentation,  false

trade descriptions of goods,  investments and sales of goods and

services  are  woefully  inadequate  for  such  scams.   Let  me

highlight some examples and figures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is something called the switch and bait

technique.  An advertisement or a poster campaign or a  circular

campaign might advertise that a certain travel agency is selling

tickets to, say, the furthest end of the earth, the North  Pole,

at  $200.  People looking for adventure might say, "Hey, that is

a  wonderful deal."  They run down and the shop says, "Sorry, we

just  sold the last two."  Actually, they never had  any.    But

they  just  want you to go down there, bait you down there,  and

then  switch you to another product or service they are selling.

I do believe that is not quite fair game.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they use scare tactics. There was one case where

an advertising campaign warned about all the dangers of drinking

coffee and it was pitched as a health education campaign.   They

exhibited  scientific  reports about  foetal  abnormalities  and

thing  like that.  On further look, we the Consumers Association

of  Singapore  realise that the company actually was  a  company

that  was  in a beverage line.  What they were saying  was  that

coffee  has  caffeine but you do not know that  cocoa  also  has

caffeine.   Did you?  Because every evening mothers make  a  hot

drink of cocoa for the children before they go to bed.  And they

said  cocoa has caffeine.  The implication therefore is that  it

is  not  safe.  But of course this is a company selling  a  non-cocoa based beverage.  So scare tactics are there, making people

think  that unsubstantiated papers are really facts.  The  other

thing about this advertisement campaign was that the paper  that

they  had  was  dismissed by our medical experts as  an  ancient

paper.   It  was obsolete.  The studies were no longer relevant.

But the uninformed consumer cannot tell.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a third technique which is unconscionable and,

that  is,  the hard sell tactics that have become such a  common

way  of doing business in Singapore.  We have heard Mr Sin  Boon

Ann  yesterday talk about soft commodities being sold that  way.

They  advertise  a  job  vacancy and they say  "elderly  people,

housewives, retirees, students, anybody, no training needed,  no

skills  needed, just come and you have got high income,  $2,000-$3,000 a month."  When people go down there,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



they  say,  "You  have  to  go through two  days  of  on-the-job

training."  And it is really two days of hard sell, at  the  end

of  which they are told, "Well, I think you have to prove.   You

have  to  learn on the job and prove that you are a good person.

So good in this line.  Therefore, we want you to put in your own

money,  $15,000."   When  the $15,000 is  lost,  they  say,  "To

recover  that $15,000, you need another $15,000." I  think  many

MPs  have written to CASE and I share the pain of these  people.

They  are  factory  operators, 3-room residents  and  they  lose

$30,000  or  $60,000.  They  are not  rich  people.   These  are

frightening facts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of time-share complaints, from April 1995 to March

1996,  CASE  received 53 complaints.  From April 1996  to  March

1997,  we  received 109 complaints.  From May 1997  to  February

1998,  we  received 607 complaints.  Because  this  line  is  so

lucrative,  they made so much money that they do not  care  what

ethics are.  Because as far as they are doing something that the

law does not prohibit or doing it in ways which the law does not

prohibit,  they  say  they are safe.  These  facts  and  figures

reflect  only the most egregious examples. They are the  tip  of

the  iceberg  as  Singaporeans find it too embarrassing  or  too

troublesome  to raise these matters publicly.  They reflect  the

failure of the law to adjust to changed market conditions.  Such

unethical  and unconscionable ways of doing business  should  be

eradicated from Singapore if we do not want Singapore's image as

a  shopping  haven to be tarnished.  It is hard  enough  getting

tourists  to  Singapore.  If they and Singaporean consumers  are

exploited like this, then we become known as a nation of thieves

and  this is not something that the retail sector or the related

trades  would want to be known for, because they are already  in

the  doldrums, and they will be in the doldrums for a long  time

to  come  if  they do not change these unscrupulous  traders  in

their midst, and turf them out, so to speak.



<br>3.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, many are indeed honest and fair. But when

they see others resorting to these unscrupulous tactics,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



the temptation is always there.  They are not being caught, they

are not being prosecuted, perhaps I am a stupid fool if I do not

do  the same thing.  And I think the decline of standards  would

be gradual, but it would be inevitable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is time to pass legislation which makes it illegal

for  businesses to resort to such tactics.  A Fair  Trading  Act

along  the  lines of what CASE has been advocating will  enhance

Singapore's image as a shopping haven, enable trade associations

to self-regulate and set their own standards, so that Government

continues  to  have a light touch.  It would prevent  and  avert

litigious  resolutions of consumer disputes and make the  retail

trade  a  more productive one.  Because if the retail  resources

are  not  chanelled into combating unfair competitive  moves  by

unscrupulous  business  rivals and the demands  of  unreasonable

consumers, then the resources can be used elsewhere.  CASE  will

be  forwarding a proposal to the Ministry within  the  next  few

months  to  explain the issue further, and I hope  the  Minister

will consider its recommendations.

there  be  a  downturn, I think we would be  able  to  spot  the

downturn  fairly  quickly.  We are not  just  depending  on  the

quarterly  statistics.  In fact, we have preliminary statistics,

then we have actual statistics as the trade figures come in, and

so  on.   So  that is the reason why we feel that  if  the  need

arises we will be able to adjust very fast; sometimes, maybe too

fast,  because the Government is able to decide very quickly  on

various measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as Mrs Lim Hwee Hua pointed out, it is instructive

to  look at the composition of business costs in Singapore.  The

largest component is wages.  In Singapore, remuneration accounts

for  about 35% of total business costs.  This is a key component

to   moderate  for  Singapore  to  stay  competitive.   For  the

manufacturing  sector, rentals account  for  only  about  3%  of

business  costs,  while Government taxes and  fees  account  for

about 2%.  The corresponding figures for the services sector are

about  9%  and  7%  respectively, 9%  for  rentals  and  7%  for

Government  taxes and fees, as compared to 3%  and  2%  for  the

manufacturing sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you compare this with Hong Kong, remuneration accounts

for  about  60%  of  business costs in Hong  Kong  (Hong  Kong's

manufacturing  sector), while rentals account  for  another  8%.

Hence,  compared  with  Hong  Kong, our  remuneration  share  of

business  costs  is about 60% of Hong Kong's  share,  while  our

rental share of business costs is only about half.  This is  for

purpose  of comparison.  Of course, it depends on the  structure

of  the economy, the kind of industry they have, and so on.   In

Hong  Kong, the manufacturing sector has mostly moved  to  China

and  even  in  the past, the manufacturing sector tended  to  be

rather labour-intensive, electronics, garments, toys, and so on.

So,  therefore,  their labour cost component  will  tend  to  be

higher.   Similarly,  now  with the move  towards  more  of  the

service  sector, the cost component again is mainly manpower  as

well as rentals.  So in the case



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



of  Hong  Kong, rentals are an important factor, more  important

than in Singapore.  With the pegging of the Hong Kong dollar  to

the  US  dollar which has been maintained so far, and also  with

the  high  cost  in  Hong Kong, which used  to  be  higher  than

Singapore,  I think they are fearful of losing their competitive

edge.   And  that is one reason why they came out  with  such  a

strong plethora of concessions for the economy.  In our case, we

have been watching costs very carefully and we are not quite  in

the  same  situation.  In fact, I think we are  very  different.

And also our currency has depreciated by about 15% versus the US

dollar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rising productivity, labour costs have moderated in

Singapore in recent years.  The Unit Labour Cost (ULC) index  of

the overall economy rose by 1.1% in 1997, slower than the 4%  in

1996,  and  3.3% over the 1990 to 1995 period.  The ULC  of  the

manufacturing sector registered flat growth in 1997.  There  are

several  reasons for this.  One, of course, is that the NWC  has

been  recommending  flexi-wages  and  keeping  the  wages  under

control.  The Government has also been more flexible in allowing

in  more workers, both work permit holders as well as employment

pass  holders.   So these have helped to check the  labour  cost

situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also one reason why we have such a big number of

foreign  workers  in  Singapore now.   I  think  Dr  Richard  Hu

mentioned  a figure of more than 450,000.  So this  would  be  a

good  buffer for us in terms of employment, in case there  is  a

severe downturn and some workers will lose their jobs.  In  that

situation,  of course, we have to retrench the least  productive

worker  first,  but  at  the same time there  will  be  openings

created,  and  if  the Ministry of Labour, by then  Ministry  of

Manpower,  could be more careful in issuing work  permits,  this

will  provide  more job openings for Singaporeans.   Of  course,

they  will have to be prepared to be flexible and not insist  on

the  old salaries or the same kind of jobs, but jobs there  will

be.   And  our projection so far is that we do not see a  severe

retrenchment or unemployment.  In fact, in the recent  situation

when  Seagate retrenched some workers, I was given to understand

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



some  of  the  workers  were  very happy.   They  collected  the

retrenchment  benefits on one hand, and they got new  jobs  very

soon  thereafter.  And the ones who were unhappy were, in  fact,

the  ones  who were not retrenched.  So it is quite  an  unusual

situation that we have in Singapore, despite the crisis that  we

are going through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help businesses to control costs, we have to pay careful

attention to the following:



<br>3.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, wage costs. The National Wages Council will be

meeting  soon  to deliberate on wage guidelines  for  the  year.

Over  the years, we have built up the annual variable components

of  salaries to provide for the eventuality that wage costs  may

have  to  be  cut  in a recession.  Now we  are  not  yet  in  a

recession.  I hope we will not be.  But when the NWC  meets  and

before it concludes its deliberations by late June, I think  the

economic  situation will be clearer and I hope the NWC  will  be

able  to  look at the different sectors, the impact,  the  total

situation, and come out with guidelines to help us overcome this

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, the Government will also be reducing the

levies for skilled foreign workers in the manufacturing, marine,

construction  and service sectors from $200 per  month  to  $100

with  effect from next month.  This is for skilled workers.   So

the   intention  is  to  lower  cost  and  also  make  it   more

advantageous for employers to recruit skilled workers  and  also

for  them to train the workers and upgrade their skills.  So the

orientation is towards that area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second important factor is of course rentals, and many

Members  have spoken about this.  I would like to inform Members

that in July last year, after JTC did its annual review, half of

JTC's  estates  enjoyed a drop in posted rents, while  the  rest

have  their  posted  rents frozen.  Many of  JTC's  lessees  are

paying  rents that are well below market rates.  The reason  for

this  is that there has been a cap of 7�% on the extent to which

they can raise their rents yearly.  So as the property market



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



shot up over recent years and the rises were very sharp, JTC was

prevented from going up so fast by the cap.  So in fact, many of

the companies are enjoying rentals which may be less than 50% of

the  posted  rents, and even the posted rents tend to  be  lower

than  the market rents.  JTC does surveys of the market and they

peg  the  posted rent and the tendency has been to peg  it  much

lower  than the market rate.  As mentioned in the Budget speech,

JTC  and  HDB  will  be  extending rental concessions  to  their

tenants and lessees.  The Government will also be giving  a  15%

property tax rebate for commercial and industrial properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third factor concerns Government rates and fees. In

this  area, the rate of increase has moderated since 1995.   The

Unit  Business Cost Index of the manufacturing sector shows that

the  Government rates and fees actually fell by 1.8% in 1997  as

against  a  growth of 5.1% in 1996.  In any case, the  fees  are

quite a small component of cost and in recent years, in fact, it

has  fallen.   But  we  should not  be  complacent.   We  should

continue to watch.  And with Members' comments, it will in  fact

make  it easier for MTI to press the other people to keep  costs

down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, we do not see a need to further reduce JTC

rentals  substantially.  Any fall in market rents will be  taken

into  account at JTC's annual review of posted rents in  May  or

June.   If  the  posted rents are reduced  at  the  next  annual

review,  new  lessees and tenants will benefit from these  lower

rates.  The rents for existing lessees and tenants will also  be

adjusted  downwards accordingly when the current rates  are  due

for  their  annual review.  This point may be  a  bit  confusing

because  Government has said in the Budget speech  that  we  are

going to freeze the posted rent and we are going to moderate the

increases for those who are far below the posted rent.  In fact,

with  the  freezing, something like 70% of the tenants will  not

have  any  rental  increase, even based on  the  current  posted

rates.  The others will have some increase but this will be kept

at  certain  levels.  JTC will be announcing the  details  soon.

But the point I was just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



making  is  that  in addition to that, JTC also does  an  annual

review  in May or June and if at that time it is clear that  the

market  rates are below posted rates, then JTC will  adjust  its

posted rentals down further.  So if we freeze rentals, it  means

they  cannot  go up but can come down, depending on  the  market

situation.   So  maybe  this  is a bit  of  good  news  for  the

manufacturers and other businesses, that we are capping rentals,

but  there  is  a  possibility of a  downward  adjustment.   The

adjustment,  if it comes, will of course depend  on  the  market

situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Government should refrain from

introducing unnecessary rules and regulations that will increase

the  cost of doing business.  If the economic situation worsens,

the  Government  is  ready  and prepared  to  implement  further

measures.  We should remember, however, that business costs  are

only  half of the competitiveness equation and will continue  to

reflect  Singapore's  basic  resource  constraints.   While   we

continue  to  manage  our  costs, we  must  also  focus  on  the

capability  factors and constantly upgrade the  productivity  of

our  workers  and  companies  so  as  to  sustain  our  economic

competitiveness.  This is the collective responsibility  of  the

Government, the employers and the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the point raised by Mr Tay Beng Chuan on

whether we need to set up a Government charges and levies review

committee  to coordinate and review these charges and levies  to

ensure Singapore's competitiveness in the region.  I would  like

to  inform  him that there is already a mechanism  in  place  to

ensure  that  major  fee hikes are coordinated  since  all  such

increases   require  the  Cabinet's  approval.    It   is   also

Government's practice to fully explain the rationale behind  any

major fee increase.  The Government has done so on all occasions

when  fees  have been increased.  My Ministry also monitors  the

impact  of  such increases on both the Consumer Price Index  and

the  Unit  Business Cost Index to ensure that Singapore  remains

competitive overall.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh spoke on the

question of PSA charges and said that the charges have increased

three  times in the last two years.  I presume they meant  three

occasions.  I was told that this is not quite right.   The  last

tariff revision was done in January 1996 and there has not  been

any  revision  since then.  So I do not know whether  there  has

been some misinformation.  Nevertheless, MPA and PSA Corporation

are  keenly  aware of the need for Singapore to  keep  its  port

tariffs  competitive.   The  Marine  and  Port  Authority  (MPA)

reduced  port  dues  for container ships by  20%  in  May  1996.

Further,  PSA Corporation negotiates on a case-by-case basis  to

grant  rebates for terminal handling and towage charges  to  its

customers.   So  I  can  assure Members  that  PSA  will  remain

responsive and make sure that they are competitive in  terms  of

their rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Choo Wee Khiang and Mr Inderjit Singh made some points

on  the question of subletting of JTC space in situations  where

there  has  been  a business downturn and there is  extra  space

available.  I can assure them that JTC is flexible in this area.

JTC did a review of its subletting policy in August last year as

part of IP 21 and has decided that lessees of JTC land and ready-built  factories are now allowed to sublet up to  30%  of  their

space for the first five years of their lease or the first three

years  for factory lessees and up to 50% thereafter.   They  can

sublet  up to 70% if the sub-tenants are related companies.   As

JTC  tenants  are  on relatively short terms of typically  three

years,  they  may also prematurely terminate their tenancies  at

any   time  if  their  space  requirements  have  changed.   JTC

recognises  that  some  tenants may find themselves  in  genuine

difficulties and is prepared to consider their special  requests

for subletting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I must say that Mr Choo was a bit unfair when he

said  that JTC is inflexible.  I think it is far from the  case.

They  have in fact been very flexible and even before the latest

moves by the Government as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



announced  in the Budget, they have on their own been  adjusting

their rates down.  So I think we should give due credit to JTC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr David Lim's point that current HDB and JTC rules

make  it difficult for businesses to streamline their operations

by  swapping  premises, JTC does allow requests for swapping  of

units  by  existing tenants.  The swap will have to be  mutually

agreeable and the usage compatible with the adjoining users  and

consistent  with  the  existing JTC  guidelines.   JTC  is  also

prepared  to  consider not imposing a rental adjustment  upon  a

swap  for  bona  fide  cases with valid  reasons,  such  as  for

purposes of business consolidation.  As for HDB premises, I will

refer Mr David Lim's suggestion to HDB for consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Inderjit Singh's suggestion to help start-up

manufacturing companies with preferential land pricing,  he  may

wish  to  note  that there are already several existing  schemes

which  assist start-ups in various aspects of their  businesses.

JTC  is  planning  to introduce as part of the local  enterprise

programme a plan to help start-up companies which are engaged in

higher valued-added manufacturing activities.  More details will

be announced in a few months' time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered most aspects on this topic of cost

of doing business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to move on to the topic of

regionalisation.  I am very happy to note that all the  speakers

who  spoke on this issue made the comment that we should not let

the  current  temporary setback divert our  attention  from  the

longer term goal and it is imperative for us to go regional,  in

fact,  global.  This is one of the strategic thrusts recommended

by  the  Competitiveness Committee which I am chairing, that  in

our  Singapore context, because of our resource constraints,  or

land,  labour, and so on, it is unavoidable that  we  must  move

offshore.   As we do so, we try and retain the linkages  between

these  offshore operations and the Singapore operations so  that

in the process, we are able to push ourselves upward and be in a

position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



where  we  manage the operations, ie, we do the designing  work,

research,  higher value manufacturing, services and so  on,  and

harness the resources in the region.  So this is something  that

we will continue to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the present situation presents opportunities for us

to  invest overseas, of course, we have to do so with great care

because the situation in neighbouring countries is still  rather

unclear.  We do not know whether there are any hidden losses  in

some of the books, and what is going to happen.  It is time  for

companies with the cash reserves to look around and see how they

can  tap  into the region and establish useful linkages  in  the

region.   But, as I said, they must do so with care  because  if

something happens, there will be no government to bail them out.

That  is the basic policy of the Government.  You go in, you  go

for  your profits, but if things turn bad, hard luck.  If things

turn out well, very good, please invest more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan made some comments about having GDP plus

and  whether we can develop better indicators to help us  assess

the  extent of our regionalisation efforts and its contributions

to our economy.  I think the points are well taken.  In fact,  I

think this is one area where she may give me some lessons on the

different components of GDP and GDP plus, and so on.  But I have

some data here that may reassure her on this aspect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach to regionalisation is to build an external economy

which  is strongly linked and beneficial to the domestic economy

in  a  way  that strengthens Singapore's role as a business  hub

without  hollowing  it out.  Thus, even as  factor  income  from

abroad  has  increased from 1993 to 1996,  the  contribution  of

foreign operations to value-added in the Singapore economy  fell

from 12% to 11%.  In other words, the domestic economy continues

to  grow  and,  in  fact, grew faster even as we  developed  the

second  wing.   That is why the contribution from  the  external

factor is, in fact, less than before.  It has gone down from 12%

to 11%, even as we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



invested more and more overseas.  I see Dr Lee shaking her head.

Maybe I have to go to her for the lesson!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, our export of business and professional services

has  expanded due to regionalisation.  It almost doubled between

1993  and  1996 to reach $2.45 billion.  This is the  export  of

business and professional services.  A linkages indicator  which

measures  the  percentage  of sales  of  overseas  manufacturing

affiliates which were channelled back to Singapore shows a  high

of  20%  or  $4.7 billion.  This is indicative of the extent  of

linkages   between  the  parent  companies  and  their  overseas

affiliates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote regionalisation, Government has put in place a

number  of incentive schemes and bilateral mechanisms to  assist

our businessmen.  In encouraging businessmen to go regional,  we

must   never  mislead  our  companies  to  go  beyond  what   is

commercially  prudent.  Whilst there are opportunities  to  reap

rewards, companies must weigh the risks as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have stated during the main Budget debate that

we  do  not  allow losses from overseas ventures  to  be  offset

against  Singapore  taxes.  In fact, the  Minister  for  Finance

explained clearly why this has been the case.  But here, I would

like  to  point out that when local companies go overseas,  they

can, in fact, apply for what is known as the Overseas Investment

Incentive  Scheme.  This scheme allows companies to  offset  the

capital losses arising from the liquidation of approved overseas

investments against the company's other taxable income.   Before

they invest, if they apply to EDB for this incentive and if  EDB

approves  it,  then they have this insurance that in  case  they

have  to  liquidate the companies and there are losses suffered,

those  losses  can  be  brought back and  offset  against  local

taxable income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has suggested that tax rebates should be

provided  for  families to defray the higher cost of  children's

education  overseas.   As explained before,  there  are  various

schemes to help companies in their drive and there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



also   various   tax  incentives.   But  tax   concessions   for

individuals  may  not be effective, since these individuals  are

unlikely  to pay any taxes in Singapore.  If the employees  have

to  go overseas and they pay more for the overseas schools, very

often,  it is the employer who is bearing the cost.  So  if  any

help is provided, maybe it is to the employer that we should  be

giving the help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Singaporeans counting their period of

absence  overseas into the minimum occupational  period  of  HDB

flats, MND has informed my Ministry that they have already  made

provision  for  this.  Those posted overseas on official  duties

are  allowed to include the period of subletting their flats  in

the  computation of the minimum occupation period, subject to  a

maximum of three years for direct purchase flats and one  and  a

half  years for resale flats.  I hope the Minister for  National

Development can confirm this when his turn is due to discuss the

budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Leong Horn Kee have inquired about

the  impact  of  the Indonesian economic problems on  Singapore.

The  events  in  Indonesia will have an  impact  on  the  entire

region.  Singapore will not be an exception.  However, we should

not  speculate on a possible collapse of the Indonesian economy.

Many  countries including the US, Japan, Australia and ourselves

have been discussing measures to help Indonesia towards economic

recovery.   Much of our trade with Indonesia is in the  form  of

intermediate  goods  as part of the regional  supply  chain  for

final  products  for  OECD  markets.  Similarly,  a  significant

portion  of  our  investments  in  Indonesia  are  manufacturing

investments  situated in the Riau islands linked  to  plants  in

Singapore which supply products to countries like the US and the

EU.   In  the financial sector, the House was informed  recently

that  as  at 31st December 1997, the exposure of the  six  local

banking groups to Indonesia was S$5.4 billion, representing only

2.3%  of  their total assets.  So while Singapore cannot  remain

unaffected  by  the  Indonesian economic  downturn,  our  global

linkages and diversified economic structure will buffer us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



from  any  fall-out effects.  Of course, we are hoping that  the

economy will recover and there will not be any serious setbacks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to turn to the topic of the Local

Enterprise  Financing  Scheme (LEFS).   Mr  Inderjit  Singh  has

expressed  concern that the recent enhancement of  the  LEFS  is

insufficient  to  help  local companies ride  out  the  regional

financial  turmoil.  I wish to emphasise that the  LEFS  is  not

intended to bail out sick companies but to support viable  local

enterprises.    The   lending  decisions   are   made   by   the

participating  banks  with the Government sharing  part  of  the

risks.  The LEFS has been popular with smaller companies.  As at

January 1998, over 4,000 smaller SMEs, ie, those with less  than

100  employees  each,  have  benefited  from  the  scheme.   The

coverage  offered by the enhanced LEFS has now been extended  so

that SMEs with fixed assets up to $30 million or employing up to

300  people  can  also qualify.  Government  has  increased  its

provision in LEFS loan lines from $760 million to $1.1  billion.

With the Government's share of the  risk for working capital and

factory  loans increased to 50% and the doubling of  the  limits

for  such loans, more assistance will be provided for our  SMEs.

It is not feasible to have an IMF-style bail out package for our

companies which are caught in the regional financial turmoil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we sympathise with companies which are selling, for

example,  to the Indonesian market and now find that the  market

has  practically disappeared in some cases, I think it  is  just

not  feasible  for  Government to come  in  and  help  in  those

situations.  But if there are companies here which  have  viable

operations and they have good export orders, and they also  have

good  collateral here which can be used to pledge to banks, then

it  is  up  to  the banks to decide whether to lend them  money.

And  they  can  then  perhaps  use that  money  to  finance  the

operations  in, say, the Riau Islands.  This is  what  is  being

done  by multi-nationals.  They treat their regional plants like

cost  centres, sub-contractors.  So they do all the sales  here.

They do all the purchasing of parts and components here and they

feed the regional plants.  So they are able in that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



way  to  insure those plants and isolate those plants  from  the

turmoil.  If some of our local companies can do likewise,  I  am

sure  our  banks can consider and where it is viable, they  will

provide them with the assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also said something about whether banks,

Government  or  whoever can guarantee the LCs  issued  by  local

businesses.   This point is not very clear to me.  The  problem,

for example, in some of the regional countries is that the banks

which  give  guarantees for LCs are no longer  acceptable.   For

example,  maybe some banks in Korea may already  be  in  serious

trouble.  So foreign lenders do not have any confidence in  that

bank  and are not prepared to accept LCs from that bank for  the

purpose  of selling them products.  In our situation, our  banks

are  very  strong and there is no problem for them to issue  LCs

for  the  import of materials from overseas.  So I am not  quite

clear what Mr Singh meant in this situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to turn to the question of the small and

medium  enterprises (SMEs).  As Mr Inderjit Singh has mentioned,

there are some 60 schemes to help our SMEs.  I also get confused

with the large number of schemes.  I can assure Members that the

statutory  boards, like  EDB, PSB and so on,  have  been  trying

their  best to help the small and medium enterprises,  and  they

have come up with all these different ideas, incentives and what

have  you,  to help our companies, to cater for their  different

needs.   Maybe  it  is  time now for us to  have  a  relook  and

streamline the operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, when we debated this issue, there was this

comment  that we did not publish the booklet in other languages.

The  PSB  has since done so and they are also in the process  of

trying to simplify the application procedures, to make the forms

easier for everybody.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSB has also set up its first-stop SME centre in the

PSB  building  in April last year to facilitate  and  coordinate

access to all schemes offered to SMEs.  The centre serves  as  a

focal point for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



guidance  and  advice  to  SMEs not familiar  with  the  various

upgrading  schemes.   If our SMEs have any  problems,  they  can

approach this first-stop centre and get assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also asked about tax deductibility for `Q' plate

cars.   On  this  issue, the Member may wish to  note  that  the

registration  of `Q' plate cars will be discontinued  under  the

new vehicle tax structure that has just been announced recently.

All  company cars registered after 1st September this year  will

be  subject to the same taxes as for private cars.  This is  the

information we have obtained from LTA.  I hope this answers  his

point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to the points made by Mr Tay Beng Chuan. He

commented about the Local Enterprise Technical Assistance Scheme

(LETAS),  whether the grant quantum could be increased from  70%

to  90%  of the allowable cost of engaging external consultants.

On  this  point, I wish to inform him that, in  fact,   the  PSB

already  allows  90%.  For certain projects  which  benefit  the

industry as a whole, not on a company basis, but where it  is  a

scheme or a study meant to benefit the whole industry group, the

PSB  does  approve 90%.  A good example of this  is  the  recent

relocation of small factories from Woodlands to make way for the

wafer fabrication plants in Woodlands.  These factories have all

been  moved  to a new multi-storey flatted factory and,  in  the

process,  PSB  has  to  come in and help them  to  lay  out  the

factory,  plan various things and so on.  The funding  for  that

was at 90% level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked whether we could give financial grants to

trade  associations to engage professionals.  I  would  like  to

inform him that the Government does provide LETAS grants to  the

Singapore Chinese and Malay Chambers of Commerce and Industry to

implement projects that upgrade their members' operations.   PSB

will  continue  to work with trade and industry associations  on

worthwhile projects that have industry-wide applications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion that Government provides soft or matching

loans to finance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



joint  investment  projects in ASEAN, the Nominated  Member  may

wish  to  note that this is available under the Local Enterprise

Regionalisation  Finance  Scheme  for  machinery  loans.    This

scheme is administered by EDB and is meant to help our companies

set  up  factories overseas.  The loans are provided at I  think

low  cost or low rates for them to set up factories and  to  buy

machinery.



<br>4.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to reiterate that the granting of loans is

a  decision  that  is best left to banks to make  on  commercial

grounds based on prudent assessment of risk and return.  This is

the best approach to avoid abuses or misallocation of resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have spoken about the retail industry and

the  tourism industry.  I am leaving them to be answered  by  Mr

Tang Guan Seng.  So please bear with me on this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about the Regional Headquarters

Scheme  and whether the Ministry is satisfied with the  progress

made so far.  He quoted a figure of 22 companies which have been

granted   the   Regional   Headquarters   (RHQs)   or   Business

Headquarters (BHQs) status and whether the incentives are enough

in view of the recent slowdown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to inform Mr Low that the scheme has in fact worked

very  well.  Since the figure that he quoted in 1991, the number

of  RHQs  has increased very significantly.  I do not  have  the

actual  figures here, but I think it exceeds 100 companies  now.

The contribution to the economy runs into billions of dollars in

terms  of  expenditure that they incur here.  So it has  been  a

very  good  scheme  and  the EDB will continue  to  promote  the

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, with the slowdown, it has indirectly led to more

companies  coming here for this purpose.  When  these  companies

pull out from the region, they still want to  have a presence in

Southeast Asia, and the natural place is Singapore.  So  we  are

in  fact seeing some of that flow coming back.  Contrary to  the

reports recently in some newspapers that we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



losing  people,  we may be losing some of these  expatriates  in

certain  areas like banking, but we are getting a gain in  other

areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked about the target. We do not have any targets,

the  more, the merrier.  We have plenty of office space and this

is  a very good field.  It helps us to control the operations in

the  region  and they can source components here and  engage  in

development  work and so on. So it is a very desirable  form  of

high  level  activity, for example, international  trading.   In

fact,  they  are  doing  trading which  does  not  pass  through

Singapore.  All they need is a phone, some fax machines and some

able staff, and, of course, plenty of good contacts overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have spoken about this important topic of

training  and  retraining of our workers.  I can assure  Members

that  training has always been a top priority for  us,  together

with education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong made the point that we only give lip

service  to training but where is the money.  Here, may  I  just

make  the  point that in fact SDF in a way is also  like  public

funds  because in the past, before we had SDF, in  fact  we  had

payroll  tax.  So payroll tax was in a way converted to SDF  and

subsequently  it  was  increased to four percentage  points  and

adjusted  down to 1% now for workers who earn less  than  $1,000

per  month.  So  he might like to look upon  it  as  a  kind  of

taxation which is directed towards training, the idea being that

companies  contribute  to  this fund  based  on  the  number  of

employees,  and  the more they train, the more  they  get  their

money back.  This is to encourage and support them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, the Government's other revenues are mostly

taxes.   It comes from the whole economy.  The Government itself

does not generate this income.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I want to clarify on this point. The

SDF  is  not budgeted.  It is not in the Budget.  It  has  never

gone   into  the  Consolidated  Fund.  Therefore,  it   is   not

Government's money.  It is a fund quite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



separate from Government revenue and Government funds.  In  that

sense, Government has not contributed any money.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Thank you, Mr Chiam. I would not split

hairs  here.   I  was just trying to make a general  point  that

these are public funds, in a way that the Government has imposed

it  on  the  system in its overall taxation,  as  it  were,  and

directed it towards certain uses.  The money is put in the  SDF.

In the past, we had in fact payroll tax and this was replaced by

the SDF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, of course, not true to say that Government has not

been  spending  money on training.  We have the  ITE  and  other

schemes which are in different parts of the Budget.  But I  take

the  point  that  for  the purpose of the  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme, we have not had any budget yet in this latest  annual

budget, the reason being that there was not enough time  for  us

to  evaluate the scheme fully and come out with a recommendation

to  the  Ministry of Finance to have it in the  Budget.   But  I

would  like  to assure all the Members who have spoken  that  we

support the scheme, and my Ministry is evaluating it to see  how

we can fund it and expand the scheme, because the scheme fits in

very  well with the need to upgrade our older workers.  It is  a

wonderful  idea  if,  whilst they are  working  in  certain  low

skilled jobs and there is a threat that they may lose their job,

we  train  them in a systematic way with certification  so  that

they  can be upgraded into higher level and better paying  jobs,

say, for example, in the wafer fabrication industry.  Of course,

we  must make sure that the training is relevant and that  there

is  no wastage.  Very often, when you train a young person, say,

in ITE, he does not apply the training after that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have been adopting this principle that the

Government's  responsibility is to provide  good  education  and

skills up to a certain level, ie, 10 years of schooling and also

skills  in the ITE.  But the employers themselves have to  train

the  workers for their own needs. That is the most effective way

of training. We cannot foresee what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



kind  of  industries will come, even though we  know  there  are

certain general directions.  And even for different companies in

the  same  industry, they may have their own needs.  But  having

said that, I think there is a case for us to upgrade the general

ability level, for example, literacy, computer skills and  other

skills  of  our workers so that they are  able to do the  higher

level jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am not comfortable about in this SRP is this part

about the absentee payroll, because we do not want to get into a

situation where we pay workers just to learn.  We think that  it

is  better that if they are holding a job and they are  learning

on-  the-job.  In  the  situations that  I  have  quoted,  these

employees  are  actually still working and contributing  to  the

existing  employers, but they are pulled out for,  say,  20%  of

their  time to undergo training in ITE either on a part-time  or

full-time basis.  On that basis, EDB has supported the programme

under  their INTECH  scheme, up to 70% of the absentee  payroll.

The  course fees are paid up to 80% via SDF.  Anyway, the  point

is that we support the scheme.  We are evaluating it and we will

discuss  with  the Ministry of Finance and see how  we  can  get

money for the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the scheme can just push on and money

would  be forthcoming, say, from the SDF funds which still  have

several hundred million dollars of resources left.  There should

be no need for us to slow down the scheme for reasons of lack of

funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Members asked whether we allow the SDF to be

used  for training foreign workers.  The answer is, yes, we  do,

especially if the foreign workers have three-year work  permits,

which  means that they are skilled already, and we feel that  it

is  useful  for  us  to  upgrade their skills  further.   Within

certain  limits, we also allow training of two-year work  permit

holders.   But here we have a cap because we want to  make  sure

that the funds are used more to train our own people rather than

transient workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to executive training, this is supported if it

is part of the company's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



total  training and development plan.  But for executives, there

are other schemes.  For example, EDB's INTECH scheme is used  to

train  executives  for  new projects  when  they  have  to  send

employees  overseas to train in headquarters so  that  they  can

bring  back the knowledge and help start up the local operation.

INTECH  has also been used to send people for training,  to  man

our regional plants for example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked for the percentage support under

SDF to be increased from the current levels.  Here, I would like

to say that PSB is generally sympathetic and is aware that under

the  current  economic  situation, some companies  may  be  more

reluctant  to  train.  So maybe there is a need to increase  the

funding  level  on  a  temporary basis.  The  general  level  of

support  is  50%  of  fee course.  But for  the  more  desirable

skills,  the higher skill areas, the PSB does go as far as  80%.

But  we  do not want to go too far because it is important  that

the  resources are not wasted.  If we go up to, say, 90% and the

employer only pays 10%, there is a possibility that the training

may  not  be  so well regulated and there could be  wastage.   I

think 50:50 is  in fact a good ratio.  But for special cases, we

can go somewhat higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Swee Say made the point that we should try and

project  into  the  future  in terms of  the  kind  of  economic

structure  that  we will have and try and assess  what  kind  of

workers  will  be needed and prepare ourselves for  that.   This

point  is  well  taken.  We will be working  together  with  the

Ministry of Manpower to see how we can do this.  Of course,  one

of  our  main concerns is to prepare our workers well, not  only

the  young  ones, but also the older ones, so that we  will  not

have  a  problem of structural unemployment.  I think the Skills

Redevelopment Programme fits in very well with the  latter  part

of the programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data from EDB shows that most of the investments coming

in  now tend to involve more skilled jobs, something like 70% or

so  for  the newer industries.  So it is very important that  we

upgrade our workers so that they can fit into those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



kinds  of  jobs.  But I would be reluctant to have  a  situation

where  there  are retrenchments and we provide the workers  with

wages  for them to train, because in our tight labour  market  - Members  will  be surprised that our markets is  actually  still

quite  tight  -  there  are plenty of jobs  available.  So  when

workers  get retrenched, the best thing for them is  to  find  a

different   job  quickly,  and  be  prepared  to  adjust   their

expectations.  In the process, of course, we will help with  the

training as well.  But they should not expect to sit at home  or

be paid just to learn.  That will be carrying it a bit too far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have various schemes to help the housewives and

retirees to come back to the labour force.  This is known as the

back-to-work programme and it has been going on well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to turn to the point made by Dr Wang Kai

Yuen.   First,  he asked about the water agreements.   Following

PM's  visit  to KL on 16th to 17th February 1998, the Government

of  Malaysia  has  agreed to continue the  supply  of  water  to

Singapore  beyond the expiry of the 1961 Agreement in  2011  and

the  1962  Agreement  in  2061 on terms  and  conditions  to  be

mutually   agreed  upon  between  the  two  governments.    This

undertaking by the Malaysian Government will be confirmed in  an

agreement within 60 days of the issue of the Joint Communiqu� by

Singapore and Malaysia.  I share his view that this is a  golden

opportunity for us to try and settle this matter.   I  hope  the

Malaysians will proceed in a business-like fashion.  It is a win-win  situation; otherwise the water will be going to waste,  and

it  is  zero value for them. But if we are prepared to buy  from

them - it is very important to us, of course - if we can come to

this  agreement  in  the near future, this  will  remove  a  big

psychological  barrier between us.  From then on, I hope it will

be  possible  for us to really cooperate.   As close neighbours,

there  is  much that we can do together.  As matters  are  still

under discussion, I am afraid I cannot go into more details.

<br>4.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the electricity rates, the recent increase in

the  electricity rates has given rise to queries,  both  outside

and  inside  the House.  And I informed the House  recently,  in

answer to an Oral Question, that this increase recently was just

to  pass  on the fuel cost increase.  There has been a time  lag

between  the  fuel price increase and the tariff  increase,  and

this is unfortunate.  Whilst the price of fuel has come down, in

US dollar terms, because of the depreciation of Singapore dollar

versus  the  US dollar, the actual cost in Singapore dollar  has

actually gone up leading to this increase in the fuel cost.  But

we  see a situation of softening of the fuel oil prices, and  if

that  continues, then I hope there will be a reduction  in  this

component in the next round when we review the prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electricity price is composed of two components. There

is  a  fixed  component  where you have  the  depreciation,  the

overheads, the wage cost, and so on, and the return,  and  there

is  this  fuel  component.  The fuel component  is  just  passed

straight  through.  Unfortunately, there is a time  lag  between

the actual cost and the price adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other components, I think this was debated

thoroughly  in 1996 when the decision was made to  increase  the

return  on investment of Singapore Power.  At that time, it  was

found  that Singapore Power was costing their electricity  on  a

different  basis.   They did not take into  consideration  their

capital which was invested in plant under construction, and they

were only basing their return on plant in operation.  So on that

basis,  they were earning a return which was adequate under  the

old  basis, ie, under the World Bank basis, but not adequate for

a  viable  business.  The Government recognises  that  power  is

actually  a very stable business.  It is not one of those  high-flyer  types  where it goes up and down.  The return  should  be

reasonable  but on the low side and stable.  So  it  is  a  very

stable  kind of situation.  The key thing here is to  make  sure

that our power rates are competitive.  And I want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



assure  him  that my Ministry is watching this  carefully.   The

tariff rates have to be approved by the PUB and we will have  to

make  sure that this component of cost is kept under control  as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok, who is not here, asked about the blackout

in  New Zealand.  I think the answer has already been given that

it  is  not  likely  that in Singapore we will  suffer  a  total

blackout,  like  in Auckland, which happened  to  their  central

business district.  I understand that some of their cables were,

in  fact,  very  old  and not designed for  this  unusually  dry

weather.  As a result, the heat was not carried away fast enough

and  there  was a trigger effect.  PUB and Singapore Power  have

assured us that they have taken all necessary precautions and  a

blackout  of this nature, a total collapse, will not  happen  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will leave the other questions to my colleagues to

answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, can I make a clarification,

please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, earlier on, the Minister

mentioned that I made unfair comment on JTC.  Indeed, it was not

true,   because  I  did  not  make  that  comment.   By   saying

"inflexible", I did not mean that JTC has not been  doing  well.

In  fact, I said that IP21 is actually quite well drawn  up.   I

must  declare  that I am a tenant of JTC, and I am  quite  happy

with  it.  But whatever I said earlier on were actually comments

and feedback from friends of mine who are tenants of JTC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by the Minister, salary, wages, rental and

service  charges  are the key components of the  cost  of  doing

business.  But I am sure the Minister is well aware that when it

comes  to  wages and rentals, it actually equates to cost,  cash

upfront.  You just have to pay.  And therefore many companies in

Singapore   are   having   this   problem,   meaning   financial

difficulties,  in paying up instalments, and wages.   Therefore,

earlier on, I had asked if JTC would be prepared to be even more

flexible to come out with some

financial schemes, eg, deferring of payments and lowering of the

rates, and so on and so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am actually quite pleased that the Minister has reassured

us  that they are quite watchful of costs.  But I hope that  the

Ministry  will continue to monitor the costs.  We  do  not  know

what  is going to hit us with this turmoil.  So I hope that  the

Ministry  will  keep on monitoring the costs and  be  even  more

flexible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point mentioned by the Minister is about the SME

schemes.   He himself said that there were too many schemes  and

he  could  not  recall all of them.  I just  wonder  whether  we

should take a fresh approach by seeing how we can actually  help

SMEs.   Maybe  they can take a global approach  and  restructure

some  of the schemes, so that SMEs will be able to enjoy to  the

fullest the various schemes introduced by the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point, Sir, is about JTC again. I just wonder

whether  JTC has come out with some kind of survey to  see  what

kind  of  grievances there are from the tenants.   At  the  same

time,   have  there  been  any  service  performance  indicators

reflecting the good work put in by JTC?  JTC tenants would  then

be  more  than  willing to take the point on  cost  control  and

reduction, and freezing of the rental charges, and so on and  so

forth.   I  am  sure with this explanation, they  will  be  more

perceptible to the complaints on the inflexibility of JTC.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Clarification, Sir. I accept the reply

from the Minister regarding the electrical power supply charges.

But  Mr  Yeo Cheow Tong in 1996 had laid out a programme on  the

increase of tariff which will be spread out over three  to  five

years,  and  every year it will increase by 5%, on the  average.

My  question to him is whether this built-in increase  is  still

going to be implemented, come high or low water.  Would he  take

into  consideration  that in 1998 Singapore will  face  economic

contraction  and maybe the danger of recession?   Will  this  5%

increase,  to  enable Singapore Power to increase  its  rate  of

return on total assets, be continued to be implemented?  Perhaps

he will give us a clear answer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Choo for his

clarification.  I take it that he accepts that JTC is  generally

quite  cooperative, although some friends of his have  told  him

that  it  is  rather  inflexible  in  some  ways.   But  my  own

impression  of  JTC  is,  in  fact,  that  it  has   been   very

accommodating  to its tenants, and it is amongst  the  first  to

move  to support our industries in the current crisis.   On  its

own volition, without any pushing from me, it has gone ahead and

made various adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the cash flow problem that he mentioned, he may be

aware that JTC has also allowed the payment of quarterly rentals

to  be done on a monthly basis, instead of quarterly.  So I hope

that would be of some help to the tenants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Dr Wang Kai Yuen's point on the return on

investment, yes, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong did mention a target in 1996.

It  slipped  my  mind just now.  I am glad to inform  the  House

that, in fact, the target has already been reached.  So that  is

not  a  reason for electricity increase because after they  went

through  the process of corporatisation, they have been able  to

increase  productivity.  When I joined the Ministry  early  last

year,  they informed me that, in fact, they had already  reached

the  target.  So I would like to assure Members that  this  will

not be a cause for increase of power charges.  In fact, the cost

of  power  is  capped.  The fixed component is capped  at  CPI-X

(where X has been set initially at 1%).  So it means they cannot

just   increase  rates  at  will.   They  must  pass  on   their

productivity to the users.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, he has not answered my question

pertaining  to  SME schemes, whether he is going to  restructure

the various schemes that we have now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Yes, as I said, we are looking into how

to  simplify the schemes and I am in favour of streamlining  the

schemes,  and not only for PSB's schemes relating to  small  and

medium  enterprises  but the tax incentive schemes  in  general,

because there is a big range of them.  My impression is that  in

the  eagerness of EDB and the others to promote investments  and

to help our industries, they have, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



fact,  made  the schemes more and more to start with,  and  also

more  and  more  generous.   So  I  think,  on  the  whole,  our

businesses here should be very thankful for this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, my question was not answered. It

is  about  the  survey.   Does JTC conduct  any  survey  on  its

performance?  How often do they collect feedback from tenants of

JTC, so that the tenants have better service?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I can assure the Member that JTC is in

close  contact with the tenants.  If nothing else,  the  tenants

come to them and protest, if anything is not proper.  But I take

his  point.  I think it would be a good idea if JTC has  regular

surveys.   I  mentioned earlier on that,  in  fact,  the  posted

rentals are set through surveys.  They measure and find out what

is  the  market rate.  So even though we have said that we  have

frozen the posted rates, in fact, if the market rentals go down,

then JTC will follow downwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that at this point, we let my colleagues answer

the other points.  If need be, we can come back again on some of

the other issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the Minister was confused about my

letter  of credit question.  So I would like to clarify.   I  am

talking  about  the  category of companies who  are  fortunately

still  able  to  secure sales, but because of the tightening  of

credit  financing, they are not able to purchase the goods  that

they  could  sell.   I was therefore hoping  for  some  form  of

backing  through  any means, banks or Government,  to  back  the

purchases  that  they  can make for the  sales  that  they  have

already  secured.  So it is quite different from those companies

who have lost sales or are in trouble because of the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I hope my question on the entrepreneurship will

be answered later on too.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Firstly, on the letters of credit, my

impression  is that if a trader has a good export order  and  he

needs to buy goods, he is able to use this to factor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



his  export bills with banks, and banks will be willing to lend.

Of course, if the trader is in a rather shaky position, then the

banks will have to evaluate whether it is too risky to lend  him

the money and, in some cases, they may require collateral and so

on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is more pertaining to LCs from the other

countries  because in those situations, their LCs are no  longer

acceptable.   So that is where the problem arises.  Our  traders

or manufacturers may be selling to the region.  But the LCs that

their importers in those countries want to open with their banks

are not acceptable to our banks here.  And this is an area where

Singapore  has been trying to help Indonesia to see how  we  can

facilitate this trade through some kind of a guarantee of  their

Bank   of  Indonesia.   Firstly,  the  Bank  of  Indonesia  will

guarantee  this group of banks which offer the LCs and  we  will

guarantee  the Bank of Indonesia.  But that scheme is contingent

on  having a multi-national effort involving many countries, and

at  the moment we are still waiting for response from some other

countries.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Second Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh raised a very important

question about the promotion of high-tech entrepreneurship.   As

we  all know, in the next century, the basis of wealth in  human

communities  will not be in raw materials but will be  in  human

knowledge.  Those who are close to the sources of knowledge  who

are  upstream,  they  get much more value  than  those  who  are

downstream.  If you were to look at a PC, there is a  very  high

extraction  of  the  total  value,  first,  by  Intel,  then  by

Microsoft.  If all you are doing is welding or assembly work  or

metal  bending,  you  are paid commodity  prices.   As  a  total

economy,  it  is very important that we promote this  particular

area of high-tech entrepreneurship in order that we will be able

to maintain our relative position in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this area, no one can beat America. The Japanese tried

but  they  are  now left far behind.  The centre is  in  Silicon

Valley.  It is a very exciting place and every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



important  city  in the world tries to re-create Silicon  Valley

within its midst.  But obviously, it is not so easy.  So when Mr

Inderjit Singh talked about promoting high-tech entrepreneurship

in  Singapore, he is really asking a very fundamental  question.

How do we try to replicate some of the conditions there in order

that,  in  this new world, we will also swim upstream  and  will

have our share of the total value of the world's product?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made four specific recommendations which I shall now

like to respond to.  First, amending the bankruptcy law in order

that  we  be more tolerant of failure and that Singapore  be  an

economy  with  many  second chances.  Our  bankruptcy  law  went

through  a  major  reform in 1995 with the new Act  coming  into

force  on 15th July 1995.  One of the primary objectives of  the

new  law was to encourage entrepreneurship, especially in  cases

where   bankruptcy  had  arisen  from  misfortune  rather   than

malpractice,  by  having  a more liberal  regime  in  bankruptcy

discharges.   With  the  scheme of easier discharges,  bankrupts

were  also  encouraged to work towards early  discharge.   Since

July 1995, close to 6,000 bankrupts have been discharged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Official Assignee is constantly reviewing bankruptcy

laws  and  practices.  In September of the same year, a  further

amendment  was  introduced to enable the  Official  Assignee  to

discharge  more  bankrupts by certificate.  Our insolvency  laws

are  being further studied to determine if additional amendments

are necessary in the interest of both creditors and bankrupts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with having many second chances is that of

moral hazard.  You use other people's money, that money is given

or  loaned  to you in trust, and if it is so easy  to  fail  and

somehow  betray  that  trust, then  we  create  a  very  serious

problem.  But we recognise at the same time that in the specific

field of high-tech, the investment is often in the nature  of  a

debt  and  that  if we are too harsh on the directors  of  these

companies,  say, for instance, by preventing them from  becoming

directors  again, then naturally there will be very  few  people

who will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



prepared  to become directors of high-tech start-ups  for  which

the  failure rate is very high.  These are some of the areas  we

are   looking  at  and,  if  necessary,  we  will  make  further

amendments to our laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also talked about the rigidity of SESDAQ

rules.   In  fact, under existing rules, a company applying  for

admission  to SESDAQ need not meet any minimum profit  or  share

capital  requirements.   Companies  seeking  listing  on  SESDAQ

usually have three-year operating records, but companies  having

shorter operating records can also apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an area which the Corporate Finance Committee,

formed by the Government to study corporate fund-raising issues,

is  currently  looking into.  The problem is more  complex  than

that.   In Israel, where they have many start-ups, they  do  not

have  their own equivalent of SESDAQ or NASDAQ.  Many  of  them,

when they succeed, they list on NASDAQ.  So they make use of the

fund  market in the US.  Creative which is listed on NASDAQ  and

in Singapore has 90% of its stocks transacted in NASDAQ and only

10%  here.  But we should try.  And if it is possible to somehow

make  SESDAQ  an  attractive place to  raise  high-risk  capital

funds, we should try to do so, and we need to tweak some of  our

other  rules and regulations as well, for example, our rules  on

stock options which are much too restrictive for high-tech start-ups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked about Government helping R&D

consortiums.   In fact, the Government has been  supporting  the

set-up  of industry consortiums.  This is an important  way  for

industry, research institutes and universities to come  together

to  work  on  common R&D projects.  And through  this  approach,

industry members benefit from reduced development cost and time,

as   well  as  from  information  sharing  and  technology   co-development.  The Government facilitates the formation  of  such

consortiums and supports their projects through grants and other

forms  of assistance.  Examples include the Aerospace Technology

Programme, the Marine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



Technology Programme and the Intelligent Progressive Die  Design

and  Manufacturing Software Programme.  Our research  institutes

and centres are also spearheading a number of other consortiums.

For  example, the Institute of Microelectronics and  the  Gintic

Institute   of   Manufacturing  Technology  lead  a   consortium

involving  29  industry members from the printed  circuit  board

assembly  industry.   Individuals or  companies  who  have  good

project ideas and are interested can approach NSTB or any of the

research institutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the question of venture capital. Mr Inderjit Singh

asked what we are doing to encourage this industry.  Again, this

industry  is not as simple as it sounds.  It does not mean  that

when  you  have  the  money, you have the rules,  and  you  have

venture  capital.  Two weeks before Chinese New Year, I  paid  a

visit  to  Silicon  Valley and had many interesting  discussions

with  venture  capitalists and lawyers who are  experts  in  the

field  in  Silicon Valley.  These are experts.  They  watch  the

bottom line very closely.  They are very good at sizing up human

beings  to  decide whom to place bets on and they also recognise

that  many  of these entrepreneurs who all have giant egos  also

have failings.  They cannot manage people,  they do not know how

to  institutionalise the procedures in the  company.   So  these

venture capitalists, in many ways, help to bring ideas through a

process  of  metamorphosis,  all  the  way  to  IPO.   There  is

specialisation at different stages of the process of watering an

idea and seeing it flower, and eventually bearing fruit.  We are

just beginning.  In fact, we have brought down many experts  and

consultants to help us here.  We will do everything we  can,  if

necessary, to make our laws and regulations conducive but  these

are  only  the  preconditions.  Whether or not we  will  succeed

depends on something more fundamental.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we have not done all too badly. The Government

has  been actively promoting the venture capital industry  since

the  mid-1980s.   As  at end 1997, there was over  $7.7  billion

worth of venture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



capital  (VC) funds managed in Singapore.  Currently,  VC  funds

enjoy  tax  exemption on the gains from disposal of  investments

and on certain investment incomes for a maximum of 10 years.  At

the  same time, fund management companies that manage such funds

can qualify for pioneer status.  To further encourage the growth

of  the industry, the Minister for Finance recently announced in

his  Budget  Statement that the current 10-year  limit  will  be

extended on a case-by-case basis, by up to a further five years,

at a concessionary tax rate of not more than 10%.  And this will

further encourage the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where private funds are not prepared to assume the

high  risks  associated with investing in seed stage  companies,

the  Government  has stepped in by establishing  venture  funds,

such  as the $50 million Technology Development Fund (TDF) which

co-invest with private firms to fund early stage ventures.   The

TDF  has  invested  in  more than 20  local  start-ups  and  has

attracted  more  than 10 overseas technology  companies.   Other

similar    funds    include   the   $100   million    Technology

Commercialisation  Fund  and  $100  million  Pharmaceutical  and

Biotechnology  Growth Fund.  At the same time,  EDB  Investments

Pte Ltd also runs venture capital funds which invest in start-up

companies at various stages of development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have various support schemes to assist

technopreneurs  and  innovators, including NSTB's  Technopreneur

Assistance Centre and PSB's R&D Incubator Programme.  These  are

infrastructural aspects.  At the end of the day, what we need is

to  create  in Singapore an environment which conduces high-tech

entrepreneurship and the growth of start-ups.  It is not an easy

thing to do.  It is a complex organic process and we have had  a

few  successes.  You take, for instance, Sim Wong Hoo's Creative

Technology.  70% of PCs carry his sound card, the Sound Blaster.

And he is quite a big name in Silicon Valley.  I have met people

there  who  hold him up as a model to emulate, not in Singapore,

in Silicon Valley.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I visited his facility recently and was very inspired by

his  briefing and of his plans for the future.  He has very  big

ambitions.   I asked him this question, "To what extent  do  you

owe your success to Singapore?"  He is Chinese educated.  He  is

not  a  university graduate.  He only has a polytechnic  diploma

and  he  listed six success factors all starting with  "F".   He

said,  "Well, some of them like hard work and so on."  They  are

Singaporean  factors and he thinks that his Singaporean  origins

are  very  important and he must maintain his roots in Singapore

which  is why Creative is listed on our Stock Exchange.  But  he

said  there  are  other aspects like fun and  failure  tolerance

which are more American in character and he wishes that we  have

more of them here.  He wants to expand here.  But he also has an

operation  in  Silicon Valley.  I asked him,  "Do  you  do  more

creative  work  here or in Silicon Valley?"  He  said,  "In  the

Valley.   But Singaporeans are very good, very kiasu.   When  it

comes  to  product  development  and  manufacturing,  debugging,

Singapore is much better than Silicon Valley."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got to take a very realistic view. I do not think

we  can ever be like Silicon Valley but we can swim close to it,

be  well-connected  there  and, at  the  same  time,  create  an

environment  here for Asians, for Westerners  who  want  a  good

wholesome  family environment to locate here and to do  creative

work  here.   And  if  we  do  that, then  we  will  succeed  in

technology  entrepreneurship.  If we do not,  then  it  is  very

difficult to keep up with this very fast paced game in the  next

century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to answer the cut on R&D by Dr Wang Kai

Yuen and Mr Zainul Abidin.  Again, this is an area connected  to

what  I  have  just discussed about technology entrepreneurship,

which is key.  The problem is we can easily measure inputs.  But

how  do we measure outputs?  Mr Zainul Abidin was concerned that

our  inputs were not sufficient.  Dr Wang Kai Yuen was concerned

that  we  were  not  measuring  outputs  carefully  enough   and

therefore we might be wasting money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a difficult area. We know that to remain

competitive,  we  must continually upgrade our  technology  base

through the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



promotion  of  industry-relevant R&D and  innovation.   And  the

Government's  general  approach to R&D  is  encompassed  in  the

National Science and Technology Plan, NSTB 2000.  I do not think

it is our objective to nurture rocket scientists in Singapore or

astrophysicists.  But at the same time, on the spectrum  of  the

manufacturing  process,  from  assembly  all  the  way  to  pure

research, instinctively we know that we must move rightwards  if

we  are  going to keep up in this knowledge game.   We  want  to

invest  long  term in projects whose outcomes are uncertain  but

whose  results are not so far into the distant future that  they

are  immeasurable even after a long period of time.  That is the

dilemma which we face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, NSTB 2000 is progressing quite well. Gross

expenditure  in R&D as a percentage of GDP, that  is  the  input

number,  reached 1.35% in 1996.  In 1990, it was only 0.84%  and

our  aim  is  to  raise  it  to 1.6% by  the  year  2000.   More

importantly,  the private sector share of gross  expenditure  on

R&D  has  risen  from 54% in 1990 to 63% in  1996,  against  our

target  of  65% by the year 2000.  The private sector  companies

have  got  to  answer  to  stockholders.   They  have  quarterly

reports,  annual reports, so they are much more  careful.   This

statistic,  the  fact of their share of a growing  pool  of  R&D

funds  in Singapore, shows that we are doing quite well.   About

79% of the estimated $6.5 billion in sales revenue attributed to

R&D  performed in Singapore, about 79% of this revenue, was from

commercialized  products  and  processes  launched  within   the

preceding two years.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another index of success is number of patents. The number

of  patents  filed  by Singapore companies and  individuals  has

increased  from  142 in 1993 to 316 in 1996, an  average  annual

growth  rate  of 31%.  This is not bad.  The number  of  patents

granted  as  a  result of R&D work carried out in Singapore  has

also risen from 20 in 1992 to 91 in 1996.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our research institutes and centres, which form part of the

knowledge infrastructure that supports industry, have also  been

doing  well.   To  date, they have participated in  1,000  joint

projects with industry, developed 150 new products and processes

and  signed  76 licensing agreements for technology development.

And some of them have gained a certain international reputation.

Although  there  may be instances of specific R&D  projects  not

doing  well,  this  is  to be expected.   If  all  projects  are

successes,  it  means  that  we are  not  taking  enough  risks.

Nevertheless, I fully agree with Dr Wang Kai Yuen that we should

conduct  regular reviews critically to monitor the effectiveness

of our investment in R&D.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's policy on international and regional R&D

collaboration is to focus on areas which will help  to  build  a

strong base of technological capabilities in Singapore.  We have

been  very  active.   We  have  bilateral  activities  with   15

countries  including China, India, Israel, Germany, Canada,  the

US,  Japan  and the Netherlands.  Activities cover  projects  in

areas  such  as  biotech, advanced materials, IT,  environmental

technology   and  advanced  manufacturing  systems.   Technology

brokerage events are also co-organised with overseas partners to

establish and build on networks and linkages that will  maximize

market access opportunities for Singapore-based companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days ago, I opened a new facility in Singapore set up

by  Genset  from  France.  They are a very interesting  company.

For  some  time now, there has been a French team consisting  of

very  brilliant scientists whose objective is to completely  map

the  human  genome, which means to map the entire DNA coding  of

human  beings.  With computers, it can be done and it  is  being

done.   This company sees enormous possibilities in health  care

therapies,  in  drugs, in solving many of the  medical  problems

which are genetic in nature.  It is a small facility.  And  what

they  produce at the end of the day, in a test tube, is a little

drop  of  electrolyte,  a  single  strand  of  DNA  artificially

synthesised  from the four amino acids.  This  is  a  new  game.

What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



biotech  means here is the creation of life.  If  you  put  this

strand  of  DNA into the primordial soup, it replicates  itself.

Of  course,  this would eventually pose enormous moral  problems

for  human  beings, but the genie is already out of the  bottle.

Either  we get into this game ourselves or others will get  into

it and we will be left behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the areas which NSTB is trying very hard

to  promote.   The  CEO  of Genset told  me  that  he  had  full

confidence  in  Singapore.  He did not even visit  our  facility

before he decided to plonk it there.  And when he came to see it

for himself, it was beyond his expectations.  In other words, we

have a certain reputation in the world.  We should safeguard  it

and build upon it, multiply our networks and get into this game.

Because  it is this game which will maintain a high standard  of

living for Singaporeans, young and old, in the next century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also active in the multi-lateral arena including the

ASEAN  Committee  for Science and Technology,  the  Asia-Pacific

Economic  Cooperation  Forum,  the  Association  for  Scientific

Cooperation in Asia and the Asia-Europe Meeting.  What  we  have

to  do  in the end, like for high-tech entrepreneurship,  is  to

create  an  environment  in Singapore  which  attracts  talented

people  from  all over the world to come here.  If  we  have  to

depend  upon  local  talent to staff  all  our  laboratories  in

Singapore,  we  must  surely fail.  If  you  visit  any  of  our

research  institutes, a very high proportion of  the  scientists

and engineers there are non-Singaporeans.  What we have to do is

to  create reputation, create a total working environment, which

makes it attractive for them to come here.  And as part of  this

move,  we  are master planning a Science Habitat in the vicinity

of the Science Park and the universities in the Ayer Rajah area,

an  ambience with watering holes which brain workers  will  find

attractive,  and  well served by schools, public  transportation

and other facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silicon Valley is, of course, much bigger than the whole of

Singapore.  It is sprawling.  It has got highways and  connected

by  cars.   But  there are not all that many watering  holes  in

Silicon Valley.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



In  Silicon Valley, there is a feeling of a small community.  If

you  are  a person who matters, everyone knows you and  you  are

recognised, even by the waiter.  What we need to do in Singapore

is  to  create one aspect of us which is like that, where  there

are  watering holes, where people will retire in the evening for

a  drink,  just to talk, to meet.  We can have electronic  mail,

but  there is nothing to substitute for a handshake and  a  chat

over a glass of beer.  And this is part of the human aspects  of

a   scientific  community,  which  we  must  try  to  create  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Tan Boon Wan and Dr Toh See Kiat spoke on

electronic commerce.  All of us know that with the growth of the

Internet, electronic commerce will explode in the coming  years.

For  it  to  realise its full potential, there  must  be  money.

Cyberspace  will  not be sustained by window  shoppers,  by  Net

surfers.   In  the  end, cyberspace will only  be  sustained  by

electronic commerce, by people investing in it and making  money

out of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for cyberspace to develop like that, we need

contracts.   We  need  protection  of  property.   We  need  the

enforcement of contracts. We need arbitration.  In other  words,

we need the whole panoply of facilities which are to be found in

the real world and they must be replicated in cyberspace.  Right

now,  it is a Wild West,    anything goes.  But eventually, like

the  Wild West, it will be settled.  I do not think for  a  long

time  to  come,  we  are  going to find a  world  government  in

cyberspace.  But jurisdictions will eventually creep in.  Banks,

credit  card companies, bookshops, haberdashers, they  will  all

jump  into  cyberspace.  Today, many of  us  are  familiar  with

amazon.com.  It is a very easy way to order books, quite  cheap,

very generous return policy.  It is very convenient, the largest

bookshop  in the world.  Or you can buy your shirts  from  Lands

End.   If you are not happy with it, you can return it to a post

office  in Singapore.  This will grow.  But in order for  it  to

grow,  you  need, like in the real world, trust networks,  which

means a way by which transactions are secured, that someone else

will not see your credit card number.  And that you are whom you

claim you are.  Therefore, identification is important.  We need



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



electronic signatures.  We need public keys, private keys.  Then

in  the  event of disputes, whose jurisdiction?  And, of course,

we have to keep the taxes light, because trade goes to where the

taxes are lightest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our approach towards electronic commerce is a total one,

not just to create the bandwidth.  Bandwidth is the least of the

problems.   But  if  we  can  create  many  trust  networks   in

Singapore, with good arbitrators, with good jurisdictions,  then

electronic commerce will flourish around us.  And we  will  find

eventually  in  cyberspace,  cyber  hubs  which  are  electronic

cities, each a collection of trust networks, where if I want  to

buy a lottery ticket or I want to make a contract, I say, "OK, I

choose  this  jurisdiction."  I may have to pay, because  it  is

worth paying for good government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are we trying to do in Singapore? We are doing

many things.  We are providing infrastructural services such  as

on-line secure payment with credit cards and the setting  up  of

Net  Trust  which  issues  digital certificates  for  electronic

identification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, for the first time in the world, the first

secured  electronic transaction was carried out in Singapore  by

Visa.   It  is  still a little cumbersome, a little complicated,

but as these things get debugged, as people get used to it, more

and  more  companies  will  do  a  part  of  their  business  in

cyberspace,  and  we must position ourselves  for  it.   We  are

promoting it.  The agency that is pushing this is NCB.  We  have

a  National Information Technology Committee chaired by  Admiral

Teo  Chee  Hean.    The  adviser is DPM BG  Lee.   And  agencies

representing  all Ministries are on it, because there  are  many

aspects to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have this thing called the Electronic Commerce Hotbed,

which  is  to try and encourage those in the private  sector  to

make use of electronic commerce.  Of course, Government agencies

are also jumping in.  We are using these Government agencies  to

spearhead  the effort and to get people used to it.  Of  course,

information technology is changing so fast that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



it  is  hard  for us to catch up.   Every 10 years, there  is  a

generational gap.  We must accept this.  Young people will  swim

in  this  new  environment.  Old people will be frightened  off.

But  even  if  our  grandparents are  not  comfortable  in  this

technology,  they  should  at least have  enough  knowledge  and

enough  wisdom  to want their grandchildren to be familiar  with

it.   And  so  we  now  find in Singapore many  old  people  who

instinctively  know that it is very important  for  their  young

charges to be taught the computer.  And, as you know, whether it

is  schools, whether it is the financial sector, whether  it  is

Singapore  One, whether it is marketing ourselves to Bill  Gates

or  to  Netscape  or whatever, we are positioning  ourselves  in

Singapore  for the electronic age.  And we are also providing  a

conducive  legal  and policy framework to facilitate  electronic

commerce.   We are preparing a new Electronic Transactions  Bill

which  will be tabled in this House to include things like  what

is  a public key.  What does it mean to be legally identified in

electronic  transactions?   What are electronic notaries?   Many

of these things have got to be defined in clearer detail because

the present laws do not quite cover the new technology.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to legislate to prevent computer misuse, to

protect  privacy and to protect intellectual property.  The  key

is that people must trust the system in Singapore. If they trust

the  system  in  Singapore,  if they are  confident  that  their

properties  will be protected, that there is a  way  to  resolve

disputes,  a  way to collect monies, a way to enforce,  then  we

will  flourish.  As part of this, we are funding R&D, conducting

market  surveys, and developing our local capabilities. We  have

schemes in place, which local companies, including SMEs can  tap

for   their   ventures.   Funding  for  consultancy,  equipment,

manpower and training is available under the Cluster Development

Fund and the Innovations Development Scheme administered by NCB.

Funding  for R&D is available as well under schemes  managed  by

the National Science and Technology Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we should go beyond the specialists. We must bring in

members  of  the  public.   NCB  has  been  working  with  other

Government  agencies  and  industry  players  to  raise   public

awareness  and acceptance of e-commerce.  For example,  together

with the Singapore Tourism Board, they organised a "Shop on  the

Net"  event  in  July  1997,  the  first  electronic  sales   in

Singapore.   E-commerce  promotion is  also  being  carried  out

through  Singapore  One clubs at various community  centres  and

through regular road shows held in shopping malls.  In addition,

broad  based  e-commerce training and awareness  programmes  are

being carried out for companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approved cyber trading scheme is part of this total

effort to position Singapore as a hub for e-commerce.  I do  not

think that cyberspace will be completely tax free, which is what

the  Americans  want.  I do not think it will be completely  tax

free because services are being provided and these services have

to be paid for.  In the end, what we will see in cyberspace will

be competing jurisdictions, each levying fees or taxes at levels

which have to compete with each other, according to the level of

services  they  provide.   Our job is to  tax  lightly  and  the

approved cyber trading scheme is precisely to ensure that normal

taxation rates do not apply for certain categories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also working with other agencies in the world, like

electronic  commerce  committees  in  the  OECD,  the   European

Community,   the  US  and  the  World  Intellectual   Properties

Organisation (WIPO).  It is a complex field.  It is evolving  so

fast that it is very hard to keep up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat asked why do we not create a Ministry for

Cyberspace or a Cyber Ministry.  It is not so simple because, if

we  think about it, IT will pervade every aspect of our life  in

Singapore.   Every entity which exists in the  real  world  must

eventually find a reflection in cyberspace.  You do not need one

Ministry  in  cyberspace.   You  need  every  Ministry   to   be

represented,  which is why Dr Toh's proposal is  not  realistic.

What we are trying to do  is to encourage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



every  Ministry  to anticipate the new technology  and  to  help

promote  it, and all agencies and all Ministries.  Many of  them

already  allow and encourage members of the public who  need  to

apply for permits or whatever to deal electronically through the

PC.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I have to bring myself back to

SESDAQ.   Earlier  on, the Minister mentioned about  SESDAQ.   I

just  want  to know what is the role of MTI in promoting  SESDAQ

and  how many companies has it helped to push them on to SESDAQ.

Can  he  give us an assessment about our SESDAQ because  it  has

been  around for quite a number of years and how successful have

we been?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The idea of the second board is to

enable companies which need high-risk funds to raise them.  This

means that, on the second board, the criteria are less stringent

than on the main  board.  This was the way NASDAQ in the US  was

conceived.   We  started it in Singapore.   The  rules  and  the

environment may be somewhat too rigid.  So SESDAQ has  had  some

success,  but we need to do much more to make it an  avenue  for

high tech-firms to raise funds through SESDAQ.  It is, of course

regulated by MAS.  MTI is only interested to the extent that  we

are  trying to promote high-tech companies in Singapore  and  to

help them raise higher risk funds more readily here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> How successful have we been in

promoting  fund raising and supporting such high-tech and  high-risk companies in the SESDAQ market?  Do you have any figures to

substantiate?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> No, I do not have the numbers

here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> May I know from the Minister what are

the  roles that he has in mind in promoting SESDAQ and promoting

companies with high-tech and high-risk?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I thought I have discussed this in

some  detail  in  connection with high tech enterpreneurship  in

Singapore,  which  has  got  to  be  financed,  and   that   the

characteristic of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



market  is  different from that of the normal market.   We  need

specialists,   different   laws   and   regulations    governing

bankruptcies  and  disclosures,  in  order  to  facilitate  this

particular  sector.  Investing in high-tech is  quite  different

from  investing  in,  say,  a  sector  like  real  estate.   Our

traditional skills are in the traditional areas.  This is a  new

area  for  us and we have got to tweak our rules and regulations

to nurture its growth.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I just want to know whether we are

ready  for it.  Is the SESDAQ ready for such high-tech and high-risk ventures?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I thought I have already said

that SESDAQ had some success but we need to do much more to make

it  more  successful.  Even then, we are not sure how successful

it  can be because, as in the Israeli example, they do not  even

try  to  create their own second board.  They just make  use  of

NASDAQ.    But  then,  again,  they  have  very  strong   Jewish

connections in New York city, which we do not have.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I do understand what the Minister

said  that  we are successful to a certain extent.  But  I  just

want  to know whether MTI  has anything in mind to promote  such

companies in future.  Does he have anything concrete?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we will ask Mr Inderjit Singh to ask

his question first, before the Minister replies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> I am glad to hear that there is some

review that is going to take place on the SESDAQ rules.  I  hope

that  with  this review, this will encourage more successes  and

more high-tech companies to be set up here and to be listed.   I

would  like  to ask Minister, while we are reviewing the  SESDAQ

rules, can we also look at the possibility of allowing shares to

be  traded  in  a  kind  of grey market.  This  exists  in  some

countries  where  the  moment  the company  is  registered,  you

actually  allow shares to be traded in a grey market.  In  fact,

the  values of the shares are listed in the newspapers.   It  is

perfectly  above board for shares to be traded.  So there  is  a

kind of a grey market even before you go to the SESDAQ level.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I am not quite sure what Mr Singh

means.  It does not sound quite legitimate.  If Mr Singh  has  a

specific proposal, I would forward it to the Committee which  is

now reviewing the rules of SESDAQ.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, by way of clarification, can

I  ask  the Minister whether he has any response to this problem

which I raised earlier about the hardware, meaning psychological

barriers  which people may have in turning to IT?  So before  we

come to the cyber age, what more does he plan to do and does  he

see  the role of the grassroots organisations towards overcoming

this initial block by many people in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The most important thing is to get

our  students on to it.  All of us know that we are starting our

kids  on computers even from kindergarten, from K1.  There is  a

big  project  by the Education Ministry to provide one  computer

for every two school students.  But there is also the problem of

training the teachers and of getting parents and grandparents to

be  familiar so that they can guide their charges along.  We are

trying  to  do  different  things in a  fun  way  so  that  this

psychological  barrier can be broken.  It  is  not  easy.   Till

today,   there  are  still  not  an  inconsiderable  number   of

Singaporeans who fear the ATM.  We should try, but it is also in

the  nature  of human beings to be conservative.   But  we  must

make  sure  that  those  who are young  and  do  not  have  this

psychological barrier are fully raised in this milieu.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, the Minister has said in this House

that  the ECH Committee has made some recommendations.  I  think

in  an  earlier  reply  to Dr Lee's question,  there  were  some

sketches of what the ECH Committee has recommended.  What I  had

asked  for was whether the Ministry would be willing to consider

publishing the full report so that the investors and members  of

the public can understand where they can position themselves  if

they want to innovate in this area.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The NCB and the Committee of the

NITC are in constant contact with players in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



industry.   So  they are aware.  From time to time,  information

will  be  disclosed to members of the public.  We  have  got  to

promote   what  we  are  doing,  not  just  locally,  but   also

internationally.  The NITC has a programme to market Singapore's

IT efforts in a big way later this year or next year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One more question. I think we should spread

the excess time to other Ministries.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Just to follow up on the Minister's point

on  consortia that have been formed.  The Minister says that the

funding  from  the Ministry does go to the consortia.   But  the

consortia that he mentioned are largely NUS, NTU, government-led

and  initiated.  I did ask the Minister in my speech whether the

Ministry  would  fund a private consortium if  such  a  need  do

arise.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I think we would, if we are in

agreement  with  the  objectives and we are confident  that  its

output will be worthwhile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Trade  and  Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng): Sir, on behalf  of  my

Minister,  I  will respond to the points made by other  Members,

including the point made by Mr Zainul Abidin, which I will reply

in greater detail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first address the point made by Dr Toh See Kiat. He

requested  that the Government introduce a Fair Trading  Act  to

protect  the  interests of the consumers.  He also mentioned  of

cases  where  companies resorted to scare and cheating  tactics.

First  of all, I would like to thank the Member for bringing  up

these  cases  because  this  is the  best  way  to  educate  the

consumers.  Before I go into it further, I would like to explain

the basic approach of the Government on consumer protection, ie,

our   approach  has  always  been   market-based  with   minimal

government  regulation.   I think we  should  let  the  consumer

decide what product they want to buy.  The Government will  only

intervene  where  there are safety, health or  moral  issues  or

where there is a market failure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh mentioned about newspaper advertisements which were

misleading to the consumers.  We did look into this problem  but

we  feel that it is practically quite difficult to address  this

issue.   Basically, it is not easy to prove which  advertisement

is  misleading or false and also the advertiser can prove it  by

bringing up only one case.  So it is not easy for the Government

to  pass legislation to ban this type of advertisement.  But  if

Dr  Toh  has  suggestions to make, we would be very  pleased  to

consider them.



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consumer watchdog, the Consumers Association of

Singapore  (CASE) can help safeguard the interests of  consumers

by  educating them.  The Government is of the view that most  of

the  provisions  in  the  New  Zealand  Fair  Trading  Act  have

equivalent provisions in our Consumer Protection Act.   That  is

why  the  Government feels that there is no need to introduce  a

Fair  Trading  Act in Singapore.  But I am happy to  learn  that

CASE  is  preparing a proposal which will be  submitted  to  the

Ministry  in  a  few  months' time.   We  will  look  into  this

seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh and Mr Goh Choon Kang mentioned about cases

involving  soft  commodity traders cheating the members  of  the

public.   I would like to inform the Members that the Government

is  aware of such cases.  A Committee, in fact, was formed  last

year  to  look  into this problem.  But, currently,  rubber  and

coffee  are the only commodities regulated under the Commodities

Futures  Act  and Regulations.  The Government is  now  studying

whether it is also possible to extend the Act to cover the other

commodities.   However,  no  regulatory  system  can   guarantee

returns for investors in the futures market, nor can regulations

protect  investors from making losses.  Investors must therefore

be  discerning  in responding to advertising claims  and  should

stay   away  from  dubious  investment  schemes  which   promise

unrealistically high returns.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh has also talked about the problem of the millennium

bug.   He would like to know whether the private sector is ready

to   cope  with  this  problem.   I  would  like  to  take  this

opportunity  to  inform  the Member that the  National  Computer

Board launched a Year 2000 Conversion Campaign in November  1996

to raise awareness of the problem and to drive conversion of the

Government's systems.  The Government has targeted  to  complete

conversion  of all affected IT systems by the end of this  year.

Ministries,  departments  and statutory  boards  have  completed

detailed  impact  analysis  and  have  begun  to  convert  their

systems.   The public sector conversion programme is on schedule

and  all  agencies  are expected to meet the end  of  this  year

target.   Testing and fine-tuning can then be carried  out  next

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the private sector, NCB has also implemented a

number  of initiatives to increase the awareness of the  private

sector   and   the  general  public.   NCB  has  supported   and

participated in talks conducted for various industrial  sectors.

It has set up a Year 2000 Website.  These provide useful avenues

to discuss the issues, to share experiences and to seek help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise that it is in the interest of the

companies to tackle the Year 2000 issue seriously.  There are  a

number of well qualified IT firms in Singapore which are able to

provide  solutions to this problem.  For small and  medium-sized

enterprises  that face difficulties, they can approach  NCB  for

financial  assistance under the Local Enterprise Computerisation

Programme.  SMEs can seek assistance to help defray part of  the

cost of consultancy services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh has also asked about what happens to the financial

sector.   For  the financial sector, the Monetary  Authority  of

Singapore (MAS) issued circulars in May 1997 and October 1997 to

all  banks  and  financial institutions outlining measures  they

should  take  to address the Year 2000 problem.  All  banks  and

financial institutions are required to complete their Year  2000

conversion and testing processes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



by  the end of this year.  This is to allow sufficient time  for

any  rectification  required.  MAS  is  presently  conducting  a

survey   to   assess  the  status  of  financial   institutions'

preparedness  for the Year 2000 problem.  Our local institutions

are  on track in their preparations.  Most of the larger foreign

financial  institutions have established  global  programmes  to

tackle the problem.  MAS will liaise with financial institutions

that have difficulties in tackling the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now Mr Zainul Abidin brought up the issue of promoting

IT  culture at the grassroots level.  I would like to give  some

more details.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one major thrust in IT2000 Plan is to promote an IT

culture amongst our people so that Singapore will become one  of

the  most  IT-literate countries in the world.  To achieve  this

objective, NCB has adopted a two-pronged approach of creating IT

awareness  and increasing IT's usage among Singaporeans.   NCB's

efforts  since  1995 have met with much success.   There  are  a

number of initiatives which are launched by NCB.  Let me cite  a

few  examples here: (1) 13 computer road shows have  been  held;

(2)  A  four-part infortainment programme was televised in 1996,

and, in fact, for this year, there will be another series of  IT

TV  programmes over Channel 5 and Channel 8.  Another  programme

launched by NCB is to set up computer playgrounds.  So far,  six

computer  playgrounds  have  been  set  up  that  reach  out  to

children.  For the members of the public, now they can  even  go

to  community  centres and community clubs  to  have  access  to

computers.   Of  course,  this is only under  a  pilot  project.

There  are  only  two CCs involved.  If this  is  proven  to  be

successful, it can be implemented in other CCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming months, more programmes will be put in place

to  reach  out  to more people.  These include  a  permanent  IT

exhibition to be staged at the Singapore Science Centre from May

this  year.   It  will be a fun and interactive exhibition  that

will showcase the benefits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



of  IT in all aspects of our lives - at work, in school, at home

and in our recreation pursuits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another programme is a travelling IT coach. This is in

partnership with NTUC and industrial partners.  And this  is  to

promote IT literacy training and skills upgrading to workers  in

the  factories.  NCB also will be setting up more Singapore  One

clubs in community centres and selected libraries.  And NCB will

be holding more IT awareness seminars for members of the public,

together with the People's Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the questions raised by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Mr Rai on

the  promotion of the tourism industry, Sir, although we had 7.2

million  visitors  last year, it was a dip of 1.3%  compared  to

1996.   With the continued weakness in the regional economy  and

the  likely  return  of  the haze, the Singapore  Tourism  Board

expects  a further drop in tourist arrivals this year  by  about

10%.   Mrs  Lim  also  raised the haze problems  which  will  be

affecting  the  arrival  of  tourists.   The  Ministry  of   the

Environment  is  working closely with regional  counterparts  to

minimise  the  problem  or  to prevent  a  repeat  of  the  haze

situation  last year.  I think the Minister for the  Environment

will be elaborating on these measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the expected drop in tourist arrivals will reduce

STB's projected cess revenue for this year, and consequently its

resources available for tourist promotion.  However, in view  of

the need to maintain Singapore's presence in key tourist markets

and  to  compete effectively against regional destinations,  STB

will sustain the previous level of marketing effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to rationalise our promotional efforts

and  focus  on markets which show greater potential for  growth.

STB  has  made  a  strategic shift to  intensify  its  marketing

efforts in markets like the US, Europe, Australia, Taiwan, India

and China.  However, STB will remain engaged in markets that are

expected  to under-perform as a result of the regional financial

crisis, so that we are in a position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



to  attract  travellers from these countries when  they  recover

from the economic difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve better results, STB will work closely with

industrial  players.   It will continue to promote  key  tourism

events  like the Great Singapore Sale, Singapore Food  Festival,

etc.   In  addition,  STB will leverage  on  our  rich  cultural

heritage  to  attract visitors to Singapore.  For instance,  STB

has  packaged various year-end festivals into a three-month long

programme  called  Celebration Singapore.  This  programme  will

feature various ethnic festival light-ups as well as the popular

Chingay procession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the Tourism 21 blueprint, STB will also develop

the  culturally  and historically rich areas  around  Chinatown,

into  a  themed  tourism product.  Within  this  thematic  zone,

various cultural activities, like Chinese opera, will be staged.

I  can  assure  the  Members that STB will continue  to  monitor

developments  in  the  regional market and  will  come  in  with

additional measures to assist the industry, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Leong Horn Kee is concerned about the performance

of the retail industry.  The problems faced by the retail sector

stems  from both structural and cyclical factors.  These include

keen  competition  for  the  consumer  dollars,  slower  visitor

arrivals and spending by Singaporeans in regional economies as a

result  of  the  relatively stronger Singapore dollar.   Private

consumption  expenditure  may also  be  affected  this  year  as

Singaporeans  tighten  their  belts,  following  more   moderate

growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has put in place several assistance measures

to   overcome  the  retail  sector's  cyclical  and   structural

difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to help retailers affected by the drop in regional

tourists,  STB is intensifying its efforts in markets which  are

relatively unaffected, such as I mentioned just now ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we might run the risk of

getting  out  of  time again.  So can you try to  condense  your

reply?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> All right. The markets which are

relatively  unaffected  are USA, Europe, Australia,  Taiwan  and

China.   And  SIA and STB, in fact, will jointly  promote  these

markets, especially in Europe and US.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in view of the anticipated softer demand, the

Government has, in fact, substantially moderated the  supply  of

commercial space under this year's Government land sales.

Thirdly, the Government is pursuing various programmes to  raise

overall  structural  competitiveness of retailers  by  enhancing

retail  infrastructure, assisting in the upgrading of operations

and  facilitating  staff training.  For  the  more  domestically

oriented  retail  sector, the Government has several  assistance

schemes.     I  will  cite  a  few  examples,  like  encouraging

retailers to join franchises or form economic groupings  and  to

use  information  technology to help small  shops  improve  shop

management through the ShopNet and BookNet schemes.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the recently announced property tax rebate, the

Minister for Finance had already mentioned in his Budget  speech

that  HDB,  JTC and other Government agencies owning  properties

will  pass  on most of the property tax rebate to their  tenants

and we also want to encourage the private sector to do likewise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> It has been a long day for MTI. I just

want   to   thank  the  two  Ministers  and  also   the   Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary for their very detailed and  deliberate

answers,  especially  from Minister  George  Yeo  for  his  very

expansive discourse on cyberspace and IT technology.  If we ever

form the Ministry of IT or Cyberspace, I think you will know who

will  be  the best choice as Minister.  I beg leave to  withdraw

the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Rai.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, in view of the fact that other

Members  have  spoken on the matter, I do not think  I  want  to

speak.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Dr Toh See Kiat.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W of the Development

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code WK 5200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just a quick point on the approved cybertrader scheme.

The  scheme  presently  gives  tax incentives  to  international

players  that do offshore trade.  I believe that this scheme  is

good  but  I think we could do more, for example, to help  local

companies,  especially start-up companies, to do  e-commerce  so

that  Singapore can become an e-commerce hub.  This is important

because from the Silicon Valley experience which General Yeo has

mentioned, we see that a lot of brave young men and women,  some

might  say  brash young men and women, are the ones  that  start

these  companies.  But they do not have the money.  I  think  we

can  do  more for them in terms of tax incentives too.  That  is

what I want to say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your indulgence, Sir, since we do have time, can I go

back to my earlier topic?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I do not think we should

confuse   our   objectives.   The  purpose   of   the   approved

cybertrading  scheme is to encourage international operators  to

hub  in  Singapore.  Dr Toh is asking for schemes to help  local

high-tech entrepreneurs.  I think specific problems there should

be  addressed  specifically, and not use what  is  intended  for

different purposes to meet this particular purpose.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head O of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in just over a year, we will be in the 21st century.

That  does not make us centenarians of course, but at  least  we

can  say  we  cross the century line, and will soon witness  the

dawn  of a new era.  But if the past year is anything to go  by,

there  is not much to look forward to by the series of bad  news

and more bad news.  No one has foreseen that in the last lap  of

this  century,  it  will be such a tortuous  one  with  currency

turmoil  and  unprecedented economic downturn  for  the  region.

South  Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, amongst  others,

are much affected by the economic downturn.  And so are we.   It

is  a  new  and indeed unfamiliar phenomenon which  all  in  the

region are trying to fathom and cope.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this economic downturn is bound to alter the power

configuration and rewrite the strategic equation in the  region.

It  will  not be incremental changes, but fundamental shifts  in

paradigm, realignment and relationship.  In the midst  of  these

shifts, I would like to ask the Minister for his reading of  the

situation,  and how a small country like Singapore can  position

itself overcome the odds and survive and prosper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What may I ask are the roles of the United States, the

People's Republic of China and Japan in this new scenario?  Will

the  Americans retain their strategic and economic interests  in

the region?  I hope they will.  I would like to ask the Minister

whether  we will continue to offer the Americans access  to  our

naval  facilities in  Singapore.  Will the Japanese expand their

economic role?  What impact will the PRC have on this region?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to ask the Minister what positive role can

Singapore  play  in  this  region.  How  can  we  contribute  to

regional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



stability,  and what will be the role of ASEAN in the  midst  of

these changes, especially in the ASEAN Regional Forum?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, Singapore has for a long

time  preferred quiet diplomacy, sensitive to its size and other

countries'  sensitivities, particularly, our  ASEAN  neighbours.

But  we  know  that  in our own quiet ways, Singapore's  Foreign

Ministry has done much and achieved a lot relative to its  size.

However,  in  areas where we need to be vocal, for  example,  on

Indochina  in  the 1970s, the question of strategic  balance  of

power  and  the  interest  of small states,  we  have  made  our

presence felt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our diplomats have done Singapore proud. Prof. Tommy Koh

is  one  outstanding example.  Earlier this week, we read  about

Australia  complimenting our Prime Minister, Mr Goh  Chok  Tong,

for  his  role  to alleviate the problems brought about  by  the

regional currency and economic turmoil.  We also read about  how

and why the American President and other international financial

agencies sought the views and advice of our Singapore leaders on

the same issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that the full ramifications of the economic

turmoil  are  yet to unfold, let us not underestimate  the  role

Singapore can play and the favourable position in which  we  can

take  advantage  of  to  play  a constructive  role.   We  must,

however, continue to be sensitive as not to be misunderstood  as

exploiting   their  plight  and  hardship.   But  within   those

boundaries   of   sensitivity,  we   should   look   for   those

opportunities  to play that constructive role that  is  mutually

beneficial.  In the process, we should also strengthen our  base

and position, vis-a-vis our trading and business partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offer of the $5 billion credit backing to Indonesia is

one  example  of  an  initiative that  has  gained  us  enhanced

goodwill.   Although  the proposal is now  on  hold,  it  was  a

gesture   which  was  well-appreciated  and  considered  timely.

Singapore's strong reserves and potential as an investor will be

looked  upon as a source for help.  The MFA therefore  can  help

identify more such opportunities to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



enhance  Singapore's  active  foreign  policy  through  economic

imperatives.  The Malaysian Minister for Trade and Industry will

be  in  Singapore  on  Monday to woo our  investors.   I  expect

similar missions and efforts from other countries in the  region

to do likewise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see tremendous potential for Singapore to exercise

diplomacy  and  enhance foreign relations through  our  economic

strength and I hope MFA will continue to take advantage of  such

opportunities.  After all, Sir, our economic muscle can  be  put

to  bear  as  an equalising balm for enhanced international  and

regional relations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wang is not here. Mr Ravindran.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, last year was a non-vintage year,

if I may say so, in Singapore-Malaysia relations.  It was indeed

a difficult passage and a very rough patch in our relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year we are off to a better start. Leaders and

officials  of both countries have met on a number of  occasions.

I sincerely hope that this good trend will generate goodwill and

it  will yield good dividends.  But it is yet too early to  tell

whether  it will be a good year.  Nevertheless, we hope for  the

best and wish that both countries will enjoy prosperity together

as good neighbours in a win-win situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are glad that the Prime Ministers of Malaysia and

Singapore met in Kuala Lumpur on 16th February of this year  and

a joint communique was issued.  This communique covered, amongst

others,  economic  cooperation,  the  Malayan  Railway  land  in

Singapore  and Pedra Branca.  Most significant of all,  Malaysia

agreed  to continue the supply of water to Singapore beyond  the

expiry  of  the  1961 Agreement in the year 2011  and  the  1962

Agreement  in  the  year  2061 as well  as  the  1990  Agreement

connected with it, on terms and conditions to be mutually



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>



agreed between the two governments.  This understanding is to be

confirmed in an agreement within 60 days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister to give us an

update of Singapore-Malaysia relationship and also to comment on

the prospect for the future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, in the Budget debate last year, much

attention was paid to Singapore-Malaysia relations.  If  Members

will recall, that was a very difficult and trying period in  our

relations  with  the Malaysians.  However, leaders  of  the  two

countries  recognise  that Singapore  and  Malaysia  have  their

destinies  closely  intertwined.  At the  end  of  the  day,  we

recognise  that in the final analysis, the future well-being  of

the two countries is to a large extent dependent on each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One year has since passed and much has taken place. Events

in  recent months have affected both countries although  not  by

the   same   extent.   Invariably,  we  recognise  that   closer

cooperation between Singapore and Malaysia need not always be  a

win-lose situation.  But in many cases, we only win one.   I  am

happy  to  note that over last year, relations between Singapore

and  Malaysia have improved substantially.  The Prime  Ministers

of  both  countries have met and in a joint communique announced

that  they  are  looking  at possibilities  of  closer  business

cooperation.   And I am also happy to note that  the  Malaysians

have  assured us that they will not cut our water supply at  the

end of the present term of the Agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to give this House an

update of the bilateral ties between Singapore and Malaysia.

announcement that the new water agreement will be signed between

Singapore  and Malaysia in 60 days' time, I still  believe  that

the  bottom  line  in  the relationship  between  Singapore  and

Malaysia is water.

<br>6.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia has the water, we do not. I believe the main

object  of  Singapore-Malaysia relationship is to  obtain  water

supply  for Singapore on a permanent basis. It is true  that  we

can  get  our  water  supply from other  sources  such  as  from

Indonesia  and from desalination plants.  But there are  hazards

and the cost is much higher to get water from Indonesia and from

the  desalination plants.  I believe the best way to ensure  the

continuous flow of water from Malaysia to Singapore is to have a

very  close  relationship with Malaysia.  I believe the  closest

relationship  we can have with Malaysia is to form  an  economic

union  with Malaysia.  This is not a new idea.  Singapore formed

a  political  union,  which included  an  economic  union,  with

Malaysia  in 1963, but it failed.  An economic union  is  not  a

political union.  In a political union, Singapore has to give up

its  sovereignty.  But in an economic union, our sovereignty  is

still intact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not proposing an economic union so that Singapore can

get  richer.  If we have this intention in mind, I do not  think

that  the  Malaysians  would want to have  such  a  union.   The

economic union must be for the mutual benefit of both countries.

Eventually, we hope that Malaysia can be as rich as us, so  that

the  element of envy, now harboured by many Malaysians,  can  be

removed  once and for all.  I believe  only then that  Singapore

can  ensure  of a permanent supply of water without  paying  too

high a price for it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, when we met in this House

for  the  budget  debate  in  July last  year,  we  debated  the

relations  between Singapore and Malaysia.  Both countries  were

still  smarting from a few months of bad patch in our  bilateral

relations.  It has since improved.  Since the end of last  year,

Prime  Minister Goh Chok Tong has met his Malaysian counterpart,

Dr Mahathir Mohamed, four times.  There have been meetings among

Ministers  and  officials, military exercises  and  games  among

government officials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the second link between Singapore and Johor was

opened.  It was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



opened to traffic not long after we faced problems, and probably

the longest period of traffic jam problem on the Causeway at the

end  of  last  year, arising from the implementation  of  a  new

Malaysian  customs check on lorries.   I hope we can  truly  put

such  a problem behind us and will not let it recur because  any

hiccup in bilateral relations such as the one manifested by  the

Causeway jam, it is the people, the businessmen and the ordinary

citizens who are affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been saying that we would like to see a long-term relationship with Malaysia that is based on mutual respect,

mutual  benefit and reciprocity.  We have to hope for  the  best

and  work  towards  it.   Although, realistically,  being  close

neighbours, problems may emerge from time to time.   Both  sides

must   continue  to  work  hard  to  strengthen  our   bilateral

relations,  and grab every opportunity to strengthen  our  close

bilateral ties while pursuing our respective national interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note the remark made by a Malaysian

Deputy  Minister that the regional economic turmoil has  brought

both  countries closer together.  Like Mr Sin Boon Ann, I  would

like  to ask the Minister to update Members on the progress that

has   been  made  in  our  bilateral  ties  with  Malaysia,   in

particular,  how  are  we cooperating with Malaysia  to  jointly

tackle problems arising from the current regional financial  and

economic crisis.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore-Indonesia relations have

been  close  and  warm ever since President  Suharto  came  into

office.   We all know that President Suharto is indeed a  friend

of  Singapore.  Indonesia has played a pivotal role in ASEAN and

President Suharto has a moderating and positive influence on the

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the moment, Indonesia is beset with economic

problems  and subject to wide currency fluctuations.   Singapore

has been quick in responding to Indonesia's needs with financial

packages  and wishing all the best for Indonesia.  We know  that

whatever happens to Indonesia, it will have an impact on  us  in

Singapore.  We want a successful and prosperous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



Indonesia  with a prosper-thy-neighbour approach, with Indonesia

and  Singapore  working  closely within ASEAN,  to  bring  about

stability  and prosperity in our own region.  I would  therefore

like  to  ask  the Minister for his reading of the situation  in

Indonesia and the region, and how best we can help Indonesia  to

overcome these problems.  And how all these will have an  impact

on  the  bilateral relationship between Singapore and  Indonesia

and also on the region.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the recent financial crisis has

taught  a  number of lessons.  In an increasingly interdependent

world,  what  affects our neighbours may have an impact  on  us.

Singaporeans  must  realise this.  We should  not  just  confine

ourselves to the well-being of our country without, at the  same

time,  being  concerned  for  what is  happening  in  the  other

countries  in the region.  Because the countries in  the  region

are  so  closely tied together, we must recognise that  regional

well-being is as important as national welfare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a region that is caught up with the turmoil of events,

investors' confidence would, to some extent, be affected.   This

lack  of confidence may at some point of time affect us locally.

Unless we do our part to restore regional confidence, we are not

essentially  helping  ourselves because regional  confidence  is

closely linked to our economic well-being as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia's problems must be resolved by Indonesians

themselves.   However, we must understand  that  the  impact  of

their  sovereign decisions would be largely felt by all  in  the

region,  not  just financially and economically but socially  as

well.  We can only hope that in the name of national resilience,

the  Indonesians  will work quickly towards strengthening  their

internal  unity  and solving their problems.  We must  recognise

that  at  this  moment  in time, there is a  need  for  regional

solidarity  within ASEAN.  As a small country, we  must  do  our

part  in helping our neighbours as much as we can.  We certainly

hope  that confidence can return soon to Indonesia and  to  this

region after the election and once reforms have been implemented

according to plans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is truly an urgency for Indonesians to reunite and to

get  back to work to put their economy together, so as to  boost

internal  and  external confidence for recovery.  I  have  every

confidence  that  the  Indonesian  people  will  overcome   this

difficulty and forge ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether the

Government  is  contemplating  further  measures  to  help   the

Indonesians at this moment.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir,

may  I suggest that we allow the other Members to speak on their

amendments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right. Dr Ong.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, last year, Cambodia almost became a

part  of  ASEAN,  but it was not to be.  By  a  twist  of  fate,

Cambodia's membership in ASEAN was held back.  Much has happened

since  then  in  Cambodia.  I would like  to  ask  the  Minister

whether  the  situation in Cambodia has stabilised, and  whether

ASEAN  will  review  and consider Cambodia  for  admission  into

ASEAN.   And  whether Singapore businessmen have  a  significant

presence in Cambodia, and how such presence can be nurtured  and

promoted for mutual benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I go on to my next topic?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Thank you, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the post-World War II era, we often talk about US-Europe

and US-Asia Pacific relationships but, surprisingly, less of the

Asia-Europe  relationship, though many countries in  the  region

have  strong ties with their former colonial masters in  Europe.

This missing link or gap was closed with the inauguration of the

Asia- Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Bangkok in March 1996.  This ASEM

was very much a Singapore initiative with our Prime Minister, Mr

Goh Chok Tong, as the driving force behind it.  Since then, ASEM

has  sprouted  forth a host of other entities,  like  the  Asia-Europe Business Forum, Asia-Europe Business Conference and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



most promising of all, the Asia-Europe Foundation.  I would like

to  ask  the  Minister  whether  this  flurry  of  meetings  and

conferences is a passing fad and phenomenon, or will they  blaze

the  trail for the fruitful relationship between Europe and Asia

in  the  long  run.   Are the Europeans seriously,  may  I  ask,

interested in playing a meaningful role in Asia and in  engaging

Asia?

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the Asia-Europe Meeting

was  an initiative of our Prime Minister.  The first meeting  in

Bangkok was a success, and the next meeting will be held in  the

United Kingdom next month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Europe and Asia are important to each other. Europe

has huge financial and economic interests in Asia.  In 1996, the

EU  exported US$123 billion worth of goods and services to  East

Asia,  more than the United States.  The involvement of European

banks in Asia amounted to more than US$350 billion, even greater

than   that  of  the  US  and  Japanese  banks  added  together.

Similarly,  Asia's  exports to Europe have  increased  over  the

years.   Many Asian countries have also invested large  sums  in

Europe.  However, the recent economic turmoil in Asia  has  made

many  people  in  Europe sanguine.  The economic  problems  have

affected the Europeans to some extent.  It clearly shows that in

the  new  interconnected  global  economy,  every  one  will  be

affected by regional economic problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern is whether Europe will continue to take a

greater  interest  in Asia, in particular,  in  Southeast  Asian

nations.  We need to assure that the Asian ship is still buoyant

and  steady.  We must ensure that Europe places great importance

in Asia and continues to increase its links.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their credit, some of the European countries have

extended help to Asia through the IMF and on a bilateral  basis.

I think they could do more both on a multi-lateral and bilateral

basis.    I  hope more countries in Europe can be  persuaded  to

participate in the trade financing scheme proposed by our  Prime

Minister for Indonesia.  I urge the Ministry to ensure that  the

Asian economic crisis is put on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>



top  of  the  upcoming ASEM II meeting in London.  I would  also

urge  the  Ministry to ensure that the environmental problem  in

the region is put on the top priority list for discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent depreciation of the Asian currencies has

also  meant cheaper exports from these ASEAN countries.  I  hope

the  Ministry will urge the Europeans to keep their markets open

to  cheaper products from the affected Asian economies, and  not

impose  barriers.  It is equally important that Europe be  urged

to  increase  its  investment in Asia to speed up  the  recovery

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Ministry will work hard to ensure that ASEM

II comes out with concrete ideas and programmes to help Asia out

of its economic problems.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, despite much criticism and doubts

and  there  are  many,  the  United Nations  have  expanded  and

fulfilled to a significant extent its role as a recognised world-wide  forum for countries, big and small.  It has weathered many

storms  and crises, the most recent of which is the Gulf crisis.

The  United  Nations certainly do not meet all our expectations,

but there is none to replace it in the post-cold war world.   As

a  small country, Singapore certainly finds it very useful to be

represented at the United Nations.  We are indeed bidding for  a

seat on the UN Security Council for the year 2001. A seat on the

UN  Security  Council, I believe, would give us, especially  our

diplomats, an excellent opportunity to learn and appreciate  the

workings of the UN Security Council.



<br>6.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister on the latest in

our campaign for such a seat on the UN Security Council and what

do  other  nations think of Singapore's role in the UN  and  its

affiliated bodies.  Will it mean that we will play a more active

role in the UN?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, a financial tornado has built up and

ripped  through  the  region,  causing  untold  damage  to   the

economies  and  the lives of the people.  The  region  is  still

counting the cost and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



the  storm has not fully subsided.  Much uncertainty remains and

further damage could still occur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is very prudent. We have an honest, hardworking

and rational system.  Our economic fundamentals are sound by any

standard.  We have sufficient reserve to cover our currency many

times  over,  yet we are affected by the regional  economic  and

financial crisis.  The sad aspect of the crisis is that  it  was

unnecessary.   It  was  not that we lack the  knowledge  of  the

genesis  of such financial tornadoes and can therefore claim  to

be  surprised by the event.  The writing was on the wall  for  a

long  time.  The painful experience of the burst of the Japanese

property bubble remains clear in our mind and the effects of  it

remain till today.  We have seen it happen also in Mexico,  just

a few short years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is growing smaller, more inter-linked. As

neighbours, what can we do to share our concerns, especially  in

matters  that affect us?  Do we have the means or the mechanisms

to  convey  our  concerns without being accused of  interfering,

without  incurring their wrath, without being  scolded?   If  no

such  mechanisms  exist, then is it time that they  be  created?

Unless something is done urgently, otherwise every few years  we

will  find  our  follies repeated with much pain, suffering  and

anguish to our people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rai, you can take your two amendment

together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Much obliged, Sir. Singapore being a

small  country, we cannot have the luxury of having a very heavy

diplomatic establishment.  But the least we could do is to  have

friends  all  over the world and I would urge  the  Minister  to

consider   maintaining  new  diplomatic  relations,  say,   with

countries with which we do not have so far.  This would at least

be  an  opening  for  us  to go into these  countries  when  the

opportunity  arises.   Many  of these countries,  especially  in

Latin  America, are potential opportunities for us.  The example

of Mexico is very clear to us how we have in a short while built

up the relationship.  I think it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



in  the interest of Singapore, like Switzerland, to have as many

friends  all over the world.  And when we should apply  for  the

United  Nations' seat in the Security Council, at least we  will

have support from the other countries as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to touch on is Roving

Ambassador or non-resident Ambassador.  As I have said  earlier,

we  do  not  have a very rich history of foreign relations.   We

just started from 1965.  But it is a credit to the Minister  and

his  officials that we have at least maintained diplomatic ties.

If  we  cannot  afford to have an ambassador  resident  in  that

country,  at  least  we  try to have ambassadors  who  are  non-resident  in countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran and  Latin

American  countries.   I would urge the business  community  and

senior  professionals who can afford it to opt, when  approached

by  the  Government, to represent Singapore. This is  the  least

they  could  do  for  the country.  Of course,  the   Government

cannot afford to pay them an allowance which probably they  will

get  elsewhere.  Nevertheless, it is an honour and  prestige  to

represent  one's  country.   So I would  urge  the  Minister  to

persuade  as many people as possible to represent Singapore  and

also  to  see  whether in those countries  where  we  have  non-resident  ambassadors there is a need now  to  upgrade  them  to

resident ambassadors.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank the Members who have spoken.

I  hope they will forgive me if I respond not necessarily in the

order  in  which the points have been raised, but  it  does  not

reflect in any way on the importance of the points. But I  think

it may be more convenient for me to respond in this manner so as

not  to  risk being cut by the "guillotine" in the midst  of  my

developing answers on some other topics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose therefore to start by responding to Dr Ong Chit

Chung who asked my views on the changing strategic situation  in

Asia.  Sir, since July 1997, which was when we discussed foreign

affairs in the Committee of Supply last,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>



I  would  say that the situation in our Asia-Pacific region  has

been  marred  and marked by the regional financial crisis  which

has  really  exacted a very heavy toll on most  Southeast  Asian

countries.  Having said that, let me add that not all  the  news

has  been  bad  in the sense that there have been some  positive

developments on other fronts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The triangular relationships, for example, between the

United  States, China and Japan, have stabilised and  show  some

signs  of  improvement.  Over the last six months, we  have,  in

fact,  witnessed high level exchanges amongst leaders  of  these

three  major  powers and also visits to and  from  Russia.   For

example,  when  we  look  at the United States-China  relations,

President Jiang's visit to the United States in October/November

last year was a first in 12 years by a Chinese Head of State and

is  regarded as signalling the normalisation and enhancement  of

United  States and China relations.  Both sides, of  course,  do

seem  to  have important differences, but they seem  willing  to

engage  one  another  and thus provide a  more  predictable  and

stable  relationship for themselves, which in turn  augurs  well

for this region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for China-Japan relations, here also, we have to note

the exchanges of visits by Prime Minister Hashimoto to China  in

September  1997  and Premier Li Peng to Japan in November  1997,

which have together stabilised Sino-Japan relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for US-Japan relations, the other side of the triangle,

United  States-Japan relationship does continue  to  remain  the

most  stable among the regional powers.  Although there will  be

from  time to time economic friction, both sides have shown that

they  can  continue  to cooperate closely, particularly  in  the

context of the Security Alliance Understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Russia, we have to note that there have also been

high profile exchanges of visits involving Russia.  For example,

President  Yeltsin visited China in November,  Premier  Li  Peng

visited  Russia and Prime Minister Hashimoto visited  Russia  in

November 1997.  We are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



told  that  the  Summit between President Yeltsin and  President

Jiang is scheduled for later this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the strategic triangle of United States, China and Japan

continues, in our view, to be the foundation of stability in the

Asia-Pacific region, I think Members will appreciate that it  is

in  Singapore's interest to see that the three major powers  and

players   are  constructively  engaged  and  their  relationship

strengthened.  This will ensure a stable and peaceful balance of

power in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the other encouraging signs in the strategic

environment?  They include the revision of the US-Japan  Defence

Guidelines which has reaffirmed the United States' commitment to

the  security  in the region.  Second,, cross-straits  relations

appear to have stabilised and with some positive signs that both

sides  are preparing for the resumption of dialogue in the  near

future.  Third, prospects in the Korean Peninsula appear to have

improved  with the DPRK agreeing to take part in the  Four-Party

talks.   The preliminary meeting was held in Geneva in  December

1997 and is to be followed up by a second preliminary meeting in

March   1998  in  Geneva.   Fourth,  in  the  South  China   Sea

territorial  disputes, always a cause of concern  in  the  sense

that  it is a potential flash point, we are glad that there  has

been  no  escalation  of tensions since we last  discussed  that

matter  in  this House.  Fifth, I would add that the  successful

demarcation  of the Eastern China-Russia border declared  during

President Yeltsin's visit in November 1997 is a factor that  has

helped the general stability in the region.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung asked:</b> will the United States retain its

strategic and economic interest?  Will we continue to be helpful

in  affording access to the United States?  I think we  can  say

that  the  United  States has historically played  an  important

strategic  role in Asia-Pacific, including Southeast Asia.   The

United  States  also  has  an extensive  network  of  trade  and

investment  linkages in the region.  We are confident  that  the

United States will continue to remain engaged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



in  the  region.  I say so because, in our discussions with  the

United  States'  leaders and their public  pronouncements,  they

have recently reiterated their strong commitment to the presence

in  the region which, Dr Ong and other Members would have noted,

also  included  visits by key Cabinet members from  the  Clinton

administration, including Defence Secretary, William  Cohen  and

Commerce  Secretary,  William Daley.  Singapore's  position  has

always  been to welcome and encourage United States' involvement

and   presence  in  this  region.   Within  the  extent  of  our

resources, Members also know that we have facilitated  this  and

we  will continue to do what we can to be helpful to the  United

States to maintain its presence in the Asia-Pacific region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having painted this situation of positive factors in the

broad  strategic situation, let me hasten to add that we  cannot

be lulled into complacency.  The benign, even positive, security

and  geo-political  environment can  deteriorate  very  quickly.

Witness  what happened last year with the unforeseen  events  in

Cambodia.  The economic crisis which descended on the region  is

another strong reminder to flag this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how this will affect the political equilibrium in the

region,  a question which Dr Ong posed, I would say a lot  would

depend on how the Asian countries perceive the help rendered  by

the  western countries.  If the United States, the EU and  other

players continue to be involved to assist in a positive way, and

the  region  is  able  to emerge through the  crisis,  and  they

recognise  the assistance and help and the signals of confidence

given  by  these  countries, the political equilibrium  will,  I

believe,  remain  unchanged.  Relations may  even  be  stronger.

Everyone  will  benefit.  However, if they cannot  get  off  the

current  turmoil, and they conclude that the help given  by  the

west   is  inadequate  then,  of  course,  there  could   be   a

reassessment  and perceptions may change.  But I would  say,  in

response  to  Dr Ong's specific question that things  are  still

fluid,  and I would also say that it is too early to say whether

the political equilibrium will be affected.  At



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



the  end  of  the  day,  what is the lesson  to  be  learnt  for

Singapore?  I would say the lesson for us is that we really have

to be prepared for sudden strategic shifts.  As a small country,

we  will have to remain alert, nimble and sufficiently agile  to

be  able to adjust to changing trends and turbulent times in the

region.



<br>6.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have your permission, Sir, I would now like to respond

to Dr Ong Chit Chung's comments and questions on Cambodia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to his comments, I would say that since we last

discussed in this House last year, the developments in  Cambodia

include, firstly, progress in the preparations for the elections

scheduled  in July this year; secondly, the return of opposition

National  Assembly  members  to  Cambodia;  and,  thirdly,   the

declaration  of ceasefire.  But here also the situation  remains

rather fluid and unpredictable.  The ongoing disputes concerning

the  question of Prince Ranariddh remains unresolved.  This  may

cast a shadow over efforts of the Cambodian government to create

conditions  that  will be conducive to free and fair  elections.

And  I think it remains to be seen whether the recent initiative

of   Japan   would  be  successful  in  breaking  the   impasse.

Meanwhile,  ASEAN  and the international community  continue  to

call on the Cambodian government to ensure that all parties  and

personalities would be permitted to contest in the elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, ASEAN has really tried sincerely to

contribute  to  the  resurrection  of  political  stability   in

Cambodia  and,  more  recently,  because  nine  members  meeting

frequently  is  not  really practical, we have  established  the

ASEAN troika.  And through the troika we have been liaising with

the  Cambodian parties involved in the Cambodian  situation.   I

must  say  that Mr Hun Sen's sharp criticisms of  ASEAN  and  of

individual ASEAN countries have once again raised some questions

about his attitude and receptiveness on the role



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



of  ASEAN.  For example, on 13th January 1998, he was quoted  in

the  Cambodian Daily as saying, and I quote, "I am not a  member

of  ASEAN.   I  need no troika delegation at all.   Please,  all

ASEAN countries, be aware of this."  In the same report, Mr  Hun

Sen  also referred to Indonesia, Thailand and Myanmar in  rather

unflattering  terms.  Such statements, to say  the  least,  have

puzzled  some in ASEAN.  But despite these negative  statements,

ASEAN  continues  to uphold the principle that countries  should

not  bring  about a change of government through violent  means,

and  the  policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs  of

another country is also upheld by ASEAN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The admission of Cambodia into ASEAN will therefore be

considered only after free and fair elections are held and  when

circumstances in Cambodia enable the country to fully assume the

rights and duties of ASEAN's membership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage the conduct of free and fair elections this

July in Cambodia, the UN has agreed, in principle, to coordinate

international observers at the elections.  We in Singapore  have

not  received  any  formal  requests from  the  United  Nations,

although  I  understand  it has informally  asked  a  number  of

countries,  including  ASEAN members,  to  contribute  electoral

monitors.   We  have  to  carefully  consider  whether  to  send

electoral monitors within our limited resources when the  UN  or

the Cambodian government makes an official request.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I respond now, Sir, to the comments made by Dr Ong and

others  on  the  Asia-Europe Meeting.  As Members  will  recall,

before  the Asia-Europe I (ASEM I), Asia-Europe relations lacked

a  multilateral and regularly held forum.  There  was  only  the

ASEAN-EU   Dialogue.   ASEAN-EU  Dialogue  is  a   bloc-to-bloc,

organisation to organisation dialogue.  And apart from  the  UN,

there  is  no  other  forum  for Asian  and  European  heads  of

government  to  meet regularly, say, once in two  years.   Asia-Europe  Meeting  (ASEM)  now affords the opportunity  for  these

leaders  to meet and discuss issues of common concern.  ASEM  II

meeting in London, in the first week of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



April,  will take place, as was pointed out, against a  backdrop

of the financial crisis in Asia.  The EMU which is scheduled for

implementation in January 1999, and the eastward expansion, will

absorb  much  of EU's energies and attention for  some  time  to

come.   We know that.  ASEM II will have to discuss among  other

issues  how we can devise ways and means to sustain and  advance

the  ASEM  process and to keep the Europeans interested  in  the

process, and interested in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major issue, yes, is the financial crisis, and

Singapore  hopes  that  ASEM II will  come  out  with  a  strong

statement  of  confidence in Asia's efforts  to  deal  with  the

financial  crisis.   We believe that Europe can  send  a  strong

political  signal  to the rest of the world, a  signal  that  it

continues to have confidence in Asia's economic potential and is

ready  to help with the financial crisis.  At the same time,  it

is  also  in  the  interest of the affected Asian  countries  to

reaffirm  their  commitment  to  implement  the  difficult   and

necessary reforms.  Through their engagement in ASEM, I  believe

Asia and Europe can also send a strong message that despite each

other's  internal preoccupations - Europe has its  preoccupation

and  Asia  has  our  own preoccupations -  both  regions  remain

outward looking and are strongly committed to multilateral trade

and investment liberalisation.  I believe such a signal strongly

sent would help to boost market confidence in the region and, in

that respect, I hope that European ASEM members will support the

ASEM  partners'  proposals  for  a  separate  statement  of  the

financial crisis.  In fact, the Asian side has proposed  to  the

Europeans that instead of the normal Chairman's statement, which

will   be  issued,  there  ought  to  be  a  separate  statement

addressing  only  the  financial  crisis.   We  hope  that   the

Europeans will agree to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to sustaining the ASEM process, we think it should be

sustained  and  advanced.  Dr Ong Chit Chung asked  whether  all

this  flurry  of  activities  is a  passing  phenomenon  or  the

beginning of a fruitful relationship.  I believe that  the  ASEM

process should be seen in the long term perspective.  And  I  do

not think it is a passing phenomenon.  Certainly from my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



discussions  with Foreign Ministers on both sides,  there  is  a

clear   appreciation  that  this  relationship  has   tremendous

potential.   Apart from the leaders' meeting, the  ASEM  Foreign

Ministers  have  met; the Finance Ministers have  met;  and  the

Economic  Ministers  have also their  own  meetings.   In  other

words,  it has become a multi-faceted process, not just a  flash

in  a  pan  meeting  of Heads of Government,  and  nothing  else

happens  in  two  years.  And Dr Ong Chit Chung will  know  that

important   projects  have  emerged  such  as  the   Asia-Europe

Foundation  which  has taken place.  The  process  is  not  just

limited to the politicians.  Because the private sector has also

met,  business forums have taken place.  Under ASEM, there  have

been  meetings  of journalists and editors.  So it  cuts  across

many areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Dr Ong Chit Chung's questions as to whether

the  Europeans  are really interested, I have  no  doubt  and  I

believe  the Europeans are interested and continue  to  have  an

interest  in  a  meaningful role in Asia.  I  believe  they  are

committed  to building the bilateral and multilateral  relations

with  Asia,  despite their preoccupation with internal  matters,

like  the  EMU,  EU expansion, unemployment, and other  economic

problems.  I think Europe still perceives Asia to be a region of

potential, notwithstanding the financial crisis.  The Europeans'

commitment to ASEM, therefore, will be a clear manifestation  of

their  interest  to  develop a mutually beneficial  relationship

with Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked by Mr Ravindran whether the financial crisis

will be given priority.  Indeed, I think the expectation on both

sides  is, yes, it will have high priority.  As to whether other

matters  like environmental matters will be discussed, I believe

it  is  also  on the agenda and is flagged as one of the  issues

where Asia and Europe can cooperate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now would like your permission, Sir, to respond to Dr Ong

Chit  Chung's comments on the United Nations.  He is right  that

the  lack  of  resources, on the part of Singapore,  limits  our

representations in many places in the world.  Our  participation

in the UN, therefore, gives us an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



opportunity to have contact with and profile ourselves to  other

parts of the world.  Together with our participation in the  UN,

the Group of 77, the Non-Aligned Group, it helps to maintain our

links  with  many other countries, and it touches on the  points

raised  by Mr Shriniwas Rai, with whom we do not have diplomatic

missions or consular missions in their countries or they do  not

have diplomatic missions in our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are a small country, we have been rather selective on

the  issues in which we have concentrated our efforts to profile

Singapore  as a responsible member at the UN.  There are  issues

in which we have selected on the basis of whether we can make  a

contribution in that particular topic.  The Law of the Sea is  a

clear  example  of where we were able to contribute.   Not  much

publicised, we also have our legal experts on organisations like

United Nations' Commission of International Trade Law where they

have made a very good contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had asked: how do other countries think about us. I

think   it  would  be  rather  self-serving  for  me   to   make

complimentary remarks about our own diplomats.  But let  me  say

with  some humility that over the past 30 years, because of hard

work and commitment put in by our excellent diplomats at the UN,

we   have  gained  a  certain  reputation  for  responsible  and

constructive contributions.  And I hope that we will be able  to

maintain that reputation at the UN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To demonstrate our support for the UN, we have stepped up

our involvement in activities which are consistent with our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



interests  and  which will enable us to gain as  much  political

mileage  as  possible.  For example, in May 1997, Singapore  was

one  of  a  handful of seven countries to sign a  Memorandum  of

Understanding  with the United Nations on standby  arrangements.

This is the provision of observers, officers, medical personnel,

as  well as helicopters and transport craft standby arrangement,

on  standby  for UN peacekeeping operations.  I think  it  is  a

modest contribution, but a contribution that is noted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also sent, as I said, high calibre delegates to the

various   UN  committees.   Other  than  the  Law  of  the   Sea

Conference, we played a constructive leadership role in  the  UN

Conference  on Environment and Development, and we  continue  to

play a key role in ongoing discussions in the UN, such as on  UN

reform,  particularly  on  the  expansion  of  the  UN  Security

Council.
