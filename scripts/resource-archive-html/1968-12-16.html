Singapore  is adequate for the Republic's  commercial

and industrial needs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, due to the

unfortunate  limited capacity of the  existing  manual

telex   switchboards  and  the  current  shortage   of

teleprinters and associated equipment, it has not been

possible to provide applicants for telex service  with

immediate  connection. In fact, there is at present  a

waiting list of 42 potential telex subscribers and  it

is  likely  that  this  list  may  become  larger.  In

addition,  there are 21 subscribers now using  limited

service   with  machines,  not  equipped  with   tape-

perforation facilities, who have requested  that  they

be   supplied   with   machines  incorporating   these

facilities  which we are, unfortunately, not  able  to

meet because of the present shortage of teleprinters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is anticipated, however, that the 42 potential

subscribers will be given service by May of next year,

that  is, six months from now, when additional  manual

switchboards  and  teleprinter equipment,  which  have

been ordered by the Telecommunications Department, are

expected  to  be ready for service. It  will  also  be

possible  then  to provide some of the 21  subscribers

with tape-perforation facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may also add that provision has been made in the

Departmental Development Estimates for next  year  for

the  purchase  and installation of an Automatic  Telex

Exchange  at an estimated cost of $600,000 and  it  is

anticipated  that  the equipment  will  be  ready  for

service   in  1970.  This  equipment,  together   with

teleprinters  and associated equipment  for  which  an

additional sum of $1 million has been budgeted in next

year's   Development  Estimates,  will   ensure   that

existing  subscribers will be given a fully  automatic

telex  service and ample capacity for the  anticipated

growth in the immediate future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Anson  is  no doubt aware that the Port of  Singapore

Authority  employs  a  very  large  work   force   of

approximately  9,000 persons, and  since  the  smooth

operation  of  our port activities is  vital  to  the

economic weIl.being of Singapore, it follows that the

P.S.A, must make a careful assessment so  that  only

persons  of  reasonably good character and  integrity

are recruited into its service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incorrect to say that all applicants with

criminal  convictions are being rejected outright  by

the  P.S.A.  As  a  matter of fact,  since  1966,  62

persons  with  minor  offences and  16  persons  with

criminal   records   have   been   recruited,   after

satj~fying  the  P.S.A, that they had  indeed  turned

over a new leaf.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, it has been the policy of

our  Registrar of Vehicles Department for some  years

not  to permit second-hand and obsolete buses  to  be

registered  for  use  as  public  service   vehicles.

Unfortunately, it is on record that seven  old  buses

which  were  purchased by a certain bus company  from

another  bus  company were approved for  registration

for use as public service vehicles early in 1966. But

when this was discovered after an investigation,  the

senior official responsible for approving these cases

was  retired  from service in the public interest  in

August  1966. The buses concerned are still  in  use,

subject to half-yearly mechanical inspections  as  to

their roadworthiness.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> In October 1968, all bus companies

were  asked and have agreed to install bins for  used

tickets  in  their buses. Many of the  buses  already

have such bins. There may be a few bus companies  who

have not installed them, in which case by March 1969,

that  is four months from now, when they do come  for

the  half-year  inspection and  they  still  fail  to

provide  litter  bins, their buses  will  not  be  re-

contemplate legislation for the compulsory wearing  of

adequate  supply  of approved types of  crash  helmets

and, what is important, at reasonable prices available

in   Singapore  has  yet  to  be  determined.  In  the

meantime, we will continue to encourage riders to wear

crash   helmets  voluntarily  to  protect   themselves

against fatal accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong will recall that in August

this  year I appointed a Transport Advisory Board with

very  wide terms of reference to study ways and  means

on  how  to  improve the public transport  service  of

Singapore.  One  of  the  members  of  the   Transport

Advisory  Board  is representing the  National  Safety

First  Council  of  Singapore,  which  body  has  been

strongly  advocating  the  compulsory  use  of   crash

helmets. He has been advised to raise this subject for

consideration  by the Transport Advisory  Board.  When

this   'Board  is  in  a  position  to  submit   their

recommendations on the subject, I will be in a  better

position to reply to the question now posed by the hon

the  larger  types of aircraft that will  be  put

into   service  through  Singapore  in  the  near

future.  In  addition, there is  re-surfacing  of

the entire length of the runway to strengthen  it

for  heavier aircraft like the Boeing 747 (better

known   as  the  Jumbo  jet).  This  project   is

scheduled  for completion by the middle  of  next

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Installation of a Radar Training Simulator in

the  Departmental Training School which  will  be

completed before the end of the current year;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) An instrument landing system has been

contracted for and is scheduled for operation  by

August 1969;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) An existing hangar is being modified for the

use  of  the  Boeing  737 of Malaysia/  Singapore

Airlines.  There  will be  five  coming  by  next

year.  And the hangar is scheduled for completion

by  the  end  of January 1969, i.e.,  two  months

from now;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) A new High Capacity Foam Tender has been ordered

and is due for delivery in 1969;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Land has been acquired and a site prepared for

the  installation  of approach lighting  for  the

<div align="center"><b>OIL POLLUTION OF SEA-WATERS AROUND SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Lim Soo Peng</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  whether investigations  indicate  that

oil pollution of the sea-waters around Singapore is to

a  great extent caused by oil tankers and other ships;

and,  with the increase in the number of such  vessels

calling at Singapore, what steps have been or will  be

taken  to  minimise such oil pollution and  make  more

beaches,  free  of  oil pollution,  available  to  the

public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, investigations,

unfortunately,  do  indicate that the  increasing  oil

pollution  of  the  sea-waters  around  Singapore   is

related to the increase in the number of ships calling

here,  in view of the almost universal use of  oil  as

fuel  for  ships. For the month of November 1968,  the

average daily number of ships anchored in the Port  of

Singapore was over 200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oil pollution arises in the following ways:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) From accumulated accidental spillage,

particularly  during bunker  operations,  which

can   reach  large  proportions,  and   it   is

difficult   to   control  such   offences,   as

offenders must be caught in the act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Oil which has been discharged by ships outside

our territorial waters and is then carried into

Singapore shores, by the action of the wind and

tide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Damaged ships, leaking oil, which come to

Singapore for repairs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Oil refineries (we have quite a number of them

around), and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Ship repair yards. They make the money, hut

also pollute our shores.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers of the Port of Singapore Authority do carry

out  sea  patrols, in the course of which a  watch  is

being  kept  for  cases  of oil pollution.  Helicopter

pilots  of  the  Royal Air Force  also  co-operate  by

reporting any incident they observe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to September 1968, only warnings were given to

the  offenders.  Since then however,  seven  summonses

have  been issued against offenders, two of which have

resulted  in court fines of $75 each, while the  other

five cases are still pending.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Port of Singapore Authority is also

constructing  a  special vessel to skim  floating  oil

from the surface of the sea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Madam

Chan Choy Siong ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. To ask the Minister for Social Affairs whether

he  will  consider extending the services  of  creches

till late evening to enable working women to have more

time for participation in community activities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> The creche service has been set

up  primarily  to meet the needs of working  women  in

providing a proper place for the care of their  infant

children (under six years old) when they are at  work.

As such, the 10 creches operated by the Social Welfare

Department  are open from 7 am, to 5 p.m, on  weekdays

and from 7 am, to 1 p.m, on Saturdays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although extending the services of the creches to

late  evening  would help some working women  to  have

more  time  for participation in community activities,

this  will definitely not be in the interests  of  the

children themselves. It is a well-known fact that  for

the  proper growth and development of infants,  it  is

essential  that  they spend as much time  as  possible

with  their  parents, brothers and sisters  from  whom

they  will  receive  and can express  their  love  and

affection.   Since  under  the  existing   arrangement

children  attending creches will be  away  from  their

homes  for  as much as 10 hours a day on weekdays  and

six hours a day on Saturdays, any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



extension  of  these  hours to late  evening  will  be

undesirable, as it would mean that the children  would

be  spending  all their waking hours at  the  creches,

leaving little or no time with their parents and other

members of the family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, the Ministry considers it

inadvisable  to extend the services of creches  beyond

the hours as provided at present.

given public assistance and the total amount paid out;

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> From 1st January to 31st October, 1968, a

average  family on public assistance consists of  five

persons.  Working  on this basis, a total  of  838,760

persons,  on the average of 83,876 persons per  month,

has been given public assistance during this period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st January to 31st October, 1968, a total of

3,104   families  have  had  their  public  assistance

family, approximately 15,520 persons, or an average of

1,552   persons  per  month,  have  had  their  public

assistance  terminated.  The  main  reasons  for   the

termination of public assistance to the 3,104 families

for  the period 1st January to 31st October, 1968  are

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head of a family having found employment; wife

having  found employment; children having found employment;   family  having  secured  a  school  tuck-shop:

<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the House rose

for  the adjournment last Friday night, I was  on  the

point of answering questions which were raised by  the

Members  for Delta, Crawford and Ulu Pandan concerning

our  international relations and our  foreign  affairs

policy.  The  Member for Delta asked what the  present

state  was  of  ASEAN, what future it would  have  and

whether any concrete progress could be achieved by it.

Well, Sir, even as I commenced replying to her, things

were  taking  place in Bangkok where our Minister  for

Foreign  Affairs  along with other  Ministers  of  the

ASEAN  member states had been conferring, among  other

things, to keep ASEAN



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



viable,  and  an on-going concern despite  the  little

dispute  that was going on between two member  states.

It  is  on  record, I am heartened to say,  that  some

understanding  has  been reached between  the  Foreign

Minister  of  the  Philippines and  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  of  Malaysia  at  Bangkok,  subject  to  the

concurrence  of  their respective  governments,  which

will,  we  hope,  allow ASEAN a fresh  opportunity  to

carry   on  business.  You  cannot  allow  a  business

enterprise to close shop after having started business

just  because  differences occur between  two  of  its

board  members, as differences are only to be expected

from time to time over one another's specific problem.

Even  the  European Economic Community, which  is  not

just  10  years old but almost 20 years old, does  not

function with unanimity on all issues. One example  is

the  admission of the United Kingdom into  the  common

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN has as yet not brought direct benefit 10 its

members,   but   this  should  occasion   no   special

disappointment because it s only just over a year old.

During the year substantial progress has been made  to

clarify and define approaches to greater economic  co-

operation   among  member  states.   At   the   recent

Ministerial  Meeting  held in  Djakarta  last  August,

areas  of  co-operation  have  been  defined  in  food

production and supply (including fisheries), shipping,

transportation, telecommunications, civil aviation and

tourism.   In   fact,   on  tourism,   some   of   the

recommendations  have  already been  implemented,  for

example, the introduction of a seven-day free visa  in

Singapore  and  facilities for package  and  chartered

tours.  There  is  also the bilateral  agreement  with

Indonesia on the Bali tourist potential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with our policy of making the maximum

number  of friends, Singapore must co-operate with  as

many   countries  as  possible  for  mutual   benefit,

particularly   so  in  the  case  of   our   immediate

neighbours, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand  and

the Philippines. This is a natural grouping of nations

in a common neighbourhood, but effort



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



must  be  made to foster the community spirit so  that

mutual   understanding  and  co-operation  is  further

developed.  Whatever the difficulties of  the  moment,

the  ASEAN concept must be maintained - even as a state

of  mind.  Last Friday night, I said that we  have  no

illusions  about regionalism or about  joining  ASEAN.

For  in  the ultimate, the small nations in  a  single

neighbourhood  have  to stick together  regardless  of

whether  it  is  in  Asia,  Africa,  Europe  or  South

America.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Delta, Crawford and Ulu Pandan also

touched on our defence build-up and would like to know

how  it  would affect our non-aligned policy  and  our

commitment  to regional co-operation, against  a  back

ground  of  turbulence in the Southeast Asian  region.

And   as   the  Member  for  Crawford  puts  it, the

possibility  of shifting balance of power  within  the

region arising from the possibility of an early end to

the  Vietnam  war and the emergence of  a  well-tried,

well-organised military organisation in Vietnam larger

than that of our members of the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place. Sir, I do not see any

incompatibility  between our defence  build-up,  which

will  cost us some $350 million in next year's budget,

and  our  non-aligned  policy.  There  is  neither  in

consistency  nor incompatibility, it is an  inevitable

concomitant  of our independence that we  develop  and

exercise our muscles for defence purposes, and, as far

as  we are concerned, for defence purposes only. It is

like  members of the fair sex deciding these  days  to

take  up karate or judo. I am sure these precautionary

measures  are  for  defence and not for  offence.  For

while  the intention in such cases where the fair  sex

is  concerned  is  to be equipped  to  defend  herself

against  any attack against her modesty, it does  not,

of  course, preclude her from giving way to temptation

and using it for other non-defensive purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, there is no doubt in my mind that our

regional  effort  in defence is inseparably  bound  up

with our neighbour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia and tied to co-operation and assistance

from  our  Commonwealth partners, the United  Kingdom,

Australia  and New Zealand. But we need  to  establish

credibility and a sort of creditworthiness  ourselves,

so that our part of the bargain in the total set-up is

not wholly insignificant or negative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, I do not think, as the Member for

Crawford  might be anxious about, that the  Vietnamese

people  after  more  than two  decades  of  suffering,

harassment and war, would want anything more  than  to

enjoy  the  blessings of peace and  to  rebuild  their

economy  and  get  on with the business  of  a  normal

peaceful  existence once the war there  is  officially

and technically over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like also to stress the point that it is of

the  utmost  importance that while  we  make  progress

internally  in strengthening our economic and  defence

sinews,  internationally  we  should  also  make   the

maximum progress within our limited resources to  seek

and maintain the friendship of other nations, both big

and  small and whatever their ideology and systems  of

government.  If  by  our defence  policy  and  defence

arrangements  we can ensure that other  nations  would

not  be predisposed to be aggressive towards us,  then

to  that  extent we will feel assured of a  basis  for

friendly relations, upon which we can further seek  to

enlarge  by  continuing  to pursue  a  forward-looking

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we extend the hand of friendship to all

nations  alike,  there is also  the  need  for  us  to

maintain  friendship even with those nations that  may

not  be  as friendly, in the hope that over the  years

they too will appreciate our gesture of friendship and

discard  any hostility or dissatisfaction  which  they

may hold against us. The hard reality of international

life  is  that today's foes can be tomorrow's friends.

After  all,  governments are made up of  human  beings

whose policies are subject to change depending on what

is in their own respective interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our foreign policy is, briefly, in a sense, a most

forward "defence" policy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



that  can be conceived, since it endeavours to  secure

the  maximum  of  friends and ensure their  friendship

with  us  at  all  times and under all  circumstances,

whatever  their own attitudes and reactions  to  other

nations, in  a way, our policy of friendship  towards

all nations indirectly supplements our security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our non-aligned policy as brought up by the

Member  for Crawford, Sir, I already spoke  at  length

last  Thursday on this topic and I would not  like  to

burden  the  House by unnecessarily repeating  it  all

over again. However. I would again stress that our non-

aligned policy is anchored to safe and unexceptionable

premises which are beyond dispute and contradiction. I

should also like to explain - as there appears  to  be

some  confusion  about this - that non-alignment  does

not  mean  rigid neutralism in dealing  with  specific

issues. This distinction must be understood, otherwise

we  may be unjustifiably and mistakenly represented by

the  misinformed or the mischievous that we follow one

bloc  or  another in making known our stand on certain

important issues from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we express our conviction and our opinion on

any  specific issue, we do so purely on the merits  of

the  case  and  in the light of our national  interest

first  and  foremost, and not because  we  follow  one

power  bloc or another as such. Our non-aligned policy

does not, in fact, preclude us from expressing our own

conviction  on  specific  issues  based  on  our   own

experience and circumstances, and our own judgment  on

the   effect   it  would  have  on  our  international

relations,  itself  resting on our  basic  premise  in

wanting  to be friends to all and enemy to  none.  The

policy  of non-alignment cannot be a policy of non-com

mitment  in  the literal sense of the word.  It  could

never be so, because in carrying out a policy of  non-

alignment,  we  aim  for  the achievement  of  certain

definite objectives. For that matter, no policy can be

considered  as  uncommitted because  every  policy  we

decide upon and execute implies action and has certain

definite objectives for the achievement of which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



it  is  engaged. So the last thing that the policy  of

non-alignment can mean is to have permanent enemies or

permanent friends. This it cannot be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Crawford also touched on the changing

scene  and  power shifts in Asia and he made reference

to the emergence of a strong Vietnam, once the present

conflict  is over As I said in the general  debate  on

the Budget, small countries like Singapore will always

be  in  the shadow of more powerful nations. But  just

because  they are powerful, it should not be taken  to

he  synonymous with any suggestion that they have  any

hostile  intentions towards us. For that  matter,  not

only  will  Vietnam be a strong nation, as the  Member

for  Crawford  has  said, but  there  are  many  other

stronger nations than Vietnam, as he knows. Judging by

both  the  pronouncements of policy and their actions,

the  Member  should  rest assured  that  whatever  the

strength  of  countries like Vietnam,  our  policy  of

friendship with all, regardless of ideology or systems

of  government, is intended to show that just as we do

not wish to interfere in their internal affairs or the

way  they  run their government, we also respect  them

for  according  us the same treatment.  In  brief,  we

cannot  allow  ourselves to be perpetually  living  in

fear  of  our  surroundings simply because  there  are

large  super-powers,  much  stronger  nations  in  the

world.   By  adhering  to  intelligent  and  realistic

policies,  I am confident we and other small countries

can still live and work together for mutual benefit.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta

raised a question concerning our posts in Johore Bahru

and   Rangoon.  As  for  Johore  Bahru,  the  original

proposal  was to have a consular post there  with  the

appointment  of  an  officer  of  the  rank  of  Third

Secretary, to deal primarily with the issue  of  visas

and related matters connected with facilitating travel

between  West  Malaysia and Singapore.  Unfortunately,

the response to this from Malaysia has not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



been  favourable in view of its interpretation of  our

request as being that of our desire for establishing a

visa  office, tantamount to establishing a  branch  of

the  Singapore Immigration Department in Johore  Bahru

which is foreign territory. While the establishment of

such an office would have in fact been more beneficial

to  Malaysians wishing to travel to Singapore, in view

of  this  response the matter was not pursued further.

However, the provision still remains and as soon as it

is convenient to establish a consular office in Johore

Bahru  with  a wider range of functions,  a  fresh  ap

proach will be made to the Malaysian Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Rangoon, it is not possible to say

categorically when this post will be set up. All I can

say  now  is that it has to be fitted into an  amended

time-table  taking into account various  new  missions

which have to be set up in the course of the next year

or two.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> A point of

clarification, Sir. Just now the Minister of State for

Foreign  Affairs said that Singapore will even  extend

its  hand  of  friendship to some  of  the  unfriendly

nations. Will the Minister inform this House which are

the unfriendly nations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

want  to  clarify two points. I do not  know  how  the

Minister  of  State for Foreign Affairs  came  to  the

conclusion, from my short statement last Friday,  that

I  was  questioning the incompatibility of the defence

build-up with our foreign policy. What I did  say  was

that too much money was being spent on defence and too

little on foreign affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on Vietnam, what I wanted to say was that

the  end of the Vietnam war does not mean the  end  of

confusion, it  will  most  probably  result  in  more

confusion, more guess-work and doubts.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Sir, the Member for Bras Basah

asked  who  were  the unfriendly nations  to  which  I

referred, I think it should be clear to him that one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



way  of making enemies is to mention who they are. For

that  reason,  it is best for us not  to  mention  the

names of the unfriendly nations.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Silence is golden.

only golden but very much more precious than gold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the comments made by the Member for Crawford

just  now, it was rather late in the evening when  the

Member  raised  the question of Vietnam.  I  can  well

remember that he was trying to race against time and I

hope  he  has not become too involved in the  question

that  he  has  put. I think that over the week-end  he

must  have  discovered that the question he had  asked

might not have been relevant to the issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incompatibility and inconsistency are, of

course, anybody's guess.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the last point -

it  the  other  day, but time was up  and  I  was  not

allowed  to  speak. The Minister of State for  Foreign

Affairs  said  that  I was against  our  Government's.

defence policy, but in fact I am 100 per cent for  it.

I  did not, however, have the opportunity to speak  my

mind. What I am against is that our foreign policy is.

not neutral enough.

<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

belabour  the use of that phrase "unfriendly nations".

If  our  foreign policy is sincerely posited upon  the

fundamental  premise that all nations are friendly  to

us,  then, in the first place, we will not be able  to

categorise  any  nation  as  unfriendly.  Perhaps  the

Minister of State will enlighten the House.

unfriendly towards Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the comments made by the Member for

Ulu  Pandan, they are like his reference to  what  you

were  supposed  to  have done, Sir, on  Friday  night.

Similarly, in the last statement which I made when the

House  resumed. I did not mention what the Member  was

supposed to have said. On Friday night he said that we

were  no longer non-aligned and, if I am not mistaken,

we  were  going to the Right in our foreign policy.  I

can only ask him to support his own statement that  we

are  not non-aligned or that we are Rightists  in  our

foreign policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the later part of this year, regulations

were  provided under the Central Provident Fund  rules

to  enable contributors who have the required balances

in  their  accounts to make use of such  balances  and

monthly   contributions  to   purchase   Housing   and

Development  Board  flats  under  the  home  ownership

scheme.  The  response  to this  scheme  was  a  great

success  and  the  Housing and  Development  Board  is

unable to cope with the demands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, may I ask the Minister

when  he  proposes  to provide regulations  to  enable

contributors of the Central Provident Fund who are not

eligible  to  purchase Housing and  Development  Board

flats,  to  make  such purchases with  other  approved

housing   schemes  with  their  balances  and  monthly

contributions?  I  am  sure this will  accelerate  our

economic  growth,  assist the  building  industry  and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are at the moment accelerating the movement

towards industrialisation, But at this point, it might

be  pertinent to ask what the Ministry is doing by way

of research or planning to prepare for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



the   various   hazards  of  industrialisation,   like

injuries  to  the  hand  in the  course  of  operating

machines. Has the Ministry attempted to get figures of

such  injuries? I have, Sir. There may be need perhaps

for  a  special department of experts in hand injuries

in the Orthopaedic Ward of the General Hospital. Can I

get   some  information  on  these  matters  from  the

Minister, Sir?



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the

increase in the number of hand injuries, I am happy to

say  that this matter has been exercising the mind  of

the  Ministry  of Labour recently and, in  conjunction

with  the  Ministry  of Health, we are  exploring  the

feasibility  of setting up a Hand Unit  in  the  Ortho

paedic Ward of the General Hospital to look into  this

type   of   accidents,  because,  according   to   the

statistics  that  we  have, the  number  of  accidents

involving  injuries to hands and fingers has  shown  a

persistent  increase  in the  last  three  years.  The

figures that I have here are, for example in 1967, out

of 799 reported accidents, something like 360 involved

injuries  to  hands and fingers. Therefore,  with  the

growth  of  industrialisation - and as  hands  are  the

parts  of  the  body  which  come  into  contact  with

machines  - we expect more injuries to hands  than  to

other parts of the body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Serangoon Gardens that

this  matter is being looked into. I hope we shall  be

able  to set up a proper Hand Unit to deal with  these

particular problems of industrial accidents.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Factories Ordinance, 1958, provides for

minimum  health,  safety and welfare requirements  for

persons employed in factories in the Republic. In some

cases,   these   provisions  fall   short   of   those

recommended  by the International Labour Organisation.

If  we  compare  our legislation with  that  of  other

countries,  our  requirements  are  not  up  to  their

standard.  The Factory Inspectorate is entrusted  with

the  enforcement of these requirements. However,  very

often,  the  recommendations or rulings  made  by  the

Inspectorate  are  quietly overlooked  or  ignored  by

industrialists  who  make  representations  to   other

authorities  entrusted with economic  development,  on

the flimsy excuse that a rigid enforcement of such  re

quirements  would result in hampering  the  growth  of

industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to warn the House that there is a rising

trend in the rate of industrial accidents, one type of

which  has not been discussed. I think these accidents

are  mainly  due to the absence of safety devices  and

safety   appliances  and  the  poor   maintenance   of

industrial equipment. This is exactly what the Factory

Inspectorate  is  out to eliminate.  In  Jurong, many

industrialists ignore the simple requirements set  out

in   the  Factories  (Persons-in-Charge)  Regulations,

1960.  Sir, this is bad. I consider that if we pass  a

set  of laws, we should ensure that they work. But  if

we  think  that such laws are hampering our industrial

progress  -  or even hampering any progress  for  that

matter  - let us revise them. The Inspectorate  should

not be asked to go round and try to do a good job when

the  requirements are not being carried out  properly.

It  just goes round to see that the legal requirements

are carried out by the industrialists. Of course, when

I refer to industrialists not conforming to our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



requirements, I do not refer to all of them but  to  a

number of them in Jurong who only care to make a quick

profit and who do not worry about simple safety  rules

to protect the health and welfare of their workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has professed itself to be

democratic and socialist. The workers have given their

unfailing  support to us all these years.  If  we  are

asking  them  to sacrifice their fringe  benefits  for

years  to  come, let us at least make  sure  that  the

factories  are  run in such a way  as  to  ensure  the

safety and health of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that the Factory Inspectorate has

been trying to do a good job in spite of a shortage of

staff and experienced engineers. Here again. I have to

bring  up the same point which I brought up under  the

Head "Ministry of Foreign Affairs". If a job is to  be

done, it should be done well, and if it is to be  done

well,  attractive salaries should be paid to the staff

so  that  they  will want to stay in  the  service.  I

believe  that only the Chief Inspector and the  Senior

Assistant  of the Factory Inspectorate have sufficient

experience to carry out involved inspections, such  as

inspections of boilers, etc. This means That they have

to make such inspections all the time. They cannot get

much  help  from their younger inspectors who  do  not

have sufficient experience. This is all wrong. Sir,If

we   want   a   Factory   Inspectorate   to   function

efficiently,  I think we should provide it  with  more

staff.  Even if it means paying them better  salaries,

by all means do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in full

agreement with the Member for Crawford that it is  our

responsibility to see to the safety and welfare of the

workers.  I  am  afraid  he  made  a  rather   general

statement  when  he said that factory  owners  do  not

conform  to safety requirements. I can only say  that,

as far as the Factory Inspectorate is concerned, close

liaison has always been maintained between the various

bodies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



interested  in  safety requirements in  factories, in

this connection, the Economic Development Board is one

of  the  bodies  consulted. The duty  of  the  Factory

Inspectorate  is  to  see  that  the  minimum   safety

standards laid down in the law are complied with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's statement that the

Factory Inspectorate is short-handed and that it  does

not have the necessary experienced men, I can only say

that, like all the other departments, we would like to

have  as  many as possible on the staff  and  as  many

experts  as we can get. But I am afraid, as is  always

the  case, a balance must be struck somewhere. In this

case,  the  provision in the Estimates  is  considered

adequate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) orphans or unwanted children who were born in Singapore but whose births were not

reported  by  their parents and who were subsequently

brought up in welfare or private homes;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) children who were born, especially of Chinese

parents,  during  the  Japanese  Occupation   and

whose births were not reported.



<br><br>Some of our younger Members in this House may not know

that,  during  the Japanese Occupation,  many  of  our

Chinese  citizens  were afraid to  move  about,  leave

alone  to report the births of their children  to  the

Japanese  authorities This was particularly so  during

the  early  days of the Occupation when many  innocent

Chinese  were arrested and executed. The  people  born

during  those  days are now married and have  children

who  were  born  in Singapore, and yet  they  are  not

issued with citizenship papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lastly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Singapore girls who married aliens and who are

residing in Singapore may have children  born  in

Singapore,  and  the whole family  roots  are  in

Singapore.



<br><br>If  citizenship is not given to the husband  and  the

residential  rights  are withdrawn,  the  family  will

suffer   hardship  and  perhaps  the  Social   Welfare

Department will have to look after the family when the

husband is gone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the above, may I ask the Minister if

he  will  reconsider the citizenship policy and  grant

citizenship rights to those who have been continuously

living  here before 1967 or for some reasonable period

of time?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I rise in support of  the  Member  for

Anson  in  respect  of his amendment.  I  request  the

Government  to review the present policy  of  granting

citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of the nation and in order not to

increase  the national burden, there is nothing  wrong

in  critically examining every application for citizen

ship.  But I do feel there are certain aspects of  the

present policy which are too restrictive. They are too

strict and unreasonable. As far as I know, there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



are  in  the  Registry of Citizens  many  applications

awaiting  consideration, Among these applications  are

some from people who are in good employment. They have

decided to make Singapore their permanent home  and  a

nation to which they can owe loyalty. They have  their

families  here.  They have their  wives  and  children

living  here,  all  of  whom are  Singapore  citizens,

However, the income of these people is not very  high.

They  are not considered to be making any contribution

to   our   national  economy.  As  a   result,   their

applications  for citizenship have not  been  approved

even after a long period. As a matter of fact, we  can

say  that  although their income is low, these  people

do,  to  a certain extent, make a contribution to  our

country.  Through the sweat of their labour they  have

provided  for their family who are Singapore citizens.

Without  the efforts of these people to make a living,

it   will  be  the  Government  who  would  have   the

responsibility of looking after their families who are

Singapore  citizens. These people are members  of  our

society.  They  share  the responsibility  of  looking

after the citizens of Singapore. In a sense, they have

made  a  definite  contribution  to  our  country   by

reducing our social burden. I hope the Government will

not neglect this aspect of their contribution, however

little   it   may  be.  In  view  of  these   factors,

sympathetic  consideration should be  given  to  their

applications.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan) (in Malay):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Member for

Anson,  I  merely  wish to add a little  to  what  has

already  been  said.  During the Japanese  Occupation,

many  people  valued  their lives more  than  anything

else.  As  as  result, many children born during  that

period  were  not registered. They are now  unable  to

obtain  citizenship  because  they  are  not  able  to

produce sufficient documentary evidence of their birth

in  Singapore.  However, I believe not  all  of  these

applications  are genuine. There may  be  one  or  two

applications  which are false. Out of a hundred  appli-

cations, there may perhaps be ten false ones. However,

the  other  90  genuine  applications  should  not  be

penalised by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



the  falsity  of  the  10  applications.  They  should

receive  due consideration by the Government. Children

born in Singapore, particularly those born during  the

Japanese   Occupation,  should  be   given   Singapore

citizenship. The lack of a Singapore birth certificate

may  not  be  the parents' fault, as in  the  case  of

children  who were born before the Japanese Occupation

or even after the Japanese Occupation.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I support the

Member  for Anson on his amendment. We all  know  that

laws  are man-made. We do not deny that when  we  have

achieved independence, we should make everybody  under

stand  that  citizenship confers  certain  rights  and

duties. The Government has citizenship laws which  are

applicable to all the people. Everybody living in  the

state  knows what his rights and duties are. When  the

citizens  have  been given their rights,  they  should

know  how  to carry out their duties towards the  country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there is a doubt among many people

regarding the laws of citizenship. Take, for instance,

the  definition  of "citizenship".  Many  people  have

stayed  in Singapore for many years. Yet they are  not

able  to get their citizenship. They are at a loss  to

understand why this is so. Some people who  have  just

come   to   Singapore   from  abroad   have   acquired

citizenship. Yet many people who have stayed in  Singa

pore  for more than ten years are still unable to  get

their  citizenship. What is the reason?  How  can  you

explain  this?  The  definition  of  "citizenship"  is

rather  vague.  The implementation of the  citizenship

policy has, therefore, given rise to some uncertainty.

Capitalists  coming from abroad and investing  250,000

here can obtain citizenship in a very short time.  Yet

many  of our people who were born here and have stayed

in  Singapore  for  many years  could  not  gel  their

citizenship. This has caused us Members of  Parliament

some trouble. When we meet these people, they say.  "I

sent  in my application for citizenship three or  four

years  ago and I have not received any reply from  the

Citizenship



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



Registry."  In  some cases they have waited  for  five

years  without any reply. Being Members of Parliament,

we  have to tell them that we will bring them  to  the

officer  concerned  and  see  what  we  can  do.  But,

according to the complaints we have received,  nothing

happens   in  the  end  in  spite  of  the   necessary

interviews. One or two weeks after the interview, they

would  receive  a  letter to  the  effect  that  their

applications  had  been  turned  clown.  They  finally

blamed the Members of Parliament. They would say  that

if  they had not sought the help of Members of  Parlia

ment,  nothing would have happened. Now that they  had

asked for our help, their applications had been turned

down  or rejected by the Citizenship Registry.  So  we

have become the scapegoats.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock temporarily in the Chair]</h4></div>





<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained my points very briefly. I have

touched   upon   some  aspects  of  the   problem   of

citizenship. Citizens are important components  of  an

independent  country.  Many  people  are  put   in   a

difficult  position because of the present  Government

policy. As has been said by the Member for Anson, many

people  who  have  been affected by the  circumstances

explained  earlier  have not been able  to  get  their

applications for citizenship approved. We should  take

steps to consider their cases. Unless we expedite  the

processing  of applications for approval, we  will  be

blamed by the people all the time. I suggest we set up

an  advisory  committee to look into all these  cases.

The   duty  of  the  Registrar  is  to  abide  by  the

instructions  of  the  Minister,  According   to   the

Minister,  the practice now is that if an  application

is  not  approved, there the matter rests. Some people

may    have   sufficient   qualifications   in   their

applications   to  deserve  favourable  consideration.

There  are many people who are related to some of  our

local  people.  For  instance,  a  husband  may  be  a

Singapore  citizen but the wife is not, or it  may  be

the  other way round. When the wife is a citizen,  she

may not apply to the Registry of Citizenship for her



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



husband's  citizenship. But at the moment the  husband

can  apply for the wife's citizenship within a certain

period of time of her stay here, Some members of their

families are doing nothing at home. They are depending

only on air and water to survive! We must not take the

view that because the law provides for such a line  of

action,  we  must act accordingly. These  are  matters

which require our sympathetic consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest again the setting up of an advisory

committee  comprising Government  representatives  and

some   Members  of  Parliament.  This  committee   can

investigate into cases which have been pending  for  a

long    time.    If    certain   applications    merit

consideration, this advisory committee can make  recom

mendations to the Minister for his final decision.  In

this way we might be able to solve this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Sir, for once I am

inclined to support the complaints made by the  Member

for  Anson,  the  Member  for Kampong  Kembangan,  the

Member for Tiong Bahru and the Member for Delta who is

the only lady Member of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to ask the Minister concerned

whether anti-national elements and communalists  could

not  be  deprived of their citizenship, and,  instead,

citizenship  be  granted  to  persons  whose   loyalty

towards  Singapore is not in question and who wish  to

live  in  Singapore permanently. Secondly,  would  the

Minister  consider the case of children who were  born

in Singapore after 17th March, 1967, and whose parents

are  non-Singapore citizens? If these children are not

granted  citizenship, they will be  faced  with  grave

problems  in the future. Furthermore, they  will  also

create problems for our society.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they are unable to go to school because they

are  non-citizens. When they grow up, they  cannot  be

employed because they will be issued with blue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



identity  cards and they cannot get public  assistance

because  they are non-citizens. These are the problems

that they will face. They have got no alternative  but

to  become  secret society members,  thieves  or  even

kidnappers  and the peace of our country  will  be  at

stake. This is our problem and we have to face it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Minister will give consideration to this

matter, perhaps we can be less stringent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

we  have  received many complaints from the people  on

this  problem and I would like to inform the  Minister

of  some of their hardships and complaints. [Laughter]

This  is not a laughing matter. Many applications  for

citizenship  have  been  rejected  without  sufficient

reasons  being given. I can give an example  to  prove

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a woman who is an owner of a small shop.

She  has been running this shop for more than 20 years

and  her  sons  were born in this country.  They  have

graduated from Nanyang University and are now  working

as  teachers, When this woman applied for citizenship,

her   application  was  rejected.  According  to   the

Minister, only those people who can make contributions

to  our economy will have their applications approved.

In  fact,  this woman has made a contribution  to  our

economy.   Therefore,   her  application   should   be

considered and approved by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is that of a father whose children

are  all citizens, except one son who was born outside

Singapore.  When he applied for citizenship  for  this

son,  he was informed that his son was a minor because

he  had not attained 21 years of age. He submitted the

application when his son was 19 years old,  but  until

now  the  application has not been approved.  This  is

very  unreasonable. Therefore, I agree with  what  the

Member  for Delta has said that an advisory  committee

should  he  set  up  to  help solve  the  problems  of

applicants for citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on the question

of  citizenship, I feel that very often  we  have  let

down



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



the  applicants, if a person fails to get citizenship,

he will come across many difficulties through no fault

of his own. It is not that he is lazy that his applica

tion  is  not  approved. I think  we  are  excessively

strict  in  considering applications  for  citizenship

and, because of this, we cause delays. In my view,  as

there  are  a  large number of applications, we  must

increase the staff of the Registry of Citizenship.  We

should  also  invite the Minister for  Labour  to  see

whether  the staff at the Registry is working hard  or

not.  This is my request and I hope sympathy  will  be

given to applicants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the eloquence of

so  many  Members  who  spoke on this  subject  really

leaves me in a very difficult situation, But I wish to

say  something in general, first, because  I  think  a

careful study and understanding of the statement given

by  the Minister in this House on the 21st of May this

year might be of some help. I quote from Hansard, Vol.

27, No. 7 dated 21st May, 1968, column 345:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the grant of citizenship is a matter of privilege

and  not  of  right.  A person who has  the  necessary

residential  qualifications will not automatically  be

granted Singapore citizenship.'



<br><br>The Minister also said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In view of the run-down of the British forces and

mounting unemployment, the Government has decided  not

to  grant  citizenship as freely as in the  past.  The

number  of cases that will be approved will now depend

upon  our  economic position. A person who is  granted

citizenship   must  be  able  to   make   a   positive

contribution to the economic well-being of Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the detailed complaints, I will try to answer

them as well as I can. The question of deprivation  of

citizenship  of  people of bad  character  and  so  on

should not be taken side by side with the granting  of

citizenship. I think the two do not belong to the same

category.  On  the  one  hand, the  law  provides  the

necessary  machinery  to deprive  those  who  are  not

worthy  to  be  citizens. But it does not  necessarily

mean  that we replace that number with an equal number

of people who are of good character.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Why not?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> As regards children who were born

in  Singapore on or after 17th March, 1967, to parents

who   are   non-citizens,  there  is   provision   for

registration.  If  such  parents  apply,  I  am   sure

consideration will be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the applicants who claim to be born in

Singapore   but  who  do  not  possess  the  necessary

documentary   evidence,  I  must  draw  the   Member's

attention  again  to the Minister's statement  on  the

10th  July in this House. I quote from Hansard, Volume

27, No.9 dated 10th July, 1968, column 502:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'During the national registration exercise, it was

revealed that there were many people who claimed birth

in  Singapore but who, on further investigation,  were

found  not be born in Singapore. If we do not  have

some  criteria for judging proof of birth in Singapore

and if we just relax or ignore the law, qualifications

and  evidence  required  to  prove  citizenship,  then

having regard to the conditions prevailing around  us,

we might have thousands of people coming here who were

not  born  in  Singapore. They  cannot  produce  birth

certificates or any other evidence of their  birth  in

Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members may not be aware that during the

national  re-registration exercise, some  1,050  cases

came  to light in which the holders of identity  cards

had  used  other persons' Singapore birth certificates

to claim Singapore birth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the man who marries a Singapore citizen,

there  is  nothing  to prevent him from  applying  for

citizenship    if   he   possesses    the    necessary

qualifications tinder the relevant Article of the  Con

stitution. But again his application will have  to  be

considered on the basis of the policy as enunciated by

the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards children born in foreign countries and

whose  parents are Singapore citizens, they can  apply

for  citizenship  if  they are under  the  age  of  21

provided  that they are residing in Singapore.  It  is

also  possible  to  register  a  person  born  outside

Singapore as a Singapore citizen by descent if at  the

time  of  his  birth  his  father  was  a  citizen  of

Singapore by birth or by registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to children who were born in Singapore of unknown

or  unascertainable parentage, it is the  practice  to

regard  such  children  as citizens  of  Singapore  by

birth, unless the contrary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



is  proved.  So  abandoned  children  would  therefore

appear to come within the ambit of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of orphans, their guardians can apply to

register  them as Singapore citizens. Of course,  each

case will be considered on its own merits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of setting up an advisory board to

study  rejected  cases  was also  raised  by  Members.

Obviously  they are not aware that there  is  already,

under the Citizenship Ordinance, an advisory board  in

existence.  This Board does go through  all  cases  of

refusal  before  the applicants are  informed  of  the

result of the application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan says that we need more

staff  in  the Citizenship Registry. I agree with  him

very  much.If only the Minister for Finance  can  be

persuaded to allow more posts to be created!  But  as

for  the Minister for Labour visiting the registry,  I

can assure him that the registry is visited very often

not  by  the  Minister because he has got  many  other

duties to perform, but by many other people under  him

who do that chore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the individual cases quoted by the Member for

Sembawang, I do not think it will be fair  for  me  to

answer him here, But if he has any particular case  on

which he thinks we have made a wrong judgment, he  can

always  write to me and I will look into it and advise

him accordingly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary's

answer to the case of the non-citizen male who chooses

to marry one of our charming citizens is not that neat

and  simple.  It is all right for the male non-citizen

who  happens to be residing here temporarily.  Perhaps

he  might acquire residential qualification. But there

are  cases  where  the male non-citizen  is  not  even

allowed to enter the country. He is stuck away in Hong

Kong  or  some other place and he is a very frustrated

husband.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How did he get married?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> I will come to that under a separate

subhead. That is what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



I  mean  by  the absence of co-ordination between  the

Registry  of Marriages and the Immigration Department.

This  is very interesting confusion. When we have such

a   case,  of  course,  the  unfortunate  husband   is

prejudiced  ad infinitum and we do not know  when  his

position will be resolved.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, just

now  the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the  number

of  people  who used other persons' birth certificates

to  claim Singapore birth when renewing their identity

cards. But he did not mention the number of people who

were born in Singapore without any birth certificates,

Is  the  figure of 1,050 the total number  of  persons

born in Singapore without any documentary evidence and

whose  applications for citizenship have been rejected

in  spite  of  their having made applications  several

years ago? This is a regrettable matter. Sir, children

who  are  born in Singapore but without any  proof  of

their birth here should be given consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Parliamentary Secretary said that more money will

be  needed if we are to recruit more staff.  How  much

money  do we need? I think it will not be a very large

sum.  It is a small matter if applications for citizen

ship  are not granted, but replies to the applications

should be given. Many applications were submitted  but

no replies were given to applicants. These people have

approached  their  Members  of  Parliament   and,   on

inquiry, the answer given was "Refused". As a  result,

Members of Parliament get the blame.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an application for citizenship is rejected, there

must  at  least  be the courtesy of a  reply  to  that

effect,  and the reason given for its rejection.  This

is the way it should be done, The applicants have been

waiting  for  two, three or five years but  all  their

applications were just put aside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion I saw one Mr Teo Kiak Seng and he

told me, "Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



Lee,  you cannot expect your citizenship to be granted

in  one  year. Some people applied for citizenship  in

1963  and ,we have had no time to study their  applica

tions  because  of the lack of staff, if  you  do  not

believe  me, the Minister can investigate the matter."

If  it  is because of lack of staff, then we  must  do

something  about it. The Minister alone  will  not  be

blamed but the Government will be blamed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour

has  drawn the attention of the House to the statement

made  by  the  Minister himself  on  the  Government's

policy in granting citizenship. I have no quarrel with

that policy, but my quarrel is with the application of

the  policy in respect of certain categories of people

resident in Singapore applying for citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has outlined a number of

categories.  There  are  people  who  were   born   in

Singapore  but,  at  the  time  of  registration,  the

parents  were  faced  with  certain  difficulties   to

register the birth of their children. There is also  a

category  of people who had resided in Singapore  long

before  the talk of Singapore joining Malaysia.  There

are  also  other categories of residents applying  for

citizenship.  The ordinary people who go  about  their

daily lives having to worry about earning a living are

the  people  who will become the victims of  a  policy

that the Government has formulated in the granting  of

citizenship.  The  Government is  not  to  be  blamed,

because  it  has to worry about its citizens.  But  my

point is that there has got to be a certain degree  of

laxity in the application of this policy, because  the

ordinary  people find it difficult to understand  this

contradiction in granting citizenship.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who come here and are able to invest $250,000

are  granted  citizenship without any difficulty.  The

qualification  is  that  they can  contribute  to  the

economic  well-being of the country. In which  country

has  citizenship  been granted on  the  basis  that  a

person  must  he able to make an economic contribution

to  the country? I think the most important point that

we  must  look for in granting citizenship is loyalty.

Singapore  will be made a laughing stock  if  it  says

that   the  criterion  in  judging  whether  a  person

qualifies  for  citizenship or not is the  ability  to

contribute  towards  the economic  well-being  of  the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk of citizenship, the first thing that it

demands  from the person is loyalty. I think the  vast

majority of those who seek citizenship today are loyal

and  have  considered Singapore their home.  It  is  a

surprise  to them that the Government does  not  grant

them  citizenship. Sir, it is in this respect that  we

ask   the  Government  to  be  more  humane   in   the

application of this policy. II: is only rational  that

the Government should have a policy in the granting of

citizenship  in  order  not to aggravate  the  present

problem   that   we  have  in  terms   of   employment

opportunities  for citizens who are  already  flooding

the  unemploynlent market. It is well and good to have

a  policy  like  this. But, at the same  time,  it  is

important for the Government to consider other factors

in  respect  of  some of the residents who  have  been

staying  in Singapore for many, many years.  There  is

also  another  category of people  who  were  born  in

Singapore but, because of special circumstances, birth

certificates were not obtained for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Government to consider

these points in granting citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I   fully  support  the  views  of  those  Members  of

Parliament  who  have  spoken on citizenship.  We  are

getting  a  lot  of  trouble and  headaches  from  our

constituents during the "meet-the-people" sessions  on

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



matter.  I  think  even a large amount  of  Aspro  and

aspirin will not cure our headaches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fully aware that there are many unemployed

persons  in  Singapore and therefore  jobs  should  be

given to our citizens. But, on the other hand, we must

sympathetically consider deserving cases.  Of  course,

they must meet the requirements of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our "meet-the-people" sessions, the

constituents who are seeking citizenship tell us  very

long  stories. We take the trouble to record  all  the

details  and  then  write  lengthy  letters   to   the

Registrar  of  Citizens, After going through  so  much

trouble, the reply is just an ordinary acknowledgement

card   which  says  the  application  is   under   con

sideration. Then there will be a long silence - it may

be  three or six months. After this the person seeking

citizenship will he asked to call at the office almost

every  week. The officer will tell him to  be  patient

and that a reply will be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government must be very realistic on

this  issue.  They must be aware that all  Members  of

Parliament  should not be made to look stupid  in  the

eyes  of the public. I hope they will carefully review

the  policy of granting citizenship and lay down guide

lines,  instead of letting Members of Parliament  help

these  people  and in the end we find  there  is  more

frustration among the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that foreigners who have $250,000 to invest

here  will  be  given special consideration  in  their

applications for citizenship, and perhaps  citizenship

will  be  granted  to  them  speedily.  I  think  some

consideration should be given to the working class  as

well.  I  am quite sure, Sir, that in time of  war  or

when  war is about to begin, the rich people  will  be

the  first to fly or sail away from Singapore. But the

working class will definitely -

Singapore, many of the rich people flew or sailed away

from  Singapore. This is a well-known fact.  This  was

reported in the newspapers of that period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make an appeal to the

Government  to  reconsider  the  policy  of   granting

citizenship and also bear in mind that we do not grant

citizenship  only to the rich people but also  to  the

working  class  as  well. The working  class  are  the

Parliament who spoke are getting themselves into  more

and   more  difficulties.  I  thought  I  had   better

intervene at this stage!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the difficulties of Members of Parliament

should be the least of our considerations. Most of the

Members  who  spoke have been trying to  persuade  the

Government to change its policies in regard to a  very

important subject like citizenship, apparently on  the

ground that it creates difficulties for them and makes

them  unpopular. I am also a Member of  Parliament.  I

also  happen to be the Minister in charge  of  citizenship

and I do get bothered by people who come and tell

me that they made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



applications for citizenship two, three or five  years

ago.  If you are a Member of Parliament, your duty  is

not  to get popular but to enforce the law to see that

you  do  things  in  the  interest  of  Singapore.   1

sympathise  with  Members of  Parliament  who  are  in

difficulties -being one myself - but that  should  not

he the criterion on which we make decisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members who spoke got worked up. The Minister

for Culture was going to intervene and explain. If  he

had  been allowed to do so, I think hon. Members might

not   have  heard  some  of  the  things  they  heard,

especially from the Member for Bukit Ho Swee. First of

all,  anybody  who invests $250,000 in Singapore  does

not  get  citizenship.  He  gets  right  of  permanent

residence.  So  I think all this oratory  about, poor

people not getting citizenship and rich people getting

citizenship  is singularly ill-informed.  Let  me  say

that  when  somebody  invests $250,000  in  Singapore,

maybe  10, 20, 30 or 40 Singaporeans get jobs. If  any

of  the  hon.  Members - especially  the  trade  union

Members - suggest that we should stop giving permanent

residence, will they say categorically that  permanent

residence  should  not  be given  to  people  who  are

prepared to invest $250,000 here and who provide  jobs

for  maybe  a  few hundred persons? I think  the  most

important point to realise - I reiterate what  I  have

said before - is that, on humanitarian grounds, it  is

good  to  give citizenship to everybody who  has  been

here  for  ten years or who qualifies for citizenship.

But  for  every one who is made a citizen,  there  are

other liabilities. The moment a man becomes a citizen,

he  is  entitled  to free education, housing,  medical

attention,  employment, a vote and to  social  welfare

assistance.   So   every  citizen   who   is   granted

citizenship  is a liability to our society.  It  means

coming back here for money to finance our new citizens

who  need not have become citizens, I quite sympathise

with  many  of the difficulties that some  people  are

confronted  with as a result of our strict enforcement

of the citizenship law, but we do so in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



the interest of the majority. Sometimes the choice  is

between  two unpleasant things and I will,  therefore,

make  the  choice  in  favour of the  less  unpleasant

course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards applications for citizenship that are

made and are not acknowledged or answered, I will  say

that  it  is  a  source  of  hope.  The  Parliamentary

Secretary did say that it may be due to a shortage  of

staff. But I will say that it is not really due  to  a

shortage  of staff. Even if we increase the  staff,  a

lot of applications will still be under consideration,

and  for  a  good  reason, because if they  are  under

consideration,  there  is  a  possibility  that   when

conditions  change  or  when  circumstances  make   it

possible  for  us  to  allow  more  people  to  become

citizens,  we  will  do  so, lf the  applications  are

rejected,  that  is that. So, as a matter  of  policy,

many of the applications are kept under consideration,

because  if  between now and the next few years,  say,

after   the  withdrawal  of  the  British  forces   in

Singapore,   we   find  that  the  economic   problems

associated  with  the British withdrawal  are  not  as

disastrous as they were thought to be, we will be more

generous  to  those people who have made  applications

for  citizenship  which have been under  consideration

for  three or four years. But if we give a reply  now,

that means they are out. So the reason why no decision

has  been  taken on many of the applications  is  that

maybe  in three, four or five years' time, it  may  be

possible  to grant citizenship to those whom we  would

be compelled to reject now, if we feel that conditions

have improved and we can take them in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say, in this connection, that quite a

large  proportion of applications for citizenship  are

made  by  people who could have applied  five  or  six

years  ago when citizenship was granted more  readily.

At  that time, they kept their options open. Now  they

have decided. And, therefore, when people now say that

they  are  loyal, yes, many of them may be loyal.  But

some  of  them are what I call "rice-eating citizens",

because  they  kept their options open, and  they  now

come and pester some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



Members  of Parliament as the options are now  closed.

Very  often, they have come to me - in fact, too  many

of   them.   Many  of  them  come  from  the  Members'

constituencies.  They make inquiries and  they  always

say  this, "But I must have my citizenship now because

I  cannot get a job." Some of them are of an age  when

they  could have applied for citizenship five  or  six

years   ago  when  things  looked  a  bit  dicey   for

Singapore. Then they kept their options open. Now that

things  are better, they want U' press for citizenship

and  the rights that go with it. Therefore, let us not

be  too  sentimental about this picture that is  drawn

about  poor people who can be loyal citizens  and  who

are  now enduring hardship. If things are not as  good

as  they are today, I think you will find less  demand

for   citizenship,  less  pestering  of   Members   of

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, first, let me say, if things improve - and I

hope  we  will review this year by year - and we  feel

that we can give citizenship to those people from whom

we  now  withhold citizenship, we will do  so.  But  I

think it will be disastrous if, purely on humanitarian

grounds,   we  open  the  doors,  Though  Members   of

Parliament  may  be able to satisfy a small  minority,

the  consequences of opening the gate may be such that

they   will  find  themselves  confronted  with  other

problems  of  mounting unemployment for citizens  who,

incidentally, are already voters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, though I sympathise with some of the

difficulties of Members of Parliament and with some of

the   hardships  undoubtedly  created  for  many  non-

citizens as a result of our strict enforcement of  the

citizenship policy, in the long run, it is a matter of

balancing the interest of the majority against that of

the  minority.  For the time being, we  will  have  to

adhere to and protect the interest of the majority.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to congratulate the

Minister for Education on having taken steps to reform

our  system of education, More attention is now  being

paid  to the education of blue-collar workers in order

to meet the needs of the industrial development of our

country. Seven months have now elapsed since May  this

year  when  the  policy  statement  on  education  was

announced  at the beginning of this session.  On  12th

December,  when we were debating the Budget  for  next

year,  we  learnt from the speech of the Minister  for

Education  that  his  Ministry had  prepared  well  in

advance  a comprehensive policy on education  for  the

coming years ahead. Thus, many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



problems  will  be  solved,  Many  worries  which  are

present  in  our  society  will  be  swept  away.  The

development of education has now reached a new  phase.

We are now implementing a new policy, a reformation in

education,  so that the products of our  schools  will

not lind themselves unemployed and can do nothing with

what they have learnt after they leave school. Our new

education policy will enable our graduates to  make  a

contribution to our society. It is thus a good policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum to be allocated to the Ministry of Education

is  about  $200 million. This is a very large  sum  of

money  and  second  only to defence expenditure.  This

large  allocation  will help to produce  more  capable

men.  We will have more people who can perform various

tasks  and take part in activities which will  improve

our  society. We will thus be able to meet the  coming

changing situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our new education policy will give rise to

some  other  matters which need to be considered.  And

here   I   would  like  to  give  my  views  for   the

consideration of the Minister for Education,  Firstly,

in  order  to ensure that our school leavers  will  be

absorbed  by  our  rapidly developing industries,  the

Ministry  of  Education should maintain close  liaison

with the industrial sector. In this way, a proper  and

regular  review can be made of the curriculum  of  our

technical  and vocational education in order  to  meet

the  changing  needs of our society.  In  my  view,  a

permanent  agency should be set up in the Ministry  of

Education,   comprising   representatives   from   the

Ministry  of  Education, the Ministry of  Labour,  the

Ministry of Finance, and the industrial and commercial

sectors  in  order  to look after  the  workers.  This

agency  will  plan and look after the  employment  pro

blems of our school leavers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in promoting technical and vocational

education, we must not overlook the cultural aspect of

education. Education has two aims, One is cultural and

the other social. We must be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



able  to look after both aspects of education  at  the

same  time.  Overemphasis on technical and  vocational

education  at  the expense of the cultural  aspect  of

education  will  result  in the  production  of  human

robots  in  our  school  leavers.  This  is  certainly

against  the  principle of education. It  defeats  the

purpose of education, for the aim of education is also

to make a cultured man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the present scheme for the training of

teachers in technical and vocational subjects  is  not

to  be  corn-mended. The courses are given on a  part-

time  basis.  After the teachers have gone  through  a

hard  day's work, they are probably exhausted  and  by

the  time  they  go  into  the class-rooms  for  their

course,  they  have  no energy left  and  are  in  low

spirits. In these circumstances, the teachers whom  it

is  hoped  to produce instantly will not  be  able  to

undertake the responsibility of training the  students

in  technical  and vocational subjects.  The  training

courses  must  be  on the same basis as  the  training

courses  being  conducted by the Economic  Development

Board.  The  teachers must be given full-time  courses

and  enough time to go through the theoretical as well

as  the practical aspects of their training. They must

be  given  opportunities to do practical work  in  the

factories or workshops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, as from next year all male students from

Secondary I and Secondary II, as well as 50  per  cent

of  the female students from Secondary I and Secondary

II, are required to do three hours' practical work  in

the  workshop. This means that our students will  have

the  opportunity of doing some practical work in their

vocational  and technical education. However,  I  have

some  misgivings about the position of those who  have

talent  in painting, drawing and music. I do not  know

whether  provision  will  be  made  to  exempt   these

students from attending such courses. Through  such  a

course,  Singapore  will in time be  able  to  produce

musicians  comparable to the talented Fou  Ts'ong  the

well-known Chinese pianist. At the same time, it is my

hope also that, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



addition to domestic science, female students would be

given the opportunity to take up other subjects,  such

as sewing, typing, book-keeping, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, as from next year, students in Secondary I

will   be   given  three  extra  hours  for  technical

training.  In  my  view, the teachers responsible  for

such  training  should not be included  in  the  quota

allowed  for  teachers.  Otherwise  it  would  greatly

increase  the  teaching load of the  teachers.  It  is

possible  that  the teachers may have  to  take  seven

teaching  periods  a day. This is  too  much  for  any

efficient teaching to be successful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, as a result of the reforms we are bringing

about  in secondary education, the study load  of  our

students  will definitely increase, not only in  terms

of  subjects  but  also in terms  of  learning  hours.

Consequently, the students will not be  able  to  cope

with their subjects. In my view, although they may  be

required  to  learn as many subjects as possible,  the

examination  subjects should be reduced  so  that  the

study load of the students may be reduced. At the same

time,  I  wish to appeal for the abolition of the  Cam

bridge  School Certificate Examination. It  should  be

replaced by a local examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now wish to go on to a new subject. This is in respect of school inspection. As far as I know, there have been recent appointments made of inspectors of schools. However, in the final analysis, the confirmation of promotion or the extension of service of teachers is handled by the

principals themselves. I cannot see the merits of this

system. Rather, I see many disadvantages. In the first

place, not all principals are properly trained in  the

School  Inspectorate. They are actually  outsiders  as

far  as  school inspection is concerned. As a  result,

they  are  doing  a slipshod job. What  is  even  more

ridiculous  is  that  some  principals  who  are   not

conversant in the second language are asked to observe

the   teaching  of  the  second  language.  After  the

observation, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



will  ask a senior teacher to make a report.  This  is

ridiculous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excessive powers given to the principals also

give  rise to some other effects. Moreover, the duties

of  school  inspection will add to the burden  of  the

principals. As a result, their other duties will  have

to  be  performed by some other teachers.  And  it  is

usually  the senior teachers who have to take  on  the

extra load. The work of school inspection is part  and

parcel  of the education system. It should be done  by

properly  trained people in order to get  the  desired

results,  so  that  the  teachers  and  students  will

benefit.  I hope the Minister will review the  present

system of school inspection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 12th of this month, the Minister for Education made a clear statement that great changes will take place in respect of the teaching of the second language. The result will be that a truly multilingual and multiracial society will emerge from this policy. I hope this policy will

succeed.  We  do  need  a  great  many  bilingual  and

multilingual people in our society. This is  not  only

useful in the field of human relationship but is  also

an  advantage in finding employment for our  citizens.

As  the  Minister  has pointed out, in  the  past  the

teaching  of the second language was confined  to  the

language  itself.  All that we  tried  to  do  was  to

increase  the  teaching time and improve the  teaching

methods.  In  his view, this was not enough.  I  agree

with  him. We must go beyond the normal teaching hours

for  the  second language and give our  children  more

opportunity to learn it. We have used English  as  the

second  language  in the teaching of  Mathematics  and

other science subjects. We have used Chinese, Malay or

Tamil  as  the  second language  in  the  teaching  of

Geography  and History - subjects which are  connected

with culture and language. In my view, this policy  is

praiseworthy.  But  we must not  try  to  hurry  these

things  in  view  of  the problems still  existing  in

connection with teachers and textbooks. If we try to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



rush  through things before these problems are solved,

we will not be able to get the desired result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also noted the possibility of using the second language as a medium of instruction in other subjects. He said that, according to a survey in Primary I, the result shows that the standard of the second language will not be lowered and the teaching of the subject in which the language is used as a

medium of instruction will not be lowered. But  if  he

were  to  make a survey, say, in Secondary I, probably

he will not be able to get as good a result.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since we are trying to build a rugged society,

we  must place emphasis on extracurricular activities.

I  fully  support  this policy.  But  there  are  many

defects  in the present system. As a result,  we  have

not been able to -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, in Committee you are limited

to  15 minutes and you have now spoken for 15 minutes.

As  you have an amendment* to the whole Head, you  can

speak further when you move that amendment.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for the Head 0701 be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in my view,

the  vote  allocated to the Ministry of  Education  is

substantial  and adequate. Even with the  increase  in

defence  expenditure amounting to  $375  million,  the

Ministry  of  Education still ranks  second  in  total

expenditure.  This  means that  we  are  paying  equal

attention  to  education and are  able  to  train  our

youths  for  various jobs. This is the  proper  course

that we should take.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few countries in Asia which have a

high  rate  of  literacy. We  have  almost  wiped  out

illiteracy  amongst  our  population.  In   1960,   we

switched our attention to technical education  and  we

are also aiming at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



turning  out  people who are rugged and patriotic.  In

this respect, I wish to raise several points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I wish to talk on technical education. Most

of the Secondary I and II students will come under the

technical  education scheme. But, as far  as  I  know,

there  are not enough teachers who are able  to  teach

technical subjects. I do not know how the Minister for

Education  proposes  to  deal  with  the  shortage  of

technical teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some 50 to 60 Government-aided schools in

the Chinese stream will be using English as the medium

of  instruction  in Mathematics and science  subjects.

What  arrangements  will  be  made  for  the  teachers

required  in  this respect? Are the existing  teachers

competent  to  teach  their  students  in  the  second

language all of a sudden? There may not be any problem

for Primary I and II. But from Primary III onwards,  I

think  the  teachers  should  be  retrained  for   the

purpose,  and such retraining should start immediately

so that they will be able to teach the higher classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point concerns the use of English in the

teaching   of  Mathematics  and  Science  in   Chinese

Government-aided  schools.  There   is   an   expected

increase  in  the number of teachers and,  because  of

this,  there  may  be a surplus of  teachers  in  some

schools. What will become of this surplus of teachers?

Some  of  them  are quite old. Will  they  be  retired

prematurely?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some aided-schools, the number of students

is  decreasing, thereby resulting in the  transfer  of

some  teachers to other schools. Is there  any  policy

governing such transfers? Is it on the last-come-first-

go  basis?  To my knowledge, this policy is not  being

followed.  The  transfers are being done  at  the  dis

cretion of the principals who, if they like the  faces

of  some  teachers,  retain them.  Some  teachers  are

transferred  because  they  are  not  liked   by   the

principals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Sir, I wish to

appeal  to the Minister for Education to abolish  the

Saturday classes for the English stream. As far as  I

can  make  out,  the school children go  to  Saturday

classes  about twice a month for reasons  unknown  to

me.  They deserve our sympathy. I cannot somehow  get

the impression that the children profit in any way by

going  to Saturday classes. Sending poor children  to

Saturday  classes is an item of considerable  expense

to  poor  parents and it is also a waste of time  not

only to the school children but also to the teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,I support the

statement of the Member for Jurong when he asked  for

the   abolition   of  the  Senior  Cambridge   School

Certificate  Examination and its replacement  by  our

locally-conducted examination. As we are now  indepen

dent,  we  should  not  rely on  other  countries  to

conduct  examinations for us. Otherwise,  what  about

the  Chinese  School Certificate Examination?  Do  we

have  to rely on Peking for this? If we do not,  then

we  do  not have to depend on England to conduct  the

School Certificate Examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point concerns our education policy. I

have been told that the number of schools to be built

next year will be reduced. If less schools are to  be

built  next  year, where are we going to  accommodate

the  new  students? In my view, we should build  more

schools  next year because the student population  is

increasing.  Actually we have  planned  to  build  17

schools  every  year - 12 primary  schools  and  five

secondary schools. Are we changing this policy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the opinion that the Minister for Education

should instruct the big civic organisations like  the

huay   kuan  to  start  their  school  building  fund

campaign. Government should also allot state land  to

these organisations for the building of schools.  For

example,  we  can  build more schools  in  Anson  con

stituency as there are vacant pieces of land there.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, first, I must thank the various Members

for their appreciation of the education policy of the

Government  as  well  as their  appreciation  of  the

problems that we are facing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to deal first with the points raised by the

Member  for  Jurong.  On  the question  of  technical

education,  he  says that we must keep close  contact

with  the commercial and industrial sectors, In fact,

this is what we are doing. At the present moment,  we

are   in  the  process  of  setting  up  an  advisory

committee  on  technical and vocational education  to

consider all the related problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the social and cultural aspects of

education,  the  Member for Jurong should  not  worry

because  a  change  in emphasis does  not  alter  the

principle of education, We only wish to convert  one-

third  of  our  students to technical education.  The

main  point  in  our  reform is  that  our  secondary

students  will have at least eight years  of  general

education in which they must have learnt enough about

culture, language, literature, art and some technical

subjects. The principle of education is not  affected

by our emphasis on technical education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members have raised the question of

shortage  of  technical teachers,  According  to  our

Estimates, when the changes are completed by 1970, we

require  700  to  800  technical  teachers  to  teach

Secondary  I and II students, At the present  moment,

we  have about 300 teachers undergoing training. Next

year, we propose to introduce the change at Secondary

I  only.  Therefore, we need only half the number  of

teachers  required. So there is no  question  of  any

shortage of teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards part-time courses for teachers, in my

view,  this  is  not  a serious problem  because  the

teachers can still cope with the training done  on  a

part-time  basis.  All along, trainee  teachers  have

been  attending  lectures on a part-time  basis.  Yet

they have been able to cope with the teaching



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



load  as  well as extracurricular activities.  At  the

present  moment, we have about 80 teachers  undergoing

full-time training in technical education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the changes to be introduced in

Secondary  I  and  II, we have given consideration  to

students  who  are  talented  in  the  fine  arts.  If

students  are considered to be talented  in  the  fine

arts, they will be exempted from attending three hours

per week workshop practice, provided that the teachers

are satisfied that the students are gifted in the fine

arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference has been made to the speech of the

Minister  for  Education on the  12th  of  this  month

regarding  the compulsory attendance of girl  students

at  domestic science classes. Only 50 per cent of  the

girl  students will be affected. I have  already  said

that   we   need  only  800  teachers  for   technical

education.  This is only four per cent of  the  20,000

teacher  population.  Therefore,  there  will  be   no

repercussions.  The  number of technical  teachers  re

quired  for the secondary schools is small because  we

are  not  fully implementing the changes at  the  same

time.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of school inspection, I am of the

view that principals should have some authority in the

methods of teaching. I think they are competent to  do

this  job,  because they have been teachers themselves

in  the past. If there are cases where the work of the

principals  is  slipshod and if  further  details  are

supplied, we will investigate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech earlier the Minister for Education has

already  made  clear the Government's  policy  on  the

teaching  of  the  second language.  The  Ministry  of

Education is now getting ready to prepare for a two to

three-year  period  of special training  in  order  to

enable teachers in the non-English language streams to

make the change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of text-books, I have to point

out that at the present moment, before the changes are

implemented, many schools, particularly the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



Chinese  schools,  are  using  English  textbooks   in

Science and Mathematics. So there is no problem  about

text-books.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the points raised by the Member for

Sembawang. The point concerning technical teachers has

already been covered by me when I answered the  Member

for Jurong. On the question of redundancy of teachers,

the Minister for Education has made it very clear that

those  who  are  dedicated and  can  carry  out  their

responsibilities  properly  will  be   given   special

consideration when the question of redundancy  arises.

Those  who are not dedicated teachers may be  affected

by the redundancy exercise,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the decreasing number of students in aided

schools, resulting in transfers of teachers,  I  think

the  transfers are based on the subjects the  teachers

are  capable of teaching. The principle of "last come,

first  go" is not strictly adhered to because  of  the

need for subject teachers. If the Member for Sembawang

has  got  any  special cases in mind, he can  give  me

further details and I will look into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the point raised by the Member for Joo

Chiat  about half-day classes on Saturdays.  Not  very

long ago Chinese schools had a six-day week. Now,  the

attendance  on  Saturdays is required  for  extramural

activities or if there are special circumstances where

the  principal  or  the teacher is of  the  view  that

special  classes are necessary on Saturdays.  In  this

way  the  burden will not fall mainly on  the  parents

because it is better for the students to attend school

rather than roam about the streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Members have raised the question of abolishing

the  Senior  Cambridge Examination.  The  Ministry  of

Education is now actively considering this matter  but

there  are  technical problems which cannot be  solved

overnight.  Therefore, we require some  more  time  to

consider  this matter and I do not think this  is  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan asked what will become of

the increasing number of students if fewer schools are

being  built.  I  do not think this  problem  is  very

serious because of our success in family planning, and

therefore  our  population growth will  be  less.  For

example,  the  enrolment  of Primary  I  students  has

decreased this year compared with last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of contributions by the public to

the  building  of schools, the Ministry  of  Education

will  give  them all the necessary help and facilities

for this purpose.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin making my observations and queries on

the  vast subject of education under this subhead, let

me assure the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary

that  I  am  well aware of the complex nature  of  the

subject under their charge and the limitations  within

which they have to manage it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I am concerned with

the  subject  of education is my belief that  it  will

take a new society, a society with radically different

responses and reactions, if we are to achieve national

security and prosperity in the years ahead. And in the

final  analysis,  it is the content of  the  education

that  we  provide our young today which will determine

their respor~ses and reactions tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I may add that I am not holding a watching

brief for the teaching profession in this Chamber  and

I  do  not intend to do so. But I am anxious that  our

education system succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short space of ten years, our education

system was adjusted as a result of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the implementation of the recommendations of

the  all-Party Report on Chinese  Education  in 1958;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the acceptance of Malay as the national

language;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the policy of integration through integrated

schools and bilingualism;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the emphasis on Science and Mathematics;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) the implementation of some of the

recommendations  of  the Commission  of  Enquiry

into  Vocational  and  Technical  Education in 1961;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) the implementation of a few recommendations

by  the Lim Tay Boh Commission of Inquiry  into

Education; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) the impact of independence which accentuated

the need for us to be rugged and to be equipped

with  all  the  proper and  requisite  reflexes

which  a  people who are determined to  survive

must have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes and adjustments did come rapidly one

after  the  other  in  the space of  ten  years.  They

created many problems' which the administrators had to

solve  by  reason  of the rapidity  with  which  these

problems  came  on  an  ad hoc  basis  which  in  turn

resulted   in  more  complications.  Meanwhile,   more

schools  were built and more children went to  schools

and  more  teachers were appointed. So  more  problems

came  in  a rush which were necessarily dealt with  ad

hoc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rate and extent of expansion virtually caused a

bottle-neck in the administration out-channels, and ex

plains why the administration perhaps had to call  for

returns after returns from schools, a telephone  relay

system   had  to  be  set  up  for  rapid  information

transmission,  teachers had to be  transferred  at  an

instant's  notice and administrative work  had  to  be

piled upon the teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today we have restructured our education system.

The  restructuring  is extensive in  scope,  involving

primary,  secondary, technical, tertiary  and  teacher

education which I hope is a final restructuring and is

intended  to  describe  in perspective  our  education

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now I say, let the administration in the Ministry

stop  solving problems on an ad hoc basis. Our pattern

of   the   education  system  is  now  set  for   some

permanence. Let problems be solved in the  context  of

the  whole system. Let there be a continuous grasp  of

the system as a whole.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the structure is set, the administration

will  be  able  to  view the system in  comprehension,

anticipate  complexities  and  resolve  them   in   co

ordination   with   other   ancillary   administrative

functions and the profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This urges me to reiterate the call which I made in

the  debate  on  the President's Speech  earlier  this

year.  Our  education system must contain  a  research

body  of  sufficient scope to undertake effectively  a

continuous, thinking on the effects  of  the  present

restructuring of the education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Minister that teachers, must

respond  to  the  challenge if  we  are  to  make  our

restructured system succeed. The profession can make a

tremendous  contribution to the country if its  effort

is  developed  into a cohesive teaching  power  imbued

with  the aims and purposes of education, as  we  have

restructured it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, the administration should consider

two  courses  of  action.  First,  it  should  make  a

statement  of these aims and purposes. The  priorities

in  education must be arranged and inculcated  in  the

profession  to the extent that they become  the  basic

motivations of its entire teaching effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the administration carry out the exercise of

ensuring that every single teacher and school-head has

a  precise understanding and appreciation of the' aims

and purposes of the new system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I say, in the name of education, let this not be

done  through  circulars  or other  forms  of  blunted

administrative insistence,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the teaching profession must be accepted

for  what  it  is a profession. At this point  in  the

development  of  education, the country  requires  the

total  and  enthusiastic commitment  of  the  teaching

profession to the aims and purposes of the system. Let

there  not  be instead a move to squeeze  out  of  the

teaching body an effort which is nothing more  than  a

service. Not only will it be insufficient, but it  may

even  be  dangerous, because the teaching  body  is  a

profession and it is not a service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching is vocational essentially. If we are agreed

that   we  want  our  school-leaver  to  be  not  only

literate, knowledgeable and proficient academically or

technically but also educated - and that means  imbued

with  the values of personal and social morality,  and

nurtured  in national obligations and responsibilities

-  then  we want a profession and we want its teaching

and we do not want a service with its instructing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the teaching profession is gradually forced into

the  strait-jacket  of service  form  and  stamp,  the

pupils will receive instruction from instructors, when

they should be receiving teaching from teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has our restructured system catered for

character education - education in personal and social

morality? Is it through the lessons in ethics once  or

twice  a  week? I am not convinced that as a  form  of

character  education, these lessons in ethics  are  a~

effective  as the teachers' impromptu and  spontaneous

references to moral principles of personal and  social

conduct in the course of a lesson, say, in History  or

Literature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, character education is the sum total of

a   teacher's   involvement   with   the   personality

development  of  his pupils through  his  sincere  and

intelligent  exemplification  of  character   in   the

ordinary living of individuals in a society or nation,

his   pupils'   responses  and  the   management   and

development of these responses.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to attend to this aspect of education

especially  now when we are going technological  in  a

big way and when opportunities for character education

in teaching are nil or much less in a lesson, say, for

example, in industrial designing than in history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of it, our system must produce

essentially the homo sapien, the human being with  his

personal, social and moral responses. Let us not have,

in  his  stead, the techno sapien, if I may be allowed

to concoct a term. And I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



say  that the teaching profession can help ensure this

by remaining essentially and contributively a teaching

profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will just end by remarking that the reason

why  this  country has succeeded hitherto is not  only

because  of  the grey matter content of our leadership

in  the  Cabinet  but,  more  important,  because  the

persons  who  constitute it have been  educated,  have

been taught and have been imbued with moral principles

of personal and social conduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a sad day when a new leadership of

intelligent and knowledgeable persons but bankrupt  of

moral education assumes government of the country. For

our entire achievements would be dissipated before you

could finish saying "Switzerland".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  wish to raise four points under this item. Firstly,

I  wish  to  draw the attention of the  House  to  the

complaints  of  parents who are in receipt  of  public

assistance.  Students of these parents  were  informed

not very long ago that they would have to pay half the

"Miscellaneous" fees when, in fact, they did not  have

to  do so in the past. The "Miscellaneous" fee was  $1

for  a primary student and $2 for a secondary student.

In  the  past, children of parents who were in receipt

of  public  assistance were exempted from  payment  of

these  fees. As far as I know, these people  are  very

poor  and  the  amount of public assistance  given  is

small.  Therefore, they should continue to be exempted

from  payment of these fees. I hope the Minister  will

give sympathetic consideration to this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is in respect of the transfers of

students  which will take place next year. I hope  the

officials  in  the  Ministry of  Education  will  make

proper arrangements for the transfer of students  from

one  school to another. Students should not be  posted

to  schools very far from their homes, otherwise  this

would  result in a greater financial burden  on  their

parents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I wish to refer to the flag-raising ceremony

in  the  morning and in the afternoon which  is  being

performed in the schools. I have noticed over a period

of  two years that in some schools the students do not

take this ceremony seriously. Probably this is due  to

the failure of the teachers to explain to the students

the  significance of the flag-raising ceremony. I hope

the Ministry officials will look into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, I wonder whether the Minister for Education

will   consider  introducing  a  uniform  of  standard

pattern for students of primary and secondary schools.

A  standard  uniform  will ensure that  students  from

primary schools will not have to make new clothes  for

school  going  when  they are  promoted  to  secondary

school.  Otherwise  the  financial  burden  on   their

parents   will  increase.  At  the  same  time,   some

aesthetic consideration should be given in the  design

ing  of  the uniforms. A standard uniform system  will

solve  the  problem of what students should wear  when

they  take  part  in mass drill at  the  National  Day

celebration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise to support the Members who  have

spoken  before  me.  Whether a modern  and  developing

nation like Singapore will continue to grow strong and

healthy  depends  on whether there  is  political  and

economic  stability. Singapore's future  survival  and

whether the democratic system will succeed will depend

on  whether our economic expansion will be fast enough

to cope with the rising expectations of our people. We

must   march  forward  if  Singapore  is  to  survive.

Everyone  knows  that we lack natural  resources.  Our

economic growth, therefore, depends on our talents and

the  proper  utilisation of our natural resources.  In

other  words,  our economy depends very  much  on  the

human  factor. Therefore, the aim of education  should

be to enhance the quality of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  viewed in  the  context  of  the situation in Asia, we have achieved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



some success in our education system. It is now mature

and   more  progressive.  However,  we  must  not   be

complacent We must always be on the look-out  for  any

shortcomings and try to overcome them. If we adopt the

correct  measures  to  overcome  our  shortcomings,  I

believe  the pace in our educational development  will

be faster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to speak on the overall education policy. I will direct my observations instead to certain short comings which we encounter in trying to implement it. Let us talk about our teachers. At this juncture in our nation building, we need not only a sufficient number of teachers but,

what  is  more  important, we need  teachers  who  are

dedicated  and  committed to the task of  implementing

our   education  policy.  Otherwise  Singapore,  which

depends on its human resources for its survival,  will

be doomed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, do our teachers have a real respect for their profession? Let me quote an example from the Teachers' Training College. Recently, the T.T.C. Research Unit conducted a survey of the theme, "Why I become a teacher." Among the teachers questioned, about 40 per cent of graduate teachers in

the  English stream; 68 per cent of graduates  in  the

Chinese stream; 71 per cent of H.S.C, trained teachers

(English  stream);  69  per  cent  of  H.S.C, trained

teachers (Chinese stream); 72 per cent of Secondary IV

trained  teachers (English stream) and 86 per cent  of

Secondary  IV  trained teachers (Chinese stream)  have

really  committed themselves to their  profession.  In

other words, of all the qualified teachers, there  are

about  60  per  cent  of  graduate  teachers  (English

stream);  32  per  cent of graduate teachers  (Chinese

stream);  29  per  cent  of  H.S.C, trained  teachers

(English  stream);  31  per  cent  of  H.S.C, trained

teachers (Chinese stream); 28 per cent of Secondary IV

trained  teachers (English stream);  14  per  cent  of

Secondary  IV  trained teachers (Chinese  stream)  who

regard  their  present job as a temporary  occupation.

Teaching is to them a stepping stone to other jobs. If

they have a better opportunity, they will quit teaching.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



We  can deduce a very alarming fact  from  these

figures;  that  is, if a teacher is better  qualified,

the  less  dedicated he is to the teaching profession.

What  is the Education Ministry going to do to  arrest

this trend? At the same time, I wish to know what  the

T.T.C, is going to do to overcome this difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. The majority of teachers

have  experienced some frustration in their  teaching.

Most  of  them have been taught the latest  scientific

tnethods of teaching. However, sometimes these methods

do  not  meet  with the approval of the inspectors  of

schools or principals. The reasons are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The inspectors were not themselves teachers prior

to  their  appointment, nor have they any  diploma  in

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Most of the principals were not given any

professional training. They did not even keep  abreast

of  the  latest  trends in education. They  run  their

schools   according  to  their  own   experience   and

reputation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Each and every lecturer has a different opinion

of a trainee teacher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, there is a conflict in the

approach  to  teaching between the lecturers  and  the

teachers.   The  teachers  are  therefore  bewildered.

Whenever a teacher wants to try out the latest methods

of   teaching,  he  has  to  consider  whether  enough

facilities are available and also whether he  will  be

allowed  the  freedom  to  experiment  with  the   new

methods. For example, first, there is the question  of

arrangement  in  the  classrooms, and,  second,   the

question  whether the students have to go out  of  the

classrooms  or  out of the school for  extra-curricular

activities.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, whether there are enough books for pupils

to do self-study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in order to allay these doubts and fears,

I believe there should be greater co-ordination and co-operation  among lecturers, principals, inspectors  of

schools and teachers. To achieve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



this,  more seminars, lectures and discussions  should

be held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now speak on the problem of teachers in aided-

schools  who  want  to  extend  their  service   after

retirement.  At the moment, the Ministry of  Education

considers applications on four criteria:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the physical condition of the teacher

concerned;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) his teaching ability;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) his financial situation; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) his record of social service.



<br><br>I  agree  entirely with this approach. But  I  do  not

agree  with the method of their implementation because

there  are  many  faults.  As  regards  the  teacher's

teaching ability, the discretion is entirely with  the

principal  and the inspector of schools. They  do  not

know  the  teacher well. If the inspector  of  schools

decides on the applicant's teaching ability after  one

or  two  inspections,  this may lead  to  a  dangerous

position  of a blind man sizing up the picture  of  an

elephant. Moreover, principals have their own personal

feelings,   whether  good  or  bad,  towards   certain

teachers  and  they may not always be right.  In  this

way, there may be prejudice against the teachers. This

system   of   allowing  inspectors  of   schools   and

principals  to judge the teaching ability of  teachers

is  not  good and may lead to unfair decisions on  the

teachers concerned. I suggest that a committee be  set

up  to deal with the question of extending the service

of retired teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point deals with textbooks. Sir, we all know

that  before 1960, our schools did not have  a  common

curriculum.  The  schools  had  their  own  choice  of

textbooks  with  an  inclination  towards  books  from

foreign  countries. Because of this, students  in  the

various  schools  adopted different  cultural  values.

Since 1960, when the common curriculum was formulated,

schools  of  all streams have been making use  of  the

same  curriculum  and  have been  inculcating  in  our

youths  a sense of national consciousness. But so  far

we  have not achieved much in this direction, although

the  common curriculum has been in existence for eight

years. This is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



because  many textbooks are not available and many  of

our schools are using textbooks the supply of which is

dependent on overseas publishers. Therefore,  how  can

the   contents  of  these  textbooks  suit  our  local

situation  and requirements? I dare say that  most  of

the  publishers and authors of textbooks are the first

generation  Chinese from China or refugees  from  Hong

Kong. They get very low pay.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Tay, you have spoken for 15

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, even if I wanted to give you

additional  time,  the  House would  have  to  pass  a

resolution  to  exempt you from  Standing  Orders.  My

spirit  is  willing but my hands are tied by  Standing

Orders! Mr Sim Boon Woo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

earlier   on   I  was  talking  about  extracurricular

activities.  I  agree very much with the  Government's

policy  on extracurricular activities. But at  present

there  are  many faults in the implementation  of  the

policy  and,  as  a result, the objectives  cannot  be

achieved.  Firstly, the teachers in  charge  of  extra

curricular  activities  are not  experienced  and  are

unable  to  demonstrate the correct techniques.  As  a

result, the students are not keen on these activities.

Because   marks   are   awarded  for   extracurricular

activities, they have to participate in them in  order

to gain more marks whether they like it or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some extracurricular activities take up

three  or  four periods a week and normal lessons  are

therefore  disturbed. Some extracurricular  activities

are concerned with taking part in public performances.

As  a  result, teaching hours are used up in the train

ing of these activities. Just because the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



students  want to get some extra marks, they  have  to

sacrifice  their  normal study lessons.  Sir,  do  you

think that extracurricular activities of this kind are

good  for the students? Students very often take  part

in  national parades, youth festivals and other public

performances.  I feel that the Minister for  Education

should look into this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Adult Education Board has achieved results

in  providing adults with supplementary education. The

Board will have greater responsibilities in the coming

years. Besides providing classes for students who have

failed  the  Primary School Leaving  Examination,  the

Board  is  also providing evening classes to over-aged

students.  This is very good. But I feel the  Ministry

of  Education should take the responsibility of  super

vising  the  activities of the  Board.  For  instance,

there have been shortcomings in the Board in the  past

owing to lack of supervision. Some teachers are assist

ing  students  by  paying for their fees  and  thereby

inducing  them  to stay on in order  to  make  up  the

required  number of students for one  class.  In  this

way,  they  will be paid by the Adult Education  Board

and thus recover the money that they have spent on the

students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Ministry of Education will be

moving to a new building. I hope that, in future,  the

efficiency  of the Ministry will be improved.  In  the

past,  perhaps it was because the offices were  housed

in  separate  buildings  that the  efficiency  of  the

Ministry  was  low.  For instance, a  certain  teacher

organisation wrote to the Ministry requesting for  per

mission  to  hold a table tennis tournament  during  a

particular  term. But there was a long delay  and  the

reply  was only given when the term was about to  end.

So  the  tournament had to be cancelled.  I  hope  the

inefficiency in administration will not recur when the

new building is occupied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

development  of education in Singapore in quantitative

and  qualitative terms has been impressive  and  signi

ficant.  But,  unfortunately, the people of  Singapore

have not noticed it. Educationists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



who have come to Singapore and seen  how  the

education system works have often marvelled at some of

our  achievements.  Take,  for  example,  integration,

bilingualism  and trilingualism in our schools.  These

are aspects of our educational achievements which have

impressed many of the foreign educationists. They have

also  been impressed by the fact that we are  able  to

achieve all this within the short space of one  decade

or so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who were present at the Youth Festival

this year and watched the performance of the youths at

the  youth  rally and the Youth Festival of Drama  and

Music  must admit that a great deal has been  achieved

in education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, all these achievements have been

conveniently forgotten by the people and also by  some

Members of this House. What stands out very clearly in

their  minds is the failings of teachers.  There  must

always  be  black  sheep  in  every  profession.   The

headlines  they make in the papers are very  vivid  in

the  minds of the people of Singapore. The people have

not  recognised  the fact that these achievements  and

the  development  in education must necessarily  bring

about  a lot of attendant problems which will only  be

solved  with the passage of time. These problems  are

unavoidable  and are sometimes due to the failings  of

certain teachers.



<br><br>6.45p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we keep on harping on all these failings and

criticising  these  teachers both inside  and  outside

this  House,  I think we will have a very  demoralised

teaching   profession  -  not  an  inspired   one.   A

demoralised teaching profession will not  be  able  to

play  the  role  that  we  expect  of  them  and,   in

Singapore, we sometimes expect the moon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give a few examples of the contributions that

the  teachers  have made in response to  the  call  of

nation  building.  Some time in 1960,  the  Government

wanted to introduce Malay as the National Language and

bilingualism and trilingualism in schools. Many of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



the  teachers  were not able to speak  Malay  at  that

time,  and when asked to attend the Teachers' Training

College  in order to acquire a knowledge of  Malay  at

Standard  I  and  II  level,  the  response   was   so

tremendous  that  even the Teachers' Training  College

and  the  Ministry  of  Education  were  not  able  to

organise enough classes for them. This situation would

not  have arisen if the teachers had not risen to  the

occasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recently heard of the slogan of building a

rugged  society.  The number of extramural  activities

going  on  in the schools nowadays sometimes frightens

the parents. They complain that their children have no

time  for their studies. We have observed the  results

of  these extramural activities in the performance  of

the  students during the Youth Rally and the  Festival

of Drama and Music.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above all this, the teachers are asked to

do  unprofessional  work.  The  Member  for  Serangoon

Gardens has underlined a very important point which we

have  to  remember, and that is, we have to  recognise

teaching  as  a  profession. If the  teachers  are  to

achieve  professional  standards  in  their  teaching,

certain  duties which are non-professional should  not

be  added to their load of professional duties. Common

sense  tells us that if you have that situation,  then

the   efforts  of  the  teachers  in  the   field   of

professional work will be diluted. Teachers  are  also

human beings and they can only take up the load  to  a

certain extent, not more than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has mentioned a few

examples  of the non-professional work that principals

and  teachers  are asked to do. One  of  them  is  the

filling of survey forms and all kinds of returns. This

work  is  not  done  during free  periods  but  during

teaching hours, and therefore lessons must necessarily

be  interrupted. Principals are sometimes asked to act

as  audit  clerks. I realise this is not entirely  the

fault of the Ministry of Education, because they  have

their limitations and, with a standstill budget,  they

cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



employ additional clerks. But the blame should not  be

on  the  principals and teachers. When  they  are  not

proficient  in their professional work, it is  because

they  are given this additional load of unprofessional

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has recently come out with

the idea of forming advisory committees in schools.  I

think  this  is a very splendid idea, because  schools

should  be  allowed  to use their  initiative  to  get

additional finance in order to increase their  efforts

in promoting extramural activities and equipping their

libraries and so forth. Unfortunately, a sound idea is

sometimes  badly  carried  out.  Principals   of   all

Government  schools - the aided schools  already  have

their  management  committees comprising  civic-minded

citizens who have the interest of education at heart -

are asked to form advisory committees. To make it easy

for  Members to follow me, I will take 200 schools  as

the  number. Each advisory committee will comprise  15

members  and  the principals are asked, in  the  first

instance,  to set up their advisory committees  within

one month. I was wondering how the principals of these

200  schools  would be able to find  3,000  persons  -

there  are  15  members  in one advisory  committee  -

within  one month to serve on them. The main  function

of the committee is to contribute and raise money, and

another function is to look after the interests of the

schools. The task of the principals to get this number

of persons within one month is beyond most of them. In

the  first  place,  how  do  we  suddenly  find  3,000

citizens within one month or six months, who are civic-

minded and with the interest of education at heart, to

serve  on  the  advisory committees and to  raise  and

contribute money? The result is that if the principals

do  not form the committees in time, the blame will be

put on them because they are not up to the mark. These

are  some  of the problems that I am able to list  for

the  moment. I can go on listing other problems  which

the principals and teachers have to face.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that there are bad principals, and bad

teachers, but this fact must be, looked at against the

perspective of the vast majority of teachers  who  are

willing  to play their role. I will not say  that  the

vast  majority  of  the teachers are truly  dedicated.

There  are also those who, though not that dedicated,.

are  willing  to rise to the occasion and  play  their

role  effectively. My point is that we  will  not  get

this  response  from  the teaching  profession  if  we

continue  to criticise the failings of a few  and  let

these  criticisms dominate everything, while we forget

the good which the teaching profession has done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must also be recognised that how well our young

citizens  will shape up does not depend  only  on  our

teachers alone. I think the teachers spend about  five

hours with their students and perhaps one or two hours

during extramural activities. There are also the other

hours  where the children are at home and  it  is  the

parent's  concern  to teach their children  moral  and

social  values.  Therefore, the parents'  role  is  as

essential as, if not more essential than, the role  of

teachers. Much as we blame the teaching profession for

some  shortcomings,  there  are  certain  parents  who

should also be blamed, for the only concern they  show

for  their  children's education is whether  they  can

pass  the  Primary  School  Leaving  Examination   and

whether  or not they should employ private  tutors  to

give  them  additional tuition. The vast  majority  of

parents, cannot afford to engage private tutors.  They

probably  have their citizenship or other problems  to

worry about.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Sia, I think you have just

gone beyond 15 minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  much  of  the criticisms  against  the

Ministry  of Education can be attributed to the  rapid

and  vast expansion in the field of education over the

last  10  years.  I think Members are aware  that  the

school enrolment has almost doubled since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



1960. There has been no corresponding expansion in the

administrative personnel in the Education Ministry and

a  considerable  backlog  of administrative  work  has

accumulated.  This  has led to various  criticisms  of

inefficiency, the lateness in giving decisions and  so

forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has pointed out

that  within a short space of eight years  there  have

been  so  many changes in the educational system  that

many  of  the teachers are not able to understand  the

various  changes  and grasp the aims and  purposes  of

such   changes.   No  sooner  have   commissions   and

committees been appointed to look into the educational

system  and  no sooner has one report by a  commission

been   completed  than  it  is  overtaken  by  events.

However,  from now onwards we can expect a  period  of

consolidation because, as Members are aware, money  is

not  easily available in future for expansion  in  the

educational field. Given this respite, we may be  able

to  bring much of the administrative work up  to  date

and innovate various improvements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will notice that although there is a

restructuring of the educational system, it is not  so

much  a  radical change of the policy as a  change  in

emphasis.  I  cannot agree more with  the  Member  for

Serangoon  Gardens that our teachers must be  informed

of  the  aims and purposes of the changes in emphasis,

and,  towards this end, the Ministry will do all  that

is  possible to bring the teachers up to date on  this

matter.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention has been made of the need for a research

unit  to  study the effects of the various changes  in

the education system. I agree that although we have at

the  moment a research unit in the Ministry, not  much

research has been carried out, because of the shortage

of qualified personnel, particularly on the subject of

the  possible  effects of the various changes  in  our

education system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens expressed his

anxiety  that in our eagerness to produce a sufficient

number of technicians and craftsmen to meet the  needs

of our industries, we might be producing a lot of what

he termed techno sapiens instead of homo sapiens. Sir,

I  cannot  agree more with him that this is a  problem

that is causing me sleepless nights, because very  few

people have given thought to it. Unlike other matters,

the  effects  of changes in our education  system  can

only be seen after a number of years. However, we  did

get  advice  from various experts on these changes  in

our education system. It is hoped that we will produce

educated homo sapiens and not techno sapiens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang raised the question of

payment  of  "Miscellaneous"  fees  by  pupils   whose

parents are in receipt of public assistance. Prior  to

the  third school-term this year, pupils in Government

and  Government-aided  schools were  required  to  pay

terminal fees which varied in amount according to  the

type  of  school and the course of study,  and  ranged

from  $1 per term in island primary schools to $6  per

term  in  secondary schools. Poor pupils were exempted

from  payment of these fees on the recommendations  of

their  principals.  But  with effect  from  the  third

school-term  this year, the terminal fee was  replaced

by  a  "Miscellaneous" fee of $1 per month in  primary

schools and $2 per month in secondary schools. As  the

"Miscellaneous" fee will be collected in small monthly

instalments  rather than in large terminal  ones,  the

burden   on  the  parents  will  be  negligible   and,

therefore,  no  exemption  or  waiver  on  grounds  of

hardship  may be considered. The Member for  Sembawang

should know that the "Miscellaneous" fees are intended

to  meet  part  of  the  cost of expendable  materials

connected  with  sports, libraries, Science,  Domestic

Science,  Arts  and  Crafts, and also  extracurricular

activities  in keeping with the Government  policy  of

intensifying such activities in our schools.  In  view

of  the  financial stringency, it is not  possible  to

grant exemptions to such cases.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has always tried, as far as possible,

to post students to schools nearest their homes. But I

think  the Member for Sembawang should know that  over

the  last  five  years, there has been a  considerable

shift in population in Singapore. Many housing estates

have been developed, and, as a result, there have been

shortages  of  school  places  in  these  new  housing

estates.  But  overall, there  are  enough  places  in

schools  in Singapore. The question is one of distance

because  the school buildings are permanent structures

on the ground and they cannot be shifted about to suit

the  convenience of the parents. While we try our best

to post students to schools nearest their homes, it is

not always possible to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar referred to the production

of  textbooks by local experts. I am quite sure he  is

well  aware  that since the introduction of  a  common

curriculum  in  schools, we have been encouraging  our

local  publishers to publish books in conformity  with

this  school curriculum. I think the response has been

satisfactory,  although it is true that  a  number  of

these  textbooks were edited by people who  came  from

China  and  by refugees from Hong Kong.  But,  by  and

large,  I think a considerable number of books,  parti

cularly  English  books, have been  produced  locally.

Nevertheless,  steps  have  also  been  taken  by  the

Ministry to publish textbooks in certain subject areas

where special needs have to be met. For example, three

series  of  textbooks  are  being  published  by   the

Ministry.   A  series  of  textbooks  on  civics   for

secondary classes have already been published  by  the

Educational  Publication Bureau  of  the  Ministry  of

Education. The publication of a similar series for the

pre-university level will soon follow. Other series in

the  course of preparation include a series of History

textbooks and a series of Chinese Language Readers for

primary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference was also made that many of the trained

teachers and many of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



those undergoing training now are not motivated by the

high  ideals of the teaching profession. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  the  situation described may have resulted  from

the large number of trainees recruited in the past  to

meet  the shortage of teachers. The situation  now  is

quite  different. With large numbers of well-qualified

applications for a limited number of teaching jobs and

with  better  methods of selection,  I  think  we  can

expect a more dedicated crop of teachers in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar also touched on the basis

of  granting  extension of service to teachers.  Since

June 1968, the work of teachers applying for extension

of  service is initially inspected and assessed by the

principal  of  the  school to  which  the  teacher  is

attached.   It  is  followed  up  by  an   independent

inspection  and assessment by a principal  of  another

school  nominated by the Ministry. Where the views  of

one   principal  differ  from  the  other,   a   third

inspection  is  made by the Inspectorate  Division  of

this  Ministry.  Since  the  work  of  a  teacher   is

inspected by more than one officer, the possibility of

personal  factors  coming into  play  is  considerably

reduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong, I am afraid you have reached

your  15  minutes. I will find out if  there  are  any

other points that Members wish to raise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister  has left two points unanswered:  first,

with  regard to the flag-raising ceremony and, second,

with regard to school uniforms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will reply to these points.

thank  you  for  giving  me  another  opportunity   to

complete my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final point refers to the Examinations Division the

administration of which should be improved.  Generally

speaking,  the  secondary school examinations  set  by

this  Division are not ideal. The form and content  of

the examination questions are extensive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



The  students are not able to cope with them. Even the

teachers themselves are at a loss.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to touch on the Science

examinations  in secondary schools. I  feel  that  the

Ministry  of  Education should adopt  a  more  unified

method  of arranging the Science examinations so  that

the  school  teachers do not have  to  run  around  to

obtain   the  necessary  apparatus  for  the   Science

examinations.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practical examination in science subjects should

also  be  under  unified  control.  The  Ministry   of

Education should set up a laboratory where examination

questions   on   practical   science   which   require

experiments could first be tested in the laboratory to

ascertain  the result, before they are  given  to  the

students,  otherwise some mistakes may  be  discovered

halfway   through   the  examination.   A   ridiculous

situation  would then develop. This is  to  supplement

what I have said just now.

"extracurricular activities" suggests, students should

take  part in these activities only outside the normal

school  hours, except under very special circumstances

where  they have to be undertaken during school hours.

Such  occasions are very rare and the principal should

get  the  permission  of the Ministry  first.  If  the

Member  feels  that there are any cases he  can  quote

which demand a special



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



investigation by the Ministry, we shall  be  delighted

to have that information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the efficiency of the administration,

my  Minister has already given his reply, and I do not

think I should go into that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also asked why his question

about the flag-raising ceremony has not been answered.

We  have  known  of instances where during  the  flag-

raising  ceremony  the discipline was  not  very  well

maintained.  However,  the principals  concerned  have

been  warned  and advised to rectify the position.  In

fact, the Ministry is rather concerned about such lack

of discipline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to uniforms, it is not possible to have

a  standard  pattern of school uniform throughout  the

island.  There  are  many  schools  which  have   long

traditions, and they would be very reluctant to change

the  pattern of their uniforms. Some schools have pure

white, some  white and yellow. I do not think  it  is

really  a  very serious matter. I think  most  schools

would prefer to keep their own tradition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as for raised by the Member for the Ministry would not like the failure of the teaching We do not -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I did not blame the

Ministry  for harping on it. I was just commenting  on

the   criticisms  that  were  being  levelled  at  the

teachers  from within and without this House.  I  know

the  Ministry  cannot blame the teachers  because  the

Ministry  has got to blame itself. I do not  hold  the

Ministry responsible for this. In fact, we are in  the

same  boat.  We have to defend ourselves  against  the

unfair  criticisms both from within and  without  this

House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would

appear then that I need not answer the question, since

as the Member for Moulmein says, the profession



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



and the Ministry are in the same boat! Anyway, to

those  who are dedicated to their profession we always

show the carrot, and to those who are not, we show the

stick.  [Interruption.] Not from the Ministry, as  the

Member for Moulmein has himself pointed out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for teachers being asked to do non-professional

work,  I  think  it is very difficult  to  distinguish

professional  work  from  non-professional  work   for

teachers.  A teacher does not only teach but  he  also

builds  up  the  personality  and  character  of   the

students.  He  may  therefore have  to  do  some  non-

teaching  work  in order to achieve  this  aim.  If  I

recall correctly, the Member for Serangoon Gardens did

ask  a  question  in this House about  the  duties  of

principals  some time ago, and this was  answered.  In

teaching,  it  is  also necessary 'to perform  certain

duties  pertaining to the education system as a whole,

such  as the filling up of forms and the supplying  of

statistics   to  the  Ministry  for  the  purpose   of

planning.   This   is  indirectly  professional   work

contributing to the education profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards school advisory committees, I realise

that  200  multiplied by 15 gives 3,000,  which  is  a

large  number.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the principals  have

been  advised to consult the Members of Parliament  of

their  respective constituencies for suitable  persons

to  be on these committees. If they fail to do so,  it

means  that they have little liaison with the  Members

of Parliament and with the community.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> They did not approach the

M.P.s.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> I am not exactly saying that,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  But if the  principals  have  not

approached M.P.s, of course, I cannot blame the M.P.s.

But  the  principals have been advised to  do  so.  It

should not be difficult for the M.P.s, to recommend 15

members  of  the public to the principals  to  sit  on

these  committees. In fact, many schools have  parents

and  teachers  associations before  the  new  advisory

committees were set up. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



many  instances, it is just a matter  of  getting  the

same people to serve on the other committees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has, raised the point

about  the  necessary improvements to be made  in  the

examination  questions of the Ministry.  Most  of  the

examination questions are set not just by one examiner

but   by  a  board  of  examiners  who  consider  the'

examination  questions in detail.  It  is  unfortunate

that sometimes certain mistakes do occur. But, by  and

large,  an examination is just a means of ascertaining

the standard which has been attained by a student.  So

the question of too wide a syllabus does not arise. We

do not want to tell the students, "We are going to ask

you this, question. Therefore, you study this question

properly."  We are trying to test what they  know  and

not  what  they do not know. The question of  limiting

the  syllabus  so that the teachers will know  exactly

what  to set as an examination question is not correct

from any educational point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to practical work, I am afraid we cannot

institute  a centre for' practical work in respect  of

science'  subjects. We have too many centres  already.

The Member for Paya Lebar will appreciate that most of

the  examination  questions are  set  by  the  science

teachers themselves ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> rose ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to correct what the Parliamentary Secretary

has said. I do not mean that a centre should be set up

where  all  the candidates could' be examined  on  the

practical  aspects, of the science  subjects.  What  I

meant  was  that the questions should be tested  first

before they are put down as examination questions  for

the students.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully

understand  the  Member's question.  As  I  said,  the

questions are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



set  by  teachers who are specialists in their fields.

They   are   graduate   specialists   teaching   their

respective .subjects. They have spent two years in the

T.T.C, to  be trained as teachers. Under the  present

system, such   experiments  as  are   necessary   in

practical  questions  are  first  tried  out  in  the

laboratory by those who set the practical side of  the

examination  paper.  This  is  to  ensure   that   the

experiments can be carried out. Of course,  there  may

be  a  few instances where minor defects might  arise.

Perhaps  the teachers, who have had so much  train'ing

themselves, will be able to answer and carry  out  the

experiments faster than the students they teach.  But

remedial  action is usually taken and such cases  have

always been reported to the examiners.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I just want to add one point with

regard to the activities of the Adult Education Board.

The  Member  for  Jurong has said just  now  that  the

activities of the Adult Education Board have not  been

properly supervised by the Ministry. Mr Speaker, Sir,

there is such a body as the Adult Education Board. All

the  activities  organised by it  are  supervised  'by

staff  recruited by it. The Ministry does not directly

supervise the activities of the Board. Although  there

might  be a few instances of laxity in supervision,  I

am  sure  they  will  be  looked  into  by  the  Adult

Education Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead concerns inspectors of schools. I

think the image of the inspectors of schools is fairly

set  by  now. In some cases it gives rise to a lot  of

apprehension on the part of the teachers.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from their functions of inspection of

teaching  methods, the examination of school  accounts

and investigation into complaints against teachers and

school  heads,  what are their residual functions,  if

any?  I  wonder  if these inspectors  of  schools  are

expected  - or a much more preferable term -  required

to   submit   research  papers  on  the  problems   of

education,   analysis   of  problems   pertaining   to

methodology, methods and teaching of special  subjects

and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is part of their duties to so submit

treatises,   theses  and  written  papers   on   these

problems, what have been their contributions so far?



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it would be extremely desirable if the

Inspectorate   insists  that  inspectors  periodically

submit  written papers on problems relating to matters

of  teaching. I think they are the proper persons with

the  expertise to undertake such a problem. I  do  not

think  that their duties should be so mundane  and  so

limited  as  to  go  around  examining  accounts   and

inspecting the teaching of teachers for bar  crossing.

etc.  I think the Inspectorate can contribute best  to

education if it instils into the inspectors of schools

a sense



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



of  careership, because inspectorship is a career.  It

does not involve isolated services like inspection  of

teaching,  examination of accounts  and  investigation

into  complaints.  I think there is  an  attitude,  an

approach,  required of inspectors. This will  only  be

achieved  if the duties of inspectors, as I  say, are

more  than  just servicing schools and  inspection  of

teaching.  It must include a progressive and sustained

inquiry into the many and varied problems of education

from  time  to time. If the results of these inquiries

are  published and distributed among the teaching  pro

fession,  then I think it will go a long way  to  help

and improve the teaching effort of the profession.  It

certainly  will benefit 19,000 teachers and indirectly

will benefit half a million school-going children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is the Inspectorate not aware that the

teaching in primary schools these days places so  much

emphasis upon the passing of that infamous examination

called the Primary School Leaving Examination that the

pupils going to the secondary schools are, in fact, in

difficulties   when  it  comes  to  articulating   and

composing work in the classroom? I think this  is  due

to  the  fact that the teachers in the primary schools

have  focused their efforts purely to get  the  pupils

through  the  examination. Surely the Inspectorate  is

aware  of this trend and, if it is, what has  it  been

doing?  Has  it gone round to the schools to  try  and

dilute  this  trend and to insist on the  teaching  of

skills  in  composition? I do not mean  the  classroom

subject   Composition  but  composition   in   speech,

composition  in thinking, composition in  articulating

so  that when the pupils go to secondary schools, they

will  not  be  shocked  by the  amount  of  work  that

requires compository skills in the secondary schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the specialists and

inspectors  of  schools do submit  papers  on  various

aspects  of  education. Some papers are  required  for

study before decisions are taken and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



others  are  submitted  as papers  for  discussion  by

teachers  and  principals  at  various  seminars   and

conferences  conducted throughout the  year.  I  agree

that  the  work  of  specialist inspectors  and  other

inspectors in this respect is not sufficient, as  most

of their time is taken up with the routine and mundane

duties  of administration~ inspection of teachers  and

so  forth.  It  is for this reason that sometime  this

year   we   decided  to  "off  load"  some  of   their

responsibilities on to the principals  by  asking  the

latter  to  inspect  their own teachers  and  also  to

assist  in  inspecting the school  accounts.  But,  as

Members have criticised just now, this aspect  of  the

work  is  really not professional and  should  not  be

given to the principals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only about 120 inspectors as against

nearly  20,000 school teachers. Merely to inspect  the

teachers'  work would have occupied most of  the  time

that  is  available to the inspectors. I think  it  is

principally because of this reason that there have not

been  enough  papers  on various educational  problems

submitted by specialist inspectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure how this problem can be tackled,

because   the   routine  inspection  of  teachers   is

necessary  for  purposes  of  crossing  the  bar,  for

purposes  of  promotion, extension of service  and  so

forth. Somebody has to do this aspect of the work. And

unless we can get staff from elsewhere to relieve  the

specialist inspectors of some of their routine duties,

I  am  afraid  it is not possible to expect  too  much

paper work from them. However, if financial support is

forthcoming in the course of next year, I  propose  to

expand the Research Unit so that it will be able to do

research  into the many pressing educational  problems

instead  of  directing  its attention  mainly  to  the

compilation of statistics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1020.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subhead concerns staff officers, a subject on

which the ambit of my debate has been somewhat reduced

by  the answer given by the Parliamentary Secretary to

my question earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are two points that I want to raise.

I  believe  that a directive stands to date  requiring

the staffing of qualified teachers only in Primaries I

and  VI and that in between (Primaries II to V), these

classes could be staffed with unqualified teachers.  I

am not saying that my information is factual. I do not

know.  Perhaps  the  Minister  for  Education  or  his

Parliamentary Secretary can enlighten me. That is what

I  have  been given to understand. If that is so,  the

point  that  I wish to raise is that the  staffing  on

this  basis in primary schools should be looked  into,

because  if  we  need  to  staff  qualified  competent

teachers in any school, it is in the primary school. I

think if the pupils in the primary schools are somehow

mishandled,  by  the  time they  reach  the  secondary

classes, they will be so atrophied that they will  not

have  much  of  a  potential  as  students,  in  these

schools.  I  think that whatever staffing  formula  is

being applied by the staff officers, it should be such

as  to  ensure that more qualified teachers be staffed

in  primary  schools  in view of  the  fact  that  the

children  in  Primary schools are in a formative  age,

and  if they are malformed, we are going to get a good

deal  of  maladjustments which would be  difficult  to

reset   in   the  secondary  schools.  That   is   one

observation  which  I  would  like  the  Minister   to

consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second observation that I wish to make is in

reference  to what we call "integrated schools"  these

days.  Sir,  perhaps  we can do  away  with  the  word

"integrated".  To me, it sounds as though  we  have  a

racial problem in Singapore when we name a school inte

grated.  I  do not know whether it is possible  to  do

away with it. My view is that it would not take a  lot

of  thinking  to  remove  the  word  "integrated".  It

conveys  the impression that we have got a set  racial

problem.  To  the  tourist  who  comes  to  Singapore,

especially if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



he  is  an  American,  and  who  sees  the  expression

"integrated school", he, of course, draws the analogy.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member for

Serangoon Gardens that the term "integrated"  used  in

the schools is not appropriate. In fact, I do not like

this  term myself, because "integrated", as translated

in Chinese, means "mixed". One does not know what type

of  school  this is. However, the Member for Serangoon

Gardens  will  notice  that in  all  our  new  schools

completed since 1964 when I took over, the term  "inte

grated"  has  not been used. But for the  old  schools

which already have this term I have not really brought

my  mind  to bear on whether we should take  the  word

out.  Some of the schools have been known by this term

for the last eight years and they have become embedded

in  the  parents'  minds. I am not  sure  whether  the

removal  of the word "integrated" will not cause  more

confusion. Anyway, it is something into which I  would

like to look myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the staffing of the primary schools, it is

our  aim  that all teachers in primary schools should,

as  far  as possible, be trained. The current position

is that 62 per cent of the primary school teachers are

trained teachers, 24 per cent are teachers-in-training

and 14 per cent are untrained teachers. Even with this

14  per cent of untrained teachers, various in-service

courses have been organised with a view to raising the

standard  of their professional teaching and  also  to

keeping   them   abreast  with   current   trends   in

educational  development and the modem  techniques  of

teaching.  As  the  primary school  enrolment  is  not

expanding and with more teachers being trained in  the

future to replace the untrained teachers who might  be

retiring in the course of the years, the situation  in

our primary schools will be very much improved.

specialist   inspectors   (physical   education).    I

understand that their work is, to a large extent,  con

nected  with  sports and extramural  activities  which

should come under extramural activities. I do not know

what  the  development  has been.  Perhaps  these  two

departments have merged. This is a question  of  form,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I note that the Estimates list out 10

posts  of  assistant  specialist inspectors  (physical

education),  but I understand that eight  others  have

been  seconded to the department, and so you  have  18

assistant  specialist inspectors (physical education).

I  understand that these 18 inspectors are required to

supervise  physical education in  a  great  number  of

schools,  involving  about half a million  pupils  and

about 20 .000 teachers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



I wonder whether, even in the course of a whole

year,  these assistant specialist inspectors  will  be

able  to  supervise all the teachers in  the  schools.

Will   the   Minister  consider  seconding   to   this

department a greater number of teachers who have  been

specialising in physical education or extramural  acti

vities to undertake what is clearly a massive piece of

work?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir,I think the Member for

Serangoon Gardens is correct in saying that extramural

activities will embrace the work done hitherto at  the

National  Recreation Centre which  will  be  abolished

with  the  completion  of  the  Extramural  Activities

Centre   at   Farrer  Park.  The  head  of  extramural

activities is responsible for the coordination of  the

work    of    the   following   three   sections    of

extracurricular   activities  in  our   schools:   the

Physical  Education Section, the Cadet  Corps  Section

and the Music Section.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>7.51 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the Physical Education Section has been run

by a specialist inspector with 10 assistant specialist

inspectors.  As the volume of work has increased  with

the  emphasis on extracurricular activities,  we  have

found  it necessary to second eight teachers  to  this

section.  I  am  sure if there is a  further  need  to

second more teachers to this section, we will do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, before I withdraw my amendment, I

notice what may be a misprint in the Estimates. Can  I

refer  the Minister to footnote (v) on page 189  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Officers who were in service on or prior to 30-4-58

are on scale: (II-4A) for Pass

Degree;  (II-13) for Certificate Course  and  (III-23)

for Normal Trained.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



I do not know whether the salary scale "(III-23)" is a

misprint.  I think it should be "(II-23)"  because  in

Appendix L at page 542 I see that the salary scale for

Normal  Trained  teachers  is $325-l5A-490/530-20A-690

under  Code  Number  II-23. I  wonder  if  this  is  a

misprint.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rodrigo, if you compare it with

footnote  (vii) on page 187 which refers to code  (11-

23)  for Normal Trained teachers, I think footnote (v)

on page 189 is clearly a misprint. In any case, we are

concerned with the sums of money to be voted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> That is right, Sir. Other than that, I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendments (10) and (11) are not being

moved. Amendment (12) , Mr Rodrigo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1153.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I seek your leave to range over the

subjects  coming under subhead 1158*

as well, as  I intend  to  make  some observations on  principals

at large.  Recalling  my  suggestion  that  the  time  is

opportune  for the administration to secure the  total

commitment  of teachers with the aims and purposes  of

ensuring  that  we  succeed  in  our  new  educational

system,  I  would urge the administration  to  provide

opportunities  for principals of schools  as  well  to

undertake  inquiry and research into  the  educational

problems  of  the  country, and those  having  special

reference  perhaps to their own school of environment.

The  principal of the school must, in my  opinion,  be

involved  if  his staff are to he similarly  enthused.

But  his contribution can certainly be much more  than

that of school administration only. I am sure that the

principals  of  schools,  who  are  people  with  vast

experience,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



keen  minds and are alive to the innumerable  problems

of  education in the country, will also be the persons

who,  apart  from  the  inspectors  of  schools,   can

contribute  to education by keeping their minds  alive

to the problems of education in the country.

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improvement in the quality of our urban

environment and the transformation of Singapore into a

garden city - a clean and green city - is the declared

objective  of the Government. In October, a month-long

campaign  to  "Keep Singapore Clean" was launched  and

carried  out  successfully; the enthusiastic  response

and  support  of the people in all walks of  life  was

tremendous. The message did certainly get down to  the

people.  During the past three years, my Ministry  has

taken  a number of positive measures to cope with  and

overcome  the  many problems that have been  a  severe

deterrent to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



efforts to improve the quality of the environment. The

problems  associated  with  indiscipline  of   labour,

overtime  rackets  and  labour-union  interference  in

management  matters  have been,  to  a  large  extent,

resolved  between 1966 and 1967 -that is past history.

It  culminated in the abortive daily-rated  strike  of

1967  which  gave the Ministry of Health an  effective

basis  to  push  ahead  with  the  initial  phase   of

reorganisation. Consequent to the tightening of  super

vision  of the work force, there was some increase  in

the  efficiency  and productivity in public  cleansing

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, real improvement began with the

implementation   of   the   reorganisation   of    the

Environmental Health Branch in August this year.  This

reorganisation  involved the  division  of  our  whole

island  into  districts which were further sub-divided

into sectors and each sector was put in the charge  of

a  public  health inspector or a senior public  health

assistant who is the officer-in-charge of the  sector.

Under  him  are a number of public health  assistants,

the public health overseers, the mandores and the beat

labourers. These officers in charge of sectors in turn

come  under a health officer who is in charge  of  the

whole  district. There is, therefore, a clear line  of

command and responsibility. Thus, the familiar game of

"passing  the  buck" was eliminated. It  was  also  an

exercise   of   integration  of  the   public   health

inspectorate  with the public cleansing department  as

well  as  of decentralisation and the giving  of  more

powers  to  the persons in the field. Improvement  was

further enhanced by the introduction of round-the-year

public  cleansing also in August this year. I am  glad

to  say that there is also now a greater awareness and

appreciation among the various Government  departments

of  the interaction of facets and sectors of the total

environment  and  of  the fact that  resultant  health

problems  may originate from other sources. All  these

efforts  have  contributed to  a  Singapore  which  is

visibly cleaner than it was, not only two years ago



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



but  ten  months ago. Of course, there is  still  much

more  to be done. As I have said previously, this  war

against  filth  and  squalor is a relentless  one  and

requires all the grit, the stamina and the persistence

in order to triumph.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, good and adequate legislation is

one   of  the  principal  tools, for  the  successful

execution of any public health programme involving the

community  as a whole. Members will remember  that  in

the  addendum to the President's Speech at the opening

of  Parliament in April this year, it was stated  that

the  public  health legislation was being consolidated

into   a  comprehensive  Environmental  Health   Code,

capable of maintaining the highest standards of public

health  that  is  required in a modern  complex  urban

society.  The  Destruction of Disease-Bearing  Insects

Act,  1968,  was passed by Parliament on  1st  August,

1968,  and brought into force on 1st September,  1968.

Today,  you  have before you the Environmental  Public

Health  Bill  in  this series of  measures  to  update

health  legislation  and  improve  our  public  health

standards.  Attention will next  be  directed  to  the

revision and updating of the Quarantine and Prevention

of Disease Ordinance, an Ordinance nearly 40 years old

in  conception;  this  controls the  introduction  and

spread  of  infectious diseases both from outside  and

within the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated earlier, the basic needs and problems

faced  by the Public Health Division are in the  field

of  environmental health services - public  cleansing,

anti-mosquito and other vector control, public  health

nuisances,  uncoordinated  building  development   and

pockets  of sub-standard environment within the  urban

area.  These  problems  are  the  result  of  multiple

factors,  some  of which are within the Public  Health

Division's  sphere  of  influence  and  competence  to

tackle,  but others are not. Briefly, we in  Singapore

are facing the results of rapid urbanisation and socio-political changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been acutely felt that the health officials

were  working  with  outmoded  legislation  which  was

formulated for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



past  colonial era. In order to solve the present  and

future  public  health problems on a long-term  basis,

there  is  a  need  for an entirely  new  dynamic  and

radical  approach, one aspect of which is  a  thorough

and   complete  revision  of  all  the  principal  and

subsidiary  legislation governing  matters  of  public

health.  In  this revision, the changed political  and

social   circumstances,  as  well  as  the   behaviour

patterns  and attitudes of our local population,  must

be  taken into account. Besides, there must also be  a

painstaking  reappraisal of what may be called  health

standards or conditions or requirements. These  cannot

be  viewed  in  isolation but in the  context  of  the

fabric  of our local life, and are by the very  nature

of things relative to the aspirations of the community

at  a  given  time.  This calls for  a  realistic  and

pragmatic  approach. But whatever these may  be,  once

decided,  these values will have to be  clearly  spelt

out and codified so that their implementation would be

uniform   and  fair.  Once  agreed,  they  should   be

generally applicable and should not be the subject  of

bargaining or ad hoc modification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environmental Public Health Bill which is before

Parliament  and the various subsidiary legislation  to

be made under it have been drafted with the philosophy

I  have just outlined. The Environmental Public Health

Act  seeks  to replace Part IV of the Local Government

Integration  Ordinance,  1963,  which  contained   the

relevant provisions concerned with the maintenance  of

environmental  health. It would  interest  Members  to

know  that the old provisions are essentially  similar

to  the  Municipal  Ordinance (Cap.  133  o  the  1936

Edition)  which  was  itself first  enacted  in  1913.

Subsequent amendments to it were made to keep in  line

with  the various administrative changes in the  Local

Government,  but  these did not affect  or  alter  the

contents  and the principles of public health practice

as provided for by the said Ordinance and, hence, they

have become quite apparently obsolescent. What is more

interesting is that the Municipal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance  itself  was  based on  the  British  Public

Health  Act of 1897 - Members will know that that  was

the  time of Queen Victoria. The British Public Health

Act has subsequently been re-enacted three times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took one year to prepare the Environmental Public

Health  Bill.  Every single clause has been  carefully

considered  in  terms  of present  and  future  health

needs.  The  relevant  laws in  other  countries  were

looked  into, that is, the British Public Health  Act,

the  New  Zealand Public Health Act and the  New  York

City  Health  Code.  The Bill  covers  all  fields  of

environmental  health action except for air  pollution

and  water  pollution.  While it  was  felt  that  the

pollution of the atmosphere is serious, it has not yet

assumed  proportions of a major public health problem.

The subject of water pollution will be dealt with in a

separate  Bill.  The main purpose of the  Bill  is  to

integrate  the environmental health functions  of  the

Public Health Division and to consolidate the services

of    public   cleansing,   markets,   hawkers,   food

establishments, general health licensing  and  environ

mental  sanitation  and  hygiene  into  a  single  co-

ordinated  and  cohesive code to be implemented  by  a

unified authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weaknesses of the present legislation have been

tightened,  and recent advances and trends  in  public

health  practice  have been incorporated.  Briefly, a

realistic  approach  to  the  present-day   needs   of

Singapore was followed, that is, bringing the law  up-

to-date    without    necessarily   discarding    such

legislative provisions as have been found to be sound,

workable  and  have stood the test of  time.  However,

where  existing  provisions have been required  to  be

revised, re-drafted and denuded of ambiguity, this has

been   done  so  that  within  the  umbrella  of   one

compendious Bill, all necessary provisions relating to

environmental health have

been systematised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am taking this opportunity to highlight some of

the notable features and innovations in the Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An important feature of the new Bill is that

every effort



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



has  been  made  to systematise and  arrange  the

relevant  sections  into separate  self-contained

parts   to   enable  easy  reference  and   imple

mentation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Public Health Authority and the Commissioner

of  Public  Health  shall  work  subject  to  the

general or special directions of the Minister.  A

necessary  separation of policy and  professional

functions  from  operational functions  is  being

achieved  as  the  public health responsibilities

of  Singapore are now too complex to be  combined

in  one  authority. This will enable  the  separa

tion of line and staff functions and improve  the

day-to-day  administration  of  the  Act.   These

provisions are parallel to those in the  recently

enacted  Destruction  of Disease-Bearing  Insects

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Major changes have been brought in the

provisions  for public cleansing in Part  III  of

the  Bill  to tackle the massive public cleansing

problems in an urban community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Part VI provides for the licensing of food

establishments  and  contains  provisions   which

ensure  a  more effective and rational  approach.

The  existing  laws are not very satisfactory  as

there  was  overlap between different legislation

(e.g.,  the Food and Drugs Ordinance);  moreover,

their content was also inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Part XII seeks to regulate and control swimming

pools  and public swimming pools (as defined)  by

licensure: no control now exists and it  is  felt

that if these remain un-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



checked,  they  will  grow into  a  serious  health

hazard  in  the future. The extent of eye-infection

and  other infections from such swimming  pools  is

on the increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) With the increasing and intense urban development

of   Singapore  towards  multi-storey   structure,

funeral  parlours will come into  more  prominence

though  at  present  this  is  only  an  incipient

problem.  Hence,  provisions  have  been  made  to

regulate  funeral parlours (Part XIII).  The  fact

that  funeral  parlours come under  Part  XIII  is

purely incidental.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Another innovation is the efficacious power given

to   the  Commissioner,  the  Medical  Officer  of

Health  and the Public Health Engineer to  execute

the  necessary works specified in a notice in  the

event of failure to comply by the persons on  whom

such  notice  had been served and,  what  is  more

important,   the  power  to  recover   costs   and

expenses  of such works. Such action can be  taken

without prejudice to any proceedings that  may  be

instituted  against the offender,  whether  before

or  after the commencement or conclusion  of  such

proceedings;    this   is   important    in    the

circumstances  where  the  default   or   omission

causes  a nuisance or offence to the community  at

large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) To speed up enforcement action, powers have been

given  to  the Commissioner to compound  specified

offences   committed  under  this   Act   or   any

regulations made there under. Provisions are  also

made  under certain sections for offenders  to  be

ticketed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) For the first time comprehensive provisions with

heavy penalties have been included



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



to  deal  with  littering by persons  and  from

moving vehicles in public places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) There has been a general upward revision of

penalties   so   that   they   are   not   only

commensurate  with the offence but  also  serve

as a deterrent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a more detailed review of the

provisions of the new Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I (Preliminary) sets out the definitions

necessary  for purposes of the Bill. In  view  of  the

omnibus  nature of the Bill, the Minister is empowered

to   appoint  different  dates  for  the  coming  into

operation  of  the different Parts or  the  provisions

thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II (Administration) deals with the manner in

which  the  Act  is  to be administered.  The  overall

professional  direction will be vested in  the  Public

Health Authority consisting of the senior professional

health officials of the Ministry. This is provided  in

clause  3.  The Act itself will be administered  by  a

"Commissioner of Public Health", who, under clause  4,

will  be assisted by such Deputy and Assistant  Commis

sioner as may be necessary. Provisions have been  made

in  clause 5 for the appointment of one or more public

health  engineers,  in  clause  6  for  public  health

auxiliaries and other employees, and in clause  7  for

the appointment of committees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III (Public Cleansing) deals with all aspects

of public cleansing in an urban setting - cleansing of

public  streets,  private streets,  removal  of  trade

refuse  and  the collection and removal of refuse  and

nightsoil. The Commissioner is empowered, under clause

12,  to make applicable systems for the collection and

removal of refuse and nightsoil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the removal of refuse particularly

from  blocks  of  flats, housing  estates,  industrial

complexes and the like, provisions have been  made  in

clause  16  whereby the Commissioner may  require  any

developer  (as  defined) or owner  or  owners  of  any

premises or group of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



premises  to  provide or construct  at  their  expense

dustbins  and  other  convenient receptacles  and  for

refuse  bin  centres to be constructed at  appropriate

situations within the property wherein may  be  placed

dustbins and other receptacles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in multi-storey developments where

removal  of refuse is by means of a refuse chute,  the

responsibility for maintaining such refuse chutes  has

been  placed  on  the owners of any building  or  part

thereof  served by such chute. This is  laid  down  in

clause 17.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 provides that the occupier of any house or

premises who keeps or allows any refuse or filth to be

kept  for  more than 48 hours, causing a  nuisance  to

neighbours, will be liable on conviction to a fine not

exceeding  $500, and to a further fine  not  exceeding

$50  for  every  day  during  which  the  offence   is

continued after conviction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an expressed prohibition in clause 22

against  unauthorised  collection  of  nightsoil   and

against refusal of any service provided by the  Commis

sioner  for  the collection and removal of  nightsoil.

The sale of nightsoil is prohibited in clause 23.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said just now, for the first time,

comprehensive   provisions   against   littering   and

depositing  refuse in public places (as defined)  and,

interalia,  against  drying of food,  spilling  earth,

throwing or leaving behind any bottle, food container,

etc.,  in  public places are contained in  clause  26.

These  offences render a person liable, on conviction,

to  a fine not exceeding $500, and in case of a second

and  subsequent  conviction to a  fine  not  exceeding

$2,000. A more severe penalty for a first offence will

be   imposed  on  any  person  who,  during   building

operations,  deposits  building  materials,  etc.,  in

public  places or fails to take reasonable precautions

to  prevent  the danger to the life or  well-being  of

persons using the public places or from such things as

falling dust or fragments. This is laid down in clause

27.  For  speedy enforcement, any person  contravening

clause 26 or 27 is liable to be ticketed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV (Markets) provides for the proper licensing

and  control  of  public markets  as  well  as  private

markets,   including   the  medical   examination   and

immunisation of stall-holders. At the moment,  the  law

for  the  control  of  private markets  is  inadequate.

Besides,  stall-holders are not permitted under  clause

35  to erect any extension or effect any alteration  to

any  stall in any market without the permission of  the

Commissioner.  Clause 36 imposes the responsibility  on

licensees and stall-holders to keep markets and  stalls

in  a  clean  and sanitary condition and penalties  for

failure  to  take such steps. In case  of  default  the

Commissioner  can carry out the work and recover  costs

and expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V (Hawkers) contains effective provisions for

the   control   of  hawkers.  Clause  38   specifically

prohibits  hawkers from hawking within 50  yards  of  a

market,   school,   hospital,  government   dispensary,

clinic,  place  of  worship  or  police  station.  Food

hawkers  will be required to be medically examined  and

immunised  against infectious diseases. The  provisions

with  regard  to the licensing and control  of  hawkers

operating  stalls and itinerant hawkers have  been  re-

enacted with some amendments in clauses 40 and 41.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI (Food Establishments) provides for the

licensing  of food establishments (as defined)  as  set

out  in  the  First Schedule to the Bill  and  contains

provisions  which ensure a more effective and  rational

approach  on  this  subject.  Similar  provisions  with

regard  to  the  employment of persons  suffering  from

infectious  diseases and also their medical examination

and  immunisation against infectious diseases have been

incorporated. The Minister is empowered under clause 48

to  make  regulations covering various matters relating

to the control of food establishments like preparation,

storage,  transport and sale of food and to secure  the

observance  of  hygienic conditions  and  practices  in

connection therewith.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII (Public Nuisance) generally re-enacts with

some   amendments   and  heavier   penalties   existing

provisions relating to public nuisances. Its scope  has

been  widened  to include pollution of reservoirs  used

for  the storage of water for public consumption. Where

any  nuisance  arises  from  any  want  or  defect   of

structural character, this shall be dealt with  by  the

Chief Building Surveyor under clause 49.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII (Insanitary buildings and obstructive

buildings) confers more efficacious powers to deal with



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) premises which are in a filthy or unwholesome

state or overgrown with rank vegetation or in an

insanitary state as to be a danger to the health

of  the persons in the premises or in the  neigh

bourhood;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) houses or buildings requiring to be cleansed,

lime-washed or disinfected for sanitary reasons;

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) rat or vermin infested premises constituting a

health hazard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical officers of health and public health

engineers  may in all these cases direct the  owner  or

occupier by notice in writing to take such measures  as

are  considered necessary, and on non - compliance with

the  notice, to execute the measures specified  in  the

notice  and  to  recover  costs  and  expenses  thereby

incurred by the person in default. Such action  may  be

taken without prejudice to any proceedings against  the

offender  and  whether before or after the commencement

or conclusion of such proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IX (Sanitary conveniences, drains, sewers and

wells)  contains a number of new provisions. Clause  67

provides   that  before  approving  plans,  the   Chief

Building Surveyor may consult the Commissioner  on  the

adequacy of sanitary conveniences provided for the  new

building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owners of buildings will now be required under

clauses  68  and  69  to  make  good  insufficient  and

defective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



sanitary  conveniences  and  to  carry  out  necessary

repairs  and maintenance. Clause 70 provides that  any

building  which  is  used  as  a  workplace  shall  be

provided   with  adequate  and  satisfactory  sanitary

conveniences as the Commissioner may deem fit.  Clause

72  provides  for  the proper care of  sanitary  conve

niences  that  are used in common by  members  of  the

public or by the employees or in common by two or more

families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obstruction, diversion, covering or any

interference  with any public drain or  public  water-

course  without prior approval in writing of  the  Com

missioner   is   prohibited  under  clause   75.   The

construction and maintenance of private  drains  in  a

satisfactory state is provided for in clause 76.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part X (General health requirements for buildings)

contains  a  new  measure whereby the  Chief  Building

Surveyor   may,   under   clause   80,   consult   the

Commissioner  on the health and sanitary  requirements

of  any  new buildings before approving any plans  and

specifications thereto, and, in so far as is possible,

to  give effect to any advice that may be tendered  by

the  Commissioner.  Clause 81 requires  the  owner  or

occupier  or the lessee of any building to  which  the

public  have access to keep such building  or  portion

thereof  in  a  clean condition. The  Commissioner  is

empowered  under  clause 82 to  require  employers  to

provide  for  their  employees if  the  conditions  or

circumstances  under  which  such  employees  work  so

warrant, suitable and sufficient facilities by way  of

mess rooms, rest rooms, canteens or changing rooms  or

to improve upon the same if the Commissioner considers

the  existing facilities inadequate. Under clause  83,

the  Commissioner may also direct the owner,  occupier

or  lessee of any premises to take proper measures  to

control offensive conditions that may occur within his

premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part XI (Offensive trades) re-enacts with amendments

existing provisions for the licensing of premises used

for purposes of the offensive trades set



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



out in the Second Schedule. This is provided in clause

85.  Clause 87 authorises the Commissioner to prohibit

the use of any particular place or area for all or any

of the purposes set out in the Second Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part XII (Swimming pools) provides for the first

time  for the licensing and control of swimming  pools

to  which  the  public  have access,  whether  or  not

admission  is gained by payment. Within the  ambit  of

this  Part  come  swimming pools  managed  by  hotels,

clubs, associations or other organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner may close swimming pools under

certain  specified circumstances as set out in  clause

91.  The Minister is empowered to make regulations  to

provide for standards of cleanliness, purity of  water

in  swimming pools and for regulating the  conduct  of

persons  admitted  thereto. Swimming  pools  owned  by

Government  come within the scope of this Part  except

provisions regarding licensing and penalties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part XIII (Funeral parlours, cemeteries and

crematoria) introduces new provisions (clauses 95  and

96)  with  regard  to  the licensing  and  control  of

funeral  parlours which are defined as premises  where

corpses  are received fot purposes of preparation  for

burial or cremation and for carrying out funeral rites

and ceremonies prior to burial or cremation. Clause 97

lays  down that the corpse of any person who has  died

of  any  infectious  disease  set  out  in  the  Third

Schedule shall not be received into a funeral parlour.

The  existing provisions in respect of cemeteries  and

crematoria have been incorporated with amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part XIV (Miscellaneous) contains various provisions

necessary  for effectively carrying out the  functions

and purposes of this Bill, namely:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) powers of entry, as provided in clause 108;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) protection of the officers from personal

liability for any act or thing done under the Act;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) penalties for persons obstructing public

officers  from carrying out their duties  under

the Act; these are laid down in clause 111;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) obtaining mandatory order, as provided in

clause 112;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) procedures for recovery of costs and expenses

payable by owners; these are set out in clauses 119, 122, 123 and 124;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) services of notices, as required in clause 117;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) general provisions with regard to licences, as

laid down in clause 127;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) the Commissioner may compound specified

offences;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the power of the Minister to make regulations

is provided in clause 141; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) the Commissioner in his discretion may under

clause  144  exempt  any class  of  persons  or

premises from any of the provisions of the  Act

for specified periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environmental Public Health Bill will make a

major   contribution  towards  improved  environmental

health  practice  in Singapore and  its  enactment  is

essential  for a clean and healthy Singapore.  I  have

every  confidence  that  given  the  support  and  co-

operation  of  the people, we shall make  Singapore  a

cleaner  and  healthier place, not only  in  Southeast

Asia,  but  comparable to the best in the  world  -  a

country  of  which  we  can  be  proud.  We  shall  be

establishing  better living conditions  for  an  urban

community  -  norms which will make for  a  healthier,

better   and  more  pleasant  life  for  everyone   in

Singapore. "These standards will keep morale high, the

sickness rate low, and so create the necessary  social

conditions for higher economic growth in industry  and

in tourism." I have no doubt that this Bill will serve

the short- and long, term objectives of Singapore well

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



enhance the environmental conditions of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>8.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

understand  the necessity for the Minister for  Health

to introduce the Environmental Public Health Bill. The

intention is good because he wants Singapore to become

the  cleanest  city  in this part  of  the  world.  In

October,  he  launched  an island-wide  public  health

campaign which received the general support of  people

of  all walks of life. He has now consolidated all the

original   laws  on  public  health   and   has   also

incorporated new provisions into the Bill  before  the

House.  The  move to introduce this Bill is worthwhile

and will win the support of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains some very strict provisions which

will  affect the livelihood of our people,  especially

those living in the rural areas. These provisions,  if

strictly implemented, may cause a lot of inconvenience

to  them. Clause 24 which prohibits the use of  night-

soil or human excreta as manure is one such provision.

Sir,  I  think you will agree with me that  the  rural

people  are  generally poor. Their livelihood  depends

mainly on agriculture, the rearing of pigs, etc.  They

use  human  excreta as manure for the  cultivation  of

vegetables. Those farmers who do not plant  vegetables

sell  the  excreta from their domestic  animals.  This

excreta  can also be used as fertiliser for  vegetable

gardening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some provisions in the Bill will cause hardship and

an  additional financial burden - to the farmers.  One

of  the reasons is that they will have to spend  money

on  the  construction of a hygienic  pond  to  collect

manure and night-soil. This pond needs at least a  few

hundred  dollars to build. Generally, the farmers  are

unable to shoulder such a burden.In addition to  this,

after  constructing a hygienic pond to collect  manure

and  night-soil, it is necessary for  the  farmers  to

engage people to do the collecting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



of  manure and night-soil. As a result, they will have

to  incur  additional expenses. If they are unable  to

sell their manure, their income will decrease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that if nightsoil or human excreta

is  not allowed to be used as manure, then the farmers

will have to buy chemical fertilisers as a substitute.

Chemical  fertilisers are expensive  and  the  farmers

find  it  difficult to pay for them. This is an  added

financial  burden on them and they will find  it  more

difficult to make a living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that we will not be too strict in the

implementation  of  the  provisions   of   the   Bill,

otherwise the livelihood of the rural people  will  be

greatly  affected. I also hope that the Minister  will

deal with the problems carefully.



<br><br>8.45p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, proceeding on the

principle that brevity is the soul of wit, I shall try

to  be as brief as possible. Sir, much as I agree with

the  Minister that the campaign to get rid of dirt and

squalor must be pursued relentlessly. I must express a

regret  that this Bill is being taken through  tonight

at  this  unearthly  hour. Frankly speaking,  Sir,  in

trying to go through the Bill last night, I managed to

cover about 10 pages only and I came across 18 penalty

clauses  and about ten forced payment clauses  whereby

the  Ministry officials can undertake construction  or

work  and cause the defaulter to pay the Ministry  the

cost of that undertaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a harsh Bill, Sir. Some of the provisions are

highly  loaded and, in fact, some of them are  double-

barrelled.  If I may refer the Minister, for  example,

to clause 26 (7) , which, in my opinion, is a provision

that  can  impose excessive hardship. You  will  note,

Sir, that this clause reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Upon a person arrested in pursuance of a warrant

issued  under  subsection (6) of  this  section  being

produced before it,..'



<br><br>In  other  words, this is the case of the accused  not

having  complied  with  the summons  and  therefore  a

warrant of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



arrest  has  been  issued and  the  accused  has  been

apprehended. It continues to

read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...a Court shall proceed as though he were produced

before it in pursuance of

subsection  (1)  of  this section  and  shall  at  the

conclusion of such proceedings...'



<br><br>That means the proceedings in sub-clause (1) . In other

words,  the  accused  shall be  tried  and,  if  found

convicted, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... call upon him to show cause why he should not

be punished for failing to attend

in  compliance with the notice delivered to him and if

cause  be not shown may order him to pay such  penalty

not exceeding two thousand dollars as the Court thinks

fit  or  may  commit  him to prison  for  a  term  not

exceeding two months.'



<br><br>In  other words, if the accused has not complied  with

the  summons,  a warrant is issued to arrest  him  and

bring him before the Court. There he is tried for  the

substantive offence and convicted thereon. Having been

convicted, he is also asked to show cause why  he  did

not  comply  with the original summons  in  the  first

place  and he is again convicted. Sir, this is what  I

mean  by a double-barrelled provision. I think  it  is

unnecessarily harsh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another unhappy clause, if I may refer the Minister

to it, is clause 19 (2) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Without prejudice to any proceeding& under

subsection (1) of this section and whether  before  or

after   the   commencement  or  conclusion   of   such

proceedings, the cause of the nuisance may be  removed

by the Commissioner.'



<br><br>This  is where you might have a case pending, and  it

continues to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...who may recover the costs and expenses thereby

incurred from the occupier

or  the  owner of the house or premises in the  manner

provided under section 119 of this Act.'



<br><br>Where  the  accused is the occupier or  owner  of  the

house, there is a case proceeding against him and  the

nuisance:  is removed. In other words, the exhibit  of

the case is removed and his whole case might depend on

that  exhibit.  So, first of all, he is prejudiced  to

the extent that the exhibit is removed and,, secondly,

he has got to pay the cost of the removal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am rather unhappy with such provisions. Perhaps

the Minister may have some explanation because, as he

said, the preparation of this Bill has taken about  a

year.  But  I must express a regret that  this  is  a

harsh  Bill  and,  unfortunately,  we  do  not   have

sufficient time to ponder over it.



<br><br>8.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

like the Member for Jurong, I feel compelled to voice

my  apprehension over the likely adverse effects upon

the  agricultural sector if certain  clauses  of  the

Bill  are to be enforced immediately. The Member  for

Jurong  has touched upon clause 24 and other  clauses

in  the Bill where the farming communities are likely

to be affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would request that a period of grace be allowed

after this Bill has become law, during which time the

attention  of  the  communities  may  be  drawn  more

closely to the changes under the law. In this regard,

perhaps  some  arrangements  can  be  made  with  the

various  centres of the Primary Production Department

and  the community centres in the rural areas whereby

they  will  help  in explaining to  the  farmers  the

practical implications of the relevant sections under

the law. In all cases of offences in the rural areas,

warnings should preferably be issued first before any

punitive action is taken during the initial period of

implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting forward this appeal on behalf of the

rural folk, I should perhaps mention that in a number

of areas in the rural districts there are still inade

quate sewerage and drainage systems. The disposal  of

rubbish  is  also  a  headache  in  the  absence   of

provision  for  a collection service  by  the  Public

Health  Department. I fully appreciate that with  the

process  of  redevelopment going on  continuously  it

will  be wasteful to spend vast sums of money on  the

improvement of sewers and drains in areas  which  are

scheduled  for redevelopment shortly.  But  in  those

areas which are unlikely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



to  be redeveloped in the foreseeable future, perhaps

something  can  be  done to carry out  the  necessary

improvements which will have a direct bearing  on  en

vironmental health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of disposal of rubbish in the rural

areas,   I  understand  that  the  matter  is   being

considered by the Minister, and I shall appreciate it

if the Minister can advise the House whether any plan

has been formulated.

<br><br>8.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, after one

month of the "Keep Singapore Clean" campaign, we  can

say  that we have achieved some improvements  in  our

public  health. In order to ensure a continuation  of

this  high standard, the Minister has tabled in  this

House a Bill known as the Environmental Public Health

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is being introduced with all good

intentions  and  deserves our  support.  But  in  the

enforcement  of  this Bill there are  some  technical

problems  and  difficulties which may  give  rise  to

public  inconvenience  and we  have  some  misgivings

about  it.  From November this year, the Ministry  of

Health has taken action to ensure the observance of a

high  standard of public health among the  people.  I

have since received several complaints against police

officers  and  public  health  inspectors  for  their

unreasonableness. According to the law, every  hawker

is  required to provide a receptacle beside his stall

and  to  maintain general hygienic conditions  around

his stall. The provision does not clearly say whether

that has to be complied with during the peak hours of

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one bean-sprouts (tow gay) hawker who is

licensed to do business in the morning and when he is

kept  busy  during morning business hours, action  is

taken  against  him for not keeping  his  pitch  area

clean.  There  is another place where the  unlicensed

hawkers  customarily congregate. One  morning,  after

the unlicensed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



hawkers   were   chased  away  by  the   Housing   and

Development Board staff, there was a heap  of  rubbish

left  outside a coffee-shop. Soon after, two policemen

came  and took down the particulars of the coffee-shop

owner for an offence for which he was not responsible.

From  these  instances,  we  can  see  that  the   law

enforcement officers did not know what they should  do

so  as  not to cause any unhappiness among members  of

the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will take note of this and give

suitable  instructions to the officers regarding  this

matter.



<br><br>8.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Sir, I can only speak as the

Member  for  Joo  Chiat. Jon Chiat constituency  is  a

relatively clean area compared with many other  areas.

But  there are a number of black spots. These are  the

kampongs  and  back-lanes.  The  properties   in   the

kampongs  are mainly privately owned and are not  very

healthy due to the presence of the cesspools there.  A

lack of proper drainage has caused these cesspools  to

be  formed. They are thus found in the low-lying areas

of  these  kampongs. Not unnaturally,  mosquitoes  and

flies thrive, leading to a mosquito or fly "population

explosion".  I am afraid the owners of the  properties

in  these kampongs are not particularly susceptible to

verbal or polite requests to construct proper drainage

systems  for their properties. Sir, clause 76  of  the

Bill  will  undoubtediy go far towards  improving  the

hygienic and health standards of the dwellers in these

kampongs and also in the surrounding areas when proper

drainage is enforced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back-lanes are also one of my headaches. Back-lanes

were  originally  used for night-soil  collection  and

perhaps even for fire escape purposes. Today, with the

introduction of a modern sewerage system in Joo Chiat,

the  back-lanes  have  been neglected  by  the  health

authorities  and  are slowly but surely  reverting  to

miniature  lalang jungles. This is not  a  tribute  to

Singapore as a garden city. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



inhabitants  of  the houses flanking these  back-lanes

are  also contributing to their deterioration by using

them  as  dumping grounds. Admittedly, Sir, the  "Keep

Singapore Clean" campaign did help clean up this place

a  bit. But this is not good enough because nowhere in

the  Bill,  no matter how harsh it is, can I  see  any

constructive  proposals  to  do  something  to   these

neglected back-lanes. They have been so neglected that

unless some measures are taken to clean them up,  none

of  us  will  be proud of them. Can some  measures  be

taken  to have them cemented so that they will  become

playgrounds for our thousands of children who live  in

the houses flanking them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens says that this Bill

is  harsh.  In  my opinion, Sir, the  Bill  should  be

harsher.  It is only by being harsh that our  citizens

will realise the necessity for a cleaner and healthier

Singapore.  I am sure through the efforts  of  a  very

determined  Minister  for  Health  and  also   equally

determined  members of his staff,  Singapore  will  be

healthier and cleaner in the years to come.

<br><br>9.00p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, a few moments

ago, the Minister for Health moved

the  Second  Reading  of a Bill which  is  fascist  in

character.  This  is not correct  because  ours  is  a

democratic   country.  The  "Keep   Singapore   Clean"

campaign  was started about a month ago and  overnight

Singapore looked different. Why should there be a need

for  such  a  Bill  now? Singapore was  already  clean

enough  before this Bill was brought up. We  must  use

persuasion  on the people to cultivate  the  habit  of

cleanliness.  We  must not impose heavy  penalties  to

force  them  to  do  so. We can hold  competitions  in

cleanliness  among them and encourage  them  to  adopt

clean  habits. They have been making progress  without

the  imposition of harsh laws. A committee  comprising

representatives  of hawkers, market  stallholders  and

flat-dwellers  - in fact, representatives  of  people

from  all  walks of life - should be set  up  to  look

after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



public health. We do not have to resort to harsh  laws

being rushed through this Parliament to promote public

health.  In  my  opinion, this ~ not a proper  way  of

going about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, I certainly

would not like to be accused of approaching this  Bill

with a pitiless heart as evinced by the Member for J00

Chiat and perhaps even by the Minister for Health.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>9.04 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think it may be proper for me to say that the

Bill  has  come  at  the right time  after  the  right

psychological attitudes have been developed among  the

people  of Singapore as a result of the recent  health

campaign.  The  Bill introduces for  the  first  time,

under  pain of penal sanctions, a complete  system  of

hygiene  which is necessary if we are to cash  in  and

see   to  it  that  we  do  not  fall  back  on   past

misdemeanours after the health campaign that  we  have

gone through. It is true to say that the penal clauses

introduced  all  over the Bill are a  bit  severe.  In

fact,  as  a  lawyer  trained  in  the  rudiments   of

humanism,  I  think the penal clauses go  against  the

grain.  It  may be difficult for doctors to understand

this!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to expand a little bit on Part XIII of

the Bill which, as the Minister has said, consolidates

existing  provisions  in so far as  a  crematorium  is

concerned. We have an old crematorium in Mount  Vernon

which, unfortunately, is not being used as effectively

as  it  ought  to be. Most people do not know  of  its

existence.  I  would like to say that, for  all  these

people who are not inhibited by either convictions  or

religion, some kind of campaign ought to be started by

the  Ministry of Health to encourage the use  of  this

crematorium so that we can be spared the use of a  lot

of  land  which is a very precious commodity in  Singa

pore.  The Ministry could start an educative  campaign

for people - especially



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



before  they die - so that they may be able to convert

their  respective families to the view that once  they

die  they  would  want  their bodies  to  be  cremated

instead of buried. If this kind of transformation  can

be brought about,, then, of course, a lot of land will

be  saved and we will not have to go into the  problem

of exhumation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of the severe penal clauses, I would

also  like  to  refer to clauses 109 and  110.  Severe

inroads  have  already been made into  the  rights  of

private property. I think these two clauses are a  bit

too   much.  They  give  unnecessary  powers  to   the

authorities  concerned with regard to the  payment  of

compensation  to  the owners of property.  Clause  109

deals  with  the power to enter on lands  adjacent  to

works   and  to  take  over  the  lands  for  specific

purposes.  Clause 110 exonerates people who take  over

the  lands from whatever misdemeanours they  may  have

committed  in  the  course of their duties.  I  wonder

sometimes  whether such provisions are  necessary  not

merely in this particular Bill but also in other Bills

which  are being brought up in this Parliament by  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, I would like to congratulate the

Minister on having introduced this Bill. It may  be  a

necessarily  painful Bill, but I  think  many  of  the

penal  clauses could have been watered down  and  made

far  more  humane. Perhaps in the application  of  the

Bill  itself, some form of humanism will be  shown  by

the authorities concerned.



<br><br>9.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  thank the various. Members who spoke in support of

or at least agreed in principle with the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I reply to certain valid points raised by hon.

Members  in  order to clarify the whole position?  The

first  refers to the prohibition of the sale of night-

soil  and the prohibition of the use of night-soil  as

manure. This point was raised by the Member for Jurong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



and  the Member for Jalan Kayu. Mr Speaker, Sir, from

the  health point of view, night-soil, in fact, is not

a  suitable manure for vegetables. In April this year,

the  day  after  I  took  office,  we  had  a  cholera

epidemic.  I think common sense will tell us  -  apart

from  the  advice of doctors that it is very dangerous

to  use  night-soil as manure. There can be  a  severe

epidemic  outbreak in Singapore if the  night-soil  is

contaminated. This is definitely not in  the  interest

of the community at large. I do sympathise in the same

way  as  other Members with the plight of the farmers.

But  I  believe that farmers should keep up  with  the

times. After all, we are now living in a technological

age.  The  farmers should switch over to  the  use  of

artificial manure or other types of manure than  human

excreta.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu said that a certain period

of  grace should be given before the provisions in the

Bill  are  implemented. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we  in  the

Health Ministry are reasonable people. We always  give

the  required warnings. As I have often said, we  only

punish  the  incorrigibles and the  recalcitrants.  In

fact,  many of the summonses issued are against  those

people who are quite incorrigible. But when they  come

to   the  "meet-the-people"  session,  they  tell  sad

stories  and  make  themselves out  as  very  pleasant

people and paint the public health officers as devils.

I  can assure hon. Members that public health officers

act  with  discretion and that action  is  taken  only

after warnings have been issued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens and the Member for

Bukit Panjang remarked that this is a harsh Bill. I do

realise that both the hon. Members are members of  the

legal  profession. They do have to plead in mitigation

when  they  go to court. So I can well understand  the

thinking  that prompted them to say that the  Bill  is

too harsh. On the other hand, the Member for J00 Chiat

is more a realistic person. He said that the Bill does

not  go far enough. I leave it to Members of the House

to  judge  for themselves. We should not whittle  down

the clauses of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



the  Bill in such a way as to make it ineffective.  If

we pass a Bill with no teeth in it, our time here will

have  been wasted. I would like to inform hon. Members

that  we in the Health Ministry are reasonable  people

and  that we will use our discretion when we implement

the  Bill. Contrary to what the Member for Ulu  Pandan

has  said,  we  are  not  Fascists  in  our  attitude.

Unfortunately, having made the accusation, the  Member

has  left this Chamber. He has not waited for a reply.

Incidentally,  if he says that we are undemocratic,  I

cannot  see  how  more democratic we can  be  than  by

having this debate on all the provisions of the  Bill.

Unfortunately, the Member for Ulu Pandan  having  made

the accusation has left the Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. There was much mention about

the  costs and expenses to be recovered from work that

is  undertaken by the Health Ministry. Unless we  have

such  a  provision,  I  am  afraid  it  will  not   be

effective, because if we do not recover the costs  and

expenses, then everyone will create nuisances and just

invite  the Health Ministry to do the work. They  will

get the work done free and this will encourage them to

create  more  nuisances in the future.  On  the  other

hand,  now that we have the provision to recover costs

and  expenses,  I  am quite sure that  it  will  be  a

deterrent to members of the public not to create  such

nuisances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru did say something about

the  rudeness of several Health Ministry officials who

implemented  the law after 1st November. This  is  the

first time I have heard such a complaint from him.  As

a  matter  of fact, we in the Health Ministry  welcome

such  complaints. If there is any specific allegation,

we will certainly look into it. We have even set up an

"Operations Room" and the Member for Tiong  Bahru  can

just take up the telephone and make his complaint.  In

other  words,  the  Health Ministry  is  giving  every

facility  not only to the Member for Tiong  Bahru  but

also   to  members  of  the  public  to  lodge   their

complaints.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chua, the Member for Ulu Pandan has

come back!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I am glad, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that he has come back. If there are any complaints  of

rudeness  on the part of Health Ministry officials,  I

would  invite not only the Member for Tiong Bahru  but

every  Member of this House to specify the allegations

so  that we can look into them and appropriate  action

can  be  taken. In fact, we will be extremely grateful

to  members  of  the public to come forward  with  the

complaints. As hon. Members know, we are waging a  war

against filth and squalor. To win such a war, we  need

sufficient "intelligence" of what is going on outside.

In  fact,  we regard such complaints as "intelligence"

information and we can very well use it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the point brought up by the Member for

Joo  Chiat about some black spots in Joo Chiat  consti

tuency. Here again, the Member for Joo Chiat is  quite

free  to take up the telephone and make his complaints

to  our Operations Room and they will be attended  to.

What I wish to point out is this. The question of back-

lanes  being  turned into slums is a  general  problem

which  I  do not think the Health Ministry  alone  can

solve.  It  needs a number of Ministries to deal  with

it. If a person puts up an illegal structure in a back-

lane  and lives in it, it does need action by  way  of

resettlement. I do not think the Health Ministry alone

can deal with the question of resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of lalang and the

cementing  of back-lanes. As far as lalang  jungle  or

tertiary or secondary jungle being allowed to grow  in

back-lanes   is   concerned,  although   it   is   not

specifically  dealt  with  in  this  Bill,  there  are

provisions   in  the  Destruction  of  Disease-Bearing

Insects  Act to deal with this problem, if the  Member

for  Joo  Chiat remembers. If it does create nuisances

or  causes the breeding of insects, appropriate action

can  be  taken  under  the Act.  With  regard  to  the

cementing of back-lanes, as the Minister for Health, I

would  be  happy  to have back-lanes cemented  because

that would solve my problem. But the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



Joo  Chiat will understand that it does need money  to

buy  the  cement and get the work done. As our Finance

Minister told us last week, we have to operate  within

a  certain budget. I suggest the Member for Joo  Chiat

go round with the Citizens' Consultative Committee and

collect some money for this job. The work of cementing

the back-lanes can then be undertaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan also said that there was

no  necessity for this Bill to be passed. He said that

what  we  need  do  is just to persuade  people,  hold

competitions and give rewards and so on. He said  that

the  success  of  the campaign which  we  launched  in

October  indicated  that  by talking  to  people,  per

suading  them, holding competitions, we  could  get  a

cleaner Singapore. If that were true, I would be  very

happy.  We need not then enforce the law to  see  that

health  hazards are not created. I am afraid I do  not

subscribe   to  such  idealism.  Even  in  the   "Keep

Singapore Clean" campaign, which was the final  effort

to  put  the message across, there was always  at  the

back  of the minds of the people the thought that  law

enforcement  would  follow as from 1st  November,  and

that   did,  to  some  extent,  contribute  to  making

Singapore  a  cleaner place. It was not just  the  com

petitions and persuasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point brought up by the Member for Ulu

Pandan  was that, by having a committee consisting  of

members  of  the  public - hawkers and  market  stall-

holders  they  would be in a better position  to  keep

Singapore clean. If that could be done, I would gladly

relinquish  my post as Health Minister and allow  this

committee  to  operate.  But,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  my

experience of committees is that there is always a lot

of talk but very little action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a very relevant point was brought up by the

Member  for Bukit Panjang concerning the Mount  Vernon

Crematorium.  According to him, very few  people  know

about  its existence and we should organise a campaign

to publicise its existence. I cannot agree



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



with  him more that greater use should be made of  the

crematorium  because  of  the  shortage  of  land  for

burial. But I believe we have other more urgent public

health  matters to organise campaigns on than  on  the

use  of this crematorium. I believe I have now covered

the whole ground of the debate on this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a
