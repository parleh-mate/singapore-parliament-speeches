   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Use of contributions for purchase of private housing)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether he will reconsider the use of Central Provident Fund contributions for the purchase of private residential flats and houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the issue on whether to allow the use of CPF contributions for the purchase of private housing has been raised many times in this House. The Member's request for the use of CPF monies for the purchase of privately-built residential properties has been consistently turned down in the House since 1971. I am afraid the answer this time is the same.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housing needs of the lower income workers are adequately taken care of by allowing them to use their CPF savings to buy HDB/JTC flats. In July last year the Housing and Development Board raised its
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> qualifying monthly family income ceiling to $2,500. In the case of middle income workers, they may use their CPF savings to buy HUDC flats and houses. The decision of HUDC in April this year to raise the monthly family income ceiling from $4,000 to $6,000 will also go a long way to meet the housing needs of the great majority of those in the middle income group. The housing needs of our workers have been largely met and there is, therefore, no compelling reason to reconsider the use of CPF contributions for the purchase of private residential flats and houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what is the Minister of State's justification for disallowing CPF members to withdraw their contributions? He must be aware that the funds are being eroded by inflation year after year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, they are allowed to withdraw their savings to buy HDB, HUDC and JTC flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> If they are allowed to withdraw their savings to buy HUDC and HDB flats, why cannot they be allowed to use their CPF money to buy private houses? This is the only way to protect their money from being eroded by inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I think we are going into a long argument over this. But knowing the number of people who have the money to buy privately-built houses, I think the hon. Member will probably agree with me that the number is very small. The hon. Member surely knows the cost of a privately-built house these days, and even if they were to withdraw the full credit in their CPF account I do not think there are many people who can afford to buy them.

   <b>ELECTRICITY SUPPLY TO PULAU UBIN</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for the Environment whether the Public Utilities Board will reconsider supplying electricity by means of generators to the residents of Pulau Ubin now that the contractor on whom the islanders had relied for their electricity supply has ceased such supply, thus affecting a community centre and about 150 families.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Utilities Board's investigation shows that the residents of Pulau Ubin are unwilling to pay higher prices due to higher operating costs, thereby causing the contractor to cease operations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was explained to the hon. Member for Changi in March 1977 and again in March 1979 when the question on supply of electricity to Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong was raised that it would be too expensive for the PUB to provide electricity, whether through submarine cables from the mainland or by diesel generator sets installed on the islands. With higher costs today, it would be even more expensive and not viable for the Board to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of residents have now purchased their own small capacity generating sets. This appears to be the best solution for the time being.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Hon. Minister whether the Public Utilities Board will
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> provide any technical assistance should another private contractor decide to take over the project?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, should there be another contractor who is willing to provide electricity to the island by the use of a generating set, the PUB will certainly give technical assistance or advice.

  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng) (for the Minister for the Environment)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir. inspectors from my Ministry carry out regular inspections of school canteens to ensure that a high standard of food hygiene is maintained. Food samples are taken regularly for analysis. Stallholders and their assistants are medically screened and inoculated against typhoid. In addition, individual schools have school canteen committees to look into the daily operations and quality of food sold by canteen stallholders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will take enforcement action against any stallholder found operating under unhygienic conditions or selling contaminated food. In the past one year, 18 stall-holders in various school canteens were convicted and fined in court for selling contaminated food, not maintaining clean stalls and for unhygienic handling of food.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, may I know whether the number of inspectors that the Ministry of the Environment has is sufficient to carry out the so-called regular inspections which he referred to, and what is the time-frequency of the regular inspections that he is talking about?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, as far as the staff is concerned, it depends on the circumstances. For example, if an out-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> break of an infectious disease has occurred, we will have some difficulty in deploying our staff. If there is no outbreak of an infectious disease then, generally, the number of inspectors is quite sufficient to go round inspecting these places at least once a month. If any complaints are received, they will make more frequent visits to the schools concerned.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he will consider extending the Upper Timescale or introducing a new Superscale grade to narrow the gap between the two grades of the Administrative Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall always be prepared to consider demonstrable improvements to the salary structure of our Civil Service. However, hon. Members will recall that Government reviewed the Administrative Service last year. In consequence, the salary structure of the Administrative Service has been modified, and appears to me to be satisfactory.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superscale Grades in the Government Service form the top management in the Service. The thinking, therefore, is that there should be a clear distinction between the Timescale grades and the Superscale grades to reflect their respective status and responsibilities. Such a distinction should be maintained and reflected by a significant differential in the salaries for Timescale grades and Superscale grades. It is not desirable to mar this distinction by either extending the salary scale for the Upper Timescale grade or introducing an additional Superscale grade to bridge the gap in salaries between them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, I believe the present differential between the Upper Timescale and the Superscale 'H'
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> grades is about 33%. Whilst I appreciate the Minister's contention to retain the distinction between the Timescale officers and the Superscale officers, would not the Minister consider that 33% is too big a gap?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the gap has been operative for quite a long time and has caused no dissatisfaction. If the Member wishes to make any suggestion I will be prepared to consider it, and I hope his representations are reflective of the opinions of people who will be affected by them.

  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, existing tenants of HDB rental flats can apply to purchase new flats. There are about 15,000 such applicants on the HDB's waiting list. These HDB tenants are already enjoying subsidised public housing unlike other applicants who are still waiting for their flats. There are no grounds to give priority or concessionary prices for the purchase of new flats to existing HDB tenants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, HDB tenants can buy their present 3-room flats as sitting tenants if the majority of the tenants in the block want to do so. They will have to pay only $200 as downpayment compared to 20% of the purchase price required for public applicants, and so far 18,574 flats have been sold to sitting tenants.

  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng</b> asked the Minister for National Development how long ago were the traffic lights at the filter lane into Nicoll Highway from the Mountbatten Road end installed and why they are not put to use.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the traffic lights at the filter lane from Mountbatten Road into Nicoll Highway were installed in 1973 and used during the 7th SEAP Games to enable pedestrians to cross to the Stadium. From experience, it was found that operation of the lights created traffic problems along Mountbatten Road. As a result, the Ministry constructed a pedestrian overhead bridge across Nicoll Highway, near the People's Association, to enable pedestrians to cross Nicoll Highway to the Stadium. The traffic lights are, therefore, redundant and will be removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to note that he is removing them. But will he remove them to a road junction in my constituency that is accident prone, that is, Jalan Satu/Old Airport Road junction?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, I will ask the PWD to look into the request.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Hon. Minister please inform the House how many more lives will have to be lost before he will expedite the installation of traffic lights at major road junctions in Ang Mo Kio, and what has accounted for the apparent delay in the installation of traffic lights?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the Member for Jalan Kayu that the installation of traffic lights in Ang Mo Kio has to be expedited. In fact, I have asked the PWD to expedite the installation of these traffic lights.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traffic lights at the junction of Avenue 3 and Avenue 8, Ang Mo Kio New Town, are currently under construction. The tender was awarded on 17th April, 1980, for a period of 2 1/2 months. The work is targeted for completion by 9th July, 1980. But because accidents have occurred quite regularly there, I have asked the PWD to ask the contractor to expedite the work. I have been informed that the traffic lights will be in operation by the end of this month, i.e. in the next few days.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the same contract, traffic lights will also be installed at the junction of Avenue 3 and Avenue 10. There will be traffic lights at nine major road junctions within Ang Mo Kio New Town. Four traffic lights are already in operation, two are under construction and three more, namely, at the junction of Avenues 5, 4, 6 and 8 will be completed within the next six months. It is rather unfortunate that a traffic accident occurred at the junction of Avenue 3 and Avenue 8 before the completion and operation of the traffic lights.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, traffic lights alone will not prevent accidents. Motorists must also exercise due caution, especially at road junctions, to prevent accidents.

  <!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the ceiling height of HDB flats in the initial years was 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 ins). It was increased to 2.6 metres (8 ft 6 ins) in 1973 upon metrication. As part of an overall pro-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> gramme to improve HDB flat designs, the ceiling height was further increased to 2.7 metres (8 ft 10 ins) in 1979. This is considered adequate and there are no plans to increase it further.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Minister enlighten the House why a minimum ceiling height of 3.2 metres has been imposed on private housing and not on HDB flats?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think most private housing units have false ceilings. Sometimes they install air-conditioners, and quite often they do install ceiling fans and other appliances. In the case of the HDB flats, however, any additional installation is under strict control. We can, therefore, allow the HDB to build flats with a lower ceiling height.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, will the Minister be as generous to the private developers if they give the same undertaking?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> No, Sir. In the case of private developers, after they have given us their undertaking, they may sell the houses. Their undertaking will, therefore, become invalid. As regards HDB flats, the HDB continues to exercise control after the sale of the flats. Therefore, there is this difference between the HDB and the private developers.

  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Jurong Town Corporation's policy is to locate industrial estates with suitable clean factories near population centres so that residents can work near their homes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Changi area is suitable for industrial development. There are population centres in the Changi and Tampines areas, and the new Changi International Airport will stimulate the growth of aviation supporting and servicing industries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC has therefore quickened the development of 106 hectares of land at the Loyang Industrial Estate. But looking ahead, JTC anticipates additional demand for factories and industrial sites in Changi. The JTC has now earmarked an additional 73 hectares of land at the Changi North Industrial Estate for industrial development. Acquisition of sites will commence towards the end of 1980. Development works will proceed immediately thereafter.

  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> double deduction against tax for expenses incurred by companies that participate in study missions organised by government agencies to countries with industries engaged in high technology work.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the device of granting of double tax deductions to companies should not be indiscriminately used as it could be abused, besides causing revenue loss. If it is in the interest of a company to participate in a study mission, it should do so, and it can deduct all legitimate expenses. Double tax deductions should not be a critical factor in determining participation in study missions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, confining the incentive to study missions organised by government agencies will discriminate against those organised by the private sector either as a group or individually.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, sufficient effective incentives already exist for manufacturers to upgrade their technology and I do not see the need for an additional incentive. Their best incentives are the benefits which a technological upgrading will bring for their enterprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what about the smaller private companies who want to see the machines for themselves before purchasing them, as they have limited capital?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, the expenses connected with their studies abroad are deductible. The companies should have at least the resources to go abroad before they can claim any tax deduction. That part of the expenses which they will incur on study missions abroad are legitimate expenses and are deductible for tax purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Sir, trade missions are granted double tax deductions. I am sure the Minister would like to encourage the smaller companies to go overseas to see these machines for themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, unlike trade missions, in the case of missions abroad to study technological developments, there are other incentives available for the latter group,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> such as the accelerated depreciation allowance for investments, investment allowance scheme, capital assistance scheme for the upgrading of industries, and small industries finance scheme for purchases of capital equipment for them to upgrade their operations. There are, therefore, sufficient incentives available for even the small companies to participate in missions abroad so as to absorb new technology which they can then introduce when they come back.

  <b>Mr E.W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a White Paper on the Report of the Electoral Boundaries Delineation Committee has been presented to Parliament as Command 8 of 1980. The Government has decided to accept all the recommendations of the Committee. The Committee recommended, inter alia, that the boundaries of 22 constituencies be re-defined so as to have a more equal representation of electors for all constituencies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The redelineation will result in the elimination of three constituencies, namely:
  <pre>
   1 Farrer Park
   2 Geylang East
   3 Upper Serangoon,
</pre> but not necessarily the elimination of the Members of Parliament concerned! The electorates of these three constituencies will be absorbed by the adjacent electoral divisions. As the total electorate for the next General Elections is expected to increase by about 228,000 electors, the Committee recommended the creation of nine new constituencies, namely:
  <pre>
   1 Ayer Rajah
   2 Cheng San
   3 Chong Boon

   7 Tanah Merah
   8 West Coast
   9 Yio Chu Kang.
</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acceptance of the Committee's recommendations will increase the number of electoral divisions from 69 to 75. This increase will come into effect as from the next general elections. It is, therefore, necessary to introduce the Parliamentary Membership Bill, 1980, to provide for the increase in the number of members to 75.

  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the clause be read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a new section 15 is to be inserted in the bill to repeal and re-enact section 22 of the Act which deals with the solemnization of a marriage. The new subsection (2) of section 22 provides that a marriage may be solemnized by the Registrar or any person licensed to solemnize marriages according to such form and ceremony as the Registrar or that person sees fit to adopt, and in some part of the ceremony each of the parties will merely have to declare to all those present that he or she is taking the other party as his or her lawful wedded wife or husband as the case may be.

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font>

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new subsection will give the Registrar or the person solemnizing a marriage some flexibility as regards the form and ceremony for the solemnization of a marriage.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6, line 39, to leave out "applicant" and insert "wife or child".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment to subsection (4) of section 60 of the Act appearing in clause 21 of the Bill seeks to make it clear that the court shall have regard to the circumstances of the wife or child when making an order under the section for the maintenance of the wife or child. The word "applicant" which now appears in subsection (4) of section 60 may be construed to refer to the guardian or person having custody of the child who is entitled to make an application under that section for an order for the maintenance of the child.
  <br>

  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the clause be read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to be made to section 21 of the Act will render void a marriage contracted in Singapore unless:
  <pre>
   (a) the parties have obtained a marriage
        licence issued by the Registrar or a
        special marriage licence issued by the
        Minister; and

   (b) the marriage is solemnized by the
        Registrar or a person who has been
        granted a licence under the Act to
        solemnize marriages.
</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section is so wide that it will render void those marriages which are contracted in a foreign Embassy, High Commission or Consulate in Singapore. The new section 167A seeks to make it clear that such marriages may continue to be contracted and it makes provision for the recognition of such marriages where all the following requirements are satisfied:
  <pre>
   (a) the marriage was contracted in the
       form required or permitted by the law
       of the country whose Embassy, High
       Commission, or Consulate it is, or in
       the form permitted under the Act;

   (b) each of the parties had at the time of
       the marriage the capacity to marry
       under the law of the country of his or
       her domicile or under the law of the

       marriage: and

   (c) in the case where either of the parties
       is a citizen of or is domiciled in
       Singapore, both parties had the capa-
       city to marry under the Act.
</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, marriages had been contracted in foreign Embassies in Singapore and we do not wish to forbid such marriages. Our law will make it clear to all concerned that such marriages will be recognised as valid in Singapore when the aforesaid requirements are satisfied.

  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Third Reading, what day?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Now, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee on this Bill received 18 written representations. I wish to express my appreciation to those persons who had given their views to the Select Committee. The Committee decided to make a number of amendments to the Bill after studying the re-presentations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 3 of the Act to make the Act apply to all persons in Singapore and also to all persons domiciled in Singapore irrespective of whether they are in or outside Singapore. The amendment has been introduced so that couples who do not have the capacity to contract a valid marriage in Singapore cannot circumvent the law by visiting another country for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the sole purpose of getting married, Such a marriage will in future be void if one of the parties to the marriage does not have the capacity to marry according to the Singapore law.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10(c) seeks to amend the first proviso of paragraph (b)(i) of section 16 of the Act to give persons under 21 years of age who have been married and are divorced or have had their marriages declared null and void, the capacity to re-marry. Under the existing law, a person who is under 21 years of age can re- marry if he or she is a widower or widow but is not permitted to re- marry if he or she is divorced or has had his or her marriage declared null and void. The amendment is to remove this inconsistency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 seeks to add a new subsection (3) to section 46 of the Act to give a Conciliation Officer the power to require a party to a marriage to attend before him to settle the differences between the parties to the marriage and such person shall be legally bound to attend and answer questions truthfully. Conciliation Officers at present do not have such power. This new provision will enable Conciliation Officers to play a more effective role in settling differences between husband and wife.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to section 60 of the Act were criticised by a number of persons who submitted representations. Section 60 empowers the court to make orders for the maintenance of a wife and her children. Two new defences were introduced by the Bill to enable a husband to defeat an application by his wife for maintenance, namely, that the wife had committed adultery or that she had deserted him. It was pointed out that section 60 as amended by the Bill would be anomalous since the Bill sought to abolish the "fault" principle which is the basis of our existing divorce law. It was suggested that a wife should be entitled to apply for maintenance from her husband if her husband neglects or refuses to provide her with a reasonable maintenance. The Select Committee
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> accepted this view and consequently amended the provision of the Bill to enact a new section 60 to provide that a court may grant maintenance to the wife if the husband had neglected or refused to maintain her. This principle is similar to that laid down in sections 101 and 102 in the new Part IX of the Act regarding the grant of maintenance to a former wife or for a wife when divorce proceedings are pending.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New provisions which are similar to those of the UK Domestic Proceedings and Magistrate's Courts Act, 1978, which gives very wide powers to the Courts for the protection of wives and children from molestation and violence, have also been included in the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations were made that sections 80 and 127 of the Women's Charter should be amended along the lines of the UK Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act, 1973. In Singapore, we do have cases of Singapore women marrying foreigners. Under the existing law, a woman acquires the domicile of her husband on marriage even though both parties may live here after their marriage. A woman will be unable to seek a divorce under the new Part IX of the Act even if her husband leaves her for good and returns to his country of domicile. The UK Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act, 1973, abolished the wife's dependent domicile and at the same time gave the court jurisdiction to entertain proceedings for divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage if either of the parties to the marriage was domiciled in England on the date when the proceedings were begun or was habitually resident in England throughout the period of one year ending with that date.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1961 when the Women's Charter was enacted, married women were given equal rights. We should now consider giving a married woman the capacity to acquire her own domicile.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This recommendation has been accepted and clause 28 of the Bill amends section 80 to give a married woman the capacity to acquire her own domicile just like any person
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of full capacity and to give our Courts the jurisdiction to entertain matrimonial proceedings if either of the parties to the marriage is domiciled in Singapore or is habitually resident in Singapore for a period of three years immediately preceding the commencement of the proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 82, which appeared in the Bill, permitted a couple to dissolve their marriage by mutual consent without any pre-conditions being fulfilled. This was at odds with the principles laid down in section 83(3)(d) which provides for one party to petition for a divorce when the couple have lived apart for three years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition and the respondent consents to the divorce. For this reason, section 82 has now been deleted. Furthermore, the Select Committee felt that our divorce law should not make it easy for a couple to terminate their marriage without first making an effort to overcome their difficulties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggestions were also made that the Court should be given more powers in enforcing maintenance orders and the power to order maintenance to be paid in one lump sum. These suggestions have been accepted and amendments have been made to sections 102 and 103(1) to that effect.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has also raised the age limit from 18 years to 21 years for a child's entitlement to maintenance from his parents. This will take into account the fact that many male students have to serve national service first before they can go for their tertiary education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention here that the amendments have not affected the interests of Muslims in any way. Section 3(3) of the Women's Charter provides that where both parties to a marriage are Muslims, the marriage cannot be solemnized or registered under the Charter. In other words, the marriage cannot be solemnized or registered
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in the Civil Registry. It does not matter if either of the parties is a convert. The marriage can only be solemnized or registered at the Registry of Muslim Marriages or by a kadi or naib kadi appointed by the President of Singapore under the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap. 42).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all the changes recommended by the Select Committee are necessary and desirable. The Select Committee had taken a great deal of time to consider the written representations so as to provide a law which, whilst making divorce easier for those couples whose marriages have irretrievably broken down, will help save those marriages which can be saved. The amendments to the Act also give wider powers to the Courts to grant maintenance for the wife and children so that there will be less hardship on the dependants of recalcitrant husbands.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
