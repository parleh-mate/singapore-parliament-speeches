<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chin had the floor yesterday when he

was interrupted at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>

Moment of Interruption. Mr Chin, will you please resume.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the end

of yesterday's session, I was commenting on the need to

avoid unnecessary duplication of work in the Industrial

Relations Division, with particular reference to the

Preventive Mediation Labour Assessment Section and the

Conciliation Section. As it is, I am given to understand

that the Preventive Mediation Labour Assessment Section

will, for instance, at the request of an employer, try its

best to prevent an outbreak of dispute between the

employer and his workers. If the attempt at prevention

fails and a dispute takes place, the Preventive Mediation

Section hands over the case to the Conciliation Section.

To me, it seems more logical that the Preventive Mediation

Section should continue with the handling of the case

until its conclusion one way or the other.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing arrangement, the relevant officer in

the  Conciliation  Section will have to  spend  more  time

briefing  himself  as to what was done by  the  Preventive

Mediation  Section. I think that is a  needless  waste  of

time.  I  hope  the Ministry can make some arrangement  to

ensure  that the Preventive Mediation Section can also  do

the work of the Conciliation Section and vice versa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the section captioned as the "NON-UNIONISED WORKERS SECTION."

The  superficial impression thereby created on the  public

is  that  the  Ministry conscientiously  looks  after  the

welfare of workers not represented by trade unions. But  I

have  been given to understand that the officers  in  that

Section are not too enthusiastic in their work. Recently a

few  workers  who went to that section,  with  a  view  to

invoking  the  Minister's  power  of  reinstatement  under

section  14 of the Employment Act, found themselves  being

made  to  wait  for more than two hours before  they  were

attended to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not happy with the staffing of the Non-unionised

Workers  Section.  I  am  given  to  understand  that  the

officers   of  the  Section  are  certified  interpreters.

Undoubtedly,  these interpreters are competent  to  advise

non-unionised workers on their nights under the Employment

Act, as they have been and are probably still attached  to

the  Labour  Court  which enforces the provisions  of  the

Employment  Act.  But  among  the  workers  who  seek  the

assistance of the Non-unionised Workers Section, there are

some  who  require advice and assistance on  their  rights

under   some  other  statutory  enactments  such  as   the

Industrial  Relations  Act.  My  concern  is  whether  the

officers  manning the Non-unionised Workers  Section  have

the  relevant  experience and training to  give  the  wide

range  of  advice and assistance they are called  upon  to

give on behalf of the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all very well to promise about highpowered

personnel   overseeing  the  conduct  of  the   industrial

relations  by  the Ministry. But if little or insufficient

attention  is paid to both the professional and the  human

aspects  of the Ministry's performance of its services  to

the public, the promise regarding the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



Industrial Relations Division becomes rather hollow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Sir,

I  do  not  know whether Members could recollect what  the

Member  for Aljunied said last night, but I hope  that  my

reply will throw light on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations Division reorganised last year

comprises  three sections: the Conciliation  Section,  the

Preventive  Mediation and Labour Assessment  Section,  and

the  Registry  of  Trade Unions. The Conciliation  Section

comprises  two units, one for disputes involving unionised

workers and the other for disputes involving non-unionised

workers.  The  Registry of Trade Unions  retains  its  old

title  as  an integral section of the Industrial Relations

Division.  The Preventive Mediation and Labour  Assessment

Section is a new one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the unsettling effect of the global recession

and  the resultant spate of retrenchments, there were only

1  8  minor  work stoppages and seven strikes in  1975  as

compared  to  28 minor work stoppages and  10  strikes  in

1974. The number of man-days lost in the strikes was 4,853

in  1975  as against 5.380 in 1974. Seen against  the  709

labour  dispute cases involving 92,339 unionised employees

dealt  with by the Industrial Relations Division,  Members

will agree that the number of industrial stoppages in 1975

is  insignificantly small. This is primarily because  most

of   these   disputes   were  amicably   settled   through

conciliation  by the officers of the Industrial  Relations

Division. Only in 51 cases did the parties fail  to  reach

agreement through conciliation, and the unresolved  issues

were referred to the Industrial Arbitration Count. For the

whole year of 1975 the Division also handled 1,191 dispute

cases  involving 3,437 non-unionised workers. Of these,  1

.079 cases were settled resulting in obtaining a total sum

of $202,473 for the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maintenance of industrial peace and stability in

1975 as in previous years was in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



large  measure  due  to the good sense and  reasonableness

displayed by both management and trade unions and the hard

work  put  in  by  the  staff of the Industrial  Relations

Division.  The  Ministry  is  determined  to  improve  and

upgrade  the competence and skill of the officers  in  the

Industrial  Relations Division. One of the  objectives  in

reorganising the Division is to ensure that the staff  are

given  an  all-round  training in the various  aspects  of

industrial   relations  work.  In  this  connection,   the

experienced  staff  in  the  former  Industrial  Relations

Section  are  being retained to provide continuity,  while

new   Administrative  Officers  are   being   trained   in

conciliation and mediation work. The initial  training  of

these   new   officers   in  the  Division   consists   of

orientation,  briefing and learning  at  first  hand  from

actual  conciliation  proceedings. They  are  subsequently

given close guidance and supervision in their duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Member for Aljunied, being a trained

industrial  relations  man himself,  will  agree  that  in

conciliation  and  mediation  work  no  amount  of  formal

training can substitute for on-the-job training. It  takes

time for a new officer to acquire the necessary specialist

knowledge  in  order  to  become the  skilful  negotiator.

mediator or assessment officer. It also takes time for the

new  officer  to earn the confidence and respect  of  both

managers and trade union leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied may wish to know that the

Ministry   is   looking  into  the  possibility   of   re-establishing   a  departmental  service   to   deal   with

industrial  relations  and labour  matters:  provided,  of

course, that with such a service the Ministry can build up

a  corps  of trained and experienced industrial  relations

and labour officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other matters raised, I would like to

clarify  the function of the Preventive Mediation Section.

Briefly,  the work involved would be to deal with  brewing

industrial  problems,  that  is,  problems  of  day-to-day

relations   which  could  escalate  into  serious   labour

disputes,  and follow-up action in the form of  advice  to

management on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



dispute  cases  which  are known to have  been  caused  by

inadequate  grievance  procedure, poor  management-worker

communication and personnel mismanagement. In addition the

Section also deals with alleged victimisation and wrongful

dismissal   cases  as  well  as  complaints   of   alleged

unjustified  retrenchment.  Since  the  officers  of   the

Preventive  Mediation and Labour Assessment  Section  also

come  under the Industrial Relations Division, it has been

possible  for  the assignment of work to be kept  flexible

and  in no instance has there been any duplication of work

between  these  two  sections.  The  Preventive  Mediation

Section   has  consistently  handled  a  case  until   its

conclusion and has not handed any case to the Conciliation

Section. Accordingly, when an impending dispute is handled

by an officer in the Preventive Mediation Section, he will

follow  through  the case until the dispute  is  resolved,

even  in  the  event that the dispute does  escalate  into

industrial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Non-Unionised Workers' Section, the

labelling  is  simply for the convenience of  workers  who

visit the Ministry with their problems, so that they would

know  where  to  go and to whom they should present  their

problems  in  the first instance. It must be  pointed  out

that  the  staff  in  this Unit are  competent  to  advise

unionised  workers as well as those who are not unionised.

There   are  in  this  Unit  one  post  of  Administrative

Assistant, four posts of Executive Officers and four posts

of   Certificated  Interpreters  who  together  cover  all

Chinese dialects, in addition to Tamil and Malay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned the case of a few workers who,

seeking  reinstatement, had to wait for hours before  they

were  attended to. This is most unfortunate. If the Member

were  to  give me more details, the case could  be  looked

into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accidents resulting in death or permanent

disabilities  to workmen have occurred too  frequently  in

our   island  Republic  in  the  last  few  years  of  our

industrial  expansion. It is a sad fact of life  that  the

victims  of  such accidents invariably come from  the  low

income  group.  It is not difficult to imagine  the  heart

pangs and anguish such tragedies bring to the families  of

such victims and themselves, if they escape death only  to

become  permanent cripples. Added to these are the  mental

agonies  and  anxieties  regarding  the  future  of  their

families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plight of the families of such victims not only

deserves  our compassion and sympathy but also  constantly

reminds  us  of  the  need  for  accident  prevention   in

workplaces through adequate occupational health and safety

measures.  This  is a matter of paramount  importance  and

concern  for the Government, the employers and  the  trade

unions  in  their common pursuit of workers'  welfare  and

security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely some of these accidents could have been prevented

if  greater  care had been exercised by all  concerned  in

safety  measures. Sad to say, some employers, particularly

those  who  are  contractors, are just not treating  their

workers as human beings. It is made to appear to them that

the  life of their workers is no more sacred than the life

of  a  dog.  They are more concerned with  the  raking  of

profits,  of  more and more profits. More safety  measures

mean   cutting   down   the  margin  of   their   profits.

Unfortunately, this  nonchalant  attitude   towards   the

sacredness of life of the workers as shown by some of  the

unscrupulous employers is also prevalent among  a  handful

of  senior  civil servants in change of economic  planning

and development. They are very conscious of financial cost

factor  in any economic activity. Occupational and  safety

measures are only to be maintained at their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>





absolute  minimum level to save cost. To  them  the  human

cost  is  less important because, according to  them,  the

human  price  we  must  pay  for economic  development  is

unavoidable, little realising that the economic losses due

to  accidents  can  be  higher than the  amount  spent  on

additional  safety measures. Such economic losses  are  in

the form of workmen's compensation, medical costs, loss in

productivity, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all the more important that both the Labour

Ministry   and   the   NTUC   must   relentlessly   pursue

occupational   health  and  safety  programmes   to   curb

unnecessary deaths and maiming. It is heartening  to  note

that  this  is  being done. I must compliment  the  Senior

Parliamentary Secretary (Labour) for his fearless  attacks

against employers, both in the public and private sectors,

for not taking adequate safety measures to protect workers

at their workplaces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1975 regulations were introduced by the

Labour  Ministry to govern the effective running of  Joint

Safety  Committees.  This year on  1st  March  regulations

governing   safety   officers  were  introduced.   Equally

important is the need for the Ministry of Labour  to  draw

up  programmes  to  ensure safer  working  environment  to

complement   the  new  regulations  that   were   recently

introduced.  I  hope  the  1975  statistics  relating   to

industrial accidents is prompting the Ministry to initiate

not  only self-regulatory systems but also more scientific

and systematic programmes to develop early warning methods

of anticipating and preventing occurrences of accidents.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

Memorandum  on the Budget Estimates I observe  that  there

has   been  an  increase  of  10  posts  in  the   Factory

Inspectorate  for  the  purpose  of  setting  up   a   new

Shipbuilding  and Repairing Inspections  Section.  In  the

past,  I spoke a great deal about safety consciousness  in

the  factories,  construction  sites  and  the  number  of

avoidable accidents that took place daily at these places.

I like to commend, of course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



the  increase  in the number of posts for the Shipbuilding

and Repairing Inspections Section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about having more inspectors for the factories and

construction  sites? Too many accidents  happen  at  these

places.  Whatever has been reported to the Police  or  the

Labour  Ministry  may only be a fraction compared  to  the

real  number  of  accidents which go  unreported,  Regular

inspections of factories for safety measures, particularly

construction  sites, or violation of  safety  rules  would

help  to  reduce the number of accidents on  human  lives.

Sometimes a commission of inquiry has to be set  up, such

as the one on the recent accident at the construction site

of the Singapore Maritime Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, the Factory lnspectorate should

also  hold regular campaigns and exhibitions in connection

with  safety  measures  so  that  the  workers  would   be

constantly  reminded of the safety rules to  be  followed.

Otherwise, we may continue `to lose valuable labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank the

Member for Moulmein for his personal compliment given  me.

But  I feel that my staff who have spent so much time  and

effort  in  this  should be congratulated for  controlling

industrial accidents in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I at the outset take this opportunity to clarify one

or two points. There has been some misconception about the

term  "industrial accidents". Various figures were  quoted

in  the  press  from  time to time. In  fact,  "industrial

accident"  means  those  accidents  reportable  under  the

Factories  Act only, and not all other forms of  accidents

involved  during employment which I will broadly  classify

as  "occupational accidents". Industrial accident  is  not

that  serious as one would imagine if one were to  compare

the figures with the number of occupational accidents.  In

fact,  there had been occupational accidents in  Singapore

ever



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



since  Sir Stamford Raffles set foot on Singapore soil.  I

do  not  know  whether  any accident occurred  during  his

landing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to note that the NTUC has strengthened

the  Occupational Health and Safety Committee.  This  will

indeed  be  a strong arm which can assist the Ministry  to

combat   the   common  problem  of  industrial  accidents.

Unfortunately, the NTUC and the Ministry of Labour  happen

to  be  the  orlly  two organised bodies that  are  really

tackling  the problem. There seems to be an absence  of  a

similar  form  of organisation on the part  of  employers,

although  much lip-service has been paid by employers  all

this while.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein is quite correct in stating that

in the construction industry the accident rate is high.  I

am  afraid I have to agree with him, much to the dismay of

the  irresponsible employers. But what the Member has said

is  completely true: that a human being is not  given  the

value  that some employers would give to their  dogs.  The

contractors have no excuse at all for failing  to  provide

the  various paraphernalia for industrial safety,  because

the  cost of all these items are included in their  tender

quotations:

these are what is known as the "Preliminaries" item. It is

also  augmented by another item - "prime cost" - a sum  of

money   set   for  the  provision  of  industrial   safety

appliances and equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most employers, as the Member has pointed out, regard

the  provision of money spent on safety measures  as  non-productive  expenses rather than as a  kind  of  long-term

investment for better returns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein touched on the question of loss

of productivity, the loss involved in compensation and the

loss  of  production time and cost. This is  a  very  real

problem but unfortunately most employers do not appreciate

this  point. Let me give a few figures to illustrate  what

the  Member for Moulmein was trying to impress  upon  this

House.  Some figures were quoted by my Minister  of  State

earlier  on  but  may  I  repeat  them  for  purposes   of

comparison.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973 the number of man-days lost due to industrial

action was 2.295. During the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



same  year  the number of man-days lost in industrial

accidents was 549,499. The following year. 1974,  the

number  of  man-days lost due to industrial stoppages

was  5.380. For the same period, the number  of  man-days  lost due to industrial accidents was 6  16.559.

In   1975,  the  number  of  man-days  lost  due   to

industrial  stoppages was 4.853. The number  of  man-days lost due to industrial accidents in 1975 is  not

available  but  I  can safely put  it  at  plus/minus

700,000.  So Hon. Members can see the vast difference

between  the  two figures and the total loss  to  the

economy as a whole. Of course, the individual factory

suffering one accident may not see the pinch of  this

loss but we cannot afford, as a whole, to lose nearly

-   million  man-days  per  year  simply  because  of

industrial accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been doing very well in the industrial

accidents  front  and for this my Ministry  has  been

activated to have some work-plans for this year.  The

work-plans  have been set out to work  to  a  certain

target, but I am afraid we do have our handicaps,  in

terms  of  staffing, for example. I will handle  this

point when I reply to the Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier on, the Member for Anson is

probably  aware  that  the two  most  accident  prone

industrial  areas  happen to be the shipbuilding  and

repair and the construction industries. It is because

of  all  the experience that we have had in the  past

that we have set up a special unit to look after  the

construction  industry.  This  unit   has   been   in

operation for several years now and it also  has  its

own set of regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the increase of 10 posts to establish the

new  Shipbuilding and Repairing Inspections  Section.

in  fact, the bodies are already there though not  in

full establishment. They have been there for the last

one  year  by Establishment Warrant and the Estimates

only reflect the action of the Ministry in requesting

for  the  staff. We have assigned them to look  after

the Shipbuilding and Repairing Inspections Section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present establishment in the Factory

Inspectorate comprises 52 posts of factory inspectors

and other technical staff and field



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



officers.  Of  these, 16 of them are in the  Building

and  Construction Section, and 11 in the Shipbuilding

and  Repairing Inspections Section. The present staff

strength  of  the  Inspectorate is adequate  only  to

carry   out  enforcement  if  we  are  to   do   only

enforcement.  But I do not believe at  all  that  any

unimaginative and strait-jacket enforcement is  going

to  help  the situation. Members are aware  that  the

Factory  Inspectorate  is  also  involved  in   other

aspects   of  work.  It  not  only  updates   factory

legislation, it  is  also  involved  in   training.

education, safety programmes, campaigns and providing

consultation  service. So you can see,  Sir,  if  the

Factory  Inspectorate staff, as I said earlier,  were

to  confine  themselves to enforcement, I think  they

ought to be adequate. But since they have to take  on

the   additional  responsibility  that  I  have  just

mentioned,  they  have to stretch  their  staff  very

thin.  In  fact, I must compliment them  in  that  in

spite  of  the  great volume of work they  have  done

exceptionally well.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also mentioned that many

accidents were not reported. May I explain here  that

not all accidents are reported, or reportable, to the

Chief  Inspector of Factories. Only an accident which

incapacitates  a worker for more than three  days  is

classified  as  a  reportable  accident   under   the

Factories Act. Some accidents might have come to  the

knowledge  of the Member for Anson. But I  am  afraid

there is no legal requirement for employers to report

all accidents to the Factory Inspectorate. Of course,

they  are  still entitled to workmen's  compensation.

But  not all accidents are reported. In the last  two

years we have improved our system of reporting. There

is   now   a  more  effective  system  of  monitoring

accidents.  I  would say that most of  the  accidents

which  occurred  are  within  the  knowledge  of  the

Factory Inspectorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Anson that regular

inspections  of factories, industrial establishments,

and   worksites   would  certainly  help   to   check

accidents.  In fact, in 1 975 the Factory  Inspectors

made a total of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



7,118 inspections, and follow-up visits to the factories

and  work-places. As a result of these inspections.  5,538

cases  of  noncompliance  with  the  Factories  Act   were

detected  and the employers were required to  rectify  the

safety  hazards. In addition, normal punitive  action  was

taken against offending employers in court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular safety campaigns, as proposed by the Member for

Anson,  have also been conducted. For instance, the Member

might  know  of  the  "Shipbuilding",  "Construction"  and

"Safety and Health" Campaigns were launched in 1974. There

were  also other campaigns launched by the Ministry for  a

particular industry to highlight the problems peculiar  to

that  industry. They were not general campaigns which  the

people concerned would find very little interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour has also published a number of

pamphlets and guides. Pamphlets such as the "Do you  know"

series  to  educate  the workers on various  hazards  like

explosion,  fire, and health pamphlets to  prevent  noise-induced  deafness  and  silicosis  were  distributed.  The

Ministry  also  sent  out  safety  circulars  to  all  the

construction  sites informing contractors  of  the  latest

discovery in safety hazards which some contractors may not

have  any  knowledge  of. We have  also  sent  out  safety

guides,  set up committees to look after peculiar problems

of certain industries. I hope that with the cooperation of

the  employers,  and I really appeal to them  to  be  more

positive,  we  should  be able to do  very  much  more  to

promote industrial health and safety. I look forward to  a

more  solid  support  from  the  NTUC, and  I  take  this

opportunity  to  thank  them for the  help  given  to  the

Ministry of Labour all these years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

also like to join in congratulating the Ministry of Labour

for  its  success over the last two years in reducing  the

number   of  industrial  accidents  and  taking  all   the

necessary measures for our workers' safety. Last year work

at  a number of building construction sites was stopped by

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  of  Labour  because of the occurrence  of  fatal

accidents. I should say that this is most welcome. But, on

the  other  hand,  when work at the worksites  stopped  to

enable  all  the precautionary measures to be  taken,  the

workers  lost  their  daily wages. Will  the  Ministry  of

Labour  consider  that, in future, when  action  is  being

taken  against  the  employers and  there  is  a  complete

stoppage of work at any worksite, whether the workers will

continue to be paid?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid my answer

will  disappoint the Member for Boon Teck. Our  philosophy

is  not  to  pay  a person for no work done.  There  is  a

shortage  of construction workers. The employers  normally

plead  with the Ministry to allow their workers to  resume

work,  otherwise they will run away to other worksites  or

even adjacent worksites. I do not think the workers really

suffer   because  there  is  a  shortage  of  construction

workers.  It  is  not the policy of the  Ministry  to  pay

workers for no work done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Ministry

directs  a stoppage of construction work at the worksites,

it is to ensure that all precautionary measures are taken

by  the  employers. The workers should, therefore, not  be

penalised as a result of this action. It is different from

other  stoppages  of work such as industrial  action.  The

employers  should  be punished, and  if  the  Ministry  of

Labour  makes the employers pay for the daily wages,  they

will definitely try to take every precautionary measure to

make sure that work can be resumed immediately.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very

unfortunate  that  in  more than half  of  the  industrial

accident cases the workers themselves were responsible. It

is  very  difficult for our enforcement  officers  to  lay

hands  on  them.  I  must also take  this  opportunity  to

caution  the workers that the Ministry would not  hesitate

to  take  whatever action necessary to bring them in  line

with  our  requirements. Most of the time  we  managed  to

catch  hold of the employers because we could locate  them

but  not  the  workers. If the NTUC can do their  part  by

exhorting the workers to be more safety



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



conscious, there would be no further need for any stoppage

of work at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three aspects to safety. First, there is

legislation.  Second, the physical environment,  that  is.

the  provision of safety appliances and supervision  which

are  the responsibility of the employers, and third, which

is  the  most  important, the behavioral  aspect.  If  the

employers  are  not keen to supervise their  workers, the

workers  would  not  be  keen to comply  with  the  safety

requirements. So in the end stoppage of work will not save

the  workers at all. As I have said, more than half of the

accidents were actually due to the carelessness  and  even

blatant  defiance  of safety rules  on  the  part  of  the

workers.  They  should consider themselves lucky  that  we

have not brought them to court. More of them should be.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

happy to note that the Ministry of Labour has done so much

and so well in the field of workers' safety. I have just a

little  question to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for Labour. He has said just now that the

Ministry   of  Labour  has  printed  many  pamphlets   for

distribution to the workers in respect of safety. I recall

that two days ago in this very Chamber he complained about

the  high  rate  of  illiteracy in Singapore.  I  am  just

wondering  how  he  can  get  the  workers  to  read   the

pamphlets?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> There was no complaint on my part of

illiteracy  or  the  poor standard  of  literacy.  On  one

occasion I did propose in jest to the former Minister  for

Education (I cannot remember which Minister because  there

have   been  so  many  changes)  that  they  should   call

themselves the "Ministry of Literacy" and let the Ministry

of  Culture  undertake  the educational  aspect.  But  the

Ministry of Culture appears to be equally unacceptable  to

me  to play this role. There is no question of the workers

being unable to read the pamphlets which have been written

in  the  simplest form. I do not think we can simplify  it

any further.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> In Hokkien then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Well, Hokkien is not a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



written  language. Hokkien can be romanised but  it  might

become a Frankenstein of a language.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the request of the Member for Boon Teck. I am  not

at  all  impressed  with the reply  given  by  the  Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister for  Labour.  The

Member for Boon Teck said that where there is a failure to

provide  adequate safety measures leading to work stoppage

and  where  the  fault lies with the employers,  then  the

workers should not be penalised. This is the point which I

would  like  to  emphasise: if it was  the  fault  of  the

workers  that  the  work had stopped, then  it  is  surely

reasonable and fair that the workers should be deprived of

their pay. But if, on the other hand, it is the failure of

the  employers  to provide the necessary safety  measures,

then  I believe the Ministry of Labour should ensure  that

the   employers  be  made  to  comply  with   the   safety

regulations by providing precautionary measures,  and  for

any number of days in which work had stopped the employers

should be made to pay the workers, because the workers are

not responsible for the provision of these safety measures

but  the  employers. I would like to have  his  considered

reply  once again, and if it is not satisfactory we  shall

pursue it further.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the

Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary has  mentioned  that  the

workers are mainly responsible for accidents due to  their

negligence, carelessness, etc. May I correct him  and  say

that from the Ministry of Labour's statistics it is due to

a lack of knowledge. It was precisely for this reason that

regulations were introduced with effect from 1st December,

1975, for  safety committees to be set up to ensure  that

employers  take  cognisance of the fact  that  a  lack  of

knowledge exists and that members of the safety committees

should  be  educated  to enable them to  know  more  about

safety.  In  addition, there should be provision  for  the

adequate  education of the workers at  the  factory  floor

level.  I  would  also  add that the  employers  too  lack

knowledge  on occupational health and safety. I feel  that

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



is of paramount importance for Government to stress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what plans are afoot, but I believe that

the  77 personnel in the Factory Inspectorate will not  be

sufficient  to go around enforcing legislation.  Time  and

time again I have made the point that we will need an army

of  inspectors  for  the  more  than  5,000  factories  in

Singapore. Therefore, self-regulatory measures  should  be

introduced in addition to the creation of enthusiasm,  and

education, which  is  covered by the  Factories  Act  and

enforcement.  These self-regulatory measures  will  ensure

that  these  accidents are not controlled, as  the  Senior

Parliamentary Secretary has said just now, but limited and

reduced. Extra stress should be made to ensure that  joint

safety  committees work effectively. The Minutes of  these

safety  committees and recommendations  should  be  looked

into by the Ministry of Labour from time to time to ensure

that  employers  as  well as workers are  making  progress

where  occupational health and safety is concerned.  Total

loss   control,   safety-sampling  and   hazard   spotting

exercises  too ought to be carried out as part and  parcel

of the responsibility of joint safety committees.

fully support the views given by the Members for Boon Teck

and Kim Seng. I strongly feel that if stoppage of work  is

the  result  of  the  employers neglecting  proper  safety

measures  and  regulations, it  is  high  time  that  the

Ministry  of Labour took serious action against them.  And

for  God's  sake,  make  them pay  the  workers  for  such

negligence.   The  general  impression  of   the   public,

especially  the  workers,  is that  it  seems  the  Labour

Ministry is very sympathetic towards the employers. Let us

do something for the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, when I made my comments on this

topic,  it  was  intended more to stir up a hornets'  nest

among certain groups of the employers. But I did not quite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



realise that these comments could stir up a hornets' nest

in this House, resulting in a lot of contributions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point mentioned by the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary  over  the need for workers to be  conscious  of

safety measures and so forth. I think that is accepted  by

the  NTUC.  But  unfortunately many of these  workers  who

suffer  injuries  or  death  as  a  result  of  industrial

accidents were not organised under any union of the  NTUC,

like   the  construction  workers.  We  have  considerable

difficulty in getting them organised. We did not get  much

sympathy and assistance from the Ministry of Labour to get

them organised. So there is a limited capacity in which we

could  sort  of inculcate safety consciousness  among  the

workers  and  that is only effective in as far  as  it  is

within  the ranks of those workers that we have organised.

But  many  accidents  occur in  places  quite  beyond  our

jurisdiction. This is the difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Boon Teck

supported by the Members for Kim Seng and Bukit  Ho  Swee,

the  Senior Parliamentary Secretary has given a reply.  On

that  matter, I am afraid it is also beyond him. I do  not

know  whether  pursuing the subject would  bring  about  a

fruitful  conclusion, because I notice that  the  Minister

for  Labour and the Minister for Finance, including  their

colleague  the  Minister  for  Communications,   are   all

listening intently. Maybe they are taking note of this  to

influence  other  Cabinet  colleagues  to  consider   this

words out of my mouth, I am caught in a dilemma: if I do

not reply I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



create the impression that I am not knowledgeable: and  if

I  should  reply, in the process I may have to expose  the

ignorance of the two Members opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Moulmein has said, these workers are

not  unionised. I accept the suggestion of the Member  for

Potong  Pasir. He spoke on behalf of the unionised workers

who  work  under  regular factory  environment  where  the

hazards can be identified easily and are regular.  In  the

construction  sector, the workers are not  organised, and

what I have said still holds true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Teck is still very persistent on the

question  of pay. As I said earlier there is no difficulty

in  getting a job in the construction industry. I know for

a  fact that employers did pay them quietly for fear  that

they  might  run away. There is no fear that  the  workers

would  suffer.  What I do know is that they were  actually

paid.  I  do not expect the Member for Kim Seng  to  agree

with  the  rest.  One  brick-bat in  exchange  for  a  few

bouquets,  I  think, is more than a fair deal  for  me.  I

think  what I have said earlier should be able to  satisfy

him.  Most of the workers were, in fact, paid because  the

employers  were  afraid that the workers would  just  walk

away. It is so difficult to find workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the functions of the Ministry is training: in

fact  what  is  going  on at the moment  is  that  we  are

providing training for one NTUC personnel. We have got one

trainee, if I am not wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I say that the I LO expert will be asked to

make  a  feasibility  study on  the  establishment  of  an

Institute of Occupational Health and Safety. When that  is

done, probably the job of training, education campaign and

consultation  can be taken out of the Factory Inspectorate

so  as  to  allow them more time to do enforcement.  Until

that  is  done. I am afraid that the Factory  Inspectorate

has got to take on more than they can chew.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion of the Member for Potong Pasir that

the  minutes of meetings of safety committees in factories

should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



checked, may I inform him that the last minutes I read was

on Vosper Thornycroft. If he is interested. I can give him

some time to read them. I have just finished reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should say that the

workers are not thinking in terms of getting a day's  wage

without work. May I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary

whether the employers should be penalised or punished  for

this. This one day's wage could be donated to the Workers'

Fund  set up by the Ministry of Labour which, I would like

to say, is most welcome. The two biggest affiliated unions

of the NTUC, i.e, the PIEU and SILO, have donated $10,000.

The Senior Parliamentary Secretary can be assured that the

workers  are  always prepared to tighten their  belts.  If

justified, the workers are prepared to sacrifice  provided

safety measures are taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy, are you answering for the Ministry of Labour?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> No, Sir, I want to say that the

Factory  Inspectorate and the contractors should not  gang

up.   That  assurance  must  be  given  by  the  Ministry,

otherwise   the   poor  workers  will   suffer.   If   the

Inspectorate  and  the contractors gang  up,  the  workers

cannot get compensation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, in view of the heat that has

been  generated  oven the debate on this subhead  and  the

need for us to cool down for the rest of the subjects, and

in  view  of the detailed and satisfactory reply given  by

the  Senior  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister  for

Labour, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AKA 1111*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Sia khoon Seong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Employment Service formerly known as the

Employment Exchange was, I believe, reorganised  in  1972.

It is not clear to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



me  in  what way reorganisation has substantially affected

the  standard of service and the organisational  structure

of  that  department, except for the fact that  there  has

been  a  change in name. It leads me therefore  to  wonder

whether  this  is  not  just a case of  what  the  Chinese

describe  as "old wine in a new bottle". Week  after  week

during my meet-the-people sessions, I continue to see  the

all  too familiar yellow registration cards issued by  the

department  to job-seekers. The majority of  these  people

have  been  on the waiting-list for months, if not  years,

and  in  many  cases they have got tired  of  waiting  and

simply let the registration lapse without renewal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 10 years our country has undergone

tremendous change in our economic structure and the entire

pattern   of  population  distribution  has  also  altered

radically  but the Employment Service of the Ministry  has

remained  essentially  what  it  was  when  it  was  first

established  after  the 2nd World War. The  department  at

present  maintains three offices at Havelock,  Jurong  and

Bukit  Panjang.  Except for Jurong which is  obviously  an

ideal  location, the other two situations would appear  to

me  to be totally out of place. One could easily think  of

many  other  suitable  places where  the  demand  for  the

services  of  the  department will be  the  greatest.  For

example,  the new towns at Kallang. Toa Payoh,  Queenstown

and Kampong Chai Chee. There is I feel a tendency for some

of  our Government departments to stand still in terms  of

upgrading  the standard and quality of services where  the

types  of  services  are  not considered  to  be  revenue-generating.  This mentality has led to an  inward  looking

approach  on  the  part  of most of these  so-called  non-revenue-generating  departments whereas, considering  the

nature  of  the services they are supposed to offer,  they

should  really  attempt to reach out  to  the  people.  We

complain  about  the tendency among our young  workers  in

hopping from job to job. Financial inducement may well  be

one  of  the reasons or even the main reason, but have  we

not also considered that if we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



provide them with better career guidance and assistance to

find  the jobs that they are best suited, it may help them

to  overcome  the  frustrations on their part  because  of

their being in the wrong jobs. Admittedly some may be  too

choosy  and  will never change but I firmly  believe  that

with proper guidance and assistance our younger generation

of  workers  will  be  able  to develop  the  correct  job

attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Employment Service's announced objectives is

to  maximise  the efficient utilisation of the  Republic's

labour   force  through  improved  matching  of   workers'

attitude  with job requirements. Quite frankly. I  do  not

think  this  objective has beer or will ever  be  achieved

given  the existing outdated organisational structure.  To

achieve  it, radical changes in the set-up are  necessary.

Perhaps it would even be useful to extend the function  of

the  Employment Service to include career guidance  aiming

not  only at job seekers but also school children so  that

by  the  time they are ready to seek employment they  will

have  some  ideas as to the direction in  which  they  may

proceed.  At present as far as I am aware, career guidance

is  not  given much emphasis by the Ministry of Education.

In any case, with the state of confusion in that Ministry.

I  do have my doubts as to the capability of that Ministry

being able to do the job well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving the

amendment  for this subhead, I was prompted  by  the  same

concern  shown  by  the Member for  Jalan  Kayu  over  the

question  as to whether, since the reorganisation  of  the

old Employment Exchange into the Employment Service, there

is  an  increase in its effectiveness in providing service

to those seeking jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when we had almost full employment, it was not

of  great concern as to whether the Employment Service was

effective  or  not because the workers could  easily  find

jobs.  But  in view of recent times where, as a result  of

the   economic  recession, more  and  more   people   are

retrenched and there is the projection that there may be a

possible increase of retrenchments in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



future,  I  think  the  effectiveness  of  the  Employment

Service  is  a  matter of concern to us  because  we  must

assist in whatever way we can to help the job seekers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of that, Sir, I just want to take this

opportunity  to ask the Minister concerned to inform  this

House as to whether he is satisfied that improvements have

been  made with regard to providing this service to  those

seeking jobs.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Sir,I

welcome  this  opportunity to inform  Members  as  to  the

function of the Employment Service and the purpose of  its

reorganisation.   The  present  Employment   Service   was

reorganised  in July 1972 with a view to facilitating  the

employment process and improving the efficient utilisation

of  the  labour  force. The revamped  Employment  Service,

formerly known as the Employment Exchange, was designed to

alleviate the labour shortfall by increasing the effective

supply  of  labour  in three ways: firstly,  by  a  faster

matching  of the unemployed workers with the job  vacancy,

thereby  shortening the period of joblessness and  raising

the  effective  supply  of labour: secondly,  by  reducing

undesirable  labour  mobility  through  the  provision  of

relevant  labour  market  information:  and,  thirdly,  by

lowering turnover through better matching of work-aptitude

and  ability  with  job requirement, thereby  raising  job

satisfaction.  To  this  end, the  reorganised  Employment

Service in 1 972 introduced vocational guidance and labour

market information services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vocational counselling is given to unemployed job

seekers, particularly fresh school leavers, as part of the

programme  of  assisting registrants  to  secure  suitable

employment.  Whenever possible, young registrants  without

any specific technical training are encouraged to take  on

blue  collar  jobs and to acquire suitable  trade  skills.

However,  those with basic minimum academic qualifications

and with interest in a blue collar career are referred  by

the  Employment  Service to the Vocational Training  Board

for admission into one of its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



vocational  training  colleges. In  this  connection,  the

Employment  Service  works closely with  the  Ministry  of

Education Guidance Unit and the Industrial Training Board.

Moreover,  senior officers of the Employment Service  also

give  group counselling to schools, community centres  and

the  Youth  Leadership Training Institute. Furthermore,  a

senior  employment  officer sits on the National  Guidance

Service Council which coordinates the national efforts  on

vocational   guidance  programmes.  So,   in   fact, the

Employment Service do carry out a certain amount of career

counselling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour market information service provided by the

Employment Service since 1972 includes sending of  monthly

information  sheet on job opportunities to all  Government

secondary,  academic, technical  and  tertiary   schools,

private   commercial  institutes  and  community  centres.

Specific  labour  market information is also  provided  to

private  individuals and individual organisations  writing

in for such information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its reorganisation the Employment Service has been

providing  an improved service to both employers  and  job

seekers. However, to further improve the efficiency of the

Employment Service, we have a Colombo Plan expert attached

to  the Employment Service since last June. His role is to

advise  and assist the Employment Service in the  training

and  developing of the staff at all levels, in  developing

procedural  and  operational machinery for  the  efficient

operation of the Employment Service and in establishing  a

progressive evaluation system for the continuing appraisal

of the effectiveness of the Employment Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of more efficient services being extended to

employers  and  registrants, the number of private  sector

employers  notifying  their vacancies  to  the  Employment

Exchange  has  increased. Likewise, the number  of  better

quality   registrants  with  higher  education  has   also

increased. This has, therefore, made it possible  for  the

Employment Service to improve its placement service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the reorganisation in 1972 job orders notified

to the former Employment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



Exchange  came primarily from the public sector, including

the  statutory bodies. Private sector employers  used  the

Exchange  sparingly and only as a last resort. Job  orders

from  the  private sector were predominantly for unskilled

manual  labour  and  often  of a  temporary  or  emergency

nature. The average annual number of vacancies notified to

the  Exchange  for the period 1969 to 1971 was  7,500,  of

which less than 20% were from private establishments. With

the reorganisation the annual number of notified vacancies

increased  substantially to an average of 13,000  for  the

period  1972 tQ 1975, and the proportion of private sector

vacancies went up to more than 50%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful placement of registrants in private firms in

the past was negligible. However, since the reorganisation

in  1972 the Employment Service has been able to place  an

increasing  number of registrants in the  private  sector.

The   proportion   of   registrants  placed   in   private

establishments has gone up from less than 20% in  1972  to

30%  in 1975. Last year the Employment Service found  work

for  a  record 8,756 registrants and many more registrants

would have been placed had they not been over-selective in

the jobs offered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that at the height of retrenchment

in the last quarter of 1974, the Employment Service set up

a  special  retrenchment  unit to  help  those  retrenched

workers who could not find alternative employment on their

own. In August 1975 the unit extended its services to  the

locally  employed civilians made redundant as a result  of

the  final withdrawal of the UK forces from Singapore. All

these  serve to demonstrate the improved capacity  of  the

Employment   Service  in  coping  with  changes   in   the

employment situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what the Member for Moulmein feared, the

current  economic indicators point towards a  gradual  but

difficult  recovery  in our economy. However, should  the

unexpected  happen and there be a downturn in the  economy

accompanied by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



high unemployment, the Employment Service will, as in  the

case of retrenchment, take immediate appropriate action to

meet the changed situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by the Member for Jalan Kayu, the

Employment Service has two branch offices, one  in  Jurong

and  the  other in Bukit Panjang. These two branch offices

are  located in industrial estates to facilitate employers

in recruiting workers as well as to assist job seekers who

live  in  the  vicinity  of these  industrial  estates  in

seeking employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong branch office caters for residents living in

postal  districts 5, 21 and 22. This includes  the  entire

Jurong  industrial estate with more than 2,000  industrial

establishments.  Members may also wish to  know  that  the

Ministry  has  submitted  to the  Ministry  of  Finance  a

proposal  to set up in Jurong a Labour Regional Centre  to

house  branch  offices  of  the various  sections  of  the

Ministry, including the Employment Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bukit Panjang branch office also serves an extensive

area  covering postal districts 23, 24 and  25.  The  main

office located within the city area caters for the rest of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for Jalan Kayu, the

question of decentralisation of the Employment Service was

further  considered before and, in fact, a  branch  office

was  set up in Kallang. Because the demand for the service

of  this  branch office in Kallang was rather  small,  the

office had to be closed down. In view of the smallness and

the  compactness  of  Singapore and of  the  existing  two

branches  strategically  located  in  industrial  estates.

coupled  with a fairly efficient transport system,  it  is

not  necessary  to  decentralise  the  Employment  Service

further.  However, should the need arise in future.  I  am

sure we will reconsider the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to setting up branch offices the Employment

Service  also  makes  use  of  the  community  centres  to

communicate  with  possible  job  seekers  visiting  these

areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, the Employment Service sends

monthly lists of job vacancies to the community centres to

be  displayed  on  their  notice  boards.  The  Employment

Service officers are also invited by the community centres

to  give talks on the role and functions of the Employment

Service,  and usually after these talks printed  brochures

giving  particulars of job vacancies and how to apply  for

them, etc, are left with the community centres.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a piece of

official propaganda. I think the Hon. Minister has done  a

good  job.  But  how near it is to the truth,  I  have  my

doubts. I am not convinced. Just by looking at the  number

of  staff shown in the Estimates. I really have my doubts.

There  are  only  three  Division  I  officers  and  seven

Division II officers. I cannot imagine that with this very

small number of staff they could undertake so many things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that I have heard about the

community  centres being made use of. I have not  received

any pamphlets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reorganisation, as I have pointed out, for many years

now  they have been using the same yellow card. Have  they

not  considered computerising the system? By computerising

the registration and the matching of jobs to seekers, that

will surely speed up the processing. But with such a small

establishment  of  staff, how are they going  to  do  that

quickly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned about the Kallang Office being

closed down very soon after it was opened. I suspect it is

because  the  people  felt  that  they  were  not  getting

anything  out  of it. So they did not want  to  go  there.

Their feeling is, "What is the point? Why should I come to

you? You are not doing anything at all." As I pointed  out

and,  in  fact, the sentiment was expressed  when  Members

discussed the earlier subhead on the Factory Inspectorate,

that if it is not a revenue-generating department there is

that  tendency  for the Government to say,  "Let  us  save

while we can."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also mentioned about Bukit Panjang being

close  to  an  industrial estate. Where is the  industrial

estate?  It is not even close to any centre of population.

The centres of population are in Toa Payoh and Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about a very efficient transport system but at

the  same  time  he is telling the people.  "For  goodness

sake,  do  not come into the Central Business District  if

you  can help it", and yet his office is in Havelock Road.

It is all illogical. I think it is a lot of eyewash, if he

does not mind my saying so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  has just stated that the Employment Service  has

only  been  successful  in getting  employment  for  those

workers  in the lower skilled jobs. I wonder what sort  of

information or facilities they have provided to  employers

in  the  private  sector.  It  appears  that  there  is  a

misconception amongst employers in the private sector that

the  workers  that are being registered at the  Employment

Service  are people of a lower education. So they  do  not

make   use   of  it  as  we  can  see  from  the   regular

advertisements in the newspapers for jobs  in  the  higher

level  of  employment, and so on. I wonder what steps  the

Ministry will take to encourage private employers to  make

use of the Employment Service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is precisely

because  of  the  identification of the former  Employment

Exchange  with lower educated candidates as  mentioned  by

the Member for Toa Payoh that we decided there should be a

reorganisation and a new image given to it, I  agree  with

him  that  under  the  old Employment Exchange,  in  fact.

practically  all  the  registrants  with  the   Employment

Exchange were unskilled workers, and those who had  better

educational qualifications would not go to the  Employment

Exchange for registration. But as I have pointed out  just

now,  after  the reorganisation, we are now  getting  more

registrants with better educational, qualifications and we

are  informing the private employers of the  existence  of

this   pool   of   better  qualified  unemployed   persons

available.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent as to how far the service could be further

improved,  I  think  a  lot will depend  on  the  staffing

position  and  finance.  The Member  for  Jalan  Kayu  has

pointed  out  that  since the Labour  Ministry  is  not  a

revenue-generating department, probably  the  Ministry  of

Finance   is   not  that  keen  to  provide  more   money.

Nevertheless,  within the limited resources  available  to

the  Ministry, we are doing our level best and, as I  have

pointed  out  just  now, in the course of  last  year  the

Employment  Service  has for the first  time  placed  over

8,000 people in suitable jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the yellow card given to the registrant, as

mentioned by the Member for Jalan Kayu, I have pointed out

that  if  the registrants are not too selective there  are

jobs  available for them. Everyone in this House knows  in

his  heart  that  jobs are available  but  there  are  few

prepared  to  accept certain jobs. At the  height  of  the

retrenchment  in  1974  and  early  last  year,   although

thousands  of workers were retrenched there  were  at  the

same  time thousands of workers on work permits  who  were

imported  from  across the Causeway. It only  demonstrates

that there are jobs available but for various reasons  the

unemployed Singaporeans are not keen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I do not believe I can

sum  up  in  one  short  sentence the  efficiency  of  the

Employment Service in Singapore. Over this period of  time

I  believe there was a mushrooming of scores of employment

agencies taking advantage of all our unemployed people  in

Singapore  due  to  the  "efficiency"  of  the  Employment

Service.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, following what the

Hon.  Minister has said earlier regarding the availability

of  jobs  and the fact that our workers are too selective,

can I make a request to the Minister if he could circulate

a  monthly  list  of  available jobs  to  all  Members  of

Parliament or to all community centres? We, on our part, I

am sure, will be able to better advise job seekers

community centres if they have not yet received them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Sir, may I suggest that if the list can

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the last Budget debate I brought up the

question  of the need to improve public relations  in  the

Housing  and Development Board. It appears that  there  is

not  much  improvement in this direction. There are  still

some  officers in the Housing Board who are  arrogant  and

rude  when dealing with members of the public. In periodic

inspections of flats and shophouses certain officials tend

to be crude and rude when asking for information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you may be aware, Sir, many working couples leave

their homes in the care of relatives or friends while they

are at work during the day. In one particular instance,  a

housing  inspector barged into the bedroom of a  flat  and

demanded of the caretaker as to who slept in which bed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shopkeepers are Similarly harassed, Under present

regulations  any  person  can tender  for  more  than  one

shophouse in the same estate or other estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, on a point of order. Sir, I think that perhaps the

Member  for Toa Payoh should bring this matter up under  a

different  subhead relating to the Housing and Development

Board, and not under this subhead.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Subhead AAA 1004 relates to the Minister,

and  he is in charge of the Housing and Development Board.

I  believe  the  Member for Toa Payoh  in  his  debate  is

ranging on the policy of the Minister. I think he  may  be

permitted to carry

on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite obvious that when a person runs more than

one  shop he could not be present in all his shops at  one

and  the  same time. On many occasions, shop  tenants  are

taken to task for not being present to run their business.

It is quite logical for some shopkeepers to employ someone

else to help them in their businesses. The officers in the

Area  Offices  insisted that shopkeepers who operate  more

than  one  shop  must  furnish to the Board  a  time-table

showing when they are present in each shop. One shopkeeper

who  went  abroad for two months on business was asked  to

produce his passport for inspection to prove that he  went

overseas.  In several instances, allegations of subletting

and unauthorised assignments were proved to be unfounded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not against the action taken for serious

breaches of the Board's regulations, but frivolous actions

of  this nature tend to give a bad image of the Board. The

Board has a good reputation for public housing. Let us not

spoil it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point I would like to raise is the

stipulation  of  approved trades  for  shophouses.  It  is

stated quite clearly in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



tender  forms  that consideration may be given  to  permit

dual  or  multiple trades provided such trades fall  under

the same category as defined in the tender forms.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most intending businessmen tender for the trade of

department  stones, where one can sell a wide  variety  of

goods.  A  businessman will obviously choose  a  trade  in

which  he can sell larger quantities of goods than  go  in

for  other  lines.  So if textiles are  the  best  selling

lines, the shopkeeper tends to trade in textiles. But this

is  not permitted by the Area Officers. The Housing  Board

insists  on a certain percentage of each type of goods  to

be   sold,  without  regard  to  the  viability  of  one's

business.  The end result is that the shopkeeper  will  be

asked  to revert to his original trade or pay the  current

market rate of rental or quit altogether.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current market rates of rental are arbitrarily fixed by

the  Housing Board. I believe they are based on the latest

tendered price. This can be quite absurd. For instance, if

a  shopkeeper had tendered $500 a month for a shophouse in

1968, should he decide to change his trade then, under the

present  system he would have to pay a revised  rental  of

nearly $2,000 per month. This is tantamount to telling the

shopkeeper to close his shop and cease business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that rentals derived from shophouses in

housing  estates help to offset the subsidised rentals  of

fIats  for the lower income group of citizens. But  surely

some  equitable  rates could be imposed. I  would  suggest

that  a review be made of the system of restriction  of  a

change of trade for the present lawful shop tenants. As  a

matter  of  fact, no  such restrictions  are  imposed  on

emporiums and supermarkets. I believe that the reason  for

this  is  that  the rentals charged for such premises  are

sufficiently high. But based on floor areas,  the  rentals

of  some  shophouses are nearly equivalent to the  rentals

charged for emporiums or supermarkets, which are based  on

the  rate  per square foot. I hope the Minister will  give

consideration to my suggestion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

taking this opportunity to raise certain matters which

affect my constituency. First, there are anxieties in my

constituency, particularly among the residents in

Serangoon Gardens Estate, about the possibility of the

Housing Board's acquisition of land area on which the Ang

Mo Kio New Town is to be developed. There is the anxiety

that such an acquisition would extend to the Serangoon

Gardens Estate. I myself believe that this acquisition

will not extend to the Serangoon Gardens Estate. But if

the Minister could so state in this House, I think it will

relieve a lot of anxiety of the residents in Serangoon

Gardens Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter I wish to raise concerns the farmers

and  residents in Ang Mo Kio, who are being  cleared  from

the area. To-date, I do not think the Board has made it  a

policy  to grant such resettlement cases priority  in  the

issue  of  licences in the HDB markets on hawker  centres,

many  of which are yet to come up in the Ang Mo Kio  area.

But  I do know that the Board attempts to assist deserving

applicants  who  are resident farmers and  who  are  being

cleared  from the Ang Mo Kb area. What I wish to  know  is

whether  the Board intends to make it a policy  to  accord

priority  to  the applicants from resettlement  areas  for

stalls in the HDB markets in the Ang Mo Kio area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if the Minister could touch on the prospect of

farmers  and residents who are being cleared from  Ang  Mo

Kio.  As a result of resettlement they now have to  reside

in  Sin  Ming estate. But they wish eventually  to  go  to

Neighbourhood II or Neighbourhood III in the  Ang  Mo  Kio

area  when  the flats are up. Will there be  a  policy  to

accord  such  a facility to these resettlement  cases  who

would want a transfer back to the Ang Mo Kio area?



<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the

Ministry of National Development accounts for 5.33% of the

Main Estimates and 42.15% of the Development Estimates,  a

total  of  21  .68%  on  over  one-fifth  of  all  planned

expenditure  for  FY  1976-77. It is second  only  to  the

Ministry  of Finance itself, which accounts for 27.64%  or

over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



one-quarter. This is a huge sum. The Ministry of  National

Development  impinges very considerably on  the  lives  of

Singaporeans. In most cases it is for the better  although

inevitably it creates problems for some.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of the Ministry can be divided into two

unequal  parts .- that which affects people more directly.

and  the  other  which  deals with subjects  like  primary

production, agriculture and fisheries. I propose  to  look

at the first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is responsible for the Housing and

Development  Board.  The  expenditure  involved  here   is

enormous. The HDB will receive a loan of $792 million this

year  (compared  with $718 million last year)  besides  an

additional contribution of $46 million (compared with  $36

million last year). The HDB's expenditure will exceed that

of the entire Ministry of Defence which received 12.56% of

the  planned expenditure and is the third largest ministry

in  terms of allocation of funds. The HDB housed fully 50%

of  Singapore's population at the end of last  year.  This

figure  will  rise to 6 5-70% by 1980, by which  time  the

proportion  of  housing units built by private  developers

should  be  very small indeed. It will be Government  that

will look after the housing needs of most Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My purpose in proposing a cut in the Minister's pay is

to   draw  his  attention  to  some  problems  of   people

previously living in kampong-type environments  when  they

move  into  high-rise flats and to elicit his response  to

some suggestions on solving these problems. I am sure that

these  problems are not all new, but they are new to those

who  are affected, We have changed the way of life of  our

people.  There  are undoubted benefits -  improved  health

conditions, electricity, potable water, modern sanitation,

proximity  to schools and medical facilities,  etc.  These

are  pluses.  There  can  be no going  back  to  what  was

previously the case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the kampong-type situation, a relative who

was  emotionally-disturbed  but  not  dangerous  could  be

accommodated. Understanding friends and neighbours



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



assisted  to see that he or she did not come to any  harm.

In  the  high-rise  flat  situation  this  supportive  and

reassuring  environment is absent. Space is at  a  premium

and neighbours may be strangers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the problem of older folks. Previously, the

old  lady,  for  example, may live in  an  outhouse,  only

joining the rest of the family when she feels so inclined.

Now  this option does not exist. Hopefully, she can adjust

to  the rest of the family, and vice-versa. If she cannot,

there can be disorder under Heaven!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is even worse if the older folks do not have

relatives to live with. This problem also afflicts the not-so-old  who  are not married and, therefore, not  eligible

for HDB flats. I think we can all recognize that it is not

so  easy to find people of the same sex with whom to share

a flat to satisfy the HDB rules and regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is that in the kampong situation a

family may be able to grow some fruits and vegetables  and

to  rear  fish,  chickens, pigs, etc, to  supplement  the

meagre  family income. Living in flats, however, the  best

thing  to  grow is probably cactus, especially during  the

dry weather we suffered recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem of flat-dwellers is that of loneliness.

They miss their friends and the familiar haunts. The known

landmarks are gone at a time when cherished social  values

are  also  being  questioned as  our  society  strives  to

industrialise  and  modernise.  Perhaps  this  is  only  a

transitional period as first-generation flat-dwellers  did

not  grow up with each other. But privacy commands a  very

high  premium when people have, of necessity, to live very

close to each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem exists in particular with young

children. They are more often than not confined  to  their

flats, despite the presence of open spaces in the estates.

In the kampongs children could go out of the house to play

in  the  back  or  front yard with mother  or  grandmother

keeping a watchful eye from within the house, while  doing

the housework. But not now. A mother just cannot look out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



or  down  and  keep  an eye on her child  playing  fifteen

floors  below  on the play-deck, on the grass  or  on  the

empty ground under the flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can be done about these problems that arise from

our improving housing situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB does have some flexibility even in respect of

older estates. Some flats are being vacated as people move

on  to  better  ones.  Others  have  vacated  when  it  is

discovered    that    they    have   previously-undeclared

properties. Leases fall due. In the case of estates  under

construction provision can be made for improvements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose the incorporation of certain

units  of  flats, preferably low-rise (say,  up  to  four-storeys in new estates such as those in Buona Vista),  for

the   accommodation   of  problem  persons - emotionally-disturbed,  displaced and single older people.  This  will

mean  that  they remain an integral part of the community,

close enough to other people, including relatives who  can

visit  them,  care for them and contribute  towards  their

maintenance. The hospitals would not accept these  people.

I  have tried writing letters on behalf of them. They  may

create  serious problems for their families, if they  have

such  families.  I believe it should also be  possible  to

persuade  retired  nurses to work part-time  within  their

estates to provide professional care for such persons.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as we have basically broken the back of the

housing problem, we should begin to pay some attention  to

the  accommodation  needs  of single  people.  Until  now,

priority  has  been  correctly  given  to  families.   But

bachelors, male and female, are not unproductive,  in  the

economic   sense.  As  the  recently  appointed  Malaysian

Finance  Minister  pointed out, both  he  and  his  deputy

minister, are bachelors! Some years ago I wrote about this

subject  to  the HDB. Today I wish to raise it again  with

the  Minister. I believe that we should now construct some

bachelor  units among the new housing estates and  convert

some  of  the older flats for sale or rental to  bachelors

who can satisfy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



the  HDB that they are indeed economically productive.  We

have made it a national ideal to have small families.  Now

that families can find accommodation almost immediately if

they  are  not unduly fussy about location,  there  is  no

reason why Government should not begin to cater for  those

who  have, for the time being at least, not added  to  our

population size.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, for those with low incomes, part of which are

lost  in resettlement when they leave the land, we  should

try  to  alleviate their problems, their hardship  in  the

short-run  by  giving  them  hawkers'  licences  if   they

qualify,  and  by reserving some jobs in the  estates  for

them  and  their  families, such as car  park  attendants,

sweepers and cleaners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, how to increase neighbourliness? I am not sure

how  this ought to be tackled. We have to make collections

of  people  into  communities with their  own  distinctive

character. Residents' associations have been tried. By and

large, they   have   not  proved  to  be   spectacularly

successful.  The  Member for Stamford  several  years  ago

proposed community halls for each block for the common use

of  residents as a meeting place. The Member for Leng  Kee

and  I have tried this out in our constituencies and  they

work   quite  well.  Community  halls  can  very  usefully

supplement the larger community centres. They do provide a

focal point for activities and more of them should be made

available, both in the older and new estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I turn to the problem of young children. Our

gardens, zoos, reservoirs and beaches are solidly  packed

with people seeking the freedom from the confines of walls

and  seeking  communion with Nature. I believe  we  cannot

sever our link with Nature without doing incalculable harm

to  our  emotional well-being. I am grateful that the  HDB

built  a  total  of 1 7 gardens and playgrounds,  big  and

small, in Buona Vista Estate in my constituency. I propose

to  build  one  more field, the Minister  permitting.  Our

Government is not unaware of this problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



Land  has  been reclaimed from the sea to construct  park-lands.  Even the dead have been moved to create space  for

the living. Can more be done in the HDB estates? I believe

yes.  Many  of  the  kindergarten  classes  are  converted

residential flats, invariably on the second floor. I would

like to propose that parts of the ground floor, where they

are  empty, be  enclosed for use as kindergartens.  These

should be adjacent to open spaces, part of which should be

fenced,  so that children can play there safely under  the

supervision   of  teachers.  Mothers  will  be   relieved.

Children  should have open spaces to play  in  instead  of

within another set of walls.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, in putting my

name down for this amendment to the Minister's salary, my

intention  is  to draw the attention of the Hon.  Minister

for   Communications  and  National  Development  to  land

acquisition in Punggol constituency and its problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Paya Lebar airport runway extension work was to

be  carried out, certain parts of Tampines were  acquired,

resulting  in certain areas of Punggol being acquired  for

the  development  of  a Housing Board estate.  Five  years

later, and as a result of pollution from pig-waste to  the

Kranji  Reservoir, the Government again decided to acquire

certain parts of Punggol for pig-farming industry. In both

these  acquisition cases, many families  have  had  to  be

resettled.  In  the latter, especially  in  the  areas  of

Lorong  Buang  Kok  and Lorong Cheng  Lim,  many  families

holding  farm  licences are not allowed  to  retain  their

small plot of farming land because they are not bona  fide

farmers.  The  result is that they have to  be  resettled.

Some  are  given compensation in the form of a  three-room

unit in an HDB estate and an ex gratia payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these families who have been resettled in the

Punggol Housing Board estate poured out their problems  on

me.  I  do not mind it, because it is a problem I have  to

face.  These  families contend that  they  are  bona  fide

farmers.  But  there  is  another adjective  to  the  word

"farmer",  and  that  is. "efficient".  I  do  not  follow

despite my looking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



into  the  dictionary as to what an "efficient farmer"  in

this  respect  means. Nevertheless, those farmers  whom  I

know  and  who have been allowed to remain where they  are

have 3.000 or more head of poultry or more than 100 pigs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the basic problem lies in the fact that these

people or families who have to move to Housing Board flats

not  only  cannot  adjust  themselves  but  also  find  it

extremely difficult to maintain themselves, let alone  pay

instalments  for the purchase or rental of the  HDB  flat.

The  Member for Ulu Pandan pointed out that in  their  own

old  kampongs they could derive supplementary income  from

fruit  trees, vegetables and poultry. These are the people

who are now posing a problem to society, and it is due  to

the  exigencies of Government requirements that they  have

to  move  out from where they were living for  which  they

were  compensated with an HDB flat. Beyond that,  what  is

the future of their livelihood? In other words, what I  am

saying is that compensating a farming family with a three-room Housing Board flat will not solve the problem because

that family has lost a means of livelihood which they were

earning before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may be allowed to illustrate, let us take a family

of  father,  mother, two sons and two  daughters.  With  a

poultry farm of 2,000 egg layers and a small plot of  land

for  vegetable farming and some fruit trees; they spend  a

lot of time each day from morning till night looking after

their  poultry. They derive an income of, say.  $400-S500.

which  is sufficient because they could have supplementary

means of income from selling vegetables and fruits At  the

same  time, they need not buy certain items of food  Today

we  have this problem. I am given to understand that there

are several thousand hawker stalls or pitches lying vacant

because the department has stopped issuing hawker licences

May  I suggest to the Minister that priority consideration

for  hawker  licences be given to these people  to  enable

them  not  only to subsist but also to live  and  maintain

themselves in an HDB flat

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I wish to comment

on  the  constant digging of roads that  is  going  on  in

various  parts of Singapore. In fact, figures  which  were

given  sometime ago show that 200 diggings  are  going  on

daily  in  Singapore.  This is, of  course, fantastically

high.  Obviously  there is very little coordination,  even

though  assurances have been given that  the  coordinating

committee would deal with road diggings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some roads have been dug up so many times that

there  is  a  perpetual sign along the  road  saying  that

digging  is  going  on either by the gas  department, the

telecommunications  department, electricity   department.

sewerage  department,  water  department  or  some   other

department. I quote Upper Thomson Road as an example.  For

the  past  six  years, it has been dug  and  re-dug, re-surfaced, re-dug  again and resurfaced, so  many  times.

Nasty  comments  have been made on the  digging  of  Upper

Thomson Road. During the oil crisis, some people commented

that  the  authorities  were digging  for  oil!  I  cannot

understand  why this particular road must undergo  endless

diggings  throughout  the  year. Something  is  definitely

wrong somewhere, and this is only one of the many roads to

suffer  this problem. What does the coordinating body  has

to say about the diggings?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the motoring public has to endure these

diggings with great patience and, worst of all, they  have

to endure the very poor workmanship of resurfacing. Why is

there  no proper supervision when the resurfacing  of  the

road  is  being carried out? Are the contractors  paid  as

soon  as  the  roads are resurfaced? Is  there  no  proper

authority  to make sure that resurfacing is done  properly

so that the roads would be safe for all types of vehicular

traffic?



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, over

the past decade the Housing and Development Board has done

a  great  deal in terms of public housing for the  people.

With   the  efforts  of  the  Minister  and  all   persons

concerned.  Singapore has achieved much in public  housing

and enjoys



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



a   good   international  reputation.  The   Housing   and

Development Board has solved the housing problem  of  more

than  50% of our population. So with this achievement  the

old  problem has been solved and there should not  be  any

more  problem for the Housing and Development  Board.  But

that  does  not  seem to be the case because  with  a  new

environment new problems have arisen. Therefore.  I  would

like to raise four matters for the Minister to consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is the rejection of applications for transfer to

larger  units.  I have two examples to bring  up.  In  the

first  case there is a family of three, husband, wife  and

daughter, living in a one-room unit. Ten years ago  there

was  no  problem, but today the problem has arisen because

the  daughter  is a grown-up young lady of 20  years  old.

Problems begin to creep into their daily life. There is  a

great deal of inconvenience and this has necessitated  the

application  for  a transfer to a larger unit.  But  their

repeated  applications have been rejected  on  the  ground

that there is no bigger unit available



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second case is similar. A family of four lives in a

one-room  unit; a couple and two children,  a  boy  and  a

girl. The children are now grown-up, and the parents  have

made  application  for a transfer to a  larger  unit.  The

daughter   is  also  married  and  there  is  a   marriage

certificate to prove it. And as the son-in-law  wishes  to

stay with them they have a good reason to ask for a larger

unit, but their application was rejected without any  good

reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many vacancies in the thousands of HDB

flats in Singapore. However, the civil servants in the HDB

do not seem to pay much attention to these vacancies. They

do  not seem to be interested to house the needy in  these

vacant  flats, resulting in a  loss  of  revenue  to  the

Government. I hope the Minister will pay attention to this

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints that applications for

transfer  of flats have been made five years ago  but  the

HDB is still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



unable  to  effect the transfer. As far as know,  most  of

these  applicants are living in one-room flats. They  have

applied  for transfer to larger units because of a  bigger

family. They have about six or seven persons occupying one

room. This is not only unhealthy hut also undesirable.  So

I  would  ask the Minister concerned to pay more attention

to this



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is whether the Minister will consider

the  abolition of the tender system for shops. Instead  of

the tender system, a proper rental rate should be fixed by

the  Government  or  by ballotting. I  raise  this  matter

because  I  understand that tenders  for  HDB  shops  have

reached  fantastically high levels. For  example, in  Toa

Payoh,  some  shops have been tendered for over  $3,000  a

month.  `when  the  floor area is only about  700  to  800

square feet. This works out to about $40 per square  foot.

about  ten times higher than the most expensive rental  in

the  commercial  centre in the city.  In  the  case  of  a

restaurant, where the floor area is 1.800 square feet, the

tendered  rent  is $5,000. It works out to about  $30  per

square  foot  What will be the result of these  exorbitant

rates? Well, since wool must con-,e from sheep, the result

will be a greater bu-den for the consumers. There will  be

a  higher  rate of inflation. I appeal to the Minister  to

consider  this  very seriously, because if we  allow  this

tender  system to continue then rents will be higher, and

such  higher  rents  will in the end nullify  Government's

efforts in countering inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister to consider

the   feasibility  of  building  more  HDB  flats  in  the

Sembawang constituency to meet the increasing needs of the

people there. In Sembawang there are at present orly eight

blocks  of  3'room  and 4-room flats, totalling  some  720

units, built  by the Jurong Town Corporation.  These  are

inadequate   to  meet  the  present  demand   Furthermore.

Sembawang  is  being  developed into  a  large  industrial

estate,  as provided in the Estimates Senoko in  Sembawang

has  been  zoned  "Industrial". Very soon  there  will  be

factories coming up and thousands and thousands of workers

will be working in these factories So, for the convenience

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



the workers and residents in the constituency. I appeal to

the  Minister to consider building more flats in the  area

so that they can live and work happily there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Sir, I regret to note -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a

point of order. Some Members have already given notice  to

speak  on  specific  subheads, but they  all  seem  to  be

speaking now on this subhead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Put a stop to this practice.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is what you ought to do. Mr Sim.

please carry on, bearing this in mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Thank you very much, Sir. As everyone

is jumping on to the band wagon. I thought I would join in

also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret to note that the Changi Airport Development

which  costs  $129.6 million has been planned  with  total

disregard  for the welfare and livelihood of the fishermen

directly affected by this project. 25 kelongs have to give

way  for  reclamation. The removal  of  the  kelongs  will

affect  the  livelihood of about 60  fishermen  and  their

dependants.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I presume the Member for Changi will not

raise this matter again later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> No, Sir. The manner in which the

Fisheries  Division carried out the clearance  has  caused

much  dissatisfaction  among  the  kelong  operators   and

fishermen  who  are  affected. I strongly  feel  that  the

Fisheries  Division is only interested  in  the  immediate

clearance of the kelong operators and fishermen  from  the

site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Division has no plan whatsoever to alleviate the

immediate  suffering  of  the  people  affected   by   the

clearance.  For  example, on the 27th December  last  year

kelong  operators were informed that their licences  would

not  be  renewed. But later, on 11th February, 1976, they

were  given  two weeks' notice to vacate their kelongs  by

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



25th  February  this  year. Sir, even unauthorised  hawker

stall  holders  need  more time to vacate.  The  Fisheries

Division  all  the while had the intention  to  cease  the

renewal  of  these kelong licences, and yet they  verbally

told  the  kelong operators that they could  repair  their

kelongs. The repair of a kelong easily costs over $20,000.

This  money  is literally dumped into the sea without  any

hope of recovery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has always been the case that there is no rapport

between  the Ministries involved. The right hand does  not

know  what  the  left hand is doing. On  7th July, 1975.

kelongs  SE  27  and  SE 62 were issued  with  permits  to

resite. What is fantastic is that kelongs SE 32 and SE  34

had  their licences renewed on 19th January, 1976, but  on

26th  February, 1 976 the operators were told  that  their

licences could not be renewed. Sir, much money and trouble

would  have  been  saved  if the  Fisheries  Division  had

earlier  informed  the kelong operators concerned  of  the

clearance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation to be paid to the kelong operators is

grossly  inadequate.  The compensation  is  based  on  the

number  of  nibong  poles used in its  construction.  Sir,

this, in my opinion, is a ridiculous way of assessing  the

compensation. Nibong poles constitute only  about  20%  of

the total cost of the structures. Most of the cost goes to

the  labour  involved. Moreover, I was informed  that  the

compensation  was  based  on  the  old  1963  policies  of

payment, which should be obsolete by now. Displaced kelong

operators  were  not given any immediate alternative  site

nor  their  workers  given consideration  for  alternative

livelihood  opportunities. Most of the kelong workers  are

too  old.  - 50. 60 and even 70 years, and very  hard  for

them to learn a new trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The displaced Siglap fishermen had been allocated

pitches in the HDB market in Bedok New Town. The Fisheries

Division seems to have made no immediate attempt to assist

these  displaced Changi fishermen, likewise. On the  other

hand, the Agricultural Division had allocated alternative

sites  for  bona  fide farmers. I am  sure  the  Fisheries

Division can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



do  the same for the kelong operators, otherwise I suggest

that this Division be closed down.



<br><br>4.45 pm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I request the Minister concerned to consider the

following  pleas  of  the  fishermen  more  and   adequate

compensation  he  awarded  to  kelong  operators  who  are

affected:  alternative  sites to  be  allotted  to  kelong

operators or all displaced fishermen to be allotted stalls

in  hawker centres or markets: kelong operators  who  were

served with non-renewal notices in 1974 be considered  for

compensation  or  resiting of their  kelongs;  enforcement

action  to be suspended with immediate effect until  their

livelihood is settled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to caution the Minister concerned that, by

declaring  the  site  along the  Changi  sea  coast  as  a

restricted  area, more inshore fishermen will  be  greatly

affected  again, and I do not know whether  the  Fisheries

Division is aware of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, let me take the comment

of  the  Member for Toa Payoh first. If he  were  in  this

House yesterday he must have heard the exposition given by

the   Prime  Minister  in  reply  to  the  accusation   of

discourtesy on the part of public servants, raised by  the

Member  for  Katong. So I would not go further  into  that

other than saying that where instances of discourtesy  and

rudeness can be pinpointed, action will be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh raised several points with

regard  to  the tenancy of shops. He says that shopkeepers

do  change  their trade from time to time and, because  of

that.  HDB  officers ask them to either  revert  to  their

original  trade or to pay a revised rental  based  on  the

present  standard  rental for the trade  The  rentals  and

tenders for shops are based on the type of business  done.

Those who tender for coffee shops and provision shops have

to  pay  high rentals. So if a person has tendered  for  a

bookshop  and  in time changes it into a  coffee  shop  or

provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



shop, he  is  being unfair to those who  had  tendered  a

higher  rate  for  a  coffee shop  or  a  provision  shop.

Therefore, the rationale behind the action of the officers

is that the tenant either reverts to his original trade or

pay  the new rental for the type of trade that he is going

to engage in. I think this is quite fair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the accusation of high rentals. Who pays

the  rental? The public pays the rental. Who tenders?  The

public  tenders. If a businessman tenders, he knows better

than  you  or  I what price to pay. They have  been  quite

successful. We made a survey and found that 90%  of  those

who  tendered  for HDB shops made their business  pay.  So

this  is  not a rate that is fixed by the HDB. This  is  a

rate fixed by the forces of supply and demand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> But they fleece the

consumers!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> We allow free market forces to play

here.  Free  market fortes determine rentals. This  is  in

reply  to the suggestion by the Member for Sembawang  that

we  should abolish the tender system. The system has  been

working well 90% of those who have tendered for HDB  shops

have succeeded in making it pay. This is a high percentage

of success for any type of business. Achieving 90% success

in  any undertaking is a sure sign of a successful system.

I  can  find  no other system which will ensure  a  fairer

deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the points raised by the Member for

Serangoon Gardens I think it is time for Members  to  stop

listering to rumours I am not aware that Serangoon Gardens

Estate  is  to  be acquired, and do not think  it  is  the

policy  of  the  Government to acquire  a  well  laid  out

estate, then pull the houses down and build Housing  Board

flats.  That is not the policy. Where a housing estate  is

well  laid out and has established itself. I think we will

leave it alone



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to priority for farmers who are resettled

from Ang Mo Kio, we can divide resettlement into different

categories For instance. "efficient bona fide farmers". A



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



bona  fide  farmer means a farmer who has been  rearing  a

minimum of 100 pigs or 3,000 head of poultry and is making

full  economic use of the land. This is a bona fide farmer

and  if  he  is  efficient  he will  be  able  to  earn  a

reasonable  income  from his 100 pigs  or  3.000  head  of

poultry.  And on resettlement he will be given alternative

land to farm elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While listening to the Member for Punggol, I was a bit

confused because he says that these poor people were  able

to  live because they were supplementing their income from

farming.   If   their   income  from   farming   is   only

supplementary, they would not be full time  or  bona  fide

farmers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. I said

that  the  supplementary income came from the fruit  trees

and the vegetables they grow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> They are not bona fide farmers then. So

if  they  are  not bona fide farmers, they are  given  the

choice of either a Housing Board flat or cash in lieu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some Hon. Members:</b> No I



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> They are given a Housing Board flat or

cash  in lieu. In order to solve their employment problem,

the  Housing Board will be building two rural centres, one

in  Punggol  and  the  other in Jalan  Kayu.  These  rural

centres will be built amidst a farming population so  that

those  who are not bona fide farmers but part-time farmers

can  find work there if they want to. This is one  of  the

ways to solve the employment problem of ex-farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those people living in attap huts will be given priority

in the allocation of Housing Board flats. Shopkeepers will

be  given  priority to tender for shops in  Housing  Board

estates.  They  will have to pay what we  call  "a  rising

rental", that is, during the first year of occupation they

pay  only  50% of the average rent which a public tenderer

pays. For the second year of occupation they pay 10%  more

and  by the sixth year they will be paying the full  rent.

These are the resettlement terms, and so priority is given

to them in certain cases. It all depends on which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



category of resettled persons they come under. I hope that

answers the query by the Member for Serangoon Gardens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards licences for hawker centres and markets, we

have  32,000 hawkers on the road. We are going to resettle

them  in  hawker  centres and markets and they  are  given

first  priority. I know, everybody thinks that hawking  is

very  profitable and so wants a hawker licence. So we have

to  be  very careful. We do not allow every Tom, Dick  and

Harry  to  be  a  hawker. Only those who  really  find  it

difficult  to  make  a living will be given  very  careful

consideration.  It  is  the Government's  policy  to  move

hawkers  from the streets into hawker centres and markets.

Street  hawkers  are given priority in the  allocation  of

stalls  in hawker centres and markets as this will improve

the  environment  and  make it  easier  to  enforce  clean

personal  habits among those who handle and sell food,  Of

course,  consideration can be given to those who  find  it

difficult   to   earn   a  living  because   of   age   or

circumstances.  But consideration will only  be  given  to

those  over 40 years of age for a market pitch or a hawker

licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the query about those who are

resettled  from Ang Mo Kio to Sin Ming Road. He  wants  to

know whether, when the time comes, they will be allowed to

return to Ang Mo Kio. I think this is very speculative, By

the  time  they have settled in Sin Ming Road  for  a  few

years  they may not want to return to Ang Mo Kio.  And  by

that  time  if  they  still think  of  returning,  thereby

displacing  their  roots  again the  matter  can  then  be

raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan is right. We have moved from

the kampong to the city. We have moved from the pondok  to

high-rise flats, We have made economic progress. We are on

the  way  to  being an industrialised country.  We  are  a

commercialised city. And in that process, of course,  many

changes have occurred, one of which is that the Member  is

not now able to enjoy life sitting under a coconut tree in

the  moonlight, strumming his guitar or fishing  with  his

toes. Some of the things that we have left behind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



are  good and some are bad, but as the Member says, "There

is  no  looking  back". But in entering an industrialised,

commercialised  and  urbanised  environment  we  have  new

problems,  some  of which he has stated. In  passing,  the

Member  did mention that the Budget estimate for  the  HDB

has  gone up compared with 1974-75, the subsidy being  $46

million as against $36 million for last year. This is  one

aspect  of  the Housing Board which very few  people  have

looked into and are aware of or want to be aware of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the average Singaporean, a landlord is a rich man. He

owns houses and he rents them out. He collects rent and he

is therefore a rich man. The Housing and Development Board

being the biggest landlord in Singapore should, therefore,

be  the richest organisation in Singapore. And yet it  has

to  get a subsidy of $46 million from the Government. Why?

Because  we  are  subsidising public housing.  So  I  hope

Members  will  note that. Though the HDB  is  the  biggest

landlord in Singapore, it is not making money. The Housing

Board  is being subsidised to the tune of $46 million  for

this  year: it was subsidised $36 million last year As  we

build more houses, the subsidy will grow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan says that the tenants are

strangers when they move into Housing Board flats. Even if

we  should  move 500 people into a kampong, they  will  be

strangers. So it makes no difference. Whether or not he is

going  to  be  lonely, and whether  or  not  he  can  make

friends, depends upon his character. If he is an extrovert

he  makes friends easily. But if he is an introvert, he is

going  to  be lonely whether in a kampong or in a  Housing

Board flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from a life of growing vegetables to a life in

Housing  Board fIat, we have gone into a new  environment.

We  have progressed and so some of the past practices have

to  be left behind. It is nice to be nostalgic about this.

But  I think we have to adapt ourselves and I am very glad

that he has pinpointed some of the problems ., the problem

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



loneliness,  the problem facing bachelors and the  problem

of young children.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children living in high-rise flats do pose a problem. I

have visited a number of these high-rise flats. The blocks

are quite close together and I feel claustrophobic. But in

our  experience we find that the children can easily adapt

themselves.  They  play along the corridors.  In  the  new

housing  estates the flats are twice the size of  the  old

ones. So there is ample space. The children can play along

the  corridors among themselves. As they grow  older  they

would  go  to the playground. But, of course, there  is  a

need  to  provide more playing fields and more open  space

for  the children. We will try to provide that as much  as

we can with our limited space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the old people. I have great sympathy for

them  because the old `family tradition is breaking  down.

We  find  that more and more old people are being left  on

their  own, The Housing Board has tried renting its  flats

to  the private Homes for the Aged so that they can  bring

the old people to live there. I have also asked whether it

is  possible  to make use of the ground floor  (which  the

Member has suggested should be turned into a kindergarten)

to  house  these old people. If the old people have  young

members of their family living in the same estate, we will

give  them  priority to be housed there.  This  matter  is

being  looked into. As I have said, there is a pilot  plan

to  rent some of the flats to Homes for the Aged. We  have

also  gone a step further. If the old people so  wish,  we

will  try  and  accommodate  them  in  places  near  their

relatives  or  families, so that they can  baby-sit  their

grandchildren.  They can be a help to working  mothers  in

looking after their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards nurses, I think my colleague, the Minister

for  Health,  would  be very pleased  if  the  Member  can

persuade  retired nurses to help look after the sick,  the

aged  and  the children in the housing estates. These  are

good suggestions and will be looked into. It is not beyond

our power and means to persuade the nurses to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the problem of single people. The Member for Ulu

Pandan  must  realise that priority  should  be  given  to

applicants who have families living with them. We  have  a

long  waiting list of 90,000 applicants. But for the young

single men and women with initiative, they should have  no

problem  finding accommodation because we  allow  them  to

rent  rooms from tenants or owners of Housing Board flats.

They  will find it easier to find such rooms now  because,

as  I  have  said, the new flats are bigger. I think  that

should  take  care of their problem. We are not  going  to

build Housing Board flats solely for single persons. I  do

not know whether or not they will create more mischief!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to finding jobs in housing estates, there

are  lots  of vacancies for sweepers and cleaners  in  the

Housing  Board estates. If flat tenants find it  difficult

to  get work, they can apply to the Housing Board for such

jobs.  There  is  no  problem as the  HDB  is  finding  it

difficult to fill these posts. In fact, we are encouraging

people who live in the estates to take up these jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to community halls to complement the

community centres, this question is being looked into.  It

is  our policy to build community halls to complement  the

community  centres in all new Housing Board  estates.  The

Member  for  Ulu Pandan is most fortunate in that  in  his

constituency he has 17 fields and open playgrounds. Yet he

still  wants one more. If all Members agree. I  will  give

him one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Let me now come to the Member for

Punggol. I have said something about resettlement and  our

attempt  to place the affected people on some jobs.  If  a

person  is  really willing to work, as my  colleague,  the

Minister  for  Labour, has just said. "See the  Employment

Service." There are lots of jobs available. We have issued

thousands of work permits. And yet the Member for  Punggol

has  said it is difficult td find a job. We will find jobs

for  them in the housing estates which we are building  in

Punggol.

they  can  become cleaners for the Housing and Development

Board. The Member can give their names to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson talks about the digging of roads

all  over  Singapore.  We have to dig  roads  because  the

Housing  Board  is building so many houses and  there  are

also  many factories coming up. With economic progress  we

have  to  lay  pipes for water and cables for electricity,

sewerage and telephones. All these are different services,

requiring different techniques in laying the systems. This

problem has preoccupied not only me but also my colleague.

the  Minister for the Environment, for the last ten years.

There  is a coordinating committee to see that a  road  is

not  dug up soon after one service has been laid. But  the

peculiarities of the different services are such  that  we

find  it  difficult to coordinate the work. There  is  one

telephone to every six persons in Singapore. That is quite

a  high  rate. Almost everyone in Singapore  has  a  water

closet  now. All this means that if we do not dig  up  the

roads to lay the services, we cannot have them. Of course,

the  road should, be dug as quickly as possible and  there

should be coordination. I can assure Members that there is

a  committee  sitting, with the Director of  Public  Works

presiding,  and from time to time the Minister  in  charge

will  sit in to improve coordination. We have done all  we

can  to  ensure  that  there is  as  little  hindrance  as

possible  to  motorists and, at the same time,  to  ensure

that economic development is not hindered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the Member for Sembawang. We do allow

HDB  residents  to move into larger flats. But  there  are

certain  priorities, such as for medical reasons or  other

extenuating circumstances. Wanting to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



get married is probably not one of the priorities. Another

reason why applicants for transfers have to wait longer is

that 3-room flats are very popular. Wherever possible,  we

allot  such  flats to those who have already been  on  the

waiting list, Those who have not yet had the advantage  of

staying  in  Housing  Board flats should  be  given  first

preference.  After that we will then look into  cases  for

transfers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the request for abolition of the tender

system, I have replied to that earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to the question raised by the Member

for Changi. Let me say that licences for kelongs are given

on the understanding that they are on Temporary Occupation

Licences,  and  may be revoked at any time.  This  is  the

understanding.  I find it very difficult to  believe  what

the Member has said. He may be quite naive to believe what

he  has  been told. He said that on the 29th of January  `

the  kelong  operators were told. "Yes,  go  on.  You  can

repair  your  kelong." A fortnight later in February  they

were  told, "You stop. We are acquiring it." He said  that

during that fortnight they had spent $20,000 repairing the

kelongs, which finally went into the sea.  They  must  be

very efficient. If they are that efficient, we do not have

to  import  fish.  I do not think they have  really  spent

$20,000  within a fortnight. He mentioned that 25  kelongs

are  affected but quite a number of them have already  had

their  licences  revoked since 1974. Yet  they  are  still

there.  They know very well since 1974 that they  have  to

leave. I believe some Members know that these kelongs  are

not  genuine  kelongs. They are not built to  catch  fish.

They are there for something else. I have no knowledge  of

what  they  are  there  for.  Some  Members  may  wish  to

enlighten  me  on that. But as I have said, they  are  not

there for fishing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for those who were given less than a year's

notice,  we  are making an exception. We are  compensating

them with the cost of replacing the poles. But I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



believe  that  within the short period they had  spent  so

much money. It is not correct to say that the compensation

is  unfair  and  that  it should be  enhanced.  First  and

foremost, I do not think he is right in saying that it  is

unfair.  Secondly, enhancing the compensation  would  mean

that  we  have  to  enhance  the  compensation  for  other

resettlement  cases elsewhere. Here, I have  got  to  say,

"No" to him with a smile.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister could

have  misunderstood me on the matter of rentals for  shop-houses. I am not opposed to the tender system. What  I  am

saying is that the rentals have been revised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of building have increased over the years. It

is,  therefore, quite fair for the Housing Board to  raise

the  minimum  rental  from time to  time,  and  this  will

consequently affect the tender price. This is fair. In the

tender  form  various  categories of  approved  trade  are

listed,  A,  B, C, D and E. I believe there is  a  certain

maximum  rental for each category. But what  these  people

are grumbling about is this. In Toa Payoh there is the old

section and the new section. When a person tendered for  a

grocery  shop  on any other shop in the old  section,  the

normal  minimum rental was $185 p.m. This was way back  in

1968. Some years later the minimum rental was increased to

$280  p.m. But now the rental is about $320 p.m.  However,

if  a person had successfully tendered for a stall in  the

old  section  of  Toa Payoh and subsequently  changes  his

trade to another trade but within the same category, he is

asked  to  pay the rental which is currently in  force.  I

think this is not fair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Toa Payoh there are three Area Offices with three

community halls. Two of them have already been turned into

Car  Park  Offices. In the case of the  third  one  in  my

constituency,  one-third of it has been converted  into  a

Car  Park Office. So there are no facilities left for  the

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It is a question of choice. Do you want

to  have  community centres, or do you want  to  have  car

parks?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



There  were  people  who shouted for  car  parks,  and  so

community centres have been turned into car parks. You can

have one but not both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards rent, I think it is quite fair for the

Housing  Board to base it on the latest rent  because  the

area may have flourished. Therefore, it is quite fair that

the rent is based on the latest rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead BAA 1105.* (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Ho Kah Leong and Ch'ng Jit Koon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main task of the Public Works Department is to

plan  and  execute  the construction  of  our  nation-wide

network  of  public roads, the sewerage system  and  their

maintenance. The PWD has very heavy responsibilities.  Our

network   of  public  roads  has  all  along   been   well

maintained. The road surface is generally smooth and even,

which goes to enhance our image.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in recent years, there has been a rapid

increase in the number of vehicles and also an increase in

construction  work  everywhere.  All  this  presents   the

serious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



problem  of  traffic congestion. If this  problem  is  not

solved  quickly, it will certainly affect our daily  lives

and   the  further  development  of  our  commercial   and

industrial  activities. In view of this, I would  like  to

put  forward two suggestions to the Minister to help solve

the problem of traffic congestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we can build bicycle tracks along the main

roads. At the moment, the Government is trying its best to

reduce  the  number of vehicles on the road  in  order  to

facilitate  a smooth flow of vehicles. In line  with  this

objective  we  should encourage more  people  to  use  the

bicycle  as  a  means of transport. In order to  encourage

this  the  PWD should construct bicycle tracks  along  the

main roads in order to provide safety to cyclists. If this

plan is carried out positively and extensively, I believe.

it  will  bring  about desirable results.  When  that  day

comes,  the  whole  workforce  from  the  commercial   and

industrial  sectors and even the public sector, including

Ministers and Members of Parliament will be able to go  to

office  on  bicycles. This will not only  relieve  traffic

congestion but it will also be conducive to our health and

help us to economise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister whether he

will  consider changing the hours of work for all roadwork

in  the Central Business District. Generally roadworks are

always  carried  out in the centre of the  road  and  this

takes  up  space and makes the roads even more  congested.

Why  not change the hours of work to the night as it  will

considerably  alleviate the serious traffic congestion  in

the  City  area, I would like the Minister to consider  my

suggestion seriously. If he thinks that this will increase

our expenditure, then I would say that the higher cost  is

justified for the smooth flow of traffic in the CBD.  This

will also help our commerce and industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the new road extension work in progress in the

Thomson and Sembawang areas. I would like to ask how  long

is  the road and whether there will be any ramifying roads

in these areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under this

amendment, I would like to raise the question of solving

the problem of traffic congestion in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, Jurong is the industrial centre of our

country.  We  can  find hundreds of  factories  there  and

thousands  of people working there, and their numbers  are

increasing. However, to the west of Jurong there is  Jalan

Ahmad  Ibrahim, and the other road is Jurong Road.  During

peak  hours in the morning and in the afternoon  there  is

heavy  traffic  congestion  in  these  roads.  The  Senior

Minister of State had worked in Jurong before and  I  hope

that he would take note of this and perhaps pay a visit to

his  old  colleagues in Jurong so that he  can  be  better

informed  of  the  situation which is now  getting  worse.

Although  I  thank the Public Works Department for  having

done  a good job with Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim and other  roads

which  have been widened or improved. I feel the situation

can be improved there to a great extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, touching on this topic, I suggested to the

Minister  that  we  could link up Jalan  Buroh  and  Jalan

Penjuru by a bridge so that we could have one more road to

link  up with Jurong town. The Minister then replied  that

his  Ministry would consider this suggestion. I now  raise

the matter again to see what has been done after one year.

Although  the  Minister is not here now but  his  Ministry

still  exists  and I hope something will be done  in  this

respect.  I wonder whether any decision has been  made  in

this  regard. I hope the Senior Minister of State can help

to solve this matter.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang):</b> Sir, let me first answer the questions raised

by  the  Member  for  Sembawang. During  the  early  1960s

bicycle tracks were provided in all new road projects  and

some  of  these  tracks  still  exist  in  such  areas  as

Queenstown,  Commonwealth Avenue, Lornie Road and  Thomson

Road.  But the result of a study of bicycle traffic  shows

that  cyclists, like the Member for Sembawang, prefer  to

ride along



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



the main carriageway instead of on the tracks provided for

them.  For example, during the Cycling Week you could  see

him  cycling night on the open road and not on  the  track

provided.  Since then the provision of bicycle tracks  has

been excluded from all new road programmes of the PWD.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are all agreed that cycling is a good

recreational exercise, but it is obviously less  effective

and  less  efficient  than, say, buses.  We  have  done  a

research  which clearly shows that a bicycle on  the  road

occupies  as much as one-third of road space  for  a  car.

This  means  that three commuters on bicycles occupy  road

space  equivalent to one car. On the other hand,  the  new

Jumbo   bus,  for  example, which  occupies  road   space

equivalent to nine cyclists or three cars can take a  load

of  70  to  80 passengers. Therefore, the bus is at  least

five  times  more effective than a bicycle as  a  form  of

transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all agreed with the Member that cycling is to be

encouraged as a form of exercise, but it is definitely not

practicable as a mode of travel, in particular, into  the

congested  City  area.  As  a recreational  exercise,  the

Member must be probably aware, since he is a keen cyclist,

that  we  have  provided cycle tracks along the  new  East

Coast  Park. He is welcome to use them whenever  he  feels

like it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also made the suggestion that we carry out road

repairs  during  the evening. The PWD  is  at  the  moment

carrying  out certain road maintenance works in  the  CBD,

such  as  road  resurfacing and painting of  lines,  white

lines in particular, during the night or off-peak hours or

during  week-ends.  However, in regard  to  excavation  of

roads for the laying of the various utility services  such

as  electricity, water and gas, serious problems may arise

if such work is carried out during the night. For example,

in  certain areas of the CBD where there are residents  it

would  create a noise nuisance to the residents. It  would

also  create the problem of unfinished work which, by  the

following   morning,  would  cause   a   heavier   traffic

congestion, probably  increasing  the  accident   risks.

Moreover, we may have the difficulty of getting people  to

work at night.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member raised a third query in regard to the

widening  of  Upper Thomson Road and Sembawang  Road.  The

programme  at the moment involves three stages. The  first

stage  is the extension of Sembawang from Mandai  Road  to

Jalan   Sembawang  Kechil.  This  stretch   of   road   is

approximately 4.511 metres long. The second  stage  covers

from  Upper Thomson Road at the Sembawang Hill  Circus  to

Mandai Road. This is equivalent to 3,205 metres long.  The

final  stage would mean the final construction from  Jalan

Sembawang Kechil to Admiralty Gate. This stretch  of  road

is  about 2.027 metres long. We have just only begun Stage

I  in  July  1975.lt is expected to be completed  in  July

1976. The completion of all three stages will take us  up

to  1978. I have no figures to tell the Member how much it

will cost. But if he is interested to know how much is the

cost of Stage I as well as the other stages I will be very

happy  to supply him with the information if he will write

to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the Member for Jurong, I am extremely

sympathetic  towards his observations because  I  used  to

travel along that road about a year ago. According to  the

PWD, a number of improvements have since then been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is granted that the previous Minister for Law and

National  Development did suggest that he would look  into

it.  But  there are three reasons why the Member's request

cannot be entertained. First of all, as far as the PWD  is

concerned,  the  JTC  is the authority  for  Jurong  Town.

Secondly, the matter was referred to the JTC but they felt

that there was no justification at this stage to construct

a  bridge across this particular area. It is obvious  that

the  cost of construction for such a long bridge would  be

prohibitive. Thirdly, although the JTC was not  in  favour

or  could  not  justify the construction  of  this  bridge

across, the PWD on its own has done as much as it could to

widen  the roads at Upper Ayer Rajah Road, extending  West

Coast  Road  into Jurong Town Hall Road, together  with  a

number of other proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that at this juncture the PWD has no intention,

and it has no budget for 1976/77 anyway, to carry out this

expensive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



construction project. I would suggest that, if the  Member

is really keen, he should convince the JTC of the need for

this project and we can decide who is to foot the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, first of all, I

thank  the  Minister of State for his reply.  He  is  very

sympathetic  to  my view that there is  the  necessity  to

build  the  bridge across the road, but  in  view  of  the

problem of a lack of funds, he has suggested that I should

persuade the JTC to approve the project. I would say  that

the   Minister  of  State  would  be  more  effective   in

persuading the JTC to implement my suggestion. He would be

in a better position to take up this proposal than I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still feel that the problem is there although, as I

have  pointed out, the road has been widened and  improved

upon.  This  goes  to  a  certain extent  to  relieve  the

congestion there. However, in view of the fact that Jurong

Town  is being developed and more people are working there

to  work  as  more  factories are being set  up, we  have

reached  the  point  where  the  situation  needs  further

improvement in the most basic way. If the JTC and the  PWD

are  not  able to provide the funds for the work,  then  I

suggest that both of them share the costs. I believe  that

since   the   Minister  of  State  has   some   links   or

communication   in  Jurong  with  either   the   Singapore

Manufacturers  Association or other bodies  concerned,  he

should be in a position to help.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, while it is a compliment that I

have more power than the Hon. Member, he must bear in mind

that JTC comes directly under the Ministry of Finance  and

the  Chairman  may have more power than I do.  However,  I

think  it  is a fain proposal. We will take the initiative

by contacting JTC and see whether there could be an agreed

formula,  If it is necessary some formula could be  worked

out.  After  all,  it is the Ministry of Finance  that  is

funding it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of the

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I accept your ruling, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the attention of the House to the

extreme difficulty experienced nowadays by individuals and

associations in seeking approval from the Building Control

Division  for  a  change  in the utilisation  of  building

premises.  The  Building Control Division  appears  to  be

absolutely  inflexible, fussing over minor  technicalities

which  are often irrelevant and stultify attempts  to  use

premises  for any other purpose. This creates  frustration

and indignation among the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you a few examples. In my constituency, as a

result  of  urban renewal, about half a dozen associations

have been asked to quit their premises. These associations

experienced   great   difficulty  in  obtaining   suitable

alternative  locations and have thus been unable  to  move

within  the time specified by the Urban Renewal Authority.

However, even  when they found a suitable location  their

application to use the premises has been rejected  by  the

Building   Control  Division  on  the  ground   that   the

association should not be sited in that locality. No  real

reason was given as to why the-location was unsuitable and

consequently  the impression is created that the  decision

has  been made at the whims and fancies of somebody in the

Building



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



Control Division. Sometimes when a locality is approved by

the  Building  Control  Division, they  will  nevertheless

insist that the third floor should be used instead of  the

second floor which is preferred by the association. If the

third floor can be used, why not the second floor? What is

the rationale behind such a thinking? It would, therefore.

seem  that  on  the  one  hand  while  the  Urban  Renewal

Authority  is  driving  the  associations  out  of   their

premises  in  the  name  of urban  renewal,  the  Building

Control  Division  on the other hand puts  obstruction  in

their  removal  to  new  premises.  The  associations  are

therefore  in  a dilemma, and I would therefore  urge  the

Building  Control  Division to  exercise  some  degree  of

flexibility and also to examine the rationale behind  some

of their regulations.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in filing an amendment

to  this  subhead, I merely wish to seek the clarification

of  the  Minister  concerned with regard to  the  building

plans  that  are  being sold by his Ministry.  With  these

plans, one would be able to proceed to build a  temporary

house, say, with three rooms and a sitting hall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier in this Chamber, there are

several farmers who have been given small plots of land in

Punggol to continue with pig farming. But they are  facing

some  difficulty  with  regard 10 the  erection  of  their

temporary  building which has to be strictly in accordance

with  the  detailed plan. For example, if  one  obtains  a

building plan for a house with three rooms and a hall, one

finds  that  the kitchen, the bathroom and the toilet  are

all  sited together. But there is no modern sanitation  ii

that  area, and I think Hon. Members can just imagine that

at  meal times what flavour the smell would give to  their

meals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Aroma!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Or aroma, as my good Friend, the Member

for  Jalan  Kayu,  has said. In this  respect,  could  the

Ministry then allow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



such  toilet  facilities to be sited outside the  building

rather  than  insist  on the strict  requirement  that  it

should be sited in the building together with the bathroom

and the kitchen?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the roof eaves which has a protrusion

of  about  three feet. I have met no less than 20  farmers

from areas like Chua Chu Kang and Cheng San who complained

to  me  that  they  had tried to ask the Building  Control

Division  to allow an extension of the protrusion  to  the

front part of the building but without any further support

from  the ground to, say, about eight feet so as to  avoid

the rain. Incidentally we have been having some very heavy

rain these days. Since the protrusion to the eaves is only

about three feet, whenever it rains especially when it  is

heavy,  windows  have  to be shut, and  according  to  one

farmer his house has been turned into a little pond.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since all these resettled farmers have brought with them

money to begin a new means of livelihood, pig farming, and

since  the  houses are of a temporary nature,  surely  the

Ministry could allow a certain amount of flexibility, such

as  extension  to the front part of the building,  if  the

alteration does not cause any extension of the  ground  or

floor area. In this connection, the latrine too should  be

allowed to be sited outside the house rather than  in  the

house.  It  is  most  inconvenient and unhygienic  because

there is no modern sanitation in these areas. Most of all,

one  can  just imagine that a great part of  the  area  is

entirely devoted to pig farming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that the Minister concerned would

kindly  consider my appeal on behalf of those farmers  who

are  there, as well as those who will be coming  to  join

them  and  they have come to see the place and  have  also

made suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I would like to support the

sentiments  expressed  by the two Hon.  Members  who  have

spoken before me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I fully agree with the point raised by the

Member  for Punggol. I think there is something  basically

not  quite  right with the standard plan prepared  by  the

Building Control Division. They seem to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



overlooked  the  fact that in all those areas  where  that

standard  plan is supposed to be applicable, there  is  no

modern  sanitation.  So it is preferable  that  we  should

allow them to erect the toilet and bathroom away from  the

main  building.  There is no doubt that there  is  a  very

strict and rigid adherence to the rules and regulations as

mentioned by the Member for Bras Basah to the extent  that

some of these cottage industries are suffering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we ought to draw a line somewhere. We ought to

support  certain cottage industries and not discourage  or

ban  them,  especially if they are situated in  the  rural

areas. If there are no complaints from the neighbours  and

if they are not polluting the environment, either in terms

of  noise  or  air pollution, they should be allowed  some

flexibility.  I have come across a number of cases  where,

in  order to supplement their earnings, the families  sub-contract  work  from  garment factories.  They  bring  the

garments  back  home to sew. The housewives and  daughters

join  in to make a bit of extra money. Yet the next moment

the  Building Control Division comes along and tells  them

to stop. As far as I can see, they are contributing to our

economy  and they are not disturbing anybody at  all.  All

this type of activity is going on in the rural areas where

the houses are situated a fair distance from each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all these points ought to be taken into

consideration. The Division should not just say, "There is

only  one  set  of rules irrespective of the environment."

There  ought  to  be  some  distinction  on  the  type  of

commercial or economic activities that might be  permitted

even in residential districts.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the point made by the Member for Jalan Kayu. At  a

time  when we are facing economic difficulties I do  think

that  we  should  not be too rigid in the  application  of

rules  and regulations, especially in the use of buildings

or,  as he has described them, cottage industries, or even

to have self-employment at home. If we are too rigid, then

I  think  we  are  going  to  exacerbate  the  problem  of

unemployment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, several

MPs  from  the  rural  areas have already  spoken  on  the

problems of housing and housing control. I would  like  to

place  on record my support for their sentiments expressed

in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we always face such problems in the rural areas,

for  example,  problems  of  alterations,  renovations  or

repairs.  If  these people have to engage an architect  to

draw  up a plan, it will cost them a lot of money. So they

buy  the standard plan available from the Building Control

Division but such plans have certain restrictions  on  the

land  area which should not exceed 1 .000 sq, ft.  But  in

the  rural  areas many of the families have more  than  10

persons each, and all of them are crammed into a space  of

1.000  sq, ft. I think this is too much. The  Member  for

Punggol  has  raised this point and I  fully  endorse  his

suggestion that we should not be rigid and allow  them  to

build the latrine outside the house. If built inside,  the

smell  is not only there at meal times but also when  they

sleep.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the plan designers have drawn up

such plans in their own air-conditioned offices or whether

they have really seen life in the rural areas. We can  ask

them:  what  is the reason for insisting that the  latrine

should be built within the four walls of the house?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, let me, first of all, answer the

query on the rigidity of the Building Control Division  in

approving applications for change of use of buildings. The

records  of  the Building Control Division  show  that  in

1974. 465 or 55% of applications for change of use, out of

a  total  of  848, were granted. In 1975, 698  or  62%  of

applications, out of a total of 1,119, were  approved.  In

other  words,  the flexibility that the  Member  for  Bras

Basah is asking for is liberally granted, as far as change

of use is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all Members here will appreciate the important

need  for  the  control of a change of use. Otherwise  all

kinds  of  nonresidential use will creep into  residential

areas,  thereby adversely affecting the amenities  of  the

residents. We are- equally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



aware  that it is totally unrealistic to completely  brush

aside  applications for nonresidential uses, many of which

may provide useful services to the community such as those

illustrated  by  the Member for Jalan  Kayu  and  strongly

supported by the Member for Whampoa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the small type of community service is

concerned, such as bringing home a few dresses to  sew,  I

do  not  see  any involvement in a change of  use  of  the

premises. It is only in a situation where, say, in a floor

of  a  residential estate you have seven or  eight  sewing

machines and five on six seamstresses employed on a  daily

basis, then the question of a change of use arises.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sort of situation I regret to say that

flexibility  cannot be exercised. But in those  situations

which  the  Member  has  mentioned,  I  am  definite  that

consideration will be given. Let me assure the Member  for

Bras Basah that if any of his constituents is aggrieved by

the  decision  of a competent authority like the  Building

Control Division, he can appeal to the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> We will give it very sympathetic

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Let me repeat that we

will  give  very sympathetic consideration to cases  where

rejection  has been based on small technicalities, as  he

has implied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to the question of why we have allowed the

second  floor of a building to be used as premises for  an

association and not the third floor. As I am familiar with

the  position  of the URA in his particular  constituency,

let  me assure him that there is coordination between  the

URA and the BCD. For example, when there is a deadline for

a  particular  resident  to be  moved  out,  extension  is

liberally given if there is strong justification. In fact.

I  am  very familiar with this matter because the  letters

would  first come to the URA. They then go to the BCD  and

on BCD's advice, or vice versa, extension is given in most

cases. If the second floor of a building is allowed to  be

used by an association, I am with him that there is no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



justification   to  turn  down  an  application   if   the

association  prefers to occupy the third floor.  But  more

often than not I think the reason is that if we allow  the

premises  to  be  used by an association, it  involves  a

change  of  use and, therefore, the application is  turned

down:  it being a residential area. But if the Member  can

give me the particulars of the case, I would be very happy

to look into it,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the Member for Punggol. He has mentioned

about  the aroma filling the dining room. My Minister  has

asked  me  to reply to him. It is very unfair to  put  the

toilet  outside and expect one's neighbour to  inhale  the

aroma.  Let  me say that the building plan  given  to  the

rural  constituents is meant, in the  first  place,  as  a

guideline. One must bear in mind that the plot of land  is

under TOL. I am with the Member that if, for example,  the

plot  of land is of an indefinite size then, in fact,  the

Building  Control Division may allow a person  to  put  up

more  than one building. But the plot is on TOL and it  is

of  a  certain standard size. The recommendation is for  a

particular  type  of house, a building with  three  rooms,

plus  kitchen and toilet. It is planned to fit  into  that

particular TOL plot so that there is a reasonable boundary

with one's neighbour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happen to know this matter quite well because I have

received complaints from one or two rural constituents.  I

am in sympathy with their view that it is unfair to expect

them  to employ an architect to change a particular  plan,

because  if  they  get  an architect  who  knows  all  the

regulations  on boundary requirements and  so  on  and  so

forth,  he can draw up a plan entirely different from  the

guide   plan   from  the  Division.  If   any   particular

constituent  in a rural constituency has a  plot  of  land

which is of a certain size and there is justification  for

constructing more than one building or an extension to the

building,  as I have indicated, I would be happy  to  look

into it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Senior

Minister  of  State  for  National  Development  has  been

misinformed. I wish to make a correction. With  regard  to

permission for a temporary building on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



agricultural  land, there is one  house  or  a  temporary

building on every two acres or nearly a hectare of land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to impress upon him is that that part

of  Punggol  has been designated a pig farming  industrial

area.  As I have mentioned, the pig farmers from Chua  Chu

Kang  and Serangoon Gardens have already been given  small

plots  of  land. On the question of architecture,  I  have

some knowledge about building structures and I believe the

Senior  Minister  of  State  knows  well  that  using  the

official  plan  is much simpler because it can  be  simply

bought  from  the Planning Department. No architect  would

say,  "All  right, I will draw up a building  plan  for  a

three-room house, one hall, a kitchen, a toilet, etc.", if

it is going to be a temporary structure. The fees would be

prohibitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question that it is unfair to have the toilet

facilities  erected  outside  the  house,  it  should   be

remembered that there will be a proliferation of pig farms

over all the designated areas in Punggol. I have mentioned

just  now that more than 20 persons have come to  see  me.

Each of them has been given a small piece of land of about

one  or  two acres, or maybe three acres, all on Temporary

Occupation  Licence. All I am asking is  this.  They  have

appealed to me to solve the problem which they are facing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will bring up other problems under other amendments

when  the time comes. But if the Senior Minister of  State

would  like  to  visit Punggol. I would  be  too  glad  to

organise for him a tour of the pig farms as well as to see

the  buildings  which are being put up.  The  farmers  are

complaining about the buildings and said that they  should

be allowed to alter them so that the eaves of the roof can

protrude  a  little  bit. It is not an extension,  because

extension implies extending the floor area, This is by way

of shade. It can probably be called that way. They wish to

keep  off  the rain because of the nature of the  building

plan.  The plan requires the eaves of the roof to be three

feet  and  no  more.  When they appeal for  permission  to

extend the eaves, it was not approved. They had to keep to

the plan. The same thing applies to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



toilet.  I think I am standing on home ground when  I  say

that  these  are  their problems. It is a  request.  I  am

appealing. I am not criticising. There is something  wrong

with  the  building plan. It is a genuine grouse. Moreover

there  is  going  to  be a new pig farming  industry,  and

perhaps  by  the  end  of 1977 the  entire  population  of

Singapore may have to depend on Punggol for pork.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while I stand

corrected for the misinformation that was given to me, my

colleague  here, the Minister of State for  Communications

understands that the Master Plan (Rural Zone)  allows  one

temporary  dwelling house on a plot of land  of  not  less

than  one  acre,  This  is  merely  to  retain  the  rural

character  of  the  area concerned. But I  understand  the

point  raised.  It  is a reasonable request,  if  you  are

talking of the extension of the eaves. If the request does

not affect the boundary and its regulations then there  is

no reason why we should not consider it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In that case I must thank the Senior

Minister  of  State  for having been  enlightened  by  his

colleague, the Minister of State for Communications. I  do

not  want to quibble over the question of the Master  Plan

and  the  number of housing units on an acre  of  land.  I

would  just like to say that I am grateful for  his  reply

with regard to the protrusion for the eaves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he has still not given a reply on the matter of

sitting  the  toilet facilities outside  the  building.  I

think  the  Minister for National Development  is  getting

excited and wishes to speak. I will give way to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the building plan from

the  Building  Control Division has been  drawn  up  by  a

professional architect. I do not think there  is  anything

wrong  with  the eaves protruding three feet out.  If  the

Member  were  to think seriously, allowing  the  eaves  to

protrude  eight feet out from a house which  is  about  10

feet  high, the eaves would reach the floor! No  doubt  it

will  prevent  the rain from coming in, but it  will  also

prevent the light from coming in, So the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



plan  is  drawn  up proportionally and is  architecturally

correct.  I  think it fills all the needs.  If  the  eaves

should  protrude  eight feet out without any  support,  it

also  constitutes a danger to the occupants. I think there

is  a  very good reason why an extension to eight feet  is

not allowed. Farmers are farmers, they are not architects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards whether the toilet facilities should be

placed  outside or inside the house, I do not know whether

it  is fair to place your toilet nearer to one's neighbour

or to oneself. If everyone wants to have his toilet nearer

to  his neighbour and not next to his own kitchen, then we

will be back to square one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not disputing that

the  architect is night on is wrong. My question  is:  can

consideration  be  given to their  request,  to  site  the

toilet outside? And the Minister of State has said that he

is  prepared  to consider it, but the Minister  now  says.

"No".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding roof eaves, I will go a step further. I am by

nature  optimistic. If the eaves protrude eight feet  out,

it  does  not mean that they will come straight  down:  It

depends on the angle, on elevation as we call it.  It can

be supported from the ceiling not from the ground.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It must be a funny-looking house.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The farmers want it that way. It is the

farmers who are staying in the house. It is not I who will

live  there.  That is the difference. Let us  not  quibble

about it. The farmers themselves have asked for it. If the

roof is slanted at, say 160 degrees or 90 degrees, that is

an  entirely  different matter. But this is a question  of

the eaves protruding eight feet, which can easily be done.

There  is no problem. I think the Senior Minister of State

for  Communications can give a better explanation why  the

eaves  can  protrude  to eight feet without  touching  the

ground.  We  can  even  protrude it to  1.5  feet  without

support from the ground.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am reminded of the

crooked man who lived in a crooked house, all in a crooked

way. If we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



going  to permit that kind of a building here, then  there

is  no  point in setting up the Building Control Division,

Neither  should we have architects. A building is  put  up

not  only  for the purposes of dwelling but also  for  its

aesthetic effect. The landscape should not be marred by  a

crooked house, a leaning house or a leaning Tower of Pisa.

That is why we have the Building Control Division.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, the house is to be occupied by a

crooked  mind who thinks in a crooked way and walks  in  a

crooked manner, runs in a crooked style and also talks  in

a  crooked way. I am talking in a straightforward  manner.

It  is  a  question of the farmers asking me to appeal  on

their  behalf. They are farmers from another constituency.

They  are not from my constituency. A good number  of  the

farmers  in my constituency have already gone to  live  in

Housing  Board flats. I have already put this case forward

when I spoke on the amendment to cut the Minister's salary

by $10.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am appealing once again. They say. "We want the eaves

at  the front of our house extended by another 8 feet."  I

said,  "For what?" They said, "Just let us have another  8

feet to keep us away from the rain."



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I have just now

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on the fall in prices of

chickens  and eggs. The Primary Production Department  has

contributed  much  to  the promotion  of  agriculture  and

animal  husbandry. In view of our limited land  area, its

contribution  is even more meritorious. Very  soon,  there

will  be  many  people moving into the Punggol  area.  Our

agricultural sector is able to provide poultry,  pork  and

fish for almost the whole population of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a phenomenon that the production of

eggs  is  in  excess  of demand. So a situation  has  been

created where the farmers engaged in poultry keeping  have

suffered some losses, In my constituency, there are also a

number  of farmers who keep poultry. They complain  to  me

that  based  on  the  retail price of eggs  they  are  now

getting 5 cents per egg less than before. In view of this,

they  feel  that the heavy production of eggs is  glutting

the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to pay attention to this. I

would request him to take some practical measures to  help

promote the sale of eggs and find markets for such eggs so

that  the  poultry farmers need not incur  an  unnecessary

loss. I mean, he should try to get markets abroad so  that

the  eggs  could  fetch a better price, thus  helping  the

poultry farmers to live better and to be able to carry  on

with poultry keeping.

the Member for Sembawang, in speaking on the Primary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



Production  Department, has  taken  good  care   of   our

agricultural sector, But judging from the situation of the

farmers and fishermen, I feel you will agree with me - you

are  also  an MP for a rural area - that these people  are

like  second  class  citizens, being  faced  with  certain

difficult  and pitiful situation. You will agree  with  me

when  I say that they are subjected to hardships when they

are  forced  to resettle, not just once but, even  a  few

times  thereafter.  We should pay much more  attention  in

giving  them better cane than we have ever done.  We  have

heard  from the Members here that we could have done  much

better,  It seems that even the request for the  extension

of the roof-eaves is not very well taken. I feel that this

sort  of  treatment  is  not  fain  to  our  farmers   and

fishermen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be a farmer or if one wants to engage in

agricultural activities, one must have a piece of land  in

which  to carry out such activities. After we have  talked

for so long, we are still at a loss as to whether anything

can  be  done for these farmers. It seems that  the  final

decision rests with the Primary Production Department.  If

the  Department  decides that one is a bona  fide  farmer,

then  perhaps one can be allotted a piece of land. If  the

Department decides that one is not a farmer, then  one  is

unable  to get any piece of land. The Department  is  also

vested  with the power to decide how big is the  piece  of

land that can be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I used to receive complaints about abnormal or

undesirable acts in regard to the allocation  of  land  by

the  Primary Production Department, such as allotting land

to so-called farmers who are actually not farmers and vice

versa. If a so-called farmer does not want the land,  then

he  can be given a flat by the HDB. There were also  cases

where people were given many times more compensation or  a

larger  piece of land than others. There were other  cases

where  genuine farmers were not allotted any land at  all.

These  are  the incidents that I have to mention.  Genuine

farmers  could  not  get land whereas pseudo-farmers  were

allotted land. This happens usually in a resettlement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



exercise  of  the farmers. There were quite  a  number  of

complaints  that  after a farmer has  moved  out,  on  the

following  day the farmhouse is demolished  and  there  is

nothing  left  as evidence to support the farmer's  claim.

There   are  no  records  to  trace.  Some  farmers   have

complained that they have suffered great losses.  If  more

notice  could be given, they would not have lost as  much.

In  certain cases, the Department would delay sending  its

officers  to assess the value of the farm and agricultural

produce.  And  when they do turn up, there would  be  very

little  agricultural produce left to be assessed. So  very

often this farmer would be adjudged not a farmer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But other farmers are smarter. They know that the

Department would send somebody over, as they got  wind  of

it  or  speculated  on  certain  information  received  in

advance.  So  they  organise their  poultry  and  pigs  in

advance  and  stock them in their farms so that  when  the

assessor  or  officer turns up, they  will  get  a  higher

assessment and be given better compensation, Here, I would

like to ask the Minister what is the criterion for judging

whether a person is a farmer on not a farmer? How is  this

judgment  exercised?  Secondly, is  the  decision  of  the

Primary  Production Department final? Is there  no  higher

authority  to  decide  thereon,  or  is  the  Department's

decision  subject  `to  any higher  authority  on  appeal?

Thirdly, what is the grade of the officer sent out by  the

Department to make on-the-spot inspections? What  division

of officers are being sent out for such purposes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on another point, what is the procedure for

appealing  against any such decision?  I  would  like  the

Minister to answer these questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I can imagine what the Member for

Jurong  is  suffering, because I have a similar experience

in  my  constituency of Potong Pasir .--, imagine an  aged

man  being  asked to leave the land he has worked  on  for

years and years. During the time that an assessment of his

activities was made, he was unfortunately hospitalised and

was  unable to work on his land. Sc) the assessment by the

PPD was "Nil".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



Immediately after he recovered of course he could not just

hang around and wait for his land to be taken over by  the

HDB for development - he had to work. That was pant of his

life. Without work, he would have died. So, he tilled  the

land  and  his vegetables started growing. But before  his

vegetables could be harvested, he was told that he had  to

move  out and that he would not be paid a single cent  for

all the vegetables he had grown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made an appeal to the Resettlement Department.

and   they  turned  it  down  saying  that  "the   Primary

Production  Department does not consider him a  bona  fide

farmer."  Once again, I appeal for a stay of execution  so

that he be allowed to harvest his vegetables and sell them

in  the market. No compensation, never mind that, so  long

as he could get something worthwhile from the sweat of his

brows, his darkened and shrinking body.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Hon. Minister will consider this appeal

of  mine  and  allow  the  farmer  at  least  to  let  his

vegetables  grow large enough for sale in the  market,  or

pay him compensation for the vegetables that he has grown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I am just wondering whether I

could be permitted to speak on resettlement of the farming

community. I have intended to raise it under my  Amendment

(9), but since so much has been said on resettlement  and

what I want to speak on, in particular, is resettlement of

the  farming  community, could I have your  indulgence  to

speak now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, Mr Hwang. You can raise it under the

proper subhead when it comes up, because the debate now is

on the Primary Production Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> The point brought up by the Member for

Jurong  relates to compensation, and the point  raised  by

the   Member   for  Potong  Pasir  is  also   related   to

resettlement of the farming community.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hwang. I would rather you raise it

later on, if you do not mind. Yes, Dr. Tan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> To answer the Member for Sembawang on

the  Primary Production Department doing something to help

poultry farmers in a situation where eggs are flooding the

market, I would say that, being familiar with poultry  and

pig  farming myself, his claim of a loss of five cents per

egg  is  highly exaggerated. If such a situation is  true,

the poultry farmer must by now be a bankrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure him that the price of eggs, like the price

of  pork, is dependent on the supply and demand. In  fact,

it  is neither the intention nor is it desirable that  the

Primary  Production Department should interfere  with  the

market   forces  by  any  form  of  direct  control.   But

indirectly the Primary Production Department does  try  to

help  the  farmers by teaching them how to bring down  the

cost   of   production,  how  to  improve  their   feeding

techniques, better   husbandry  techniques, and   even

providing an effective animal health service. In addition,

the  Department also monitors at all times the  prices  of

animal feed and feed stuffs, and the price fluctuation  of

eggs  and  pork. If there is a situation such as what  the

Member  has  mentioned, the Primary Production  Department

makes  an  indirect attempt by talking to both the  animal

stock  feed  manufacturers, the farmers and  the  relevant

associations.  In  other words, the role  of  the  Primary

Production  Department in this case is an  unofficial  and

indirect one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has made a few allegations on the

unfair decision taken by the PPD in the classification  of

what  we  call "genuine" or "bona fide" farmers.  He  even

alleged  that  there was perhaps some  wrongdoing  in  the

sense  that information had leaked out to certain  farmers

who  would then know exactly when a PPD officer  would  be

coming  to  make an assessment. Let me assure  the  Member

that if he could submit details of his information to  us,

we will definitely look into the allegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to the question as to what are the criteria

used to differentiate between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>





a  bona fide farmer or an efficient farmer, and a non-bona

fide  farmer, the Minister has indicated  just  now  some

general guidelines. We say that if a farmer could rear 100

pigs  or 3,000 head of poultry and do it reasonably  well,

then  he would be a genuine farmer. He must grant the  PPD

technical officer the ability to assess whether he  is  an

efficient  farmer  or  not.  I think  that  is  reasonable

because  if the officer is familiar with animal  husbandry

techniques, the type of housing, the type  of  management

and  the way they feed their animals, he can quite  safely

conclude  whether  that farmer is efficient  or  not.  The

general  criteria for assessment are this  figure  of  100

pigs  or 3,000 head of poultry, and also at the same  time

the management of that particular farmer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point queried was about the assessment for

compensation.  I would like to tell him that  the  Primary

Production Department has a set rate of compensation which

has been revised upwards on 1 St April, 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in no position to tell him exactly what grade of

officers  go to the farms to make assessments of a  durian

tree,  a rambutan tree, etc. However, I shall be happy  to

supply him the information any time he wants them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the unfair demolition without any

consideration  for  an extension of time,  this  could  be

answered together with the query by the Member for  Potong

Pasir who asked whether sympathetic consideration could be

given   to  allow  a  vegetable  farmer  to  harvest   his

vegetables  so  that  he  could sell  them.  Under  normal

circumstances  the answer is yes. But if  that  particular

area  is  required  urgently, for  example,  an  immediate

construction  of  roads,  then  the  Authority  is  in  no

position  to  grant an extension of time  because  of  the

urgent  need  by  the relevant competent authority.  Under

normal circumstances where there is no urgent requirement.

then in all cases a reasonable extension of time is given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the procedure for appeal, there is a

provision that if they are not happy with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



regard  to specific items of compensation, they can  write

directly to the Ministry or, if they feel strongly, to the

Minister  concerned. We have received a few  appeals  arid

these are being investigated. If the investigations reveal

that there is unfair assessment of the various items, then

there  could  be  a  decision to  upgrade  the  amount  of

compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to compensation and to whether a farmer is

bona fide or not, we have to adopt certain criteria. If we

do  not  start  off somewhere, there is no way  to  assess

whether or not a farmer is entitled to it, In all cases of

resettlement,  whether he is a bona fide  farmer  or  not,

some form of compensation is given. For example, if at the

time  of  census-taking  and even  if  he  is  an  illegal

squatter, priority as far as rental is concerned  is  also

given  to  him. Most farmers are happy in the  sense  that

they  feel that they qualify as bona fide farmers  and  so

would be entitled to alternative land for farming. I think

the main problem, as my Minister has indicated earlier, is

that  due  to  a  shortage of land we  have  to  encourage

intensive  pig farming, and in this respect we  regret  we

cannot   liberally  grant  a  non-bona  fide  farmer   the

privileges of a bona fide farmer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I do not quite agree

to   his   answer.  I  should  think  that   it   is   his

This   is  his  duty,  not  mine.  Perhaps  due  to   some

discrepancy in language interpretation, he has  not  given

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying that there were some people who had been

Consultative Committee members. When such people wanted to

co-operate  with the Government authority in  resettlement

enforcement,  they reduced their agricultural  activities.

So  when the assessor came, the produce of course would be

assessed  less,  and  such people were  adjudged  as  non-farmers.  These people have complained to me  about  this.

When  I  mentioned  this  to the Authority  concerned,  no

favourable  consideration was given. What I am  trying  to

say is that you can ask the CCC members to confirm whether

or not such people are genuine farmers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> As a layman I am very sympathetic

towards  the farmers regarding their status. While  it  is

appreciated  that the CCC or the Management Committee  can

support  a  claim,  the definition  of  a  bona  fide  and

efficient farmer, as I have indicated, is a technical one.

In  the  case that he has mentioned, if a farmer initially

keeps  3,000  head of poultry but due to  some  reason  or

other  he has reduced it to 2,000 at the time the  Primary

Production officer arrives to make an assessment, then  he

is automatically disqualified for the definition of a bona

fide  farmer. In farming language, it is unlikely  that  a

bona  fide farmer would reduce his stock of 3.000 head  of

poultry because 3.000 is considered the minimum number  to

really  break  even.  As  my Minister  indicated  sometime

earlier, that could only be a supplementary type of work.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give some simple statistics. For example, a

farmer has 3,000 head of poultry and assuming they produce

3,000  eggs. Let us also say that this farmer derives  the

whole  of his income from these 3,000 head of poultry.  At

10  cents per egg per day, he will find that his margin of

profit cannot be more than 10%. At most, assuming that  he

is  so  efficient that the 3,000 head of poultry lay 3.000

eggs,  at  any  one time he can sell them  for  $360  and.

cleverly  makes a profit of 10%, which is $36.  I  am  not

suggesting  that some of the CCC members are not  farmers.

They  are,  but they must appreciate that we must  draw  a

line   somewhere.  To  cut  short  the  argument,  I  have

indicated  that if the Member feels strongly that  he  has

got  a  case where at the time of census instead of  3.000

poultry the farmer had only 2,800 then I think flexibility

could be exercised. If, on the other hand, at the time  of

census  he  had  only  2,000, then  I  think  it  is  very

difficult for him to argue the case out. So I would appeal

to  him that if he still feels strongly about those cases.

please  write to us and we will have another investigation

made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards my point about asking CCC members to help us,

assuming that the Primary Production Department should now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



investigate  those  allegations that  these  members  have

made, there is no way of investigating because the officer

does  not know where to begin. He must have some  clue  or

information  to  start with. All that we are  asking  from

these members is that if they can give us that information

under  confidential cover, or even make  it  anonymous  if

they  feel like it, it could enable us to start somewhere.

Our  officer  cannot  lust go to a particular  area,  say,

Jurong  or, for  that  matter,  any  rural  constituency,

without  knowing how or where to begin. So please  do  not

get  me wrong when I say that we do not have the intention

to investigate. We have, but they must feed us with a clue

as to which direction we can move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have given the

Minister certain useful tips. Such incidents would  happen

to  those farmers who are affected by urgent resettlement.

They  have to collect and move a substantial part of their

farm  produce  and implements hurriedly. So the  following

day  when  the  houses  and  agricultural  implements  are

demolished there is no more evidence to support any claim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned that certain farmers due to

circumstances have reduced their production.  In  view  of

the  situation,  could the Minister be flexible  and  give

special  consideration to such cases  and  not  just  beat

about the bush about the definition of 3,000 or 2.000 head

of poultry?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng hang:</b> If the Minister's interpretation is

correct, and that is, a farmer is classified as bona  fide

by  the Primary Production Department but it now says that

he  is  not  a bona fide farmer, then I think the  Primary

Production  Department should be asked to explain.  If  my

understanding  is  correct. I think what  the  Member  for

Jurong is suggesting is that the person has all along been

a bona fide farmer according to our definition, but at the

time  of  assessment, for some reason, he was disqualified

because the number of pigs or poultry has been reduced.  I

am   saying  that  much  depends  on  what  the  range  of

difference  is. If it is within a reasonable  range,  some

flexibility could be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



exercised and I think we can look into the matter. Perhaps

to  convince  the Member for Jurong, if he feels  strongly

about it, please send the case to us and we will look into

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the

Minister of State for having given me a detailed reply.  I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Messrs Sim

Boon Woo and Ng Kah Ting



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead DEA 1111.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sim Boon Woo is not here. Mr Ng Kah

Ting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead DEA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the

lack  of  marine  life  in  the  Serangoon  River  due  to

pollution from the Ministry of the Environment.  Sir,  you

are aware that I was more or less compelled to shorten  my

question  yesterday  because I  intended  to  broaden  the

aspect  of  pollution  problems  which  resulted  in   the

fishermen in Punggol having to lead a hard life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of the Environment has another dumping

ground  in  Tampines constituency, which is situated  near

the  estuary of the Serangoon River. Every day many lorry-loads  of  trade refuse from the City are carted by  these

Environment  lorries and dumped there.  The  refuse  being

dumped there naturally pollute the waters of the Serangoon

River  because of the tides that come in and recede.  When

the tide comes in it comes up right to the banks, and when

it  recedes it washes the refuse away. As a result,  there

is less fish and prawns in that area. So the livelihood of

fishermen  who  fish in that area is threatened.  I  think

that   not  only  the  fishermen  from  Punggol  but  also

fishermen from Tampines and Jalan Kayu constituencies  are

faced with this problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem, Sir, which they face is this illegal

otter trawling. In the past I had occasion to bring to the

attention of this House to the damage done to the nets  as

well  as  the threat posed by these illegal otter trawlers

which  go  into  the  waters with long  drag-nets  without

marine  lights  and cutting off the little  fishing  lines

that  were  laid by the fishermen. Today, I still  receive

complaints  of  the  operations  of  these  illegal  otter

trawlers. I wonder whether the Minister would care to look

into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is in regard to the Fisheries Division. We

have read in the newspapers that the Division is trying to

encourage fish breeding in our waters, especially  in  the

Singapore  Straits or the kelongs. It is a  pity  to  hear

from  the  Member  for Changi that a good  number  of  the

kelongs  have to be demolished. I was under the impression

that  the Fisheries Division is actively encouraging these

kelong owners to breed fish in their kelongs. I think this

is a good move because we lack such food supplies and have

to import them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now we heard an active discussion about the glut of

eggs  resulting in the farmers losing money.  That  should

not  be so because the Government department concerned  is

indirectly trying to get a fairer price and the price also

fluctuates  according to supply and demand.  But  in  this

particular case. Sir, fish also is like a staple food,  as

we have to import no less than 80% to 90% of our needs. At

the  moment, we have two fish markets, one at  Jurong  and

the other at Kangkar which is in my constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these remarks, Sir, I wonder whether the Minister

would  care  to  elaborate  to  this  House  the  type  of

activities covered by the Fisheries Division.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I presume that the Member for

Punggol in the first part of his query is referring to the

Lorong Halus Dumping Ground of the Ministry of the

Environment, which is situated along the Serangoon River.

Yesterday the Minister for the Environment has indicated

to the Member that bunds have been built along the river

bank as a means to prevent waste from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



being  washed down into the Serangoon River. If the Member

feels  strongly regarding the pollution control procedures

or  matters, my Ministry will be happy to take it up  with

the  Ministry of the Environment. I was told that  at  the

mouth  of  the Serangoon River the fishermen are  catching

crabs.  I do not know how true this is. According  to  the

Ministry of the Environment, the pollution is not all that

bad. As I have indicated, if the Member feels strongly  he

can refer this matter to the Ministry of the Environment.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards illegal trawlers, the Primary Production

Department  has not received any complaint on this  matter

and  I  have  no information to offer. If the  Member  can

supply me information on the trawlers' activities, we  can

look into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third matter which he wishes to seek information is

the  Fisheries Division which, as he has correctly pointed

out, is playing an extremely important role in ensuring  a

sufficient  supply  of fish for Singapore.  The  Fisheries

Division  has  done  a few things in  that  direction.  Of

immediate  relevance would be the type  of  research  work

that  is  being carried out in the Division, in particular

the  freshwater laboratory called the Aqua  Culture  Unit.

This  is a relatively new field. The intention is to  rear

freshwater or aquarium fish for production, just like  the

traditional  Chinese  method of culture.  This  particular

unit is looking into the artificial breeding of udang gala

and  soon  hock, a variety of carp. The Division  is  also

looking  into  the  possibility of  cage-net  breeding  of

Chinese  carps  in  the reservoirs and  garoupa  near  and

around  the  costal waters. It is also  looking  into  the

artificial  breeding of fingerlings by culture.  They  are

all  at  different stages of research and development.  We

hope  that  something  will come  out  of  these  research

programmes.  But,  as the Member has indicated,  the  main

activities  are at the Jurong Fishing Port and  the  other

fishing  centres,  that  is, the Central  Fish  Market  at

Jurong and the Kangkar Fisheries Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a question on the Jurong Fishing Centre by the

Member for Jurong. I think I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



can  sum  up by saying that the activities of the  Central

Fish Market at Jurong have increased tremendously in terms

of encouraging trawlers to bunk at this particular fishing

centre.  It has also encouraged other indirect or  related

activities, such   as  the  provision   of   deep-freeze

facilities. It has also a fish meal factory nearby. It  is

trying  to encourage related facilities in that particular

centre  so as to enable more fishing trawlers to  call  at

Singapore.  The Member may know that we do buy  fish  from

the  Russian,  Japanese, and Taiwanese trawlers  and  also

from  Thailand. I have figures to show that over the  past

year  there  was  an increase of total  gross  tonnage  of

almost  77.636 tons over the previous year. There is  also

an  increase of unloaded fish, approximately 1 7.4%,  over

the previous year. I have more or less summarised the more

important  points  on  the  activities  of  the  Fisheries

Division.  But  if  Members are interested  to  have  more

details, I have them all here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sin. I must first

thank   the   Senior  Minister  of  State   for   National

Development  for  his  detailed  reply.  However,  he  has

mentioned that his Ministry has not received any complaint

of  illegal  trawling. If that is so, I shall send  him  a

written complaint later today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, the Minister for Law and the

Environment  mentioned  yesterday that  the  Ministry  was

building  bunds at the Tampines dumping ground. A  lot  of

damage has already been caused to marine life there. It is

only   because  someone  has  stood  up  and  said  "Look,

pollution  is affecting marine life. The fishermen  cannot

get  much of a catch, and as a result, they are faced with

a serious problem", then something is being done. But I am

taking this one step further. I say that even though bunds

are built, the rubbish is still being dumped there. If the

Senior Minister of State would care to go to the place, he

will find a lot of rubbish floating at high tide. This  is

a genuine case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to the fishermen who catch crabs in the

mangrove swamps. They have to get a long piece of wire  to

catch the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



crab  in  its hole. I am talking about the fishing problem

they  are facing. Most of them use small lines. If  I  can

use the Malay word, with your permission. Sir, the net  is

called "jaring". It is just a net with a half-inch span in

width  and about 10 metres in length, at the end of  which

is attached a small light. The net comes in with the tide.

The  net  is thrown into the water, and there are  usually

four  or  five nets. Later when the tide goes  down,  they

would  just  go round and pick up the catch  of  fish  and

prawns.  The catch is getting less now, and this is  their

complaint.  I have seen how they do it. It is  my  earnest

hope  that  since this complaint has been laid before  the

House,  the  Ministry would look into the  matter.  If  an

assurance  is  forthcoming, I am prepared to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the Member is championing the

cause of the fishermen in his constituency. As far as anti-pollution  measures are concerned. I  have  said  that  he

could  bring  the matter up directly with the Ministry  of

the   Environment.  As  far  as  the  Primary   Production

Department is concerned. I have indicated that we would be

very  happy to pursue the matter further with the Ministry

of the Environment to satisfy his request.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, it is not a question of satisfying

my  request.  It  is  a  matter of grave  concern  to  the

fishermen  because their livelihood is affected.  However,

since  the Minister of State has said that he is  prepared

to  look  into  the  matter, I beg leave  to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead AAA 3011



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a simple question to ask of the Minister. I

believe  that  free water supply at public standpipes  has

already  ceased a few years ago. How is it that last  year

there was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



such  a vote and this year there is also a vote of $20,000

for free water supply at public standpipes. I am under the

impression that nothing is for free. How is it that  today

we  still see a vote of $20,000 for the provision of  free

water  supply? I should be very grateful if  the  Minister

would care to reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the provision under this subhead

is  to meet expenditure, as the Member has indicated, for

the   supply  of  free  water  at  the  remaining   public

standpipes and outdoor taps in the rural areas. Our policy

as  mentioned  by  him still stands. There  are  only  two

standpipes  today at Jalan Betek, off Lim  Chu  Kang, and

five  outdoor  taps at Rifle Range Road  which  cannot  be

dismantled for the time being as they are for use  by  the

residents in that area who have no other source  of  water

supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an indication of how our policy has been

implemented, the   number   of   standpipes   has   been

progressively reduced from 2,471 in 1966 to two  in  1976.

As and when alternative water supply is available in these

particular  areas,  the  remaining  standpipes   will   be

removed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The answer given is satisfactory. I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by $10

in respect of item (a) of subhead AAA .3020*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Yeo Choo Kok, Hwang Soo Jin, Ho See Beng and J.F. Conceicao.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had reason to complain once before, outside this

Chamber, of shoddy and poorly finished work by contractors

which were accepted as "completed work" by the Housing and

Development Board. I do appreciate the tremendous pressure

on  the Housing and Development Board to deliver more  and

more  flats  to  meet  the  increasing  demand  for  them.

Notwithstanding this pressure, the Housing and Development

Board should be more vigilant in ensuring that it will not

accept from contractors any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



flat  that  is  poorly finished. After  all, tenders  are

called   for  the  construction  of  flats  suitable   for

occupation and are paid for as such. Proper supervision of

construction  and  inspection before acceptance  from  the

contractors  will  not appreciably increase  the  cost  of

flats.  Proper finish of the floors, walls and  hinges  of

doors,  windows,  etc, is not going to delay  construction

that  long either. In any case, poorly finished flats have

to be redone before occupation, and that takes time too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had also previously talked about workers and

contractors  lacking work ethic, lacking  pride  in  their

craftsmanship, etc, which accounted for this  sorry  state

of affairs. What I ask is that the Housing and Development

Board   should  be  a  little  more  vigilant   in   their

supervision of contractors.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area where the HDB can help the new flat owners

is  to  be  a  little  more careful in  the  selection  of

authorised  contractors for renovation work in HDB  flats.

Some  of these authorised contractors farm out their  work

to   numerous  unauthorised  sub-contractors   who   cheat

innocent  flat  owners  by  shoddy  workmanship   or   not

completing the work in time after having received  payment

or  refusing to hand over the keys until their demand  for

additional payment is met. Whenever such reports are  made

to the Housing and Development Board, the Board should not

brush  them  off saying that it was a private  arrangement

between  the contractor and the flat owner. Investigations

should  be  made and recalcitrant contractors  should  be

barred from tendering, and blacklisted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area of comment is that the Housing Board

lets  out parking lots to residents on a six-month  basis.

Recently, when the Government decided to increase road tax

for  cars  in  order  to  reduce  the  car  population  in

Singapore,  a  car  owner  decided  to  conform  with  the

Government policy and deregistered his car and so took  it

off  the  road. Yet, when he approached the Housing  Board

for  a  proportionate refund of the unused parking charges

of four months, his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



request  was  turned  down. Here is a  car-owner  who  has

deregistered his car in accordance with Government  policy

and  yet  his  money was not refunded. If  a  cash  refund

cannot  be  made, the amount of refund could at  least  be

used to set off his monthly payment to HDB for conservancy

charges, etc. The Government is setting a good example  in

this  respect  by  making  a refund  of  unused  road  tax

payments  if the cars are deregistered, and the  road  tax

surcharge was also adjusted downwards in respect  of  cars

above seven years old after representations had been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third complaint is in respect of land set aside in

housing estates for community centres. I am told that  the

Ministry  of Finance takes a long time to approve  payment

for  the land to the Housing and Development Board. I will

have  more  to say about this when we come to  debate  the

provisions  for the Ministry of Finance. In the  meantime,

let  me  say that plans for construction of the  community

centres  could not be submitted to the Planning Department

because the Housing and Development Board, as land  owner.

refuses to endorse such plans. This causes a deadlock  and

a  long  delay, and  the entire  project  will  be  at  a

standstill  because  of  the Housing  Board's  refusal  to

endorse.  If the land set aside for a community centre  is

accepted  by the People's Association as a suitable  site,

then I do not see any difficulty for the Housing Board  to

endorse  such  a plan. Surely the HDB is not worried  that

the Ministry of Finance would not pay for the land. In any

case,  even if there is a dispute between the Ministry  of

Finance  and the Housing Board in respect of payment, the

HDB  can  always stop its construction. In any case.  Sir,

the HDB gets money from the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, as housing

developers,  there is no disputing the fact that  the  HDB

has  lived  up to its name so much so that today  half  of

Singapore's population are housed in HDB accommodations, a

fact that has been referred to by a number of Hon. Members

in  the House today. It may sound a little farfetched, but

someone did remark to me



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



recently that half of Singapore is in effect, ruled by the

HDB.  Although  this  was  made  more  in  jest  than   in

seriousness, it does lead me to think that there ought  to

be  a  serious review of the role and the function of  the

HDB. Whilst the development aspect of the Board's function

will remain important for some time to come, equal if  not

greater emphasis should now be placed on the provision  of

better maintenance services. Over the years we have  heard

of  numerous grouses against the unilateral actions  taken

by  the Board's administration. Many of these grouses, if

not  all,  are to my mind well justified, suggesting  that

the  Board  is  either not giving sufficient attention  or

simply   not  equipped  organisationally  to  provide   an

acceptable  standard  of maintenance  services.  Residents

generally   are   agreed   that   considering   the    not

inconsiderable monthly maintenance and conservancy charges

paid  by  them, the services provided ought to be  better.

This  has  also  led  to doubts as to  whether  the  basis

adopted  in the costing of all such charges is, in  fact,

equitable and realistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a firm believer in statistics which it is often

said  can be used to prove anything depending on your  own

standpoint.  It is nevertheless interesting to  note  that

according to a sample household survey conducted  in  1968

to  find  out  residents' reaction  to  change  in  living

conditions  since their relocation into HDB  flats.  75.2%

interviewed at that time considered that from the point of

cleanliness  of  neighbourhood, the change'  was  for  the

better. However, by 1973 a similar survey conducted by the

HDB  revealed that the percentage has dropped by 26 points

to  49.2%  and from the point of cleanliness of  building,

only  49.3%  agreed that the change was  for  the  better.

There is no comparative figure for 1 968 in regard to  the

latter  item.  The figures quoted by me are  contained  in

pages  356  and  357  of  the  HDB  sponsored  publication

entitled  Public  Housing  in  Singapore.  Admittedly  the

position may have changed somewhat over the last two years

but  is  it for the better? I leave Members to draw  their

own conclusion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some years now the HDB has been invariably chaired

by  a private individual working on a part-time basis, but

for the time being the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry

is the acting Chairman. I do hope that this will become  a

permanent  feature  as  by having direct  control  of  the

activities  of the `Board by a senior Government  officer.

there will be numerous advantages. First, there is greater

awareness  and  appreciation  of  the  thinking   of   the

political  leadership. Secondly, being a senior Government

officer,  he can more easily coordinate the activities  of

the Board with those of the other Government departments - from overall planning down to day-to-day administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater coordination will go a long way towards ensuring

unnecessary    wastage,    delays    and,    above    all.

comprehensiveness  in  services.  The  apparent  lack   of

comprehensiveness  in  planning  resulting  from  lack  of

proper  coordination  has  given  rise  to  a  number   of

anomalies and shortcomings. Take, for example, Toa  Payoh,

a  town  of not less than a quarter million people.  There

was  not  a  police  station in sight when  it  was  first

completed.  In  no  time  it was to  acquire  the  dubious

reputation  of  being  the Chicago of  Singapore.  Another

example  is to be found in the location of the Jalan  Kayu

Post  Office at the newly completed HDB estate. This  post

office  is  tucked  away in such an odd and  inconspicuous

corner  some  distance away from the market  and  shopping

centre.   The  explanation  given  to  me  was  that   the

requirement  of  the  post  office  was  not  taken   into

consideration at the planning stage. By the time the  post

office  asked  for a suitable site, all shop premises  had

been  taken up. In planning the estate, it is also obvious

to me that no attention was paid to the unavoidable impact

on  the  traffic situation in the neighbourhood  resulting

from  overnight expansion in population. This  has  caused

serious congestion and increasing number of road accidents

at  the  traffic  junction close by. Had a little  thought

been  given to this aspect during the planning  stage,  it

would  have been possible to widen a small stretch of  one

side  only  of Yio Chu Kang Road bordering the HDB  estate

without too great a cost if carried



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



out  when  the  construction of the estate  was  still  in

progress. As things stand at this very moment, I have been

told  that the situation can only be remedied in 1977 when

the PWD proposes to widen the entire Yio Chu Kang Road. In

the  meantime, the junction remains a serious  hazard  to

road users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the planning of a housing estate, one would have

expected the Board to take into account the needs  of  all

Government  departments.  Many  will  obviously  like   to

decentralise their services by setting up offices or  sub-offices in newly established population centres so  as  to

provide  on-the-spot service and in the  process  help  to

alleviate the serious problem of traffic congestion in the

Central Business District, where most of them are situated

at  present.  The  present attitude of  the  Board  would,

however, appear to be that if I can let out all the  shops

to  the private sector at good rentals, let me do so first

and  think of the Government departments later. This  over

pre-occupation  with  money-making  to   the   extent   of

overlooking the need to provide essential services on-the-spot  is  surely  not  right. I am  shocked  to  find  out

recently  that the going rate for renting a  shop  in  Toa

Payoh  Central, is $10 per sq, ft. I think the Member  for

Sembawang was exaggerating when he said that it was $40. I

think  $10 is already bad enough. This must be the highest

rate  anywhere in Singapore. Well, I can understand it  is

all  a question of supply and demand, as the Hon. Minister

explained  earlier, which determines the level of  rentals

and the Board obviously takes the view that if people want

to  pay  more  and in the process kill themselves, it  is

their  own  business, let them. But I do  wonder  to  what

extent has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



this  sort  of high overhead in rents affected  the  price

levels  of goods and services and ultimately the  cost  of

living  of  the residents, the majority of whom  are  wage

earners and belong to the lower income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, I think there is need and I submit an urgent

need  for  the  Board  to  be put under  more  direct  and

stringent control of Government and whoever is running the

show  should be made aware and constantly reminded of  the

wider  implications which their work entails and  that  is

they are involved not just with bricks and mortar but with

homes  that people live in who expect the environment  and

the quality of life to go on improving.
