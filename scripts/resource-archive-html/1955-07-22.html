<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE COLONY ORDER IN COUNCIL, 1955</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(INTERPRETATION)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Message from the Governor)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members, I have a message from

His Excellency the Governor. It is dated the 22nd of July, 1955. This is the message:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand that certain motions are before

the   Legislative  Assembly  this  morning   which

concern   the  interpretation  of  the   Order-in-Council, 1955, and that these motions arise out of

recommendations made to me by the  Chief  Minister

for  the  appointment of four Assistant Ministers,

and  of  correspondence, thereafter, in which  the

Chief  Minister  took  up  the  question  of   the

exercise  of  my  discretionary powers  under  the

Order-in-Council. The exchange of letters has been

presented to the Assembly at this sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will recollect that on the

occasion of my Installation, only three weeks ago,

I  gave  an assurance that I intended to  give  my

wholehearted help and guidance to the  Council  of

Ministers  in the execution of their policies  and

in   the   task  of  running  the  Government   of

Singapore,  in order to bring about conditions  in

which  the next stage in the advance towards self-government   becomes   not  only   desirable   but

possible. I am sure that, so soon after my arrival

in  Singapore, it is not necessary for me to renew

these assurances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now contended that my discretionary powers

under  the  Order-in-Council, which are  expressly

excluded  by section 19 (1) (i) from consideration

by   the  Council  of  Ministers  (which  is   the

principal   instrument   of   policy   under   the

Constitution) are to be interpreted in  a  manner

which   would  amount  to  an  amendment  of   the

Constitution. When the Chief Minister asked me  to

appoint  four Assistant Ministers, I was  required

by  Section 32 of the Order-in-Council to  consult

him  and  then  to  exercise my discretion  as  to

whether or not these appointments should be  made.

While,  of course, I would at all times  give  the

greatest   weight  to  the  views  of  the   Chief

Minister,  it will be noted that the  language  of

Section  32 of the Order-in-Council puts upon  the

Governor  merely  the obligation  to  consult  the

Chief   Minister,  and  there  is   no   provision

corresponding  to  Section 19  (2)  requiring  the

Governor to act in accordance with recommendations

made  by  the  Chief  Minister.  If  it  had  been

intended  that the Governor must act in accordance

with  the advice given, express provision to  that

effect would have been included.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position regarding my discretionary powers

under  the  Constitution is this, that, where  the

Governor is bound to accept



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>

the  advice  tendered to him, it is  provided  for

expressly,  and this can be seen by  reference  to

Section   19  (2).  The  Order-in-Council  clearly

preserves  to  the  Governor  certain  powers  and

duties,  and  these powers and  duties  cannot  be

given  up,  or  delegated,  to, the  Council   of

Ministers without a radical change in the form  of

the  Constitution. The Chief Minister now contends

that  I  should  interpret  the  exercise  of   my

discretionary  powers  in a  manner,  which  would

amount to an amendment of the Constitution. As the

Order-in-Council   is  made  by   Her   Majesty's

Government, any amendment of it must be subject to

negotiations with Her Majesty's Government. It is

not  a matter, which can be settled merely between

the Governor and the Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add that, yesterday morning, I received

a  message from the Secretary of State in which he

confirmed  my  interpretation of  the  use  of  my

discretionary  powers under the  Order-in-Council,

and  in  which  he  expressed the  hope  that  any

amendments   to   the   Constitution   now   under

consideration  could  be deferred  for  discussion

with   him   during  his  forthcoming   visit   to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel bound to place on record my regret that

the  issue of an amendment to our new Constitution

should have been raised in this way, namely on  a

relatively minor matter concerning the appointment

of  four  Assistant Ministers, and that it  should

have  been raised at a time when it may very  well

jeopardise the progress which has been made in the

last  three  and  a  half months  by  the  present

Government.  I consider that it will  be  a  great

pity if this record of progress, and the prospects

of  stable government, bringing, confidence to the

community, are lost as a result of the  issue  now

raised."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had copies prepared. They will be distributed now to hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the Governor's message distributed.

<div align="center"><b>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDER 31 (7) AND (8)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before the Hon. The Chief Minister

moves  this  motion,  I would  like  to  make  the

position clear. I allowed the motion to be tabled

under  the  provisions of Standing  Order  No.  71

because  the  publication  of  the  correspondence

between His Excellency the Governor and the  Chief

Minister,  as  the background to the  main  motion

before  the  House, and the terms  of  the  motion

itself, have made it impossible for any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



reference to the Governor to be excluded,  if  the

motion  is  to  be  debated  with  any  degree  of

thoroughness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members,  no  doubt,  are  aware  and  will

appreciate that any reference to the Governor must

be  completely impersonal, and any other  approach

will be out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very

much indebted to you. You have made my speech, and

it needs no further explanation. I move the motion

that stands in my name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the provisions of Standing Order 31 (7) and

(8)  in  so  far as they refer to the Governor  be

suspended  for  the  purposes of  all  discussions

under the next item.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in the discussion that is to follow, we have

two parties to it - His Excellency the Governor  on

the one hand, and the Chief Minister on the other.

Standing  Order No. 31(7) and (8) seeks to  remove

the  protection from one party, whereas the  other

party  is still covered by paragraphs (6) and  (9)

of the same Standing Order. It would only be fair,

Sir, if the above paragraphs of the Standing Order

are also suspended so as to accord equal treatment

to both parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore wish to move an amendment that the

following  words  be  inserted  after   the   word

"Governor":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and the provisions of Standing Order 31 (6) and (9)",



<br><br>so that the whole motion before us would read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the provisions of Standing Order 31 (7) and

(8)  in  so far as they refer to the Governor  and

the provisions of Standing Order 31 (6) and (9) be

suspended  for  the  purposes of  all  discussions

under the next item.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have that in writing, please?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You are making it under Standing Order No. 71?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, I must have the expression of the general assent of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is inadmissible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the provisions of Standing Order 31 (7) and

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

move the motion standing in my name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Speaker do convey to His Excellency the

Governor the view of this House that the people of

Singapore are determined to end colonialism and to

rule     themselves    through    their    elected

representatives;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that as a demonstration of the good faith of

Her   Majesty's  Government  in  its  oft-repeated

promise  to  the people of Malaya that they  would

grant  self-government  at the  earliest  possible

moment,  the  most  liberal  construction  legally

permissible    in    favour   of    the    elected

representatives    of   the    people    in    the

interpretation  of the Singapore Colony  Order  in

Council, 1955, should be adopted;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that where the Governor is required by the

provisions of the said Order in Council to consult

with  the Chief Minister before taking any action,

he should act in accordance with such advice;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that the Speaker do report back to this

House on the reply he receives from His Excellency

the  Governor to this message, and that thereafter

this  Assembly  do  take such  action  on  motions

without notice as the circumstances may require.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I quote part of the message

which  Her  Majesty the Queen graciously  sent  to

this House at its very first sitting:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am glad at the opening of the first session of

the    Legislative   Assembly   under   the    New

Constitution of Singapore to express to my  people

in   Singapore  my  great  satisfaction   at   the

significant   advance   in  their   constitutional

progress  which  is marked by this  occasion.  The

Council  of Ministers will now have to  deal  with

the  many problems of Government and upon  them

will  fall the chief burden of responsibility  for

the   continued  advancement  and  prosperity   of

Singapore and for the welfare and safety  of  its

citizens."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, Mr Speaker, Sir, are almost the very first

words that this Assembly heard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... I intend to give my wholehearted help and

guidance  to  the  Council of  Ministers  in  the

execution  of their policies and in the  task  of

running the Government of Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the words, Sir, the first words which

Singapore heard from our Governor on the  occasion

of  his  installation. "Significant constitutional

progress";     "whole-hearted    help";     brave,

reverberating   words - words  full   of   wonderful

promise,  and I fell for each of them, hook,  line

and sinker. I believed every word, and today, Sir,

I   find  that  this  "significant  constitutional

progress"  infused  by  this "whole-hearted  help"

gives  us  not even power in so minor  a  domestic

matter   as   the   appointment  of  Parliamentary

Secretaries, that we call Assistant Ministers. And

the  basic  reason - the vital reason - given  by  His

Excellency  at  an  informal  meeting   with   the

appointed Ministers for refusing the power lay  in

the following words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was never the intention of Her Majesty's

Government  that this constitution should  provide

for  rapid  self-government. It  was  intended  to

provide for slow progress."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow progress! This, then, Sir, is the spirit of

the  Rendel Constitution - the scraggy hand of death

clutching at the brakes of progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say to the gentlemen opposite that

the tempestuous honeymoon between this side of the

House and theirs is over - the broken crockery,  the

black  eyes, the tumultuous recriminations.  Today

we  face a common foe. The claws of the beast show

through the velvet glove.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not come here today as Chief Minister, as

head  of the Government. I have withdrawn the Whip

from my side of the House. I have made it clear to

every Member that he will and must speak according

to  his own conscience, and vote according to  his

own  lights. I come here today - and I hope you come

here   today - as  Malayans,  and  I  speak,  as   a

representative  of the Malayans of  Cairnhill,  to

you,  the representatives of the Malayans  of  the

rest  of  the  territory - Singapore.  This  is  the

common danger - do we accept the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



position that this constitution is not to provide

- repeat not - for rapid self-government? Maybe  what

has  happened  in the past fortnight  should  have

been  no  shock  to me. There have been  incidents

from  the  word "Go" which should have warned  me,

and I can tell you of the few that I may tell. The

rest  that  transpired in the  Council  Chamber  I

cannot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the very day I was appointed Chief Minister, I

asked  for  my office and discovered  that  I  had

neither  office  nor staff nor  even  a  piece  of

notepaper. I was told I was Minister for Commerce,

and  Chief  Minister merely meant that I  was  the

leader  of the appointed Ministers. I was  further

told  I  had  no right of co-ordination  over  the

other  ministries. That would have been  the  end,

right  away. Fortunately, common sense  prevailed.

My representations were accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then - it may seem to you a minor matter, but it is

in  the  same  pattern -  I  discovered  at  public

functions that a host of dignitaries, including my

friend the Chief Secretary, were supposed to  take

precedence  over  me.  The Governor  said  I  must

accept this position. He (the Chief Secretary) was

my  senior. To my own very acute embarrassment,  I

had  to  act  like a bad-tempered prima  donna  in

order that there should be proper respect for  the

people  of this territory in the person  of  their

chief elected representative. That question is not

even now completely solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the Emergency Regulations, and it was

graciously  conceded that we were  in  an  awkward

position,  having promised to repeal them,  if  we

now  thought that they might be necessary for  the

welfare of the people. And as you have read in the

correspondence, it was officially  suggested  that

we  should  blithely come to this Chamber,  repeal

those Emergency Regulations, gain the credit  from

our  electors, and then the Governor would  impose

them  under  his special powers. That was  perhaps

the  biggest shock I have ever suffered - that there

should   be   such  contempt  for   the   people's

representatives; that it should be assumed that we

would act in so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



filthy  and dishonest a fashion; cheating  you  on

this  side of the House, cheating the public, only

to  gain  dishonest kudos and  to  evade  our  own

responsibility to our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made it quite clear that if the Governor ever

used  his  special powers against our advice,  the

Ministers  would resign en bloc. And now  we  have

what  His  Excellency calls "the relatively  minor

matter of the appointment of Assistant Ministers".

Now, please, let us get this straight. We are  not

considering   the  merits  or  demerits   of   the

appointment of junior Ministers. That will come on

Tuesday on a motion to be moved by the Member  for

Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was startled this morning to learn from the

Straits  Times that I am a very astute politician,

and   it   seems  that  I  am  indulging  in   the

Machiavellian manoeuvre of enticing  you  to  vote

for   this  motion  in  order  to  prejudice  your

attitude  on  the  motion that  is  coming  up  on

Tuesday.   I   repeat,  this  motion   is   on   a

constitutional issue, entirely independent of  the

merits  or  demerits of the appointment of  junior

Ministers, and no person who votes for or  against

this motion is in any way bound, or prejudiced  in

any attitude he may seek to adopt on Tuesday next.

Let this be quite clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a letter here. It merely

confirms several conversations. My letter  of  the

20th of July:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Excellency,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you for your letter of yesterday's date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to make it clear that it is no

longer  a question of the appointment of Assistant

Ministers - I am prepared to reconsider my advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue as I see it is whether you are to

exercise  your  discretionary  powers  under   the

constitution  in  accordance with  the  advice  of

those  whom  you have to consult before exercising

such  powers,  or whether you are free  to  reject

such advice at your will and pleasure."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, gentlemen, is this: that if we are

to  have  the  responsibility, we  must  have  the

power. We are not, and will never be, prepared  to

be  nothing  but gold-plated shock  absorbers  for

colonial rule. We have accepted office in complete

faith - that this constitution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



was  intended to bridge the present period to  the

period   of  full  self-government  and   ultimate

independence.  We  have,  I  think,   demonstrated

sufficiently, despite the short period, our  sense

of  responsibility,  believing  that  we  had  the

power. It must be obvious that if we have not  the

power, then we can never achieve that standard  of

responsibility,  that  agonising  heart-searching,

that   comes  of  having  to  act  on  one's   own

decisions.  If  we are nothing but  advisers,  you

cannot  expect of us the responsibility of rulers.

That  responsibility  is expected,  and  has  been

demonstrated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when we contested the elections,

nobody  was  good  enough to  tell  us  that  this

constitution  was never intended by Her  Majesty's

Government for rapid self-government. In fact, you

know,   and  I  know,  we  were  led  to   believe

completely the contrary. For myself, I believed it

utterly,  completely. Without any reservations,  I

believed. I had studied the constitution.  I  have

repeatedly said - and I said it again as a warning

at  the  installation - that  this  constitution  is

inadequate, but it is workable. If infused with  a

spirit of goodwill, it is workable and can  be  an

instrument for bridging the present to the  period

of self-government and independence. I remember at

the  very  first  sitting of this Assembly  saying

these words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it comes ill from us to question the

good  faith of a nation that seeks to give us  its

hand   to   help  us  to  our  feet.  The  present

constitution is an earnest of that good  faith.  I

have faith in the English."



<br><br>That was exactly three months ago. I meant it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me say this: if the spirit of generous

goodwill  is  to  be  absent,  if  the  spirit  of

negation  is  to  direct  the  working   of   this

constitution,  I shall no longer  have  faith.  If

this constitution were, to me, a sham and a cul-de-sac,  not  a bridge, then, as the P.A.P. have  so

repeatedly  maintained,  it  would  have   to   be

destroyed - not worked. I am not a destroyer.  I  do

not  know  how to. But when the time comes - and  it

seems  near - that  this  is proved  so,  then,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  you will see me no  more  in  this

House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technical aspects of the issue immediately

before  us can best be gathered by looking at  the

message from His Excellency, and pointing out  the

flaws.  May  I  refer  you,  gentlemen,  to   that

paragraph which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the Chief Minister asked me to appoint

four  Assistant  Ministers,  I  was  required   by

Section  32  of  the Order-in-Council  to  consult

him..."



<br><br>That is correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and then to exercise my discretion as to

whether or not these appointments should be made."



<br><br>That  is not correct, and I will prove it to  you.

Section 32:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Governor after consultation with the Chief Minister may from among the elected

Members   in   the   Assembly  appoint   Assistant

Ministers to assist Ministers in the discharge  of

their duties and functions."



<br><br>And it is said the word is "may". Gentlemen, if  I

say  to  my clerk: "If the Little Sisters  of  the

Poor come for a donation, you may give them $100."

Do  I  give him the discretion - to give or  not  to

give, to give $50 or $10? I give him an authority.

That section 32 is an authority to the Governor to

appoint - it is not a discretion to the Governor.  I

had  hoped that the Hon. the Attorney-General (Mr

E.  J. Davies) would take part in this debate, but

I  understand he will not, so I shall leave  those

books, and I will refer to just three, if you will

permit  me, Sir, as a curiosity, if you  like,  to

prove  to  you that the word "may" in the  English

language in that context means "shall" and "must".



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Chief Minister. I just

want  to  find  out whether you  are  making  this

Assembly the forum for the interpretation  of  the

Order in Council. If you are, then you are out  of

order;  but if you are asking the Assembly for  an

opinion, of course you are entitled to.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May it please you, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I am indicating to the  Assembly - I

hope  with  your permission - my own  view  and  the

basis on which that view was arrived at, and I  am

seeking   from   them,  through  my   motion,   an

expression  of their own views. Now,  I  know  how

much  ancient legal authority is respected. I have

not had much time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



to  go back for it, but I have got one here - l683 - I

hope that is old enough, and it says this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord Keeper giving a judgment in the case of

Alderman Backwell in Vernon's Chancery Reports  at

page 152:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Keeper declared that though the words

in  the Act of Parliament were that the Chancellor

may grant a commission of bankrupt, yet that 'may'

was,  in  effect,  'must',  and  it  had  been  so

resolved by all judges."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not been able to go back to that case of

Henry I. But here is another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McDougal and Patterson, 1851. It is reported in

the Law Journal, 1852, Court of Common Pleas. This

is the judgment of the Chief Justice:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The statute which saith that the Chancellor may

grant is as if it had been shall grant or ought to

grant,  but  he  cannot grant  ex-officio  but  on

request of persons interested."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is explained,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"which we think support the rule that when a

statute confers an authority to do a judicial  act

in  a  certain case, it is imperative on those  so

authorised to exercise the authority when the case

arises, and its exercise is duly applied for by  a

party interested and having the right to make  the

application.  For these reasons,  we  are  of  the

opinion that the word 'may' is not used to give  a

discretion but to confer a power."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more. The case of the King versus Mitchell,

1913:  I  King's Bench at page 561; the head  note

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The phrases 'thereupon the Court of Summary

Jurisdiction  may  deal  with  the  case  in   all

respects  as if the accused were charged  with  an

indictable  offence'  and  'the  offence  may   be

prosecuted  on indictment', the word 'may'  is  an

enabling word empowering the Court to give  effect

to the right of the accused."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of cases. If the Governor is

supposed to have a discretion, which is alleged on

his  behalf,  there are 17 times in the  Order  in

Council  of  79 sections which say: "The  Governor

may in his discretion". Why could they not put  in

for  the  18th time "may in his discretion"  after

"consultation  with the Chief  Minister"?  Let  me

show you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15: "The powers conferred upon the

Governor by sections 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of this

Order shall be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



exercised  by  him acting in his  discretion."  If

they had wanted "in his discretion" in section 32,

could  they not have added "and 32"? That  is  one

instance. You may be sure there are more. I am not

going to read all the seventeen, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 45, Mr Speaker, Sir, says: "The Governor

acting  in  his  discretion may appoint  Nominated

Members." That is interesting, because although he

acts  "in his discretion", nevertheless it is  only

proper, as in fact you are aware of in this  case,

the  Governor  did consult the Chief Minister  and

did,  in part, accept his view. He did not  accept

my  view completely, but he had the right, because

"acting    in    his    discretion",    he     was

constitutionally in the right to reject completely

my  opinion, or to accept it in part  as  he  did,

because  the  phrase  is  there - "acting   in   his

discretion",   he  shall  appoint  the   Nominated

Members.  He consulted me, as he was entitled  to,

and  as  he should have. In section 32, it is  not

"acting  in his discretion", he shall appoint.  It

is  "he  may,  after consultation with  the  Chief

Minister".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you just one more, and this is

particularly interesting - section 60 (4)  and  (5).

Section  60  is "Introduction of Bills",  and  you

cannot  introduce certain Bills  except  with  the

Governor's permission. I read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Except with the recommendation or consent of

the Governor signified thereto, the Assembly shall

not  proceed upon any Bill or motion which, in the

opinion  of  the  Speaker or the Attorney-General,

relates  to or affects any of the matters set  out

in the Third Schedule to this Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers conferred upon the Governor by

subsections (3) and (4) of this section  shall  be

exercised by him acting in his discretion."



<br><br>So  that whatever the Attorney-General may say, or

whatever the Speaker may say, the Governor has the

right, after consulting them, to say, "I act in my

discretion."  That  is not what  was  intended  by

section 32 and all the other sections. It  is  not

only  section  32. The principle is  so  important

that  I  would  not  care if I did  not  have  any

Assistant Ministers for the rest of my term,  such

as remains of it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there we nave the question of discretion.

Think   of  it  again - "The  Governor  may,   after

consultation, appoint". Quite obviously, these are

enabling  powers, because otherwise  the  Governor

has   no   power  to  appoint.  And   from   that,

gentlemen - I hope I am not boring you,  but  it  is

important to this House - we come to Jennings on the

Constitution  of  Ceylon, Sir Ivor  Jennings,  the

great constitutional lawyer, at page 99:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other Ministers are appointed by the

Governor on the advice of the Prime Minister."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never mind about Ceylon, but just look at the

principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the Prime Minister has to establish and

maintain a majority, he must have a large  element

of  discretion, and indeed the last word,  in  the

formation of his government; but the King, and  to

a  smaller degree the Governor-General,  from  his

impartial position, is able to advise and to warn.

The  Governor-General's approval should  therefore

not   be  regarded  as  a  formality.  The   Prime

Minister's responsibility is a heavy one.  He  has

to  satisfy  so  many competing  claims  with  the

knowledge  that  he  may make  more  enemies  than

friends.  The  Governor-General may  not  be  very

familiar  with the politics of this  country,  and

will  not be able to advise with the authority  of

the King ..." etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come next, gentlemen, to the immediately

succeeding paragraph in the Governor's message:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While, of course, I would at all times give the

greatest   weight  to  the  views  of  the   Chief

Minister,  it will be noted that the  language  of

Section  32 of the Order-in-Council puts upon  the

Governor  merely  the obligation  to  consult  the

Chief Minister."



<br><br>I have already shown you why not. Further:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... and there is no provision corresponding to

Section 19 (2) requiring the Governor to  act  in

accordance  with  recommendations  made  by   the

Chief Minister. If it had been intended that  the

Governor  must act in accordance with the  advice

given,  express  provision to that  effect  would

have been included."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the opposite is quite true too, that if the

Governor  had been intended to be able to  act  in

his  discretion, express provision would have been

provided, as it had been provided 17 other  times,

and  as it could have been provided in section 15.

But let us see why in section 19 (2) there is that

express



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



provision.  Now  it is a matter of  constitutional

law and constitutional practice that where you are

required  to  consult  someone,  you  act  on  his

advice,   and  that  being  so,  it  was   thought

important  not to leave it at that but to  make  a

very vital provision for an exception. That is why

section  19  (2)  is there, because  if  you  read

section  19  (2)  it  does not  merely  say,  "The

Governor  shall act in accordance with the  advice

of  the Council of Ministers", but it has provided

that  "if in any case in which he shall be obliged

to   consult  with  the  Council  concerning   the

exercise  of any power the Governor shall consider

it  expedient  in the interests of  public  faith,

public order or good government that he should not

act  in accordance with the advice of the Council,

then  he  may act against that advice, but  shall,

without delay, report the matter to a Secretary of

State  with the reasons for his action." The whole

thing  there - subsection  (2)  of  section  19 -  is

around  that exception to the duty of the Governor

to  act in accordance with constitutional practice

to  accept  the advice of his Council. It  is  not

introducing a principle of interpretation; it is a

principle  of constitutional law that requires  no

introduction.  But  it  is  for  introducing  that

proviso  that you have that immediately  preceding

paragraph.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have this in the Governor's message:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chief Minister now contends that I should

interpret the exercise of my discretionary  powers

in  a manner which would amount to an amendment of

the Constitution."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now an amendment to a written constitution, as I

understand it, is a written amendment. What I seek

here  is  no  amendment at all. It  is  merely  an

acceptance    of    the   normal    constitutional

interpretation. It is an acceptance of a spirit of

generous  interpretation in favour of the people's

elected representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Excellency ends up on the point that he

regrets  that a constitutional issue  should  have

been raised on a minor matter. Gentlemen, I accept

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



position that, whether I have additional Assistant

Ministers  or no, it is not vital; but  it  is,  I

sincerely believe, conducive to the welfare of the

people.  And  I  repeat: if he would  concede  the

principle,   I  am  prepared  to  reconsider   the

question of Assistant Ministers. It is not a minor

matter - the   constitutional   issue - but   if   the

appointment  of Assistant Ministers is  so  minor,

then  there  is  all  the  more  reason  why   His

Excellency  should not interfere in  the  domestic

conduct  of his Ministers. Let me add this:  I  am

very  happy it is a minor matter. It is, in  fact,

one  on  which there are many gentlemen, not  only

those  opposite me but in the country - many  honest

people - who disagree with me - the question whether I

should have the Assistant Ministers named for  the

posts  indicated. Consequently  there  can  be  no

emotional  content aroused about my being  refused

because  of the immediate issue, and I would  much

prefer  that that should be so, rather  than  that

the issue should be raised on a far more important

matter  which  would arouse the  emotions  of  the

country,  already  exacerbated by  frustration  so

near to the surface as has been recently proved. I

would rather take the position of disadvantage and

fight the principle on a minor matter. But it is a

major  principle  which may probably  have  tragic

consequences  if it is sought to  raise  it  on  a

matter that would emotionally affect the people of

this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have taken the liberty of strewing this

desk with legal authorities, seeking to prove that

His Excellency was ill-advised in taking the stand

that  there  is  any necessity for  amendment;  in

taking  the  stand  that,  in  fact,  he   has   a

constitutional  discretion. But I should  like  to

take  it now on the far broader basis - on the human

basis  of  the people of this territory.  We  have

waited  for this moment. We have believed in  this

constitution.  Never  mind  about  the   gentlemen

opposite.   We  have  believed  in  it,  sincerely

believed  in  it, and we have wanted to  work  it,

straining every nerve in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



body to make an honest job of it. I have said that

to apply a restrictive, unimaginative construction

to  this  constitution on the basis  that  it  was

never  intended  that we should have  rapid  self-government is to destroy all faith and to  destroy

all possibility of peaceful progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for that reason, Sir that I am appealing to

this  House that I have taken the liberty to  call

this House, on a matter of urgency, to debate  not

the  legal technicalities, but the spirit in which

we  are  in  future to proceed. I am  asking  this

House  to  appeal to the Governor to redirect  his

steps, whatever may have been the intention of the

framers  of the constitution and of Her  Majesty's

Government at the time the constitution was given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be recognised that today it is

imperative that the dynamically evolving political

life  of  this country should be recognised,  that

our  abilities for responsibility and power should

be  recognised, and that this constitution and any

other constitution to follow should be interpreted

in  the broadest and most generous sense possible,

in favour of the people's elected representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this spirit that I have come before you,

Sir,  and  taken  the  liberty  of  calling  other

Members  away  from their jobs  to  come  here  to

consider the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of the motion says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Speaker do convey to His Excellency

the  Governor  the  view of this  House  that  the

people   of  Singapore  are  determined   to   end

colonialism  and to rule themselves through  their

elected representatives."



<br><br>Sir, I do not need to debate that any more than I

need to debate the fact that the blood in my veins

is red, or to fear a single dissenting voice in

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the motion says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that as a demonstration of the good faith"-



<br><br>because it is now a question of good faith, not a

question of constitution. I took the constitution,

believing in the good faith that infused it, and

knowing how it could be worked. But it is not

being worked.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that as a demonstration of the good faith

of  Her  Majesty's Government in its  oft-repeated

promise  to  the people of Malaya that they  would

grant  self-government  at the  earliest  possible

moment,  the  most  liberal  construction  legally

permissible    in    favour   of    the    elected

representatives    of   the    people    in    the

interpretation  of the Singapore Colony  Order  in

Council. 1955, should be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next one, Sir, follows from it; but since we

are expected to dot our  i's and cross our t's,  I

have  put  it  in.  It may be  tautologous  to  a

lawyer,  because the next really  flows  from  the

first  one.  If the provisions of the constitution

are to be construed in a manner most liberally  in

favour  of  the  people's elected representatives,

then  the  next one, that where the Chief Minister

is  to  be consulted the power should be exercised

in accordance with such advice, naturally follows.

But  let  us get this straight, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

There  are  many sections in which His  Excellency

has to consult the Chief Minister. You may say  it

is dangerous, but he has always this expedient: "I

dismiss  him." Short and simple. If you  put  that

safeguard - and  it  is there - if  that  attitude  of

interpretation is adopted, then there  will  be  a

far  greater sense of responsibility in  rejecting

advice,  just as there must be a greater sense  of

responsibility in offering advice, because on  the

advice  offered, the Chief Minister must act;  and

on rejecting the advice offered, the Governor must

seek  to form a new government. It is only at that

height and accepting the fact that power goes with

responsibility,   and   that   both   power    and

responsibility - in their real character - should  be

vested  in the people of this country that we  can

evolve in any fashion towards self-rule: not  just

driving Daimlers with liveried chauffeurs and flags

and  palatial houses; mansions to be built for the

Chief Minister to entertain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said at the beginning that today I am

not  here  as  head  of the Government  arguing  a

political  case. I come as a Malayan  speaking  to

fellow  Malayans. I have sought,  on  a  non-party

basis, to obtain the approval of this motion  from

one   who  could  be  termed  the  leader  of  the

Opposition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



A de jure leader of the Opposition, there is none.

But  one  gentleman  opposite has  plagued  me  so

consistently  and so vociferously in the  past - and

he  is an able man - that he is virtually the leader

of  the  Opposition in the eyes of the  public.  I

refer  to  the Member for Tanjong Pagar  (Mr  Lee

Kuan  Yew).  I have said to him that I would  like

him  to  rise,  in  the  name  of  the  people  he

represents  and - with respect to the others - as  the

de  facto leader of the Opposition, to second this

motion. I do hope, Sir, he will see his way to  do

so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I rise to second this motion. Like the Chief

Minister,  I  find it difficult  to  imagine  that

anyone  could  disagree  with  the  terms  of  the

motion.  No one can doubt that the people of  this

country  are determined to be rid of the  Colonial

Civil Service, agents of a European power, serving

the  interests  of  a European people  some  8,000

miles away. Only a Malayan - an Asian born and  bred

in  this country, all his life at the wrong end of

the  colonial stick - can feel the intensity of  the

antipathy to foreign control, or the intensity  of

that passionate desire to assert control over  his

own destiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy today to join my friends on the other

side  of the House on this motion. It does not  go

as  far  as  my  Party would wish it  to.  It  is,

nevertheless, a great step forward. I am  grateful

for  the kind remarks the Chief Minister has  made

today, but, in supporting this motion, I shall not

dwell  on the legal aspects of the matter,  for  I

believe that the solution is a political and not a

legal  one. At the same time I would like  to  say

that  I  am  glad he has split the two  issues - the

junior  Ministers, and this question of principle.

I   would  find  myself  in  a  very  embarrassing

position  if I had in any way to associate  myself

with  the  question  of the  appointment,  not  in

principle,  but  the appointment in  practice,  of

four  Assistant  Ministers, of  the  four  persons

named to the four Ministries concerned, in a House

of 25 elected representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meeting is a most solemn occasion - perhaps

more solemn than has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



been reflected in the fighting speech that we have

just  heard, for the constitutional principles  at

stake  are  very  grave. This is a  constitutional

crisis in every sense of the word, but it is  one

which  was accidental. We all have our own guesses

as  to  how it began. We, and indeed the whole  of

Singapore, know the pre-Rendel politicians - Mr Mak

Pak  Shee  before he became Member for Geylang - Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am most decorous in these matters - Mr  Lee  Choon Eng before Queenstown  was  carved

out;  and Mr M. P. D. Nair in those days when  he

represented  the Naval Base in Seletar.  They  are

the  few  remnants in this House  of  that  phoney

political -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to point out to the Member for Tanjong Pagar

that  I  was  not a Member of the old  Legislative

Council.  Neither have I had any connections  with

that Council, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must

apologise  if I had not made myself clear  to  the

Member for Queens-town, but they are a few of the

remnants   of   that  old  crowd   of   pre-Rendel

politicians,  of  whom  I believe  the  now  semi-retired  Progressive Party leader  was  a  shining

light.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrespective of how this crisis began, we

are faced with a constitutional issue of dangerous

magnitude  within  four months  of  the  elections

under the new constitution. If this crisis is  not

resolved,   I   can   see  only   three   possible

developments:  the  first, a  new  coalition;  the

second,  a  suspension  of the  constitution;  the

third, fresh elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new coalition, with the Progressive Party

leader,  the Member for Serangoon (Mr  Lim  Choon

Mong),  as the Chief Minister; or will it  be  the

Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy)?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Thank you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I find it difficult to

imagine a more ludicrous situation outside Alice's

Wonderland,  but with none of the charm  of  Lewis

Carroll's delightful fantasy!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish the

P.A.P.  Secretary  would avoid  personalities  and

suggest himself as the Chief Minister!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would not

do  that. I went to the people on April 2nd  on  a

completely different programme. I told  them  what

the  Chief  Minister was reluctantly compelled  to

tell   them   today - that  this   constitution   is

inadequate.  But  whatever  the  permutations  and

combinations  of  Progressives, Independents,  and

deserters  from  other ranks, no  coalition  could

give this constitution any chance, if it ever  had

any, of working.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second alternative is to suspend the

constitution.  I  know two groups  of  people  who

would  cheer with joy at this. One group we  would

find  in  the Tanglin Club, the company directors,

and  even stockbrokers like Mr Charles David Cox.

These  are  the  solid,  industrious  citizens  of

European  countries who are congenitally incapable

of understanding why the Asians would want to stop

them  from  making profits for their shareholders,

since,   in  their  opinion,  profits  for   their

shareholders  mean prosperity for Singapore.  They

believe  that  if  only you  could  shut  up  this

dangerous  talk  about freedom and Socialism  from

well-meaning  but silly Labour Front  politicians,

and  from very dangerous P.A.P. politicians,  then

peace  and prosperity of the colonial period would

prevail.    [Interruption.]   How    astonishingly

accurate one can be!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> But they would perhaps be less

happy  than the Malayan Communist Party. A changed

international situation, and, even more important,

a  changed  internal  Malayan situation  with  the

government  in  partly representative  hands,  has

brought  about a change of tactics. A peace  offer

was made, and was spurned, in my opinion unwisely.

What  better  proof  could they  ask  for  than  a

suspension  of  the constitution - to  convince  the

people that the only way to be rid of the colonial

masters  of  this  country is by force  and  armed

violence?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaya is not British Guiana. In British

Guiana,  perhaps, one could get away with it.  But

in  Malaya, in Asia, I say to Mr Sutherland  that

the  choice lies between a Communist Malaya,  with

all  that  that  implies, and an independent  non-Communist   Malaya,  passionately  determined   to

preserve  and produce wealth for its own citizens;

not  prepared to accept any direction  or  control

from  outside, but willing to trade and deal  with

their former masters on equal and friendly terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third alternative would be fresh elections.

There  are three possible consequences if we  have

fresh elections. The Progressive Party might  win,

and  the  constitution will  work!  The  elections

might produce exactly the same result, and we  are

back  to  where  we  started - in  a  constitutional

deadlock, with the Labour Front-U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.

Alliance in roughly the same proportions  as  they

find  themselves today, blocked by  an  unresolved

constitutional  issue.  Or  there  could   be   an

election  with this constitutional  issue  as  the

only plank in the election platform of all Parties

who  vote for this motion. Then you would  have  a

new  constitutional crisis, with round-table talks

before this Assembly is even convened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first possibility, a Progressive victory, is

the  one that would suit Britain best. This was  a

constitution  tailored  by  the  British  and  the

Progressives  for the Progressives.  It  was  only

this  lot of timorous people who would have  found

this constitution ample for their timid programme.

Sir,  they  may have fond hopes that  perhaps  the

country  has forgotten what they really represent,

and  that  perhaps they could go back and befuddle

the  people into voting for them. Sir, I hold  the

contrary  view.  The  sudden retirement  of  their

Party  heavyweights after their election  defeats;

the  assumption  of  office  in  their  Party   of

youthful lightweights, whose only redeeming virtue

is  their  youthfulness; their  pathetic,  pitiful

lack of self-respect and self-esteem, crawling  to

their former colonial masters every time the world

looks unkind; a general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



strike, and off they crawl and creep to see the

Acting Chief Secretary; four junior Ministers, and

off they send a cable to the Secretary of State

for the Colonies, and they want me to go with them

and see the Governor - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, these have earned them

the contempt of even their former friends. Let

me tell them that if they -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Is this strictly

relevant to the issue before the House? If the

Member for Tanjong Pagar can persuade me that it

is, he can carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

stated in my opening remarks that I consider  this

a  most  important  debate, because  what  we  are

facing  is not a legal interpretation of a section

of the Order in Council, but the whole question of

whether  the  framework, the set-up, is  going  to

crash  and  collapse to the ground. To  illustrate

why in my opinion it would crash to the ground,  I

am   pursuing  to  its  logical  conclusions   the

possible developments out of this situation. I  am

pointing   out   now  that  a  Progressive   Party

Government,  after  a fresh general  election,  to

work  the constitution, which could only have been

worked by them, is not possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other alternative which might come out of a

fresh  election is for us to go back and fight  on

the  same  old issues, and we shall come  back  in

roughly  the same proportions. The Chief  Minister

would  then be in the unhappy position, after  all

the  heat, the sound and fury of the hustings,  of

being  back to where he started. Sir,  in  such  a

situation,  we  go  back again  to  either  a  new

coalition  or a suspension of the constitution - two

alternatives on which I have already dwelt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other possible outcome of a fresh

election,  and  one which those who  support  this

motion  will have seriously to consider, if  there

is  no solution to this constitutional dispute, is

for those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



Parties and individuals who support this motion to

go  back  to the country and fight on this  issue,

and  this  issue alone. When 25 people  have  been

returned  with  a  mandate to  negotiate  on  this

issue,  we  shall  then have a new  constitutional

position,   and   we   shall  face   the   British

Government,  not  in Singapore but  in  Whitehall,

with  a solid phalanx of representatives who  have

been directed to do a specific task.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That is self-government now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, it could be that if the

People's Action Party were allowed to convince the

Chief   Minister - self-government  now!   But   the

People's Action Party would even fight with him on

this  issue,  "He  must take the Chief  Minister's

advice - now!"  We would fight  an  election  with

him.  But such a situation, within four months  of

the  constitution,  is unnecessary.  It  would  be

unfortunate  because, much as the Chief  Secretary

(Mr  Goode)  would like to believe that  I  am  a

wicked and evil person, who would have no more joy

than to wreck this whole constitution, I would say

this:  if  the Chief Minister feels he could  work

this  constitution, if it is worked in the  spirit

in  which  he  thinks it ought to be,  then  every

opportunity should be given to allow him  to  work

it.  Speaking for myself, I do not for one  moment

believe  that the People's Action Party could  sit

in  conference  with His Excellency the  Governor,

govern  within the framework of this constitution,

and  do  the  things we want to do.  But  that  is

another matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us today, it is important to realise that

the issues are grave, and it is important that  we

should  make this clear to the people of Singapore

and  to  Her  Majesty's  Government.  I  find   it

difficult  to believe that if they are  acquainted

with  the facts, that if they understand the grave

implications of a breakdown over such a relatively

minor   issue,   they  will  be   unyielding   and

unrelenting.  There  are times  and  places  where

rattling  the  sabre would work,  but  Malaya  and

Singapore  in 1955 are neither the place  nor  the

time for that. No nation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



can more skilfully and gracefully withdraw from  a

difficult  and  embarrassing  situation  than  the

British.  They have more skill and more experience

than my friend opposite, the Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, it is not impossible, if there is

reasonableness  and  common-sense,   to   find   a

solution  which  could be honourably  accepted  by

both   Her  Majesty's  Government  and  the  Chief

Minister and his colleagues. We, Sir, have  always

said that this constitution was inadequate. I said

once,  in  an election forum broadcast,  that  the

task  of the People's Action Party in the Assembly

would  be  to  expose,  expose,  and  expose,  the

hollowness  and hypocrisy of it all.  But  I  must

confess that not even in my wildest dreams could I

have  envisaged  such a delightfully  embarrassing

position for my friends on the other side  of  the

House.  Three months ago the Chief Minister  stood

before  us  there, and, in his most solemn  court-room  manner,  glared at us so  intently  that  we

nearly  trembled, and as he, in  a  most  dramatic

gesture, took off his heavy spectacles, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have come here as one Government - elected

Ministers,    nominated    Ministers,     official

Ministers.",



<br><br>I   had  my  doubts  and  my  misgivings  on  that

occasion.  I  tried to point out  the  differences

between  them - that they were the Queen's men,  the

three  of  them, and perhaps another, the Minister

for  Communications and Works (Mr Thomas). I  was

generous - partly  the Queen's man  and  partly  the

Chief Minister's man.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Not that, Sir!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Be that as it may, I would not

wish  to  be  unfair on this solemn occasion.  But

could we not have avoided all this if we had  gone

in,  not  so much in an exuberance of good  faith,

but  with  cold, calculating logic? If the  Labour

Front felt that, limited as the constitution  was,

it  could be worked for their programme, for their

aims and

objects,  then let us find a way out to make  this

experiment succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that occasion the Chief Minister

reminded   us  that  the  Government  honoured   a

principle   known   as   "collective   Ministerial

responsibility". On that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



occasion  he  went out of his way, personally,  to

undertake  an  odious  duty  on  behalf   of   his

colleague - his  then colleague - the Hon. the  Chief

Secretary,  of justifying the continuance  of  the

Emergency Regulations. He was a brave and,  in  my

opinion,  a sincere man. He took upon himself  the

full  burden of his office in the full  spirit  of

sincerity,  to  which  only  he  could  give  such

intensity  of expression. I could not express,  as

he  has  done  on  so  many  occasions,  how  much

confidence  he had - one, in the constitution;  two,

in  the  good faith of the people who would  watch

over the constitution, the British Government and

the  British officials with whom he has  to  work.

They  must feel it is a matter of regret  that  he

should,  at this hour, ask for a demonstration  of

their good faith. I support that motion because  I

feel   he  is  justified,  if  not  on  the  legal

interpretation,  then on the  political  principle

involved, in asking for good faith, and in  giving

an  interpretation to this Order in Council  which

could help it work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a little disappointed earlier at this

sitting when the Chief Minister said that  he  had

taken off the Whip. I would have liked to see  his

Official  Ministers,  having dissented  from  him,

come  here and speak and vote for him, as he  said

once  upon  a  time they would do.  Sir,  I  never

believed it. Maybe it is because I have so  little

faith  in  colonial administrations.  If  we  were

wicked and evil men, we would incite and instigate

the  Chief Minister and the Colonial Secretary,  I

beg  his  pardon, the Chief Secretary, the Officer

Administering  the  Government  now  turned  Chief

Secretary, to smash this constitution and  suspend

it,  and  let the issue be a straight one, between

Communism  and Colonialism. Very few  people  have

doubts  as  to what the result of such  a  contest

would be, though not many would be bold enough  to

express   it   publicly.  I  hope  that   such   a

catastrophe will never come to pass. I hope that a

reasonable  and sensible solution will  be  worked

out  between the British Government and the  Chief

Minister  and  his colleagues. If they  fail,  the

consequences  to this country will please  no  one

who has the welfare of this country at heart.

something.  The honeymoon is over - but there  is  a

new  marriage  between the Labour  Front  and  the

P.A.P. - I wonder how long that will last.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As long as colonialism lasts!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I do not really mind

interruptions,  Mr Speaker, Sir. Sir,  the  first

part of the motion before the House reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Speaker do convey to His Excellency

the  Governor  the  view of this  House  that  the

people   of  Singapore  are  determined   to   end

colonialism  and to rule themselves through  their

elected representatives."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not moving an amendment, Sir, but in my

view - the  Chief Minister hoped that we  would  all

agree  with this motion - it is redundant. You would

be  conveying to His Excellency the Governor  what

he already knows full well. But the phrase "people

of   Singapore",  I  think,  requires   a   little

clarification.  What the Chief Minister  means,  I

think,  is  a  section of the  locally  born  non-European  population of Singapore.  The  rest  are

probably, in his view, stooges - I think that is the

word used - but I am glad to see that he has not yet

got round to calling them "running-dogs".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 39 of the Rendel Report reads as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the principle of Nominated Members is

accepted,  we consider that the widest measure  of

discretion  should  be left  to  the  Governor  in

exercising this power of nomination, in order that

he  may  be  free to appoint Members qualified  to

voice or defend whatever interests he may consider

in   danger   of  being  overlooked,   and   whose

appointment  would, in his view, be  to  the  best

interests of the Colony at the time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not pretend that the cap fits me

perfectly, and although I hold no mandate from any

person  or  group, I think I might  claim,  on  an

occasion like this, to speak for my own people - the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



expatriate  British of this Colony.  And  we  are,

after  all,  a section of the people. All  Parties

claim  to  speak  for  the people.  There  is  the

People's Action Party people; there are the Labour

Front   followers.  My  people  may  not  all   be

workers - they work too hard for that - but  no  doubt

the  Chief Minister will in due course make  quite

clear what he means by "the people".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of its new and sinister connotations, it

would  be  nice if that odious word "colonialism",

and  also  the  two words preceding it,  could  be

excised  from  the motion. It would not  make  any

difference to the motion. I am still not moving an

amendment,  Sir. Colonialism - that wicked,  corrupt

system  which  is at the root of all  our  evils.

Yet,  I believe that there are thousands of Asians

in this island who have had very little, and still

have  little, to complain of under colonial  rule,

and  I  do not believe that, as the Chief Minister

once stated that Professor Silcock was supposed to

have  said, they have been unbelievably  corrupted

thereby.  I  would suggest to the  Chief  Minister

that  it would have greatly benefited himself  and

his Party if he had concentrated on selling to the

public  the idea of self-government by proving  by

deeds that his Government is efficient, instead of

periodically  adding fuel to  the  fire  of  anti-colonialism.  The Coalition Government  cannot,  I

think,   point  with  any  great  pride   to   its

achievements  in  its  three  months  of   office,

although   admittedly  they  were  very  difficult

months.  The dynamism of the Chief Minister  calls

forth the admiration of all of us; but many of his

Ministers  are  men without any great  experience,

and  the  public in Singapore are quite  genuinely

perturbed about the idea of appointing some of his

Labour  Back-benchers to the  posts  of  Assistant

Ministers.  Ask  whom  you  will,  Sir,  in   this

beautiful  island - the  Chief  Minister  is  always

reminding  us that our island is beautiful;  well,

it  is  not without charm, but it is nothing  very

wonderful; in fact, much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



of its beauty is man-made, including the taming of

the jungle by colonial pioneers -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Without the coolies?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Labourers!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Ask whom you will, Sir - be they

Chinese,    Eurasians,    Malays,    Indians    or

British - whether they think conditions in Singapore

at  present under the Coalition Government are  as

good  as they were under colonial rule even a  few

months  ago; and in many cases the reply would  be

in  the  negative,  varying  only  in  degrees  of

emphasis!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may be sure, Sir, that a crisis such as

this,  while  providing something of a  theatrical

spectacle  and ephemeral fame for our orators,  is

doing  Singapore and its trade, which is the life-blood of the place, no good at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like to make it clear that

I  am  not standing up here to say that I  do  not

want  this country to get self-government. My  own

Scottish ancestors fought the English for hundreds

of  years  and only gave up, of course,  when,  by

successful  infiltration they realised that  union

was definitely to their advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have many Asian friends in this city - at least

I think I have - and I personally do not wish to see

the  colonial regime retained any longer  than  is

necessary.  But  I must remind the Chief  Minister

and  the Member for Tanjong Pagar that one has  to

learn to crawl before one can walk.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We do not crawl.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I cannot see how this issue,

where the Governor acts according to his views  on

the  Order  in  Council,  should  lead  the  Chief

Minister  to believe that Her Majesty's Government

are deliberately protracting the granting of self-government to this country. Sir, I have  carefully

perused  the correspondence exchanged between  His

Excellency  the  Governor and the Chief  Minister,

and when I read it at home - it was delivered to  my

house at 7 o'clock in the evening - it certainly did

all  sound  to  me  like a  storm  in  a  tea-cup.

Unfortunately, as this sitting of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



Assembly bears witness, it is very far from  that.

But,  without fear of being called a sycophant,  I

agree with His Excellency's interpretation of  the

Order  in  Council;  and  incidentally  the  Chief

Minister's  forensic erudition in  the  matter  of

"may"  and  "must", I am afraid, leaves  me  quite

cold.  I cannot really believe that the word "may"

in  section 32 means "shall". Anyway,  Sir,  I  am

saying,  without fear of being called a sycophant,

I  agree  with His Excellency's interpretation  of

the  Order in Council. If I did not believe it,  I

would say so with the plainness of plainness,  but

I sincerely believe it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second part of the motion, in my

opinion,   no  demonstration  of  good  faith   is

necessary.  Self-government  will  come,  but  not

overnight.  Can  anyone  deny  that  there  is  in

Singapore  at  the  present moment  an  uneasiness

amongst all the business communities and a lack of

confidence  which did not exist before?  I  assure

you,  Sir, it is true. Some people may doubt  our

bona fides, but we, the British, who are perhaps a

little  sad at the passing of the colonial regime,

which seemed to us, no doubt mistakenly, to  be  a

just   and   fair   system,  soon   became   quite

enthusiastic  about  the idea  of  self-government

within   the   Commonwealth.   The   change    was

inevitable, but also desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister himself has said that he is

convinced  the English are conscious of the  evils

of colonial rule. Well, it seems a pity to me that

he  is  beginning to doubt the good faith  of  Her

Majesty's Government, just because he does not see

eye   to   eye   with   the   Governor   over   an

interpretation  of  the  Order  in   Council.   In

Whitehall  they have a great deal of  wisdom  and

experience,  as even the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

has  granted,  and I believe they are  anxious  to

grant   these   territories  self-government   and

independence. But, in my opinion, the flogging  of

the anti-colonial horse by the Chief Minister, and

"Malayanisation or bust", whatever that  may  mean

by  the People's Action Party - a curious expression

to come from a lawyer! - these things do nothing but

retard the process.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all their histrionics will convince a great

deal   of  the  people  in  Singapore  otherwise.

Besides,  all  that has been said about  colonial

rule is far from true, and some of the utterances

in the Press have been positively mendacious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has said - he said it this

morning - that the Rendel Constitution is workable,

but   is   unworkable  when  you  have   arrogant

colonialism in power and in the saddle.  Now,  to

me, the statement makes no sense at all. It seems

to   me  that  it  is  his  Government  that   is

displaying  the  arrogance.  Some  of  the  Chief

Minister's  statements have been so naive  as  to

make  even  political tyros  like  myself  laugh.

There was some reference to a football team,  and

he  discovered, quite late, that he was not  the

captain  of it. He discovered also, rather  late,

that the Rendel Constitution did not make him, in

fact, the  Prime  Minister. Well,  what  did  he

expect? There has never been any suggestion  that

the  implementation  of the  Rendel  Constitution

would  give this country self-government. At  one

time  I  thought his idea was that he  would  be

quite content with self-government in four years.

Now,  over some minor issue, everyone is storming

and  raging  for  self-government immediately.  I

really cannot understand it. After all, the Chief

Minister  must see before him every day,  on  the

letterheads, the words "Colony of Singapore".  It

is still a British Colony, you know, but a lot of

people seem to have forgotten it. I hope it never

becomes  a  colony  of  any other  power,  either

occidental or oriental. Now the Chief Minister is

trying to mould the Rendel Constitution nearer to

his heart's desire -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That is evil, I suppose?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> - and threatens resignation if

his interpretation of it is not accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust this motion before the House will be

defeated,  and  that  the  Chief  Minister   will

readjust  his  views  on  the  functions  of  His

Excellency the Governor. I hope, if he does, that

he  will  not  concern himself  with  such  minor

matters, but get on with the serious business of

governing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after

hearing the mover and seconder of the motion,  it

seems  to  convey to us that there are  only  two

people   in   Singapore  who  are  fighting   for

democracy  and self-government, for getting  rid

of  colonialism and all that. That is not so.  We

stand   for   the  same  thing.  We   stand   for

independence. [Interruption.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before this House, however, really

has  the  appearance of a champion  of  democracy

fighting for the rights of the people. The  whole

motion  would have had my support if it were  not

for the fact that it has been the offspring of -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Of the Chief Minister. So

what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - a shameful manoeuvre, and

drafted in such a way calculated to deceive all

of us -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I object to those terms, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> To the Chief Minister rising on a

point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I

take the strongest exception to the suggestion of

deceit  and  shamefulness. I ask that  you,  Sir,

request that those remarks be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members must remember their

Standing  Orders in this debate as in  any  other

debate,  and it is quite clear under the Standing

Orders  that  it  shall be out of  order  to  use

offensive  amid insulting language about  Members

of  the Assembly. No Member shall impute improper

motives  to  any  other Member and  the  personal

conduct of the Members of the Assembly shall  not

be  referred to except upon a substantive  motion

moved for that purpose. This debate must carry on

on  an impersonal basis. Any personal attack will

be  out  of  order. Will the Member for Serangoon

please withdraw those expressions?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, if it is your

opinion  that it is so, I withdraw. I will explain

that  the  action has never been intended  on  the

person, but it has been on the whole Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the wording of the motion, really, has been

drawn in a very clever manner so as to mix up what

would  be  an ideal of the people with what  would

have  been  the  aim of a Party  to  get  what  it

wanted.  I feel that the people of Singapore  have

not  been  deceived by that. I know they have  not

been hoodwinked by such an intention of that Party

to  gain more power. Indeed, today, we should have

been  standing  in this House discussing  actually

what  should not be the motion that is before  us,

but  probably  a  motion on  the  censure  of  the

Government  on what the Chief Minister has  termed

"a  very  minor matter". I put it to you, Sir, if

the matter has been very minor, why was it allowed

to develop into a constitutional crisis?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, all of us know definitely that the

business,  starting from two weeks ago until  now,

arose   from  the  appointment  or  the   proposed

appointment  of Assistant Ministers, and  that  as

the  days went by, it has been twisted and twisted

and  twisted  until  it is out of  recognition  by

anybody.  It  is  no  more  the  issue  that   was

intended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has now shifted his ground,

and  put forward an ideal to the people, an  ideal

which  the  people stand for, in order  to  cloak

what has been a failure behind the scenes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, you would ask whether this thing,

which  is called a very minor affair, should  have

developed  into  one  that  is  considered  as   a

constitutional crisis. It is very generally  known

in  Singapore that right from the very word  "go",

there had been dissension within the ranks of  the

Labour  Front  group and that  dissension  was  no

other  than  over the distribution of  portfolios,

and  that unless something was being done  by  the

Chief  Minister, there would have been threats  of

desertion from the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Just give me your point of order, Mr

Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I object to the allegations,

Sir, that I am acting in an improper fashion,  and

suspended. Disgraceful!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already ruled that no

Members shall impute improper motives to any other

the  Member  for Serangoon to be very  careful  of

what  he  says. [Interruption.] Can I have  order,

please?  After  all, the prestige and  dignity  of

this  House is in your keeping, gentlemen. Let  us

have  that  properly kept. Will  the  hon.  Member

please withdraw any imputation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I withdraw

what I have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, this matter which had been linked up

with  the  appointment of Assistant Ministers  has

been  allowed  to  develop into  a  constitutional

crisis, and the Chief Minister, in the motion, has

asked  us  to  agree  with paragraph  No.  3,  the

essence  of which being that he be allowed  to  be

the  sole interpreter of the Order in Council, and

that the Governor should take his advice. Sir, the

first  and second paragraphs of the motion receive

my  support. I am agreeable to them. The third and

the fourth parts, I do not agree with, because  if

this  were done, it would have created a new  type

of  constitution. It would have been  giving  more

powers to the Chief Minister, whoever he may be -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I like that!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let us have some order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> As it is now, as we all

know,  public  opinion  has  been  such  that  the

appointment of the four Ministers has  never  been

well  received. Yet it has been pursued.  I  would

say  that if public opinion has been consulted and

taken into account, such a crisis would never have

arisen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If more powers were to be given to that office,

it  would  mean  more dictators.  It  would  mean

either Singapore is ruled by the Governor or that

Singapore  should be ruled by the Chief Minister;

we  would  have a system whereby what one  person

says  will go. We do not agree to that set-up  of

the  new  regime, and I therefore move  that  the

third  and fourth parts of the motion be deleted.

The parts to be deleted read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that where the Governor is required by the

provisions  of  the  said  Order  in  Council  to

consult with the Chief Minister before taking any

action,  he  should act in accordance  with  such

advice;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that the Speaker do report back to this

House   on   the  reply  he  receives  from   His

motions  without notice as the circumstances  may

require."



<br><br>And substitute therefor the following:

sitting,   I  indicated  that  I  would  consider

whether the amendment proposed by the Member  for

Serangoon  (Mr  Lim Choon Mong) was  admissible.

The  point which exercised my mind was  whether

or  not  the  amendment is, in effect,  a  direct

negative of the third



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



paragraph  of  the motion. If  it  is,  then,  of

course,  the  amendment is out of order.  I  have

considered the matter purely on those  lines  and

have decided that that is not so, and I therefore

allow the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government opposite has chosen to throw this

country once more into conditions of crisis.  The

crisis  is  unnecessary and unreasonable.  It  is

unnecessary because the Chief Minister  sees  fit

to twist the issue of whether or not a Government

of  eighteen Members should be allowed as many as

fourteen Ministers into a constitutional  wrangle

as  to  whether  the Governor or the  Council  of

Ministers  has the last word in all matters.  The

two  questions  cannot  be  separated  from  each

other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Progressive stand is the same as that of

many  Members of the Opposition, the same as that

of  the majority of Press comments, and the  same

as  that  of  the  overwhelming  bulk  of  public

opinion,  namely, that it is not in the interests

of  good government to have fourteen Ministers in

a House of thirty-two, of which only eighteen are

on  the  side of the Government, particularly  as

the   intention   is  to  add   inexperience   to

inexperience, or to use this issue to work  up  a

constitutional  crisis.  The  substantive  motion

before this House today attempted to obscure this

fact,  and it is a political manoeuvre, the  type

of  which this country is getting somewhat tired,

manufactured to forestall the motion put down  by

the Opposition Parties and due for debate in this

House next week. This is the issue, and no amount

of  statements and contradictions  by  the  Chief

Minister can obscure this fact, this simple fact.

I  am  convinced  that the public  has  not  been

misled,  even if the Chief Minister has  now  the

assistance of the Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amendment now before us, because

the  substantive motion, if approved, could  lead

to   a  revolution  and  not  evolution  in   our

constitutional progress, and could encourage  the

concept  that government is to be based,  not  on

democratic    but   autocratic    methods.    The

fundamental point is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



whether  to  vote  for  or  against  the  present

constitution, or whether to vote for  or  against

colonialism - in this Chamber, a few months ago,  I

stated  that the Progressive Party had done  more

than  any other Party to send colonialism on  its

way  out - but whether to vote for or against a new

brand of rule fashioned by the Chief Minister  to

suit  himself and nobody but himself. This  is  a

very  vital matter on which each Member  of  this

House must clearly cast his vote according to his

conscience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the Progressive Party must remind the

Elected  Members of this House, and through  them

the  public at large, of one important  fact.  If

the constitutional issue is to be provoked as to

whether  the Governor or the Council of Ministers

is  to  rule,  the Chief Minister  has  no  right

whatever  to  speak on behalf of  the  people  of

Singapore,  without the backing of this  Assembly

in   his   position  of  leader  of  a   minority

Government.   In   this   Assembly,   the   Chief

Minister's group, the Labour Front as represented

by ten seats out of thirty-two, owes its majority

in the House, in the ultimate resort, to the fact

that   two  Labour  Front  men  were  chosen   as

Nominated  Members  by the Governor,  and  to  no

other  fact  whatever. I would remind  the  Chief

Minister  of  section  47 (1)  of  the  Singapore

Colony  Order  in Council, 1955, which  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every Nominated Member of the Assembly shall

hold  his  seat  therein  during  the  Governor's

pleasure."



<br><br>Constitutionally speaking, therefore, whether  he

likes it or not, the Chief Minister is head of  a

minority  Party, and retains his  position  in  a

very  real  and  double  sense  only  during  the

Governor's pleasure. In saying as he has said  in

his   letter  dated  the  12th  of  July,   1955,

addressed to His Excellency:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, as Chief Minister, responsible to the people

of  Singapore cannot take orders either from Your

Excellency or from the Colonial Office.",



<br><br>he  is arrogating to himself a position which  he

does not, in fact, hold, either according to  the

letter or the spirit of the constitution.  It  is

his  own  individual interpretation  of  what  he

wishes  to  read  into the Order in  Council,  as

Counsel for the Prosecution and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



Members of this House apparently acting as a sort

of  jury,  an act which, to my mind, is something

of a flouting of the constitution and a challenge

to  ordered  government. This House  is  not  the

place  for arguing out the interpretation of  the

constitution        on        an        emergency

motion - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> The Member for Cairnhill (Mr

Marshall)  and those on the opposite Benches  who

support  him on this issue would do well to  bear

in  mind  that he is not entitled to say that  he

speaks  for  all  the  people  of  Singapore.  He

represents  at  best fourteen  per  cent  of  the

electorate  and  less than one per  cent  of  the

entire   population.  Before  he  can  choose   a

constitutional  issue on which  to  cross  swords

with  the Governor, he must, in the first  place,

obtain  the  views  of  the  Assembly.  In   this

particular case, he did not do so, but  chose  an

issue   which   does  not  have  the   Assembly's

approval,  namely,  that of  the  appointment  of

Assistant Ministers. He created -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The Member must not

anticipate  a motion which has not as  yet  been

argued.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, he created the

crisis first, and then summoned a meeting of this

House   to   help  extricate  himself  from   his

difficulties, calling his erstwhile opponent, the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar, to his  support.  The

Member  for Tanjong Pagar saw fit to throw  scorn

on  the  Member for Serangoon in words which,  to

say  the least of it, were not in good taste;  he

has made sly and somewhat slighting references to

a  member of the Progressive Party who is not  in

this  House,  and he has chosen to  describe  the

Young  Progressives as a group whose only  virtue

is their youthfulness. Perhaps, he might remember

that the only guide the P.A.P. has ever given  to

youth  is to lead school children to strikes  and

disorders -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You will have to prove it!



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Has the public forgotten this?

Have  hon. Members forgotten this? Has the  Chief

Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



forgotten  this fact about the Party that  is  his

new-found  ally? If the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

thinks  that by seconding this motion he can  wipe

his  Party's  slate  clean, he  had  better  think

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us return to the main issue. I repeat:

this  House is not the place for arguing  out  the

interpretation of the constitution on an emergency

motion.  We  of the Progressive Party  accept  the

first two sections of the substantive motion  with

no reservations; for the reasons I have stated, we

reject  the  third and the fourth. The Progressive

Party  represents  the  views  of  38,000  of  the

electorate  as against only 42,000 represented  by

the  Labour Front Government, and we believe  that

we  represent the views of several thousands more,

when   we  state  we  condemn  this  twist  of   a

relatively  minor administrative question  into  a

headlong  constitutional challenge. We  move  this

amendment,  as  we cannot allow a Member  of  this

House  to  seek, as he has sought, by  implication

today to arrogate unto himself the right to be the

sole interpreter of our country's constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to second.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> An amendment has been proposed that

the  third and fourth parts of the motion be  left

out  and  the following words substituted  in  the

place of those parts:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House does not accept the Chief

Minister as the sole interpreter of the said Order

in Council."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall first put the first part of that

amendment, that is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the words after the word "that" in the first

line of the third paragraph of the motion proposed

to be left out, be left out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the first Question before the House, and

in  debating that Question, hon. Members will know

that they can, of course, touch on the second part

of the amendment, which is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in the place of those words, the following

words be inserted:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House does not accept the Chief

Minister as the sole interpreter of the said Order

in Council."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the words after the word "that" in the

first  line  of the third paragraph of the  motion

proposed to be left out, be left out.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should warn hon. Members that if any hon.

Member  wishes  to leave out only  part  of  those

words,  he must indicate that he wishes to  do  so

now: otherwise, if that motion fails, then no hon.

Member will be allowed to delete any of the  words

from  the third and fourth parts of the motion.  I

hope I have made myself clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir. I support the

amendment.  We  have  all read the  correspondence

between  His  Excellency and the  Chief  Minister.

There  is one point, and it is a sordid one, that

stands  out - the  now notorious case  of  the  four

Assistant Ministers -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> There is nothing notorious

about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please, Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> This is the issue We could have

disturbed  the Chief Minister, but I think  it  is

not nice of his position to -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member for Telok

Ayer please proceed?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> This is the issue which the

Chief  Minister, with great ingenuity and abortive

reasoning,  has tried to enlarge into  a  spurious

constitutional issue -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr R. Jumabhoy. Will you

please take your seat?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will read out the Standing Orders again

relative to personalities:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shall be out of order to use offensive and

insulting language about Members of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Member shall impute improper motives to any

other Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall not be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose."



<br><br>Mr  R.  Jumabhoy,  will  you  please  bear  those

Standing Orders in mind as you proceed?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for

pointing this out. I just wanted to explain  only.

If it has hurt anybody, I am sorry about it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister seems to think that it is

perfectly in order to waste the time of  the  hon.

Members by summoning them to this sitting on these

pretences to debate an issue that is purely of his

own making, and a crisis born in his own mind.  It

had  better be left there and not on the floor  of

this  House. I should like to know the reason  why

any  of  us  here  or  outside,  or,  indeed,  the

Governor   should  accept  the  Chief   Minister's

interpretation of the Order in Council. Why should

the  Chief Minister dictate to us'? Sir,  we  will

never  submit to dictation. Be benevolent:  or  in

this case, malevolent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the Chief Minister's motion. Let

us  admit that it is worded very cleverly. Let  us

realise  that, even so, it is devoid of substance.

We  who are dedicated to the cause of freedom feel

that the Chief Minister's principal resolution  is

but  to  gain cheap publicity. Is there any  doubt

that  the first aim of the colonial people  is  to

put a speedy end to colonial rule? Freedom is our

birthright.  We will fight for it, but  when  the

Chief  Minister  puts it in a motion  before  this

House, it  only gives a chance to  entertain  and

amuse  us, if that is possible. The Chief Minister

is  a lawyer, and I am told he is a good one.  Our

law  courts are open to all, and it has been  laid

down  that any question of interpretation  can  be

taken  to  the  courts. Mr Marshall read  several

statements -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. You should not refer

to the hon. Member by name.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, may I ask on a point of

information? It is the Chief Minister who spoke to

us  on  this motion. You want me to say "the  Hon.

the Chief Minister"?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Can I read out the

Standing Order:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Member shall refer by name to any other

Member."



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Refer to him as "the Hon. the

Chief Minister"? Is it all right, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I wonder how many of us

understood those statements from the legal  books.

It is a pity that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



the Hon. the Attorney-General is not going to give

to  this  House the benefit of his advice on  this

subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has accepted the Rendel

Constitution. He has been vacillating  whether  it

is  workable or not. He has reached two  different

and   opposite  conclusions.  How  can  the  Chief

Minister get down to the serious business  of  the

Government?  But he does not want to  resign.  No

honey-bee can truthfully say that it does not  like

honey. I think the Chief Minister likes his  post.

He   has  made  a  constitutional  issue  of   his

difference  of opinion with the Governor. If   we

vote against the motion, those of us who seek  re-election will be losing the chance of getting  re-elected.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> People do not want to.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I would request the gentleman

to resign and try against us



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> With pleasure.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> He has overplayed his hand and

he knows it. I want him to admit it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Press of Singapore, this past week and

yesterday,  fully exposed this stand on  the  four

Assistant  Ministers.  Our clever  but  not  smart

Chief Minister has brought this motion before  the

House today, but if the lives, honour, welfare and

the  well-being of the workers and the  people  of

Singapore  were  at stake, this motion  could  not

have been here. I consider it a joke.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic state of affairs that the country is

drifting  into  is my concern. It  should  be  his

concern,  and he should try to do away  with  this

chaotic  state  of affairs and get the  government

running  properly and peacefully for the  interest

of  the  people.  To  me and  to  all  responsible

Assemblymen  and Ministers, this is  of  paramount

interest,  lf  we had been summoned  here  on  the

issue  of  the  present state of  strikes  or  the

improvement of the workers' lot, I would have been

the  first to back him up in his efforts: but what

are we here for? The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



newspapers have made us these last few days  aware

of  it. People all over the world were told a  few

days  ago  that our Chief Minister  was  going  to

resign, if his demand for the four Ministers would

not  be  fulfilled. Then we are told that he  will

wait, possibly till the Secretary of State arrives

here. Sir, we can bear it no longer, and I hope he

will definitely resign.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> To make you -

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yet, again, we were told the

same evening that perhaps the Chief Minister  had

changed   his   mind.   Lo   and   behold!   After

consultation,  he  has deferred  his  decision  to

resign. Sir, I feel sorry that my good Friend  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar has seen  fit  to  make

fools of many of us over here. May I say, Sir,  it

is  not  oratory which runs the country'? We  have

two  orators here. I quote our Chief Minister  the

Hon. Mr Marshall as number one orator. Of course,

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Member for Tanjong Pagar -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr R. Jumabhoy, will you - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar

may  stand second. What has oratory done  to  this

country?  Nothing  but  chaos.  If  you  want  the

country   to   run  smoothly,  you  require   good

administration. Oratory is not necessary -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Good businessmen![Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Well, so far, businessmen have

been  running  it very well, Sir, the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar has made the point that this  is  an

Assembly of twenty-five Elected Members, and  that

if  we were to resign, the same people would  come

in.  But  even the P.A.P. has not made any headway

to  get them returned in a majority. Therefore, he

wants  to go on with it. I say, if he wants to  go

on  with  it,  well, he has to  work  within  this

framework.  If  you do not like the  constitution,

resign en bloc -

<br><br>What  the hon. Member has just said perhaps  would

be  quite appropriate in arguing the main  motion,

but not the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I was speaking on the

amendment,  but, at the same time, in his  earlier

speech  the  Member  for Tanjong  Pagar  had  made

references as to whether to resign, or to  remain,

and  so  on. If that is not in order, then I  will

not talk on that -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The hon. Member will

be  given  the  chance to speak  on  the  original

motion  afterwards. We are now  dealing  with  the

amendment. If he will confine his remarks  to  the

amendment,  he  can still speak  on  the  original

motion later on.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> All right, Sir; thank you very

much. I will take the chance later on, if that  is

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment on the ground that

the  Chief Minister, as the Member for Tanglin has

said, does not represent the people of the colony.

He  has given statistics, and if any Party  has  a

clear  majority in the House, then it is  possible

that  one  may accept it, but as it stands  today,

the Labour Front has only ten elected Members, and

as such, they cannot speak for the people. I would

not  say that the Governor should never accept the

Chief  Minister's advice in the way  he  wants  to

interpret it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amendment, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a great pity that Singapore has to face such

a  crisis today, as it is in my opinion absolutely

unnecessary,  and has been created  by  the  Chief

Minister because he is unable to have his way.  He

has aptly compared himself to a prima donna. Prima

donnas  are full of tantrums and impatient of  any

opposition  to  their  demands.  At  the   present

moment, after four months of government, the stock

of  Singapore is very low. Instead of getting down

to  work  to gain the confidence of the public  in

his  Government  and settling  the  many  problems

before  us,  he  has  made a  mountain  out  of  a

molehill, and tried to have his way by making  the

refusal of two out of the four Assistant Ministers

he  asked for a constitutional issue, on which  he

is prepared to resign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, before he makes this constitutional

issue,  he  should,  at least, have  obtained  the

views  of this House as to whether we are prepared

to  support  the  appointment of  four  additional

Assistant  Ministers  or  not.  There   is   ample

evidence to show that not only we on this side  of

the  House,  but the public are much against  such

appointments.  It is a great pity that  the  Chief

Minister has not graduated from his profession  as

a lawyer for the defence to the high post of Chief

Minister  which  he  holds  today.  He  has  even

conducted his arguments this morning to support -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point

of  order. I do not think what the Member for Paya

Lebar   is  talking  about  is  relevant  to   the

amendment.   Has  he  also  forgotten   what   the

amendment is?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Probably Mr R. C. H. Lim has

forgotten the amendment. I will read it out again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the third and fourth parts of the motion

be  left  out, and these words be inserted -  'That

this  House does not accept the Chief Minister  as

the sole interpreter of the said Order in Council.' "



<br><br>The  debate  appears  to be revolving  around  the

Chief  Minister.  Please carry on,  Mr  Lim  Koon

Teck.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> It must be necessarily so,

because he is the chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



actor.  He  has  even conducted his  arguments  in

support  of his motion in exactly the same  manner

as  he  did in his very successful appearances  in

the  courts.  He  has turned the Assembly  into  a

court-house  and the Members of this Assembly  into

jurors,  and with great ability, he has  tried  to

persuade  us that, for his convenience,  the  word

"may"  whenever the Governor consults  him  should

read  "shall". Sir, in other words, he  is  asking

the  Governor to be an additional Chief  Secretary

and  he to  be  the Governor. If  he  wants  legal

interpretation, he should go to the courts,  where

there  are  legally trained men to deal  with  the

points  there raised, and not to all the untrained

Members  of  this House with the  many  law  books

which  he  hurled  at us. The Chief  Minister  has

cleverly put over this issue as a patriot and made

his seconder the Member for Tanjong Pagar. We have

had   the  strange  sight  today  of  Judas  being

welcomed as a long lost brother, setting forth  on

a  joint expedition. We wonder what will happen on

the way!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Progressive massacre!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar

says  that the original motion, which he seconded

must be treated as a political issue and not as  a

legal  one.  He appears to agree that legally  the

Governor's  interpretation of the constitution  is

correct,  but  that  this  is  much  more  than  a

political issue. We are asked here to say that the

Governor should no longer use the discretion given

to  him  under section 15 of the Order in Council.

This section reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The powers conferred upon the Governor by

sections 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of this Order shall

be exercised by him acting in his discretion,"



<br><br>Section  32  of the Order in Council requires  the

Governor  to consult the Chief Minister,  but  the

appointment of Assistant Ministers is  made  under

section  11  of  this Order, which gives  him  the

power    to   exercise   his   discretion.    This

constitution  has been accepted by  the  Coalition

Government when they accepted office, and there is

no  doubt  that the Governor has legally exercised

his powers under this constitution.

I  was wailing for a long time for that laugh, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



and  before  the  driver has even  learned  how  to

drive.  We  believe in orderly progress,  that  the

constitution is workable, and that we shall get our

independence without having to crawl  for  it.  Our

aim  is  that Singapore should take over government

on the most advantageous terms -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Are you confining

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Which is, "That the Chief Minister

is  not  the  sole  interpreter  of  the  Order  in

people  as a whole, without having to pass  through

the  turmoils and crises which Singapore has  seen

during the last few months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one point that I want to mention. I

submit  that  the  motion  before  the-  House   is

inextricably  bound  up with the  question  of  the

appointment  of  the four Assistant  Ministers,  as

this  is  the  direct cause for the Chief  Minister

taking  this action. At board meetings of companies

and,  particularly,  of  other  associations,   any

person  having an interest in the issue, especially

if it is a pecuniary one, does not take part in the

debate and abstains from voting. Such a rule  is  a

sound  one  and applies more forcibly to government

business.  I  hope the traditions of good  business

and  sound  government will  be  observed  in  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no hesitation whatever in supporting

the amendment, because I am quite sure, in my mind,

that  this  House  should  not  be  turned  into  a

courthouse  to  interpret  the  constitution  in  a

manner which the Chief Minister desires.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, I rise to oppose the amendment. I listened to the Member for

Tanglin very carefully, and when he enunciated  his

theory  that the Chief Minister does not  represent

the  people of Singapore. I thought that the  whole

of the Progressive Party did not understand what is

democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House of Commons, which consists of 625

Members at the present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



time,  the  Conservative Party has a  majority  of

only  about  60  Members, and if  the  Member  for

Tanglin  dares to say that the Prime  Minister  of

Britain does not represent the nation, I would not

know which democracy he believes in.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Majority government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Even then, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

the  Prime Minister speaks for the nation and acts

for the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin also

raised  some points on the question of electorate,

and  I  thought for some time that the Progressive

Party  aimed at including those of the  electorate

who  did  not  go  to the polls as supporting  the

Progressive   Party.   I  think.   Sir,   in   all

earnestness,  that the Chief Minister  enjoys  the

confidence  of  the  majority  of  the  people  of

Singapore,  and  the  demonstration  we  witnessed

outside  this House this morning is a  proof.  The

amendment,  if  successful, would amount  to  non-confidence in the Chief Minister and, as  such,  I

vehemently oppose it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak against this amendment. Having spoken when I

seconded  the  motion,  I will  not  be  given  an

opportunity again to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Members for Telok

Ayer,   Tanglin  and  Paya  Lebar  do  not  really

understand the grave issues we are facing.  If  it

were a question, today, of just scoring a debating

point  off the Labour Front or the U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.

Alliance, then I would say their descent, somewhat

crudely,  to personalities would have served  that

purpose. But before this debate continues, I would

ask  them to remember, and to correct me if  I  am

wrong,  that  there  are no possible  developments

other than the three I have enunciated.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Will the Member for

Tanjong Pagar confine himself to the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I will, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Then,  having  decided that  there  are  no  other

alternatives, they will have to ask themselves the

meaning of this amendment, This amendment,  if  it

were carried, would mean a vote of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



no  confidence  in  the  Chief  Minister  and  his

Government.  If  they  want a  new  coalition,  or

suspension   of   the   constitution,   or   fresh

elections,   then   they  can  proceed   on   this

amendment. If however they do not desire  any  one

of  those  three possibilities, then I  would  ask

them  to  consider the matter carefully,  and  ask

themselves  whether it would not be  advisable  to

leave the motion as it is, and allow Her Majesty's

Government   and  the  Chief  Minister   and   his

colleagues to work out a solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer has slightingly

referred  to  the  courage of my  Party  in  fresh

elections. If he should ever doubt that,  we  will

provide him with an opponent in Telok Ayer in  the

next elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in a House

that is not unadorned by legal talents sitting  on

the  opposite  Benches, I am more  than  a  little

surprised  to  find  that though  an  hon.  Member

stands  to  support an amendment which,  in  fact,

means  a complete negation, with respect, Sir,  of

the motion, yet he has absolutely nothing to offer

on   the   legal   aspect,  except  a   completely

misleading reference to section 11 of the Order in

Council. Section 11, Sir, in respect of which  His

Excellency  must  exercise  his  powers   in   his

complete  discretion,  refers  to  judgeships  and

offices  of  the Crown - Attorney-Generals,  Judges,

etc.  It  does not refer to the Chief Minister  or

Assistant  Ministers. The Member for  Paya  Lebar,

himself  a  member  of  the  Bar,  himself  having

practised  at  the Bar, himself  at  one  time  an

officer  of  the  law, if he cares  to  reread  it

carefully,  will  recognise  that  it  is  not  an

instrument  for  supporting his  opposition;  will

recognise that that is true and may well  wish  to

withdraw a suggestion made to the House which,  if

believed, could certainly mislead it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had thought it my duty, in speaking to this

House, to make clear the legal position as  I  saw

it.  I do not think I had suggested-and may I  say

with  respect, Sir, I think it comes very  ill  to

suggest that I have suggested - that I was the  sole

interpreter  of this or any other constitution.  I

give you my views. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



give  you the reasons on which my views are based.

I  am prepared to respect the views of others, and

I repeat: I believe I am right. What do you think?

I  think,  if  I may say so, Sir, that  the  words

which  it  is sought to substitute for  the  words

which it is sought to omit are a gratuitous insult

wholly out of place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, on the motion itself, I have, I

thought,  in  the plainest language,  pointed  out

that  the third paragraph arises out of the second

paragraph,  and you cannot divorce the third  from

the second. If you accept the second which states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the most liberal construction legally

permissible    in    favour   of    the    elected

representatives    of   the    people    in    the

interpretation  of the Singapore Colony  Order  in

Council,  1955, should be adopted",



<br><br>then you  must

accept  the  third  paragraph,  since  that  is  a

liberal construction legally permissible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that in a motion, which I had hoped

would  have the support of all Malayans  in  this

House, and which was not intended to be on a Party

basis,  there  should  still  proceed  the   Party

outlook,   and  the  Party  attitude  of   certain

sections of the opposite Benches. May I say  that

apart  from  the  inconsistency of  accepting  the

first two paragraphs and rejecting the third, as I

understand  it,  according to the  policy  of  the

Progressive  Party,  inconsistencies  are  their

meat  and  drink? Nevertheless,  Sir,  it  is  the

height of absurdity to accept the suggestion  that

you, Sir, embodying this House, should proceed  to

meet  His Excellency, should in the name  of  this

House indicate to him our view that we desire self-government  and independence, our view that  there

should be a liberal construction, and leave things

hanging in the air without reporting back to us

on  the  message that you have delivered  and  the

message that you may receive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know, Sir, whether the hon. Members

opposite  ever stop to think of what  they  do.  I

have  been  the  object of  attack  for  making  a

constitutional issue of a minor matter. Sir,  very

fortunately, it has never been, and so long  as  I

stay  here  or so short as I stay here,  it  never

will be, part of my policy to seek, to placate and

please the Progressive Party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They attack me now for making a constitutional

issue of a minor matter. Can you not see that  had

I  waited  for some major matter of an inflammable

character,   I   would  be  attacked   for   being

responsible  for  bringing  forth  an  inflammable

issue?  So just where do we go, Sir? According  to

the  Progressive  Party and the Member  for  Telok

Ayer,  this  Chief  Minister, Sir,  can  never  do

right. I accept that position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to state, Sir, I am indebted for

the  remarks from the opposite side of  the  House

that  the rejection of this motion, or those parts

of  the motion which I have brought forward, would

amount  to a vote of no confidence in me. I  would

repeat  that I hope no Member in this House  would

be affected by that consideration. There should be

no  question today, on this motion, of  confidence

or no confidence. There should be only the welfare

of  the  people,  and a realisation  that  we  are

dealing  with basic and vital factors that  affect

the working of the constitution and the welfare of

the country.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is most

amazing to me that this amendment should have ever

been proposed. It must either have arisen from the

fact that the proposer and his supporters have not

read  the motion as it stands, or having read  it,

found  themselves  incapable of understanding  it.

The  second  part  of the motion,  Sir,  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that as a demonstration of the good faith of

Her  Majesty's  Government in its  oft-repeated

promise  to  the people of Malaya that they  would

grant  self-government  at the  earliest  possible

moment,  the  most  liberal  construction  legally

permissible    in    favour   of    the    elected

representatives    of   the    people    in    the

interpretation  of the Singapore Colony  Order  in

Council, 1955, should be adopted;".



<br><br>It is asking, Sir, in that part of the motion that

the  most liberal construction legally permissible

should  be adopted. Does that not indicate clearly

that the Chief Minister had never wanted to be the

sole  interpreter of the Order in Council?  Is  it

possible, Sir, that that part of the motion, which

is    in   the   English   language,   could    be

misunderstood? It is not only amazing, but  rather

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words after the word 'that'

in the first line of the third



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



paragraph  of  the  original  motion  to  the  end

proposed  to be left out, be left out,"  put,  and

negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That means, of course, that the

whole   amendment  has  been  defeated,  and   the

original motion is now before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, government under law is often a matter of

definition. On the definition or interpretation of

a  word,  a  principle often lives  or  dies.  The

nature of government under law is also a matter of

definition.  Somehow,  it seems  that  definitions

have  become unclear in Singapore during the past

few   weeks.  It  should  be  very  clear  to  all

concerned  in  government  that  Singapore  is  no

longer  a  colonial  territory,  but  a  political

entity in transition towards independence. That is

the basic definition which must be understood and

appreciated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, therefore, methods which might be!

appropriate in a colony are no longer appropriate.

The   direction  of  government  in  a  transition

society  is  very different from the direction  of

government in a colonial society. In a  colony,  a

firm hand may be necessary for the maintenance  of

the  government. In Singapore, it  should  be  the

role  of  appointed  officials to  conciliate  and

guide. Appointed officials should be eager to turn

over   responsibility  as  soon  as  the   elected

officials  show  they can manage it.  Instead,  in

Singapore we are witnessing a reassertion  of  the

inflexible attitudes associated with past colonial

rule. One belief guided the voters who went to the

polls  in Singapore's first election a few  months

ago.  One  belief animates all - or almost  all - the

elected representatives of the people who  sit  in

this  House.  That belief is the  conviction  that

Singapore,   with  the  blessing  of  the   former

colonial authority, is moving rapidly towards self-government  and  independence.  But  in  the  past

weeks,  that cardinal belief has suffered  a  rude

shock.  The people are beginning to lose faith  in

the   promises  which  were  the  basis  of   the

elections.  The people are beginning  to  wonder

whether  it is truly the intentions of the  former

colonial authority to assist our progress towards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



independence.  This  loss of  faith  is  the  most

dangerous thing that could happen in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If evolution towards independence proves to be an

illusion - or  a  deliberate  deception - the  people

will  be  forced to listen to the extremists.  The

extremists advocate a road to independence  which

can  only  result in suffering for the people  and

great  losses for all. We still believe  that  the

extreme path can be avoided. We still hold to  our

faith  that  evolution towards independence  is  a

reality. But that faith has been shaken. It is now

the  responsibility of the appointed officials  to

restore  that faith - to give us reason to  believe

as we have already believed. If they do not do so,

the cost, I fear, will be grievous for all of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Chief Minister's motion and trust

that it will have the desired effect of causing  a

reconsideration of definitions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, many people outside this Assembly

think  that what the Labour Front is fighting  for

is  two  or  four Assistant Ministers,  but  I  am

surprised  that in this Assembly there are  a  few

Members who still believe this. I think it  should

be  clear  even  to the Progressive Party  Members

that  what the Chief Minister is fighting  for  is

not   Assistant  Ministers  but  a  constitutional

point.  The Chief Minister has said in this  House

this  morning  that  he  is  ready  to  drop  the

question   of   the  Assistant  Ministers   if   a

satisfactory   solution   is   found    to    this

constitutional problem. On this motion the  P.A.P.

stands solidly behind this. Those who vote against

it  must  remember, if they are  Elected  Members,

that they may go to the country on this issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a young firebrand. I have nine

grandchildren. I say in all sincerity  that  times

have  changed.  The people now are  not  like  the

people  before the war. I cannot say what  started

it.  Maybe the Japanese occupation. But  there  is

now  a  new spirit in the people of this  country,

particularly among the younger generation. I  have

no doubt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



that the people of this country - by that I mean the

Asians  who  have  been  born  and  bred  in  this

country - fully support this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Piah Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Piah Teng (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

according  to  what I have read from  the  letters

exchanged  between  the  Chief  Minister  and  His

Excellency  the Governor, I am inclined  to  think

that the question of appointment of four Assistant

Ministers, which has been the cause of the present

crisis,  could have been more amicably settled  if

it was approached in a more informal manner. I see

little  necessity to hurry in this matter.  It  is

certainly regrettable that this question  has  now

developed into a constitutional problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the constitutional matter, it is

obvious  that the Rendel Constitution has  created

certain  reserved  powers  in  the  hands  of  the

Governor. Nevertheless, I am in sympathy with that

paragraph of the proposed resolution which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that as a demonstration of the good faith

of  Her  Majesty's Government in its  oft-repeated

promise  to  the people of Malaya that they  would

grant  self-government  at the  earliest  possible

moment,  the  most  liberal  construction  legally

permissible    in    favour   of    the    elected

representatives    of   the    people    in    the

interpretation  of the Singapore Colony  Order  in

Council, 1955, should be adopted;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this position, and I feel that the

architects  of the Rendel Constitution  must  have

felt the same way. I feel that the reserved powers

given   to   the   Governor   under   the   Rendel

Constitution   should  be   sparingly   used.   I,

therefore, support in principle the spirit of this

resolution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  my  Party  and I are not  surprised  at  the

present crisis. We are not surprised because right

from   the  beginning  we  said  that  the  Rendel

Constitution  was a sham. The Rendel  Constitution

is  an undemocratic constitution. It is a colonial

constitution, and therefore it does not give clear

powers   to   the   people   and   their   elected

representatives. The real power is in the hands of

the  Governor and the colonial officials, but  the

people do not want power for the Governor and  the

colonial   officials.  They   want   freedom   and

democracy for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



themselves  and  their  country.  Those  whom  the

people  have elected are not elected for  nothing.

The people did not participate in the elections in

order to provide stooges for the Governor and  the

colonial     system.    They     elected     their

representatives to fight for freedom and democracy

and  not  to  listen to the orders of colonialism.

The  elected  representatives of the  people  must

listen  to the people and not to the Governor.  If

the Governor is not prepared to accept and act  on

the  advice  of those whom the people  elect,  why

have elections at all? Why have this Assembly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider it hypocrisy to ask the people to

elect  their  own  representatives,  and  then  to

ignore  and to insult them. I fought the elections

to   this  Assembly,  and  my  Party  fought   the

elections,  because we wanted to voice the  demand

of  the  people  in  this  Assembly  for  complete

freedom and democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have great pleasure in supporting

the  Chief Minister's motion for it is a  motion,

which anyone who believes in democratic principles

must support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Mr Sutherland, who is the "Member for

himself",  does not agree. This is not surprising,

for   on  his  own  admission  he  represents  the

expatriates - the European business  community.  The

P.A.P. does  not  include  a  European  business

community - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> - when it talks of the

people of this country. A colonial constitution is

only    workable   ultimately   if   the   elected

representatives of the people are prepared to obey

the  Governor's  orders and  carry  out  policies

which are in the interests of colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the colonial world is in

a  crisis because colonialism is unworkable in the

modem  world.  Everywhere in the world,  including

this country, the people hunger for peace, freedom

and  democracy,  but  the  policy  of  colonialism

throughout  the  world,  in  British  Guiana,  the

French  policy  in  Indo-China and  North  Africa,

proves  that  freedom and democracy  cannot  exist

under colonialism. I hope that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



the Governor and the colonial officials will learn

the  lessons of history quickly for their own good

and for the good of the people of this country  by

granting    the    people   and   their    elected

representatives  real  power.  They   are   acting

against history. They are acting like men who  are

foolish  enough to suppose that they  can  prevent

the sun from rising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The propagandists of colonialism are always

trying  to  convince  the  public  that  they  are

sincere  in  their  desire to  grant  freedom  and

democracy  to  the people, but this crisis  proves

that  they  are not sincere. If they are  sincere,

why  should  the Governor find it so difficult  to

act  according to the advice of the elected  Chief

Minister? The Chief Minister says that the  people

of Singapore are determined to end colonialism and

to  rule  themselves.  I hope  that  the  colonial

officials understand this before it is too late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the Secretary of State for the Colonies,

Mr  Lennox-Boyd, will be visiting  this  country,

but  if  he listens only to the colonial officials

and  to the propagandists, he will never learn the

truth. If he really desires to learn the truth,  I

would  advise him as follows. The truth is not  to

be discovered in Government House. Neither will he

find  it  in European clubs or in police stations,

or  even  in this Assembly itself. If you want  to

learn  the  truth, go among the people,  mix  with

them,  learn  their true feelings,  their  deepest

thoughts,  and then you will find that  everywhere

in  this  country the people cry  out  from  their

hearts "Merdeka!"



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, it  is  a matter of surprise to me  that  in

Singapore  of  1955 this Assembly should  have  to

consider a motion of this nature, The surprise  is

because  it  is  the oft-repeated promise  of  the

British  Government that colonialism is  not  only

dead but damned, and the job facing us is to guide

this   country   to   the   peaceful   waters   of

independence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has stated the case for my

Party and with him I take the stand that only with

a steady march to freedom can this country be kept

safe  within the camp of democracy. It  is  indeed

unfortunate that these statements of simple  truth

should have to be made when the country is in  the

throes  of  a  constitutional crisis.  It  is  the

fashion  these  days to talk, often  and  loosely,

about  the  constitution  under  which  the  April

elections were fought. I warn this House  that  we

are here as representatives of the various Parties

which  fought  the election. We are here,  for  my

part for instance, to push through the platform of

the  Labour  Front. Whether you gentlemen  on  the

opposite side propose to assist or hinder us is  a

different matter. We are here, as I said, to  push

through our Party's platform. This House should be

aware  of its status and not to arrogate to itself

the  power  that normally goes with a  Constituent

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that the motion before the

House  is in the form as it is at present.  Should

it   have   sought  in  any  way  to   amend   the

constitution, then it would have been my  duty  to

warn  this House that this is something  which  is

not within our power to do. We accepted the Rendel

Constitution.  We  fought the election  under  the

Rendel  Constitution, and I am one with the  Chief

Minister when he says that the Rendel Constitution

is   workable,  provided  that  all  the   Parties

concerned adjust their minds to the task of taking

this  country on the road to self-government. This

is the Labour Front policy, and we hope to achieve

our  independence, as the Chief Minister  said  in

his  first  speech  in this Assembly,  within  the

space  of  four  years.  We  have  worked  to  the

constitution  for just four months, and  I  plead

today  to  all those interested in the welfare  of

Singapore not to throw on the scrap-heap something

which  is a milestone in the path of our march  to

self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are today in the relentless grip of a

constitutional crisis. We are today faced with the

issue of who is to govern,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



the  Party in power or the Governor. May I suggest

that  with a liberal interpretation of the  Rendel

Constitution, could we say: Is it possible for the

Party  in power to rule, assisted by the Governor?

I  may  be called an optimist, but I have  grounds

for my optimism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are today faced with the simple issue that

the  Chief Minister made a recommendation for  the

appointment  of  four  Assistant  Ministers.   The

Governor  thought  that only two  were  necessary.

This,  we say, is interference, but I beg  to  say

that if this is interference, there have also been

cases  where  the previous Governor  has  shown  a

remarkable  degree of co-operation. I refer,  Sir,

to  the inaugural speech delivered in this Chamber

by  Sir  John  Nicoll, when he  said  that  multi-lingualism would be introduced in the vehicles  of

local   and  central  government.  Was  this   not

co-operation?   If   there  is  one   instance   of

difference  between the Party  in  power  and  the

Governor,  are  there not several instances  where

the  Governor had taken his stand with  this  same

Party?   What  I  say  is  this.  If  the   Rendel

Constitution was workable four months ago when  we

assumed  office, why should we not, with a  little

patience  and  understanding,  make  use  of   its

positive  aspects  to implement  the  platform  on

which  the electorate sent us here? This issue  of

the Assistant Ministers has been a sore point with

the  public, and I am not so sure that we are wise

to  persist  with  it.  In fact,  I  welcome  that

sentence in the letters published yesterday  where

the  Chief  Minister says that he is  prepared  to

reconsider his advice on this issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came here to serve the people and, in that

service,  we  are fortunate to find in  the  Chief

Minister   one   whose  ability,   integrity   and

sincerity  have won the admiration of all  of  us.

The   Party  thought,  at  one  time,  that  these

Assistant   Ministerships   were   necessary    to

strengthen the Party's chances of implementing its

policies. I can say for sure that the Labour Front

Coalition have changed their minds now. I know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



it will be said that what is at stake today is not

the  appointment  of  a  number  of  men  for  the

Assistant  Ministerships, but the vital principle

of  who is to govern. It is a matter of regret  to

me  that  we  should  have  tripped  up  on  this

principle  over the issue of Assistant  Ministers.

Interference in any manner, I say, is  wrong,  but

it is indeed a pity that this issue should have so

clouded our view, and we have forgotten today  how

it  all  started.  Let me state  flatly  that  the

electorate is against the whole idea of  Assistant

Ministership,  and  we  in  the  Party  like  good

democrats  bow  to this decision and  request  the

Chief  Minister  not to pursue  this  subject  any

further.  The electorate, too, is of  the  opinion

that in no instances where our Party has sought to

implement  its election promises has the  Governor

proved a stumbling block. In fact, on the issue of

multi-lingualism, the Governor, Sir  John  Nicoll,

met  us  half-way.  Again, in  the  matter  of  the

appointment  of  the  Commission  to   probe   the

workings  of the Public Service, we had  our  way.

Again, on the question of land freeze, we had  our

way.  In  the Labour Code and, in fact,  in  every

major  issue  which we have taken up  during  the

four  months we have been in power, we  find  that

the  Governor has met us half-way. That proves that

the Rendel Constitution is workable, and if it was

workable on all these major issues, then  it  will

be  workable again and again during the next  four

years  we  are in office, and when on the strength

of  some  fine  achievements, we will  go  to  the

electorate again. In view of all this, can we  not

pursue  more  diligently with the suggestion  made

earlier  by  the Member for Tanjong Pagar  that  a

modus  vivendi be sought to make this constitution

now  in our hands workable, and to get the Parties

to  work  together to take this island  along  the

road to self-government?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, we, the Naval Base Labour Union  and

the   people  of  Sembawang,  fully  support   the

principal  motion  moved by  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister this morning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stand is against colonialism, and to this end

we  shall  relax  neither  our  efforts  nor  our

strength.  We are opposed to colonialism,  because

we  recognise  it as a running sore  in  our  body

politic. There can be no progress and security in

our  country  as long as the reins  of  power  are

held,  not by the true elected representatives  of

the  people,  but by the colonial government.  The

unworkability of the constitution under which  the

Labour  Front  Coalition  Government  has  had  to

labour  is  too obvious to require repetition.  We

have constantly pointed out the deficiency of  the

constitution, and we now see no reason  to  revise

our  convictions. The constitution is not  adapted

to   the   interests  of  the  people  ready   for

independence. On this issue, our stand is logical

and clear. We shall strive to our utmost extent to

support  any  political  Party  fighting  for  the

independence  of  our country.  The  discretionary

powers   of  the  Governor  in  Council  are   an

unnecessary obstacle to the process of  democracy.

These powers militate against the interests of the

people. If we are to attain our independence, then

these  powers can have no place in the Legislature

of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore realise only too well the

political     implications     colouring      this

constitutional crisis. Any reassertions  of  power

by  the colonial government will earn the deserved

hatred and distrust of the people of Singapore. In

supporting  the Labour Front Coalition  Government

in  such a crisis, we do rightly urge the colonial

government  to justify their promise  of  granting

independence to the people of Singapore.  On  this

issue, the Governor should determine to accept the

principle of government existing primarily for the

people;  and where this principle is not  observed

in  a  colonial country, then democracy becomes  a

hollow pretence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  support the motion. I wish  to  make  it

clear that if this House had been asked to vote on

the  creation  of  posts for  the  four  Assistant

Ministers, my Party would have voted "No",  unless

a  good  and valid justification could  be  given.

Even if those posts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



had been created and this House had been asked  to

approve  the nominations of the Chief Minister  to

those  positions,  we  would  have  also  strongly

opposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we heard the most sensational Party

speeches  delivered  by  our  Chief  Minister,  my

sympathies go with him, but I can assure the Chief

Minister  that his position in history is  secure.

He  will always be remembered as Singapore's first

Malayan  to  occupy the chief executive  chair  as

Singapore  moves towards true self-government  and

independence,  but  history's  judgment   on   Mr

Marshall,  the Member for Cairnhill,  however,  is

not  nearly so certain. Certain of his actions  in

his  entire chain of actions led us to  fear  that

the  statement of the future historian  about  the

Chief  Minister may merely note that Mr  Marshall

is  only the first Chief Minister, and will say no

more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A terrible burden rests on the pioneer, we admit,

particularly when he treads the political road  to

independence.  Precisely because Mr  Marshall  is

Singapore's    first    Chief    Minister,     his

administration  should  be  more  immaculate  than

Caesar's  wife. Unfortunately, we cannot say  that

it is, so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we meet here today to consider a

constitutional   crisis,   and   we   note    this

constitutional crisis with grief. Can we deny that

this  crisis  came about because of the  political

self-seeking of the present Government? The people

of  Singapore who are acquainted with their public

figures  look with doubt, and perhaps  disfavour,

on certain of the nominations offered by the Chief

Minister for the posts of Assistant Ministers -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please do not touch on the

merits   or   demerits  of  the  appointment   of

Assistant  Ministers.  That  is  not  before  the  House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Despite our distaste for the

manner in which the dispute arose, my Party cannot

do  otherwise than to support the Chief Minister's

motion  because  the issue is no  longer  a  minor

issue. It is no more a political issue. The  issue

has  become a moral issue touching the very  heart

of Singapore's political being.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Singaporeans believed, and have been led to

believe,  that we were on the high  road  to  the

goal of self-government and independence, but now

it  is feared that the high road is merely a back

alley.  A  government which is not  permitted  to

govern   its   own  composition   is   hardly   a

government. Therefore, we base on the  principle,

which  nobody  can and dare deny, that  Singapore

must  be  governed  and ruled by  the  people  of

Singapore. Therefore, Sir, I have the  honour  to

support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Rochore):</b> I rise to

support  the motion standing in the name  of  the Hon. the Chief Minister -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Moment of interruption. It is four

o'clock now. Debate to be resumed, what day,  Mr

Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Ten o'clock tomorrow morning, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid that cannot be done. If

the Chief Minister will now move that the sitting

do adjourn, automatically the adjournment will be

until Monday morning, the next sitting day.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> With respect, Sir, may I

point  out that under the provisions of  Standing

Order  7  (2),  I thought we could  continue  to-morrow?  Would you permit me, Sir,  to  move  the

suspension  of the Standing Orders  in  order  to

enable a sitting to be held tomorrow morning?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That cannot be done. Will you move

the adjournment, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move

the adjournment till Monday morning at 10 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at 4.02 p.m. to</div>
