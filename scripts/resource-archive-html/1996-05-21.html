  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether the Housing and Development Board is slowing down the building of Executive apartments following the introduction of the new Executive Condominium Housing Scheme as purchasers of Executive apartments have been informed that their waiting period to obtain such flats will be between five and eight years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the introduction of the Executive Condominium Housing Scheme in August 1995, HDB has stopped accepting applications for its Executive flats. As at 31st March 1996, there were about 29,000 applications in the Executive flat register under HDB's Registration for Flat System. HDB will continue to build about 4,000 units of Executive flats each year for the existing Executive flat applicants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Executive Condominium Housing Scheme, the developer appointed by my Ministry will set aside 80% of the supply of Executive Condominiums for allocation to registered Executive flat applicants. To encourage the purchase of Executive Condominiums, eligible first-timers will be given a $40,000 CPF housing grant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive flat applicants will have to decide between Executive Condominiums or Executive flats at the point when their registration numbers are due for either type of housing. Applicants from the Executive flat queue who decide not to buy an Executive Condominium will be allowed to retain their queue positions until they are due for selection of an Executive flat. If all or most of the 80% of the supply of Executive Condominiums set aside for allocation to registered Executive flat applicants are taken up, then it will take about five years to clear the 29,000 applications. HDB will be in a better position to review the building

   <b>HDB'S PURCHASE OF 3-ROOM FLATS FROM OPEN MARKET</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether the Housing and Development Board's purchases of 3-room flats from the open market are based on the demand for units in preferred estates by lower-income applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the 3-room buy-back scheme from the open market for sale to low-income families is part of Government's efforts to help the low-income families own their flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB buys back from the open market a wide range of 3-room flats at varying prices and at varying locations. These flats are then offered for sale to the 3-room flat applicants on the waiting list. The take-up rate is about 58%. Applicants are given a second opportunity to choose the flat of their choice. Those who are very particular about location can buy a resale flat directly, with the help of the $40,000 CPF grant given to first-time purchasers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, what is the stock of such 3-room flats that HDB has for sale to the applicants? Would the Minister consider buying back these flats based on the demand of applicants rather than buying them in, say, Woodlands or Chua Chua Kang, when most applicants would prefer Hougang or Toa Payoh?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, the HDB officers dealing with this scheme have a fairly good idea of where the demand lies and they would direct the housing agents to source for those flats where there is a demand. Most of the flats would be in the central area, like Queenstown, Bukit Merah, Toa Payoh, Bedok and Geylang. Not many flats can be sourced from the Woodlands area. The sourcing of such flats is quite responsive to the demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, so far, how many applicants have rejected the flats because they are not in the location of their choice?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I explained earlier, the take-up rate is about 58%. So 58% would choose the flats when they are offered to them. The remaining 42% will reject the flats. But we give them a second chance to choose again. Many of these flats are sourced from the open market. So there is no guarantee that we can match accurately the supply with the demand. We roughly know the locations where the applicants prefer and we try to source the flats in those locations. But again it depends on the availability of such flats in the open market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they are offered the flat in the same location they may not choose it because of facing, floor height, and other reasons. But they have a second alternative. They can go out to the open market, buy the resale flat on their own in the location which they want, and the Government will help them with the $40,000 CPF housing grant or $50,000 CPF housing grant if they are staying close to their parents.

   <b>STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING MANUAL</b>

   <b>(Guidelines relating to interested party transactions)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Stephen Lee Ching Yen:--
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To ask the Minister for Finance whether the Stock Exchange of Singapore will provide a set of guidelines to exclude certain transactions from Rule 10-10 of the Stock Exchange Listing Manual relating to interested party transactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Question No. 3, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Stephen Lee has asked whether the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) will issue new guidelines to exempt certain related-party transactions which are now covered under Clause 1010 of the Listing Manual. A transaction caught under this clause requires the approval of independent shareholders at the general meeting unless a waiver has been granted by the Stock Exchange.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Mr Lee would be aware by now that the Stock Exchange had
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> issued a new set of guidelines on the sale of properties to connected persons and directors' relatives on 22nd April 1996, and subsequently, a revised Clause 1010 on 26th April 1996.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying the operation of Clause 1010 in the past and similar rules in other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong, the SES issued an amended Clause 1010 which provides for a new two-tier system to regulate related-party transactions. Under this system, related-party transactions below the lower of $500,000 or 3% of the latest net total assets (NTA) of the listed company will not require shareholders' approval but only disclosure in the annual report by aggregating transactions with the same related party, where each transaction exceeds $5,000. Related-party transactions which fall between this first-tier and the lower of $3 million or 5% of NTA will not require shareholders' approval but must be announced immediately. Only related-party transactions above $3 million or 5% of NTA, whichever is lower, will require shareholders' approval.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the Stock Exchange's estimate, the new clause will reduce the number of related-party transactions which require shareholders' approval considerably. If the new two-tier system had been in place, only 22%, (or 38 cases) of the 172 related-party transactions last year would have required shareholders' approval.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to be consistent with the Stock Exchange's latest guidelines on the sale of properties to connected persons and directors' relatives, this new two-tier system will not apply to sale of properties to connected persons. All such property sales must be approved by shareholders regardless of the value of the transactions. The Stock Exchange is of the view that sale of properties is different from other related-party transactions because properties are not homogenous products and the pricing of properties is complex and subject to frequent market changes. Furthermore, there have been public complaints about listed companies selling properties to related parties at discounts
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and giving them priority in selecting and booking properties. As such, the SES considers it more appropriate to subject all property sales by listed companies to related parties to shareholders' approval.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the SES' guidelines on the sale of properties to connected persons, (which requires shareholders' approval for such sales to be obtained within six weeks of the sale or proposed sale) the new Clause 1010 does not specify any time period within which shareholders' approval must be obtained. This is because Clause 1010 applies to all related-party transactions, most of which require opinions from independent financial advisers and independent directors. As such transactions and their terms are usually much more complicated than property transactions, independent opinions can normally be given only after detailed evaluation and due diligence. This may require considerable time. Furthermore, some related party-transactions involving the acquisition of foreign assets by the listed company may be subject to approval by the authorities here. The timing of such approvals is therefore frequently beyond the listed company's control.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for these two differences, all other requirements under the revised Clause 1010 will also apply to listed companies' sale of properties to their connected persons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the new two-tier system, the SES will exempt certain related-party transactions where conflicts of interest are immaterial from Clause 1010. The main categories of transactions that will be exempted are as follows:--
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the grant of options, and issue of shares pursuant to the exercise of options under an employee share option scheme approved by the Stock Exchange;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) transactions between a listed company and its partly-owned subsidiary or associated company if none of the listed company's substantial shareholders or director is a substantial shareholder of that partly-owned subsidiary or associated company in his personal capacity;
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) transactions between a listed company and another company where the only connection between the two is certain common directors who in aggregate own less than 5% of either company;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) provision of financial services by a financial institution in Singapore on normal commercial terms and in the ordinary course of business; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) transactions with past directors and substantial shareholders.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust this answers Mr Lee's question.

  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I recall the same statement issued by SES which cited a grant of waiver of shareholders' approval to HPL for the transaction by the Senior Minister in Nassim Jade and, subsequently, the same principle was applied to Scotts 28. The reason given was that SM was financially independent from the brother who is the non executive director. I would like to know from the Minister what is the Stock Exchange's definition for "financially independent". Are there any guidelines and what do they mean by "financially independent"? Also, I would like to ask whether the principle for granting the waiver, based on financial independence, is a prudent guideline.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, the normal interpretation of "financial dependence" would be the dependence of a child on the parents. In other words, a child is dependent on the parent. Therefore, if the parent buys something on behalf of the child, the child is dependent. Another sibling or relative who is not financially dependent acts on his own, in other words, he buys things on his own account. Therefore, there is no linkage in that sense. That is the general guideline and I think it is quite a prudent and adequate one.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> If a wife is independent financially from the husband, for example, and she buys a property, would the transaction require the shareholders' approval?

   <b>SECURITY GATES AT HDB BLOCKS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether the installation of security gates at Housing and Development Board blocks like the one proposed in the Interim Upgrading Programme for 11 blocks at Bedok is desirable and should be encouraged.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the installation of security gates is part of an Integrated Security System which was first incorporated in the pilot project at Woodlands Blocks 318 and 321. Under this system, the access points to the blocks are enclosed with grilles and metal gates. To go in and out of the block, the residents have to make use of access cards or the exit push button respectively. For the visitor, a call panel is installed at the main gate for him to call up the unit that he wants to visit. The resident, upon identifying the visitor through his audio intercom handset, can unlock the main gate at the lift lobby by depressing a button on the handset. The residents can also identify visitors or watch what is happening at the main gate through their television sets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Integrated Security System is a complete security system for the entire block. Besides lift crime, the system also deters crimes such as robbery and housebreaking within the block. The system therefore achieves an all-round improvement in crime prevention and enhances the sense of security of the residents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB continues to monitor the pilot project at Woodlands. Most of the residents feel that this system has enhanced their security and gives them more privacy. However, it is still possible
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for strangers to slip into the block by following a resident or a visitor. This is where the residents must cooperate with one another. At the same time, they should not be complacent and be lulled into a false sense of security.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB leaves it to the Town Councils to decide whether to install the Integrated Security System in their estates. If it is an item installed under the Interim Upgrading Programme, as is done by the Bedok Town Council, then the costs will have to be met within the $6,000 budget allocated per flat and the residents do not have to pay for it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the first supplementary question is: while it may enhance the security of the residents, will it also discourage visits by neighbours from the next block? And secondly, will it be socially desirable to fence up -- it now seems that not only private properties are fenced up but every HDB block is going to be fenced up - and will it encourage social interaction?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The trade-off between privacy, security and free access for social interaction is best left to the residents to decide for themselves whether in their particular circumstances they want to install such a system. If they find that there are too many accesses by strangers, and it does not necessarily cut off social interaction, they can still freely come and go and visit whoever they want in the block. There is still good access through the intercom.

   <b>(Definition)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Finance what is the definition of income derived from property trading and how many people paid tax on this source of income from 1993 to 1995.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with effect from 15th May 1996, gains from all property transactions within three years of its purchase will be deemed as income and taxed at the individual marginal tax rate or corporate tax rate of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 26%. Prior to 15th May 1996, there were about 100 taxpayers taxed on income derived from property trading per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, stamp duties have become payable with effect from 15th May for all vendors who enter into sale and purchase agreements within three years of acquiring their property and yet the Stamp Duties (Amendment) Bill has not been passed. Would the Minister consider this to be a regular practice in spite of the fact that the Amendment Bill has not been passed, but the stamp duties are already payable from 15th May?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The Stamp Duties (Amendment) Bill will be introduced today and it will be passed at a subsequent sitting of Parliament after the Second and Third readings, probably next month. The Bill will allow stamp duties to take place with retrospective effect from 15th May, 1996.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, in reply to my Question earlier, would the Minister be good enough to say whether this figure of 100 people, who have been charged income tax for property trading, implies that the Income Tax Department has not been diligent in its pursuance of this tax in view of the great amount of property speculation that has been going on?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The figure of 100 is low, I agree, and the reason is that it is extremely difficult to tax a person on what he considers to be property gains, unless the person is an established property trader and does it regularly and frequently. It is precisely this problem that we are introducing amendments to the Income Tax Act to change the law so that anybody who sells within three years will be considered as having made property gains during this period. This is the reason for it.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Prime Minister (a) whether he will name all the Ministers who have purchased private properties in Singapore in the years 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 in the first, pre-launch and soft launch offers; and (b) whether he will identify those properties, the prices at which they were purchased and the percentages of discount given, if any.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Ministers and other office-holders are governed by a set of rules of prudence stated in the Code of Conduct for Ministers. They are required to declare in writing to the Prime Minister, at the beginning of each term of office, the assets they own. I also require them to declare their financial borrowings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The declaration is confidential, known only to the Prime Minister and the President. If there is an allegation later of a sudden and unexplained increase in wealth of an office-holder, his declaration will be turned over to the CPIB for investigation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has never publicly revealed the assets owned by Ministers. To do so would be to intrude into their
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> privacy unnecessarily. Other than satisfying the curiosity of the Opposition and some of the public, it does not help to maintain good and clean Government. All those countries which have Ministers and MPs declaring their assets have not improved their cleanness of the government. Our system of strict surveillance and transparency has done and is doing so -- we have a clean, open system. Capable and honest Singaporeans running for public office will not want to have the Opposition and the public go into their private financial arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide the details which Mr Chiam has asked for enables a Member of Parliament to pry into the investments of Ministers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Chiam believes that there has been wrongdoing on the part of Ministers in their purchase of private residential properties, he should let me or the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) or the CPIB have the evidence. They will pursue the matter.

  <b>The Acting Minister for Communications (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are over 3,000 bus shelters in Singapore. Generally, a bus shelter is replaced if it is more than 15 years old and is beyond economic repair.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as part of its efforts to improve the quality of our public transport system, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has embarked on a pilot project to upgrade 100 bus shelters in the city area and along main roads in Ang Mo Kio New Town. The new generation bus stops have been designed taking into account feedback from bus commuters. Apart from the basic function of protecting commuters from inclement weather, these bus stops are also equipped with amenities like fans, water coolers and telephones.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA will monitor bus commuters' response to the new amenities. If the pilot project proves to be a success, it will extend the bus shelter upgrading programme to other areas.

  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, section 3 of the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Act empowers Parliament to add to or amend the Schedule to the Act by resolution at any time. The Schedule contains a listing of old and new titles or names of departmental offices. Such titles and names of offices are subject to changes from time to time when departments are reorganised or restructured following periodic management reviews.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Parliament should not be concerned with such administrative changes. This Bill therefore seeks to give powers to the respective Ministers in charge of the departments to make changes to the departmental titles instead of Parliament. The proposed amendment to the Act is procedural and administrative in nature and will not affect the operation of the provisions in the Constitution where certain key appointments require the concurrence of the President.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -- [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].

   <b>BANKING (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking Act was last amended in 1993. Since then, the international financial market has witnessed the collapse of Barings, the massive fraud in the New York branch of the Daiwa Bank and losses suffered by leading international financial institutions from trading in derivatives. During this period, the Japanese banking system was also adversely affected by the large exposures of its banks to the problem real estate sector. A number of the smaller Japanese banks had to be bailed out by the Japanese government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the need for proper regulation and strong internal controls, one of the key lessons learnt from these events is the importance of having strong capital to underpin banking operations. As banks venture into more sophisticated financial instruments, the risk which they undertake also increases, hence the need for stronger capital. Financial institutions with stronger capital are better able to withstand financial crises and to undertake risk.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another lesson from recent events is the need for closer cooperation among banking supervisory authorities in the supervision of financial institutions with international cross-border operations. As the world's financial markets become more closely linked, disturbances in one market are now transmitted more rapidly to other markets. This further underscores the need for closer cooperation among financial regulators in protecting the integrity and soundness of the international financial system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an international financial centre, it is important for Singapore to review its financial laws and regulations in the light of international financial developments and trends to ensure that the laws and regulations continue to be effective in maintaining the soundness of our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> financial system. Against this background, let me explain the rationale for the proposed amendments to the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key amendments proposed in the Bill is to increase the minimum capital requirement for locally-incorporated banks. Since the last amendment of the Banking Act in 1993, the total assets of the six local banking groups have increased by almost $38 billion, or 27%, from $141 billion to $179 billion. The four largest banks rank among the top 200 banks in the world in terms of capital funds and among the top 300 by assets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the strong growth in our local banks' business over the last few years and their plans for expansion into international financial markets, it is prudent to require them to further strengthen their capital to better protect depositors' interest and ensure that they have adequate capital resources to compete effectively in the global marketplace.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to raise the minimum capital funds requirement (defined as paid-up capital plus retained earnings and published reserves) for locally-incorporated banks from $800 million to $1,500 million. Local banks would be given a grace period of five years to comply. Of the six major local banks, the `Big 4' are already able to meet the requirement. The other two banks, namely, Tat Lee Bank and Keppel Bank, have capital funds of $1.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively, and should have no difficulty meeting the requirement within the five-year grace period through profit retention and capital injection.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes to raise the minimum paid-up capital for newly-incorporated local banks from $800 million to $1,500 million. In order to bring up the paid-up capital requirement from existing banks in line with that of newly-incorporated banks, the existing local banks may be required to increase their paid-up capital to not less than $1,500 million at any time five years after the Amendment Act has come into operation. MAS will give sufficient time for existing local banks to meet with the requirement, when it is introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) be allowed to grant subsidiary banks of the local banking groups a longer grace period to meet the new minimum capital funds requirement. Notwithstanding this provision, it is MAS' intention to encourage these banks to merge with their parent banks in order that they could make better use of their resources and reap the benefits of economies of scale.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second key amendment proposed in the Bill is to allow foreign banking supervisory authorities to inspect their banks' operations in Singapore, which is presently not permitted. The collapse of a number of financial institutions with cross-border operations, such as the Bank for Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in 1991 and Barings in 1995, had led banking regulators to re-examine the supervision of large international banks which culminated in the issue of a set of supervision standards by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for the supervision of banks with substantial international operations. One of the basic principles embodied in the standards is the need for home supervisory authorities to exercise effective consolidated supervision over their bank's global operations. One way of achieving this is for supervisory authorities to inspect their banks' overseas operations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although MAS routinely inspects banks, including foreign banks in Singapore, the Authority has received requests from a number of foreign banking supervisory authorities to inspect their banks' branches in Singapore directly in order to fulfil their responsibility under the BIS principles of consolidated supervision. The US bank regulators have been particularly keen to inspect their banks' operations in Singapore as bank examination is central to their supervision process. The major international financial centres, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and Hong Kong, allow home supervisory authorities to inspect foreign banks operating in their jurisdictions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an international financial centre, it is important that Singapore should cooperate more closely with other banking
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> regulators to strengthen the supervision of large international banks whose operations could threaten the stability of the international financial system if they are not properly supervised, provided that this does not undermine depositors' legitimate right to secrecy on their banking information. The Bill, therefore, proposes to allow foreign supervisory authorities to inspect the Singapore branches of banks whose head offices are incorporated in their respective jurisdiction, subject to certain safeguards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard the confidentiality of customer information, the proposed amendment requires a foreign supervisory authority which intends to conduct an inspection of its banks' operations in Singapore to obtain prior written permission from MAS before conducting the inspection. In addition, the foreign supervisory authority must be prohibited under its domestic laws from divulging information obtained from the inspection to other parties. If not, the foreign supervisory authority would have to undertake to MAS not to divulge the information to other parties. The foreign supervisory authority would only be allowed to examine credit facilities and the internal control systems of the Singapore branch and, with prior approval of MAS, other matters relating to the operation of the branch. Foreign supervisors would be prohibited from accessing depositor information of the branch.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the Act does not require persons who have access to reports produced by MAS, pursuant to its inspection of banks, to keep such reports confidential. The Bill proposes to include a new provision in the Act to ensure that information in such reports is not misused for purposes other than its intended objective, which is the prudential supervision of banks. With the new provision, any person, including staff of banks, who has access to inspection reports prepared by MAS, is required to keep the information contained in the reports confidential. It would be an offence for such persons to disclose the contents of these reports to parties who are not authorised under any written law in Singapore to receive the information.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some international banks which have operations in Singapore have centralised their data processing function in their head office or other overseas branches in order to reap cost-reduction benefits from economies of scale and for a more efficient and effective management control. In order that their Singapore operations may also enjoy these benefits, the Bill proposes to allow certain types of information to be transmitted by foreign banks in Singapore to their head offices and other such overseas branches for data processing purposes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes that the Goods and Services Tax Act be included in the definition of "written law" under section 47(11) of the Act so that banking secrecy may be lifted for investigation and prosecution of offences under the GST Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the above amendments, the Bill also contains a number of other house-keeping amendments to the Act merely to give the force of law to administrative procedures. These amendments do not warrant any special mention in addition to what has been stated in reference to them in the Explanatory Statement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Banking Act was amended in 1993. Since then, there have been a number of incidents which have rocked the world's financial markets, such as the collapse of Barings, the Daiwa Bank scandal in the United States and the Mexican peso crisis. Even though the Barings collapse was triggered off by losses incurred by its futures subsidiary in Singapore, Singapore's financial sector was virtually unscathed, largely because of our sound financial system and the high prudential standards we have imposed on financial institutions operating here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, financial markets have become increasingly interdependent and more competitive. More innovative and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> sophisticated financial derivatives are being traded in increasing volumes. While these developments have raised the relative importance of the financial sector in the economy and improve the efficiency of the financial markets, they have also generated greater volatility and risks for banks and other market participants. Singapore's financial sector has also grown in sophistication and our financial institutions will also be subject to greater risks as they venture further abroad. While we should continue to develop Singapore as an international financial centre, we should not compromise our prudential standards to ensure the integrity of our financial markets. There must be a proper balance. Liberalisation of our financial markets should only be undertaken hand-in-hand with adequate regulations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let me turn to the specific provisions of the Bill. Clause 3 seeks to raise the minimum capital funds requirement of Singapore incorporated banks to S$1,500 million. In the 1993 amendment to the Banking Act, the minimum capital funds requirement was raised to S$800 million. I had already asked then why the requirement was set at that level, and not higher, as nearly all the local banks at that time had exceeded the S$800 million requirement. I have great pleasure to tell the Minister that I told him so three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as the Singapore banks continue to expand their operations overseas, it is important that they have adequate capital resources to support such expansion, and to withstand any potential adverse developments which could result in losses to their operations. I therefore have no difficulty in supporting this further increase of the minimum capital funds requirement to S$1,500 million.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Minister has said that only two local banks have some difficulty in meeting the new requirement. May I ask the Minister whether the banks would be able to meet the new requirement within five years? I would also like to ask the Minister whether he would consider providing any incentive to encourage the smaller Singapore banks to merge among
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> themselves or with the larger banks to achieve economies of scale, and thereby improve efficiency. I would also like to ask: with this increase in capital funds, what will be our capital adequacy ratio, and how does this ratio compare with other financial markets?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill inserts a new section 45A to allow foreign supervisory authorities to conduct on-site inspections on Singapore branches of banks incorporated under their jurisdictions. This will enable them to undertake more effective consolidated supervision over their banks' overall operations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent occurrences of fraud and mismanagement by the overseas offices of some foreign banks, eg, the US$1.1 billion fraud in Daiwa Bank's New York Branch, have highlighted the importance for supervisory authorities to undertake closer supervision over their banks' overseas operations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that a number of financial centres already allow foreign supervisory authorities to conduct inspections on the branches of foreign banks operating in their jurisdictions. I therefore support this provision under clause 5. Sir, given the large number of foreign banks with branches in Singapore, this provision will enhance the level of supervision over the Singapore banking sector and help to reduce the risk to our depositors and investors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot depend solely on the foreign supervisory authorities to supervise the operation of their banks here. The foreign supervisory authorities may not fully appreciate our local operating environment, and the focus of their inspections may also differ from that of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. MAS, therefore, cannot afford to be less vigilant in supervising the foreign banks in Singapore. But may I ask the Minister: in the event of differences or even conflict between MAS and a foreign supervisory body, which agency will prevail or take precedence? In this context, Clause 7 of the Bill inserts a new section 46A to safeguard the confidentiality of reports produced by MAS or a foreign supervisory
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> authority upon supervision or investigation. May I ask the Minister to further elaborate on these safeguards to maintain the confidentiality so as to ensure that depositors' and investors' confidence in our banking system is not compromised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, clause 8 of the Bill also proposes to amend the Banking Act to allow the Singapore branches of foreign banks to transmit information to their head offices or other overseas branches for data processing. I support this proposal as it would help to reduce the operating costs of foreign banks in Singapore, thereby making Singapore more attractive as a location for foreign banks to set up or expand their operations here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from these queries, I fully support the Banking (Amendment) Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I begin, I would like to declare my interest as a banker. I would also like to say that the views I express today are entirely personal. I do not represent my bank here or any banking group. Some of these views, however, have been formed after informal discussions with people in the banking community, many of whom have been in banking much longer than I.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stated mission of the MAS is to promote sustained and non-inflationary growth of the economy, as well as to foster a sound, progressive and competitive financial services sector. The resounding success of Singapore as an international financial centre is testimony to the good job MAS has done in this respect.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking Act has served MAS well thus far in maintaining a sound financial regulatory framework which could withstand incidents like bad debt crises of less developed countries, stock market crashes and even the recent Barings Bank failure without any investor or financial institution in Singapore losing any money. But as the external pressure for liberalisation of our financial services grows, there is a need to review our supervisory system to ensure that we are prepared to manage the greater volatility in the financial markets that may result. I believe this Banking (Amendment) Bill is a step in the right direction, and I support it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the provision to require existing banks incorporated in Singapore with capital funds of less than $1.5 billion to increase their capital funds to that level in five years will result in fewer but stronger local banks. This, I believe, is necessary if we intend to compete in a big way in the international market place. The recent mergers of Chase and Chemical Banks and Tokyo and the Mitsubishi Banks are aimed at achieving precisely this. Stronger banks have greater access to quality customers and better cost of funds and can therefore compete more effectively. The smaller banks may have to merge or be absorbed by their parent companies to meet this requirement in five years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 to amend section 26 to shorten the time allowed for banks to submit their monthly statements from 15 calendar days to 10 calendar days is, in my view, reasonable, considering the high level of computerisation in banks today. As a matter of fact, MAS had already implemented the 10-day deadline since February last year through a circular issued to all banks dated October 1994. Generally, banks should have no problems meeting this deadline, except perhaps in months when public holidays and weekends fall within those 10 calendar days. In those cases, I hope the MAS would be understanding and give banks a bit more time to file their returns.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I have some questions regarding the provision to allow, under certain circumstances, a foreign supervisory authority to carry out an inspection of a branch in Singapore of a foreign bank under its supervision. This will give foreign authorities a complete picture for specific audit and investigation purposes. My question to the Minister is: apart from the few countries which have been mentioned, will the foreign authorities of other countries reciprocate and allow MAS to do likewise? If not, will Singapore be disadvantaged vis-a-vis other financial centres where customers' perception of our banking secrecy is concerned? I do realise that the possible access by foreign authorities to their branches' books in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore is subject to the approval of MAS and a host of other conditions. But, unfortunately, the fear of compromise of confidentiality is sometimes irrational. I believe MAS and the foreign banks have a public relations task to allay such anxieties of foreign customers. Singapore has grown as an international financial centre because of the confidence instilled in customers through our legal framework. We should do our best to maintain that confidence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the new section 46A provides penalties for unauthorised communication and misuse of such information, in the course of the work of foreign authorities. My last question to the Minister is: how do we enforce these laws on persons who violate this Act who are living in other countries?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, I certainly support the Government's move to increase the capital adequacy of banks in Singapore. I also support the move to get foreign supervisory authorities more involved with the affairs of branches of their own banks. Certainly, today in this world where international finance is getting more and more international and, in fact, it is basically one single global financial community, this is important. But, Sir, I remember that in the past MAS has not been very receptive to such ideas because of its banking secrecy provisions. In line with the new mood, especially that started by the Swiss authorities, I believe the mood now is towards a more open and more transparent supervisory climate. However, given the provisions that have been enacted regarding the banking secrecy in Singapore, I also believe that MAS sets great store in the development of our financial centre.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, I would like to ask the same question that the Member for Tanglin has asked, ie, if perchance, information is released by foreigners in other countries, what are the practical steps and avenues that are open to us to seek redress? The presence of such provisions prohibiting such release in our own statutes would not really go too far away if this information is being released in the foreign domain.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, Dr Ow has asked whether the local banks will have any difficulty in meeting the minimum capital requirement proposed. Of the six major local banks, four have capital funds, as I have mentioned, which are more than $1,500 million, and they range from $2.6 billion to $5.6 billion. The other two have capital funds of $1.13 billion and $1.03 billion, and should be able to meet the new capital requirement within five years. There are six other local banks which are all subsidiaries of the major local banks. For those banks which are at least 75% owned by the parent banks which are able to meet the new capital requirement, the authority may extend the grace period beyond five years for these smaller banks. However, as I have mentioned in my speech earlier, the authority would encourage these banks to merge with their parent banks in order to make better use of their resources and to enjoy the benefits of economies of scale. For those banks which are less than 75% owned, they may have to be merged with their parent banks at the end of the grace period if they are still unable to meet the new requirement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow also wants to know whether the MAS would provide incentives to encourage the smaller Singapore banks to merge among themselves or with the larger ones. Members may recall that in the last amendment to the Banking Act in 1993, new provisions were introduced to facilitate the merger of a bank with one or more of its fully-owned subsidiary banks. This was as a result of feedback from local banks that the provisions for mergers and takeovers in the Companies Act posed considerable impediments to bank mergers, particularly in the transfer of assets and liabilities and contractual rights and obligations of the existing banks to the merged entity. The Banking Act was therefore amended to allow banks to apply to the Minister for Finance for approval to merge with one or more of its locally wholly-owned subsidiary banks. Once approval is granted, all undertakings of the existing banks will be transferred to and vested in the merged bank, allowing
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the merged bank to carry on business with minimum disruption and inconvenience to depositors and customers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the amendment in 1993, one of the big four local banks, UOB, has made use of the provisions to merge with one of its subsidiary banks, the Lee Wah Bank. The MAS will continue to encourage the subsidiary banks of other banks to merge with their parents in order to make better use of their resources. In this regard, I think the MAS will be pleased to consider removing any other impediments which banks foresee may prevent such mergers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow also wants to know what are the capital adequacy ratios of the banks with this change in capital funds. Under the Banking Act, the local banks are required to have minimum capital adequacy ratios of at least 12%. However, at the end of April 1996, the capital adequacy ratios of the six major local banks already ranged from 13.4% to 17.7%, based on Tier 1 capital, which is paid-up capital and published reserves. These capital adequacy ratios of our local banks are among the highest in the world, making them among the strongest banks in the world financially. The increase in the minimum capital funds requirement should not have any impact on the capital adequacy ratio of the big four banks as they are already able to meet the new capital funds requirement. As for the other two smaller banks, their capital adequacy ratios would likely improve as a result.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow also wants to know who would prevail if there is a perceived conflict between the views of MAS and the foreign supervisory authority. Undoubtedly, in Singapore, the MAS would prevail on local banking matters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also wants to know what safeguards would be introduced to maintain the confidentiality of bank depositors information. The following are the safeguards which are available:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a foreign supervisory authority which intends to conduct an inspection of its bank's operations in Singapore must obtain MAS' prior permission. Secondly, the inspection must be solely for supervisory purposes and must be conducted
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> under conditions of secrecy. Thirdly, the foreign supervisory authority must be prohibited from its domestic laws from divulging information obtained from the inspection to other parties. If not, the foreign supervisory authority would have to give an undertaking to MAS not to divulge the information to third parties. Fourthly, the foreign supervisor would have to give MAS a written undertaking to comply with the provisions of the Banking Act and any conditions which the MAS may impose.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the foreign supervisory authority would only be allowed to examine the credit facilities and internal control systems of the bank with the prior approval of MAS. Other matters would not be allowed unless MAS' prior approval is obtained. It is quite clear that they would have no access to individual depositor information.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau asked whether we are the first country to introduce the legal provision to allow foreign supervisory authorities to inspect banks here. The answer is no, we are not the first country to allow foreign supervisors to inspect the banks' operations. As I have mentioned in my speech, other countries such as US, UK, Australia and Hong Kong have already allowed home supervisory authorities to inspect foreign banks operating within their jurisdictions. As such, Singapore would not be disadvantaged vis-a-vis these countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS would only consider allowing foreign supervisory authorities to inspect their banks' operations inside Singapore if they are prepared to allow reciprocal treatment when we ask to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, both Mr Lew and Mr Heng Chiang Meng were concerned how we would deal with situations in which foreign persons living overseas divulge confidential information to which they had access. In the first place, we must ensure that the information which can be divulged should be limited. In other words, such persons would not have access to depositor information anyway. So there is nothing to divulge in that area.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as our ability to catch and prosecute them is concerned, if they are not in Singapore, we have limited means. If the person is a Singapore citizen, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of extradition laws, we would try to extradite him. If he is a foreign person, non-citizen, living overseas, we can only prosecute him in absentia and hope that he comes here and visits us some time in the future.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Objective</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed National Parks Bill 1996 seeks to merge the National Parks Board and the Parks and Recreation Department into a single statutory board.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Background</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, the National Parks Board was formed through the merger of the Nature Reserves Board and the Botanic Gardens Division of the Parks and Recreation Department . The rationale then was to give management focus to our heritage parks, namely, the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the Fort Canning Park and the Nature Reserves. Their potential for recreation, conservation, research and education would therefore be better realised.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Rationale</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this goal has been achieved. The National Parks Board has successfully integrated the heritage parks and nature reserves to complement one another as
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> conservation and recreation resources for Singaporeans and tourists. In the process, it has also developed specialist expertise in park management and has established active education and public outreach programmes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore now opportune to integrate the work of the National Parks Board with that of the Parks and Recreation Department to capitalise on their accumulated expertise. As a single statutory board, their combined expertise in park development, horticulture and amenity management, will allow the new Board to serve the public better. There will be synergy and greater cost effectiveness in the use of resources as the core businesses of the Parks and Recreation Department and the National Parks Board are complementary.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Mission and roles of the New National Parks Board</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission of the new Board will be to improve the quality of life for Singaporeans by enhancing and managing the parks and greenery of our Garden City. The new Board will continue to carry out the functions presently undertaken by both the Parks and Recreation Department and the present National Parks Board. However, the new Board will now place greater efforts in improving its park management systems. It will also seek to be more creative and enterprising. It will explore new ways to improve park features and amenities.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Legislation</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now elaborate on the Bill. The Bills seeks to reconstitute the National Parks Board. Although it is based on the existing National Parks Act, it repeals the present Act and replaces it as there is extensive rearrangement of the individual clauses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill provides for the reconstitution of the National Parks Board. Specifically, clause 3 provides for the continued existence of the present Board. Present assets and liabilities of the Board
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> therefore remain with it. This will also allow the present Board to continue when the Bill comes into force.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions and powers of the Board are contained in Part III and are drawn from the functions of the current National Parks Board and the Parks and Recreation Department.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV and Part V of the Bill relate to staff and financial matters. They are based on existing provisions that the current Board has to comply with.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bill provides for the transfer of movable property, assets, liabilities, and employees from the Parks and Recreation Department to the Board.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII provides for the establishment of national parks and nature reserves. It also defines the activities that are prohibited in national parks, nature reserves or green areas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII contains miscellaneous provisions. These define the powers of the Board to carry out its duties as well as provide for consequential amendments to the Parks and Trees Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Conclusion</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the parks, gardens and greenery of Singapore are a source of pride for Singaporeans. They enhance Singapore's reputation as a tropical city of excellence and as one that takes the management of its natural environment seriously. By bringing together the wealth of experience of the Parks and Recreation Department and the technical and managerial expertise of the National Parks Board, we will be able to build upon the achievements of the past 30 years and continue to develop Singapore as a Garden City.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> The proposal by the Minister is a good measure administratively. However, I have one concern. Basically it is a merger of two organisations with very different cultures. If you look at the National Parks
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Board's organisation, I think its mandate and mission is to leave nature as it is, ie, as little interference as possible, and perhaps do not do anything and let nature take its own course within a park, whereas the Parks and Recreation Department is a completely different organisation. It is concerned with horticulture, and basically as much human interference as possible, like landscaping, planting trees, and so on. I am a bit concerned about the type of approach the merged organisation will adopt, and I hope the Minister can address my concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Ministry in part shares his concern and that is why we are doing this merger in two steps. As Members will remember, we merged the Nature Reserves Board with the Singapore Botanic Gardens in 1990. At that time, if we were to merge the Nature Reserves Board with the Parks and Recreation Department, I think it would have been a very major step and the Nature Reserves Board, being such a small board, would be overwhelmed by the Parks and Recreation Department, and its expertise and direction could well be overwhelmed by the day-to-day maintenance function of the Parks and Recreation Department. That is why we did it in two steps. We combined the Nature Reserves Board with Singapore Botanic Gardens which has the same focus as the Nature Reserves Board -- conservation of our green heritage. That has been successfully done and we are now confident that the organisational culture of the two organisations is now closer together and we are confident that with this merger, the focus of the National Parks Board will not be overwhelmed by the Parks and Recreation Department.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -- [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.

   <b>PURCHASE OF PROPERTIES BY SENIOR MINISTER</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER BG LEE HSIEN LOONG</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me retrace the steps to explain how the purchase of properties by SM and DPM Lee became a public issue, and why we are debating this subject here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drafted this statement before reading reports of HPL Managing Director Ong Beng Seng's press conference yesterday. I have not altered my statement to take into account the additional information now available, as it was not known to me when I investigated Senior Minister's and DPM Lee's purchases. The additional information, however, confirmed my conclusion that there was no impropriety in SM's and DPM's purchases of units in Nassim Jade and Scotts 28.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st March 1996, after the Budget debate, Finance Minister Richard Hu saw me. The Deputy Managing Director of MAS, Koh Beng Seng, had reported to him that Hotel Properties Ltd (HPL) had sought and obtained waiver from the SES
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to seek shareholders' approval for SM's purchase of one unit in Scotts 28, and that there was market talk that SM had been offered units in all the property projects of the HPL group. The next day, I kept Tony Tan, Jayakumar and Wong Kan Seng informed of the matter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind, I never doubted the integrity of Senior Minister. I have worked with him for 20 years. Over a long period, a person gets to know the thinking and, more important, the character of another man. He has given his whole life to build this country and the whole world knows us for our reputation for being clean.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as Prime Minister, I had to verify the market talk to protect the reputation of the Government. If the market perception of impropriety was wrong, it had to be dispelled. If it was true, it had to be further pursued.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I instructed Richard Hu to ask SES to get HPL to provide the lists of purchasers of Nassim Jade and Scotts 28, the prices, and discounts given, if any. These were the two HPL developments then in the news. I also asked him whether SES had made an exception by granting the Senior Minister a waiver from seeking shareholders' approval to buy a unit in Scotts 28 as a sibling of a director.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS replied that it was normal for SES to give waivers to related parties with independent means. I learnt later that HPL applied for the waiver without Senior Minister's knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lists showed that Senior Minister and also DPM Lee had, indeed, bought one unit each in Nassim Jade and Scotts 28. On 26th March, I queried DPM Lee about his properties in Nassim Jade and Scotts 28. There was no rule requiring Ministers to declare to me their purchases of properties at the time of purchase.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM was taken aback when I told him of public perception over his and SM's purchases of condominium units from HPL. He wrote to me immediately to declare the units he bought and the prices paid. Later, he found out the discounts he received, 12% for the Nassim Jade unit and 5% for the Scotts 28 unit, and declared them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 28th March, after a Cabinet meeting, I discussed his purchases with Tony Tan, Jayakumar, Richard Hu and Wong Kan Seng, with DPM Lee present. I will not go into the details of DPM Lee's explanation. He will do this himself later.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point, I had not spoken to Senior Minister yet because of his medical condition. I was troubled having to query him regarding his purchases because he had just undergone his second angioplasty to insert a stent into his blocked artery. He had just left the hospital and was recuperating at home. He was on several medications, including one to prevent any blood clots from forming. I was not comfortable about having to question him in that state.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consulted Tony Tan, Jayakumar and Wong Kan Seng. They agreed that I had to query SM regarding his purchases, despite his medical condition, given the market rumour about his and DPM's purchases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then wrote on 29th March to Senior Minister at home about his purchases. I also asked him to see me as soon as he could come to office. He replied the next day, giving salient information about his purchases. He came to my office on Monday, 1st April, to find out what it was all about.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SM was perplexed that there should be questions about the propriety of his purchases. He was not angry, annoyed, or dismayed, but perplexed. I explained that there was public perception of impropriety and I had to satisfy myself that he and DPM Lee received no favours, since discounts were given on their purchases. He answered my questions readily, and explained the circumstances of his and Loong's purchases. We met a couple of times more, at the end of which he offered to have a Commission of Inquiry to look into his purchases, if I was still not satisfied with his explanation. He will make a statement later regarding his purchases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Senior Minister. I also know Loong well. Loong has worked for me for more than 15 years. First, as a young officer in the SAF; later, as a colleague in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> my Cabinet and now, as my Deputy Prime Minister. I know his character and his integrity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe SM's and DPM's accounts of how they came to buy the properties at Nassim Jade and Scotts 28. They were open, they answered my questions readily, and they were prepared to have their purchases scrutinised by the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the circumstances of SM's and DPM's purchases, I had the benefit of hindsight information provided by HPL on the prices paid by other buyers, and the discounts given to them. This information was not available to SM and DPM at the time they made the purchases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SM and DPM were not the only ones to be given discounts. For Nassim Jade, HPL had offered the 7% discount and higher to eight buyers, including SM and DPM Lee. This works out to about one-fifth of the total number of units in Nassim Jade. The 7% discount given to SM was not exceptional. The 12% discount given to DPM was, but DPM gave me an explanation which I accepted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Scotts 28, HPL offered the 5% discount to some 30 other buyers. This is also about one-fifth of the total number of units in Scotts 28. There was nothing exceptional in the discounts received by SM and DPM Lee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also checked how developers market their properties. I learnt that discounts for early buyers and in soft launches are standard practices. These discounts are part of developers' marketing strategy, a way to test out the market. Developers set a higher list price, and then offer discounts from this. Later, depending on the response from buyers, they either increase or decrease the discounts for the rest of the units. Towards the end of the project, developers also offer larger discounts on remnant units which prove unpopular or difficult to sell.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I investigated SM's and DPM's purchases together with the Minister for Finance and Koh Beng Seng, Deputy
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Managing Director of MAS. Throughout, I kept Tony Tan, Jayakumar and Wong Kan Seng informed. Later, I discussed it in Cabinet.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPIB had also received two anonymous letters of complaints on HPL's method of `soft launch' of its properties. But as no corruption was alleged, it referred the letters to MAS.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS and SES had investigated HPL regarding its conduct over the sales of its properties to directors and related parties for possible wrongdoing. They found that HPL had not breached any laws or rules. But SES decided to criticise HPL for being late in seeking shareholders' approval of certain purchases by two of its directors and related parties. It issued a statement on 23rd April. SES had no problem with HPL's handling of SM's and DPM's purchases. In these purchases, SM was a related party, but DPM was not, so DPM's purchase did not have to be reported to SES at all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After SES had issued its statement, SM and DPM decided to bring their purchases and the discounts they received, into the open, to be scrutinised by the public. They issued a statement on 24th April, a day after the SES statement, stating their purchases and the discounts they had received.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SM's and DPM's statement caused quite a stir. The press asked me for my reaction. On 26th April, I issued a statement that I was satisfied that there had been no impropriety on the part of SM and DPM Lee in their purchases of units in Nassim Jade and Scotts 28. I had reached the conclusion based on my investigation together with the Finance Minister and MAS, the accounts given by SM and DPM Lee, and my judgement of the men and the facts of the case. However, SM and DPM Lee asked me to arrange this debate so that they could publicly explain and be questioned on the circumstances of their purchases. I agreed to this -- to put the transactions of SM and DPM as well as my judgement on them to public scrutiny.

  <div align="center">
   <b>AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER BG LEE HSIEN LOONG</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has just recounted the sequence of events which started from a MAS report I received in March this year from Mr Koh Beng Seng, Deputy Managing Director of MAS in charge of financial institutions in Singapore. This report ultimately led to today's debate. As I was intimately involved, I believe it will be helpful to the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> House if I gave an account of how the investigations evolved and my own conclusions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Mr Koh's responsibilities is to keep me informed of developments which will have impact on our financial markets. Around mid-March, he received reports that there was widespread market talk that Senior Minister and members of his family had purchased units in all HPL developments, with the suggestion that it involved some sort of cozy arrangement. This was immediately reported to me as the implications were very serious, as Senior Minister was involved and HPL was a listed public company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS routinely investigates market rumours of this type. But as this case involved Senior Minister, the Prime Minister had to be informed. The PM's instructions were specific - investigate and report. The rumours could not be allowed to fester, lest it undermined the integrity of the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around this time, there were also press reports of minority shareholders' unhappiness over HPL's handling of the sale of Nassim Jade. As HPL was a listed company, the case began to take on wider implications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two parts to the investigation. Firstly, we had to establish whether HPL had done anything illegal or had violated any SES regulations in its handling of the sale of units at Nassim Jade. Secondly, the rumours linking Senior Minister to purchases of HPL properties had to be thoroughly investigated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Koh, working through the Stock Exchange, carried out a thorough investigation into HPL's handling of the sales of Nassim Jade and Scotts 28. After tracing through all communications between SES and HPL on Nassim Jade and Scotts 28, the Stock Exchange was satisfied that HPL had not committed any violations of SES regulations nor had the company made any attempt to conceal the purchases by Senior Minister and DPM Lee. All the transactions were above board and properly recorded. The company was however criticised by the Stock Exchange in a public statement issued on 22nd April
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 1996, but the criticism dealt with the company's tardiness in obtaining shareholders' approval for sales to directors. Both Senior Minister and DPM Lee fully endorsed the SES's investigations and its subsequent statement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue linking Senior Minister to HPL through the purchase of its properties, the SES was able to establish, through HPL, that Senior Minister and DPM Lee had indeed purchased units at Nassim Jade and Scotts 28. HPL also provided data on the prices and discounts given for all the units sold at both developments. The information showed that SM and DPM Lee received discounts of 7% and 12% respectively for purchase of units at Nassim Jade and discounts of 5% each for the units at Scotts 28. In the case of Nassim Jade, six other buyers also received 7% discounts, but only DPM Lee was given a 12% discount. This information was reported to the Prime Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister has related, he questioned Senior Minister and DPM Lee on their purchases as the discounts they received appeared to be on the high side. Both SM and DPM Lee were able to satisfy the Prime Minister that their purchases were above board and that there was no impropriety involved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was present at several of the discussions and it became clear to me that the purchases were completely normal. SM and DPM Lee had paid prices which they considered reasonable, but their actions had become entangled with the complex schemes used by developers to price and sell their new developments, involving the use of movable list prices and variable discounts. What we were facing was therefore a public perception problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background, I had recommended to the Prime Minister that Senior Minister and DPM Lee should consider giving back the difference between what they received in discounts and what the public would perceive as normal discounts of around 5% usually given to early-bird buyers. Although Senior
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Minister and DPM Lee had done nothing wrong and were perfectly entitled to keep the discounts, I felt that this gesture would be seen as underlining the fact that they had not sought any special advantages. There was risk, of course, that some would misunderstand the gesture as an admission of wrongdoing, but this was a risk, I thought, worth taking. My feeling was that the public would only focus on the discounts given in the belief that Senior Minister and DPM Lee had received preferential treatment and that this was unfair. As you know, in the end, Senior Minister and DPM Lee both decided to donate all their discounts on their purchases and not just the differentials to charity. This was a generous gesture which I fully support.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have related in some detail on the circumstances which led to today's debate. For those of us who were directly involved in the investigations, it was a wrenching but necessary exercise. I am confident that after today's and tomorrow's debate, the House will agree with me that the integrity and reputation of Senior Minister and DPM Lee has in no way been besmirched. The fact that we are debating the issue at all testifies to the integrity and soundness of the Singapore political system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more personal note, I first came to know Senior Minister and DPM Lee personally when Senior Minister invited me to enter politics in 1984. In these past 12 years, I have come to know them well and to know that the accumulation of personal wealth and its trappings rank very low in their scheme of things. Members may be interested to know that over the years Senior Minister had contributed over $2 million to a variety of charities. Some $1.4 million was from awards received from defamation actions and the remainder was from honorariums and fees he received from lectures and speeches around the world, and from the sales of his book of speeches, photographs and CD-ROMs. DPM Lee has made similar donations to charity from his libel awards. I therefore find it difficult to understand how anyone could believe
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that Senior Minister and DPM Lee would use their positions to gain unfair advantage in the purchase of properties.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I entered politics in 1984. At the time I was elected to Parliament, I already owned two apartments which my parents had helped me to buy many years earlier. I had lived in one of them since I got married in 1978 and started my own family. My wife had died in 1982. Three years later, in 1985, I remarried. I was then Minister of State. The next year, my wife and I started looking for a bigger house, because we intended to have more children. She hunted around. We found one. I bought a house with my parents' support and I have lived in it for the last nine years. After 1986, neither my wife nor I have bought or sold any properties until last year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 1992, I discovered that I had lymphoma and began chemotherapy. I again started looking for a property to buy. My four children were then very young, aged between 3 and 11 years old. I had some savings, including in the CPF, and I wanted to invest them prudently, that means more than 3% interest from the CPF, so that if anything happened to me, my family would be well looked after. And my parents offered to help me out financially when I found a suitable property or properties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to put the money into property in Singapore rather than to buy shares or overseas assets. Because I was confident that with good Government, Singapore properties would appreciate steadily over the long term, and good Government was something which I could have a part in ensuring for Singapore. I decided against investing in shares because my wife did not want to manage a portfolio of shares and neither did I. Furthermore, I was a Cabinet Minister, moreover one responsible for economic policy and for me to have been trading actively in shares would have been very awkward.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my wife scanned the classified advertisements and visited possible properties. On weekends, she went to open

  <br> houses. She also drove around to look for signboards for new developments. When she spotted any possibilities, she would make discreet telephone enquiries using her maiden name. I told her some developers might know her maiden name. She said she called herself "Ms Ho". There are many Ms Hos. If the property was promising, she would do more groundwork, checking on the prices, the developer's reputation, etc. and only when she was reasonably satisfied, then she would get me to go and take a look. I went with her once or twice in 1993. Of course, once I go, the cover is blown. But I do not go unless we are reasonably serious.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, after looking at many possibilities, we did not buy. The main reason was that we felt that the prices were very high. Little did we know what was going to happen afterwards. We thought that the market would correct. We kept our options open by reviewing possible properties from time to time, in 1994-95, but nothing much happened. Nevertheless, word that we were interested in buying properties rapidly spread. Regularly, we heard rumours of us moving to new homes. Friends and colleagues asked us whether we had bought properties at various places, some of which we had visited, some of which we had never heard of. We therefore knew that when we finally made a purchase, it would be the subject of considerable public interest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1995, I learnt from my mother that Hotel Properties Limited (HPL) was developing a small property called Nassim Jade. My wife thought it would be a good investment because Four Seasons Park, which was also developed by HPL, had a good reputation for quality. My mother told me to get in touch with Mrs Pamelia Lee for more details. Mrs Pamelia Lee is the wife of my uncle, Dr Lee Suan Yew. She is a close family member, who gave quite a bit of support to my children when they were younger, especially before I got remarried. She had also given my wife some leads previously when she went house hunting. Later on, we met Dr and Mrs Lee socially and we confirmed our interest in buying a unit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother sent me a brochure on Nassim Jade, together with a price list and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> information on some of the units which were available. Because we were not sure which of these units would still be available by the time we booked, my wife and I shortlisted and ranked nine possible units. There were only 39 in the whole development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A day or two later, my wife learnt, either directly from HPL or through Mrs Pamelia Lee -- we cannot remember now, and we cannot pin it down -- that none of the units we had selected were available. Instead, HPL offered her one other unit, #02-06. She was also informed that there was a 7% discount. The price, net of discount, was given as $3,570,100.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read this morning in the newspapers that Mr Ong Beng Seng, the Managing Director of HPL, had said at the press conference yesterday, that HPL had not issued any price lists for Nassim Jade. I was surprised because I had received such a price list for Nassim Jade, although not for Scotts 28. The price list had come together with the brochure from my mother. I can only surmise that the HPL staff had made a mistake, and gave the list to my mother when she visited the HPL office, because when I received another copy of the brochure from Mrs Pamelia Lee, there was no price list inside. There could be other explanations. It is not a major point.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and I agreed to this unit and this price without bargaining. Having spent more than two years looking for a property without any result, we had decided to buy a property soon. We had also reluctantly concluded that property prices were unlikely to fall, even though we had considered them to be too high for a long time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not consider the 7% discount in any way significant. We knew that developers routinely gave discounts from the nominal list price. Per square foot my discounted price was $1,658, much higher than most other condominiums in the vicinity, or for that matter in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Mrs Pamelia Lee telephoned at home. I picked up the phone.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> She had a message from Mr Ong Beng Seng. He had told her that HPL had already committed unit #02-06 to another buyer. He requested her to ask me if I would agree to change to another unit, #02-07. This was bigger than #02-06 and would cost $75,000 more, which is $3,645,100. He quoted the price in dollars, for the total sum. No discount percentages were mentioned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I immediately replied that I accepted. I did not bargain. Subsequently, I told my wife, and she agreed with my decision. #02-07 was also not one of the units on our original shortlist. The new price worked out to $1,565 per square foot, still very high. But my wife felt that it was reasonable, using the Four Seasons Park prices as her benchmark. We did not calculate the percentage of the discount because this was not a factor in our decision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, I instructed my lawyer, Miss Kwa Kim Li of Lee &amp; Lee, that I had agreed to purchase unit #02-07 instead of unit #02-06. My wife and I put the unit in our joint names. When we signed the sale and purchase agreement, Lee &amp; Lee lodged the usual caveat against the property in the Land Registry, setting out our names and the purchase price, to give notice of our interests in the flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither I nor my wife visited the Nassim Jade site or HPL's office. Throughout this transaction, I never met or talked to any of HPL's directors or managers, except for Dr Lee Suan Yew and Mrs Pamelia Lee, as I have recounted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 1995, I learnt about Scotts 28 from my mother. I was still looking out for an apartment to invest in one more apartment. My four children are now between 7 and 15 years old. They all read, even the youngest one. But they are all different, with different personalities and needs. My eldest son is studying at the Singapore School for the Visually Handicapped. He is taking his PSLE this year. My wife and I had discussed this often, and had decided to buy one more property to make some specific trust arrangements for our children for part of my assets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother sent me the brochure, which she had obtained through Miss Kwa Kim
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Li. I asked Miss Kwa to book one unit. I accepted the unit HPL offered, at their offer price, which was $2,776,400, which I considered reasonable. No discount was mentioned. It worked out to $1,365 per square foot.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, I signed the sale and purchase agreement, and again I put the unit in the joint names of my wife and me. My lawyer filed two caveats in the Land Registry, one when HPL gave me the option form, and another when we signed the sale and purchase agreement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This entire transaction was done through my lawyer. My wife and I had no contact whatsoever with any of HPL's directors or staff on this matter. Neither have we visited the Scotts 28 site. Dr Lee Suan Yew and Mrs Pamelia Lee were completely not involved in this second transaction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter rested there until March 1996 when the Stock Exchange was investigating HPL. The Prime Minister then asked me whether I had bought properties in Nassim Jade and Scotts 28. I told him I had and the prices I paid. The Prime Minister then asked me what discounts I received. I did not know. So I looked up my files, and calculated, based on the price I had agreed to for Nassim Jade, and the old price list that I had, that HPL had given me a discount of 12%. This was when I first became aware that the discount had been 12%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Scotts 28, I looked up my records, but I could find no record of any list price or any mention of any discount from the list price. So on 1st April 1996, I asked my lawyer whether she knew. She said that she was not aware of any discount or published list price. However, she did not think that the price I had paid was special.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwa Kim Li explained to me that when Senior Minister and I had bought the Scotts 28 units, she had decided to check that the prices we were paying were reasonable. Lee &amp; Lee had acted for other buyers above and below our units, and also for buyers of different types of units in the same development. She had compared the prices, and found them all fairly consistent, with regular increases for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> each higher level, which is the standard practice. She had not told us about this at the time, as it was not her duty as solicitor to check the pricing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I asked her to check with HPL. She did, and I read her account. This is a note which she has given me:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On 1st April 96, Lee Hsien Loong phoned me to ask whether he was given a discount when he purchased unit #19-05 [This is in Scotts 28], and if he was, what was the quantum of the discount. I replied that I was not aware that the discount was given. He instructed me to ask Mr Thio, which I did. [Mr Thio is Mr Thio Gim Hock of HPL]. Mr Thio informed me on 1st April 1996, that generally all buyers in the 136-unit project received discounts. About 35 purchasers received 5% discount, of whom Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong were two. This was the first time that I, and thus my clients, learnt that they had received the 5% discount. I also asked Mr Thio whether there was a list price of all the units made public at the time of the launch in October 95, as some developers had, so that buyers could, on their own, calculate the discounts that they were given. He said that there was no list price available to the public. I then asked how a purchaser could have known whether the price he was paying was discounted. He replied that there was no way a purchaser could know whether he was getting a discount and, if so, what discount he was getting, unless the developer informed him.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing secret about our purchases at Nassim Jade and Scotts 28. My wife and I put the properties in our joint names. We made no attempt to conceal these purchases. Information about them were available to the public through caveats lodged in the Land Registry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I regularly received letters in the mail addressed to me by name at my home telling me, "Dear Mr Lee, I understand you own a unit at Nassim Jade. I have buyers available. If you are interested, please contact me at the following telephone number, pager." I just threw them into the wastepaper basket. I bought these properties not for speculation, but as long term investments to provide for my family.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I bought the units, I did not know what HPL was charging the other buyers, or what discounts HPL was offering other people, least of all, could I tell what HPL would charge or give to buyers who came after me. The high prices I was paying gave me no reason to believe that HPL was offering me special terms. In fact, my
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> concern was that I was paying too much, not too little. I assumed that HPL was charging me what it was charging other buyers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HPL's press statement and press conference yesterday, explaining how it priced and sold the units at Nassim Jade and at Scotts 28, confirmed that they had treated their sales to me on a purely commercial basis. But as the Prime Minister said, that is ex-post information. What I had was ex-ante information. At the time I had to judge based on what they had offered me.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we became aware of the speculation and rumours about the properties we had purchased, the Senior Minister and I decided to bring the matter out into the open through a public statement. To have remained silent would have given the wrong impression that we had something to hide, or to be ashamed of.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Prime Minister announced that in future Ministers should first clear their property purchases, together with any known discounts, with him, we decided to give the discounts we had received to the Government. We wanted to put the matter beyond doubt that the Prime Minister would have approved our purchases under the new rules, had these new rules been in place earlier. In other words, we were voluntarily and retrospectively subjecting ourselves to the new rules which came into effect after the event.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has since asked the Accountant-General to return our cheques. The Senior Minister and I have decided to give the money to charity, to underline our position that we had never asked for the discounts and did not purchase the properties because of them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have recounted how I bought the units at Nassim Jade and Scotts 28. I have also told Members about the other properties which I had previously bought, so that Members will know the background and the circumstances of my purchases at Nassim Jade and Scotts 28. Really, these are private matters which I have no obligation to disclose publicly. But I have
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> explained them to dispel any lingering mystery or doubt over my purchases at Nassim Jade and Scotts 28.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high standard of honesty and integrity which the PAP has established is one of Singapore's most precious assets. It is a system which I grew up with, and which I value. As a Cabinet Minister, I am all the more conscious of my duty to uphold these standards, and to set the tone, by example, for what constitutes proper conduct on the part of political leaders and public officers. My moral authority depends on that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore grateful for this opportunity to explain the facts of my two property purchases last year, and to answer Members' questions on this matter.

  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Senior Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was recovering from my second angioplasty and stent operation when this issue of my purchases of two properties from HPL arose. At that time, I was under three different medications and was somewhat fragile. Literally fragile as those on three blood thinners can attest. I could not meet the press. So I issued, the next best thing, press statements. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> press statement is not me. It is just a few words. It is not satisfactory because I have to meet you in person, tell you the facts and give you an opportunity to decide whether you think I have become a different person. And this is my first opportunity to do so. I am not in my best form because it is only nine weeks since my stent operation and my doctors have said, keep the heart rates steady in case the wires are not completely covered. But I feel fine and I intend to give you as robust an explanation in as robust a manner as you would expect of me. There is also the problem of jet lag. I am still on New York time. But I think, factor all that in, you will find that I am not as much as I used to be.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state the circumstances I, or rather my wife, came to buy one unit each at Nassim Jade and Scotts 28, developed by HPL. In April 1995, my brother, Dr Lee Suan Yew, rang up my wife. She was out. She returned the call. My brother's wife, Mrs Pamelia Lee took the call and told her about a small development called Nassim Jade in Nassim Road. My wife had wanted to buy a property for some time and she had been to see some bungalows (three bungalows) that were on the market but did not like them. So she decided to consider an apartment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She visited HPL's office with Mrs Pamelia Lee and chose a flat next to my brother's, relying on Pamelia Lee's judgment that she would have chosen a good aspect or a good prospect. Mr Thio Gim Hock of HPL, in the presence of Mrs Pamelia Lee, quoted her a lump sum price, saying it was a discounted price, did not mention any discount percentages or the undiscounted price. My wife knew that discounts meant little because developers regularly give discounts on their listed prices. Having acted as a lawyer for developers, she knew the way they marketed and their practice was to quote a high listed price, and give discounts which they vary according to the buyers and whether the market was going up or down. For the developer to have to lower the listed price because of poor sales would have made his earlier buyers feel cheated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore she focused on the actual price, not the discount, as she always
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> does. She agreed to it without bargaining, assuming that it was more or less what my brother Dr Lee has paid for their adjacent flat, because when the price was quoted Mrs Pamelia Lee was with her. So she assumed that she would not be given a price which would be fantastically above Mrs Pamelia Lee's. My wife was also confident that Mrs Pamelia Lee would have investigated condominium prices in that area and found it reasonable. She knew also that the wife of Mr Tan Kok Quan, a lawyer in Lee &amp; Lee, where she was a partner, had bought, and was living in one of the flats in HPL's Four Seasons Park and she had heard good reports of its workmanship and finishes. And this report of good workmanship and good finishes was confirmed by one of her other friends who had bought a flat in Four Seasons Park.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pamelia Lee had chosen a flat on the second floor. My wife chose the adjoining flat on the same floor. I am saying this because I have had a discussion with several older Members of the PAP, and my natural instinct is to come out and say, "I take you on the argument." But Mr Dhanabalan told me it is better to let people know why I actually bought it. So I told my wife, better tell people why we actually bought it. She had in mind our possible future need for a flat after seeing what has happened to my father when he could no longer cope with the stairs and the steps in my old-style three-level bungalow home at Oxley Road, where my bedroom and sitting room are at one level, my dining room and my father's bedroom are at another level, and the kitchen is at a third level, and he had suffered fractures on his arms and legs in the last four to one-and-a-half years when he repeatedly fell. So he had to move, most unhappily, to my brother's home (Dr Lee Suan Yew), where he has a bedroom, a toilet, the dining room and the sitting rooms, all on the same level, and he has not fallen. Of course, this is a distant future consideration, assuming that I reach 93, which is my father's age.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later she told me she had booked the flat in my name because I did not have a property in my name alone and that this would enable us to arrange our assets to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> benefit from the tax laws. I know some MPs feel unhappy when I showed them my draft. They say that is very bad, that is tax evasion. Not at all; it is the business of lawyers and accountants to advise their clients on how to deploy their assets in a way that makes the maximum use of the tax laws. The properties she had bought previously were in her name and some were in our joint names. So I agreed. And that was the first time I knew I was buying some property in Nassim Jade. I do not even know the number.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later HPL sent a form, addressed to me at Oxley Road. I never saw it. My wife took it, handed it to her lawyer, Miss Kwa Kim Li of Lee &amp; Lee, to attend to. When the contract was signed, Lee &amp; Lee lodged a caveat in the Registry of Titles and the purchase price and my name as purchaser was on that caveat. My wife had no further dealings with HPL and all correspondence between Lee &amp; Lee were with HPL's solicitors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchase of Scotts 28 six months later had nothing to do with my brother Dr Lee Suan Yew. In October 1995, my wife learnt that Mrs Pamelia Lee and Miss Kwa Kim Li of Lee &amp; Lee had booked units in another HPL development called Scotts 28. She decided to book one through Kwa Kim Li, relying on the judgments of two shrewd buyers, Pamelia Lee and Kwa Kim Li, and that the price would be reasonable and the finish would be of good quality. She was told a twentieth floor unit, above those booked by these two, was available with a correspondingly higher price. Unlike Nassim Jade, where she had in mind the distant possibility of our living in it one day, Scotts 28 was bought simply for investment, to let out. So she agreed to buy at level twentieth floor, which is popular with foreigners. There was no mention of any discount and indeed Miss Kwa Kim Li was not aware of any discount, as DPM has read from the letter by Miss Kwa Kim Li. She only learnt of the 5% discount in April this year, after DPM asked her to inquire from HPL.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife decided to buy this unit in our joint names, so the option and the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> agreement were in our joint names. And Lee &amp; Lee lodged the usual caveat in the Land Registry, giving our joint names and the price.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At no stage did my wife or I feel that we were doing anything irregular or improper. They were open, above board transactions. Caveats were openly lodged by our solicitors to give notice to everyone. Not all buyers do that. Some buyers do not like their identities to be known and so do not lodge caveats, preferring to run the risk of not protecting their property from a subsequent sale to some other person. These caveats gave my name as purchaser of the Nassim Jade unit at the price of $3,578,260 and for Scotts 28 unit at the price of $2,791,500. If my wife or I had thought that there was anything improper in buying the properties because my brother was a non-executive director of HPL, she would not have proceeded with the business. She expected all legal procedures and permission to be obtained as a matter of course.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I digress here and take a point which I think has arisen since this case has come up? I met two editors of our major English and Chinese newspapers - Cheong Yip Seng of the Straits Times and Lim Jim Koon of Zaobao - to ask them: what is the issue? And their answer was, it is not a question of legality. Nobody doubts it is legal. They are satisfied. It is a question of equity or fairness. People outside say that I have the inside track. My son has the inside track. Ministers have the inside track. Permanent Secretaries, MPs have the inside track, and you get invited to soft launches. They queue outside, and sometimes pay hundreds of dollars to get someone to queue for them, or sell their place in the queue for hundreds of dollars.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess that one of the disadvantages of age is that I do not keep track of these passing frenzies, manias and panics. I know from time to time the property market goes in oscillation. This was oscillating too high. So I think it is useful if, besides arguing the legality which I think any lawyer in this House will know, or any person with any developer experience will know is beyond question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain from my point of view the problem of the inside track -- the sense of fairness or equality. It is the Government's duty to have a level playing field. When the Government sells land for development, it is an open tender system. When the Government sells houses, HDB, HUDC, individual bungalows, or groups of houses, for redevelopment it is by open tender. We are the Government and not all governments do that, but the Singapore Government wisely does that and has benefitted from it. It has built confidence among all investors, locals and foreigners. But let me add that private property is not sold by the Government. The Government is going into Executive Condominiums and that will have to be a level playing field.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But private corporations, private companies, private businessmen conduct their business to get the maximum advantage, the maximum profits. Hence, if they can get their product, whether a tennis racket or a golf stick, or a cap, or jogging shoes, or running shoes, worn by you and seen on television at the Olympics, or at the US Open, or Wimbledon, then thousands of others buy them. It is unfair, totally unfair. The No. 2 who gets beaten at Wimbledon gets a very small fraction of the No. 1. So they sweat their guts out to be No. 1.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports and TV stars are valuable, not because the sports maker thinks well of the sportsmen. He wants to sell his product. And having it used by a star well-known throughout the world, adds value to the product. Sellers want customers who are celebrities or, otherwise depending on the product, well-known and admired public people. So you see Mr Chiam had to sue a restaurant because they said that he ate at that restaurant. I do not know whether the food was good or bad, but Mr Chiam objected strenuously. He is not unknown. I am sure, if he were unknown, the judge would have given him a pittance, but he is Chiam See Tong with a record of many years in public life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way -- and I say this with some sympathy for the young aspiring professionals or young executives -- for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> them to have the same value to a seller of a product as a well-known public figure, or a sports star, or a TV star. And it is not just well-known publicly, even well-known privately makes a difference.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks have got prime lending rates. You always see them in MAS reports, prime 6% today, tomorrow 6.25%. You try and get a loan at prime rate. You will find it is prime plus 3%, or prime plus 4%, depending on how the manager assesses you, not only whether you look a nice handsome young man, but what is your background, what are your assets, what kind of a record you have got, are you likely to default, how long will it take you to earn that money, and it varies with the standing of each customer, the length of association with the bank and, most of all, the likelihood of that customer bringing in more business in the long run. So when Rupert Murdoch, his News Corporation, was on the brink of bankruptcy in the 1980s, I met the man who helped him convince the bankers to back him. Feed him with more money, have trust in his judgment, sink more money and risk the loss of everything, but a very good chance that this man with his judgment, his knowledge, will turn it around and you will get all your money back plus. They had a team of bankers, worked it out and several big banks with thousands of millions of dollars worth at risk, listened carefully, studied the figures and, finally, had to judge, "You, Rupert Murdoch, rose from one Australian newspaper in Melbourne to own the biggest number of newspapers in Australia, crossed over to London, captured the major newspapers there, became more ambitious, London was too small, went to New York, bought up big papers, went to Hollywood to buy Fox Studios." He was on the brink of collapse. But his personality, the hard-headedness of the offers and the schemes put up by his bankers, and they backed him. And today, News Corporation is the biggest in the world and they all got their money back. No government would have dared take that risk. But that is what an entrepreneur is supposed to do, an entrepreneur bank takes risk and the final risk is: what is the quality of that man?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate in my own very small way. My being me helped me get, if you
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> like, the inside track and special treatment. I was diagnosed on 10th March, after my stress test, as having my coronary artery reblocked after eight weeks. I could see my cardiologist's face, Dr Arthur Tan. He was glum. His reputation was at stake. What to do? I had two other cardiologists whom I had carefully chosen after going through all the cardiologists: Low Lip Pin, former Head of NUH, Cardiology; Maurice Choo, also Head of Cardiology, NUH. But they did not do that angioplasty. They were just advising. So they were less in danger of their reputation. They said, "Can you excuse us?" I thought, "Oh dear! This is trouble." So they went out. Ten minutes, or 15 minutes, seemed quite a long time to me. They came back. They said the options were: do another angioplasty. I said what was the chance. They said, "This is again the same problem. 30% to 40% chance it will restenose. But it might not restenose. Or we put a stent in." And they explained it to me. I said, "Well, what?" Of course, it is a higher risk and the blood may clot along the stent and some people get shocks, and so on. Arthur Tan said, "I have done the best I could the first time. So I cannot do better than the first time." So I said, "All right. We will have to consider a stent."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Lip Ping said, "There is a stent specialist who is coming to have a seminar tomorrow, a Dr Richard Schatz." This was Saturday. Sunday, Dr Richard Schatz was coming to have a seminar at the Raffles Hotel. He is the man who invented one of the stents used called a Palmaz-Schatz stent. Maybe, we persuade him to do you. He has done thousands, Arthur Tan had done 120, Low Lip Ping had done 100 and something, Maurice Choo had done 100 and something. So I said, "All right, we try."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur Tan waited for him at the Airport and he arrived at 12.00 midnight. He came, explained to him what happened the first time and showed him the film, "Will you stay and do my patient?" He said, "I have a full schedule. But if you like, when we finish the seminar early at 12.00 o'clock, I will have lunch, we will have it done at 2.00 o'clock. It takes 2-2 1/2 hours."
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> So he rung me up, by this time, it was half-past one in the morning. He came to see me at my home. I was wide awake, waiting to know what was going to happen. And I was shocked when I saw him, because he was haggard. I said, "What's happening to you, Arthur?" He said, "I've been running around trying to get this operating theatre ready, all the anesthetists and surgeons on stand-by." I said, "Look, have a glass of water first." After I heard him, I said, "If you were me, and you were having this operation, would you go on that table at 2 o'clock and be operated upon by a man who has arrived from California, 15 hours time difference, going to have a seminar next morning, finish the seminar and come in to do me?" He took a deep breath and said, "No, I will have elective procedure." I said, "Yes, so would I. You tell him, thank you very much. If he would come back when things are normal and we have no rushing around, surgeons and stand-by anaesthetists on a Sunday afternoon, then we will do it. Otherwise, we proceed with what we have here."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my cardiologists were also experienced men of the world. Between the time he left Dr Schatz at 1.15 am, to see me at 1.30 in the morning, they decided to get the owners of the stent who had arranged for this seminar, Johnson &amp; Johnson. And they said to him, "Mr Lee Kuan Yew would be using one of your stents if Dr Schatz were able to come back." Dr Schatz may not know the commercial considerations but the Johnson &amp; Johnson representative in Singapore saw the point of having a stent put in the coronary artery of someone who is well-known, liked by some, disliked intensely by others but, whatever it is, well-known and not just in Singapore. So in those few hours, messages or faxes to and fro, by the next morning, it was agreed that Dr Schatz would come back on Friday, 15th March, after he had finished all his operations and do me in the afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it fair? You can be the top executive. He would not have come back. You will have to go to San Diego and you will have to find a slot. But I am me. After 44 years of public life since my first postmen's strike in 1952, there was some added
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> value to this stent if I have got one in my coronary artery and it is alive! It is not a level playing field.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to Williamsburg this time to meet the top 100 American CEOs at a conference of the US Business Council, it so happened that at a dinner, I sat next to a Mrs Larson and my wife sat next to a Mr Larson, and he is the Chief Executive Officer of Johnson &amp; Johnson. And he was very pleased that I was healthy and I was very pleased that his stent had helped me stay healthy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to the pressmen and they thought that I should explain it to the young professionals so that they would understand that they could never expect a level playing field, because if they were businessmen and they were entrepreneurs, they would do exactly what Johnson &amp; Johnson would do.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will start off before I was Prime Minister. Of course, I was already Leader of the Opposition and by March 1959, it was quite clear that there was every possibility that the PAP would win the elections in April or May and I would become the first Prime Minister. So my wife and I decided that if we bought a Mercedes Benz after I became Prime Minister, that would be a problem. People would say, "There you are, Prime Minister, highly paid, buys a Mercedes Benz." So she said, "No, better buy it on Lee &amp; Lee's income." Mercedes Benzes even then were prized possessions. So I bought one from Cycle &amp; Carriage, the Chua family, and they gave very, very small discounts, because it was in hot demand. They were doing you a favour to sell you a Mercedes Benz. When I took mine and they sent me the bill - my wife keeps these bills and she was very angry with all this that is going on - and she has produced me the bill: Cycle &amp; Carriage, 9th March 1959, one new Mercedes Benz 220S Saloon, $12,985. Now it is $200,000-$300,000. I do not know. Less 121/2% discount, $1,623.12. I was not an ordinary customer. I knew the family, but that is not the reason they gave me this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of May when I won the elections, on the Monday morning after that, I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> went to see the Governor at Government House. He asked me to form the first government. When I drove out from Government House in my Mercedes, SS 6566 - for 4-digit - that car with me at the driving wheel and all the pressmen around had been captured in the annual report of that year and is in my book which Lianhe Zaobao had produced. I am now on the international advisory board of Daimler Benz which includes Mercedes Benz. If they knew that I was going to use that, they would have given me a 330 model, not a 220 model.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let us be a little realistic and do not expect that the Government can force the private sector to give the professionals a level playing field. No. It is their business. They want to get the best customer that will help them sell the product and add value. I ask all of you to be honest, including Mr Chiam. He has this experience, I am sure, or he would not have been used for that advertisement. All Ministers who carry weight, all Parliamentary Secretaries, all MPs who are popular, you go to a hawker centre. If they give other customers one egg, they will give you two. I know because when I was campaigning in the 1950s before I was Prime Minister, I used to go to Koek Road, the best char kway teow there, other people for 50 cents got one egg. I got two. I said, "No, don't do this, you lose money." They said, "No, I want you to win."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang cannot be going to the coffeeshop and paying more than the average customers. It is not possible, unless he is going to lose the elections. Mr Chiam must know that in Potong Pasir, he must get a special price. Because the day he stops getting a special price, it is the day he looks for another constituency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stopped buying cars after that Mercedes. I used official cars. In November 1990 I stepped down as Prime Minister and the official car, the Mercedes, went. So I wanted to buy a Lexus and I got hold of Toyota who makes Lexus and a Mr Gaffor, I think his name was, very pleasant man, saw me. He said, "No right hand drive Lexus until 12-18 months. They are concentrating on the American market
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and the Japanese market. When they go to Australia, then I'll get you one, right hand drive." I said, "All right, what have you got?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "Well, I recommend you a Cressida." So I drove the Toyota Cressida around the Istana.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "How much?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "Well, I'll be honest with you, better wait for next year's model. This is already the end of the year. In January-February, we'll be getting a new model and the price will be so and so. We'll give you a 10% or whatever discount. And when we got the Lexus, we'll take it back off you at 10% discount, whatever the condition." Because he wants me to buy that Lexus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I said, "All right, but what happens in the meantime, because I've no car. I've given up my car now."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "If you want to buy now, you'll have to buy last year's model, this one."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "What's the difference?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "It's more jazzed up. It'll have all these extras."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "Never mind, I'll buy last year's model. But what's the price?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "All right, if you are willing to buy last year's model, I will sell you this model as if it is already 1991 with the new model here and discount it." In other words, I bought my Toyota as if the new Toyota model had arrived and I got a few more hundred dollars discount.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said, "I will still buy back kfrom you at 10% below that when the Lexus arrives." It was a deal. He wanted my custom. He wanted me to buy the Lexus. But having got used to the Toyota, had a fairly comfortable ride between Oxley Road and the Istana and to the Botanic Gardens and a few odd places I visited, when the Lexus came, I said, "What is the price?" I totted up the COE price. By that time the COE price had gone up. I said, "Okay, I am staying put with the Toyota." I do not need to impress anybody. If
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> anybody thinks that I am a lesser man because I am using an old model Toyota, well, so I am a lesser man. But that is the way business is done.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even my tailor, my shoemaker. My tailor comes to the office or my home. I send my car and pick him up. It saves me time. Any fitting which is not comfortable he sees on television, he says, "Oh, send back that coat." His reputation is at stake. To unpick and unstitch is a very laborious exercise on blue sandwashed silk. "No trouble", he said. I am his walking model.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My shoemaker, and I have got problems with my feet because I had two operations, one on each, to remove a nerve between the two toes called Morton's Metatarsalgia. I need special shoes, so that they do not hurt. And there is a Hakka-lo, my clansman, off the Old Airport Road, and I worry because he gives me best quality leather, fitting after fitting, and charges me $100-plus. I said, "Look, you embarrass me. You must make a living. You have to live." He says, "No. This leather was the remnant of what was given. It was a big piece which I have. It fits you. You like it. It is all right." So I gave him a copy of my book to show my appreciation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My choice of jogging shoes and my shorts, they are covered in the local press, pictures are taken. They are in the regional media. So whether I have a Nike or New Balance that I use, it is a plus. It adds value. Even when I choose my doctors and my cardiologists, because people know that I would not act foolishly. So when I say my cardiologists are the following three, you can take it as an endorsement of my judgment, if you believe my judgment is sound, or you can say, "No, the man is a fool. He should have taken this doctor." But I think I have taken the best three in Singapore for the time being until new ones grow up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact of life. There is no way for me or my wife having to join a queue to buy a house. All I need do, which I have not done, is to tell my secretary to ring up Mr Ng Teng Fong or Kwek Leng Joo, whom I see for business reasons, not my business, but Government business, their
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> enterprises overseas, and I say I like their development. Even if all the units were sold, they will find one unit for me, surely, and they will compensate that man with a special price at the next best building that they put up. Or Mr Ng Teng Fong would not be Mr Ng Teng Fong. So too Mr Ong Beng Seng. Let us grow up. I am what I am, and I am here after 37 years in office because I have never taken advantage financially of my position. And for $416,000 or $417,000 to go and do something which was improper?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister raised this with me, he said I was puzzled. I was more than puzzled. I was astonished. Why? Because my wife is a very experienced conveyancer, since 1951 when she was in practice, 46 years. Before she retired and became a consultant, she was probably one of the few senior conveyancers in Singapore who knew the mostest. And Eddie Barker, when he had trouble with his drafts in Government, would consult her when he was Minister for Law. She is not a fool. She has conducted her business with my brother and never brought me any embarrassment. Never acted for any petitioner, any client, that required an act of discretion in favour of Lee &amp; Lee and the client. Not necessary. She has enough business. So she protected my position. That is why I have not the slightest problem meeting you, or the people of the press, or the people of Singapore. It is absurd.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until these two purchases in 1995, my wife had stopped buying properties for 14 years, since 1982. When she buys properties, if she acts for the developer, it is normal developer practice, they gave her discount, automatic. Any lawyer will tell you that. It is part of the trade. She does not need to be the Prime Minister's wife to get a discount. She gets it in her own right. She thought that property prices were going up too high and she felt that a strong correction was coming, as has happened in the past. Because she handles old title deeds and she knows that prices go up and down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Korean boom it went up. When the Korean War was over in 1953, rubber went down, property prices went down,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and took some 15 to 20 years to reach those prices. So do not believe that property prices can only go up. We have one mishap, it will hit bottom, because land is immovable, not like stocks, shares, gold, jewellery. One fire across the Strait by accident, the stock market in Taiwan and the property market will just go through the floor. Hong Kong, in sympathetic reaction, because they are part now of greater China, and with these two sources of liquidity gone, and pulling their money and selling their properties here to get cash to go to America, all those who have got properties would wish that they had cash, because they might be able to get them at half price. So please be under no illusions that this is a one-way ticket.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time she bought it, it was going up. But not even Ong Beng Seng knew. If he knew, would he sell? He would have waited for a while. She bought this time last year because I told her, "In spite of the trouble across the Strait, I did not think it will come to an open exchange of fire." I think mainland China wants to grow. They do not want war. They can prevent Taiwan from going independent without war. As you can see from President Lee Teng Hui's speech that you have read today, all they need do is to shake the place and investments disappear. Can you last? You need stability for growth. So I said, "My opinion was that prices would not go back to the level of the 1980s because this time it is not just Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore boom, it is Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand boom. So it is a sustained boom."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take this out into the open because people will say, "Look, my God, the Lees buy properties worth $2.7 million, $3.5 million, $3.8 million without batting an eyelid." And we give up discounts worth $400,000, DPM $700,000 without batting an eyelid. I am not sure whether DPM can do it without batting an eyelid. It is going to hurt him. I have told him, "If it is too painful, let me know." But I can do it without batting an eyelid because my wife can do it without batting an eyelid.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the last 40 years, she had bought other properties, most in her name, some in our joint names. Between
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 1969 and 1974, she bought three in the names of our three children, as gifts to help them set up homes later. She often bought at discounts when they were her clients, which was completely normal practice. I have absolute trust and confidence in her integrity and judgment, and for more than 40 years, she has managed her law practice and her assets. Having dealt with property developers, she knows that if you are a successful property developer, you have to be shrewd, hard-headed and sharp. She has seen them. So she expects them, whether it is Ng Teng Fong, Kwek Hong Png or Ong Beng Seng, to be shrewd, hard-harded and sharp. She did not buy because my brother was a director of the company. She never thought of that point. It is irrelevant. If she wanted to buy, Ong Beng Seng will sell. It is as simple as that. She does not depend on my brother. But my brother made it easy for her, because the wife had chosen one flat and she said okay. My wife is over 70 years old and she does not go around wanting to grow richer and looking at 39 units to see which is the best outlook and which is the best price. She said, "All right, you have chosen this one, I choose the next best one next to you."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every developer in town knows her by her maiden name under which she practises, and they are most likely to offer her the price they give to their best customers, whether it is soft launch, hard launch, or after all sales have been made. She did not bargain because she knew that HPL would oblige. She asked for another 5% discount? Mr Thio would be a little nervous because he has no authority. He will ring up Mr Ong Beng Seng. He says, "5%? Make it 6%." Why not? He has got Mrs Lee Kuan Yew as his customer and better still, out of the blue, she says, "Put it in the name of Lee Kuan Yew."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing under-hand in this. I did him a favour more than any favour he can give me. I saw him for the first time over this deal after we finished Cabinet last Thursday. I told the Prime Minister in the Cabinet and all members of the Cabinet. I said I am going to see Mr Ong Beng Seng to tell him to come out with a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> statement and all the facts before this debate. Let us not argue about the facts. All facts out. He came to see me at seven with Mr Thio Gim Hock and my brother, because he is nervous having to see me. He said, "Sorry. I've got you into trouble." I said, "No, no. Don't worry about that. I will look after myself. Now let me tell you how you had better look after yourself. I can clear myself and I have every confidence my son can clear himself. But you will look a crook if you don't clear yourself because you gave everybody 7% in Nassim Jade but you gave DPM 12%, and that caused Dr Richard Hu to commence the investigations."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had it been 7%, there would have been no investigation because it was open, given to all. But when Richard Hu saw this report from Koh Beng Seng about the 12% discount, and the Lee family has been offered all HPL developments, that is very fishy. He is out to bribe. I am an old man, so bribing me, how many years does it have value? He is a young man of 44, that is a valuable person to bribe. He said, "I have got an explanation." I said, "I don't want to hear it." You put all out in the statement and you are going to meet the press. He said, "Must I meet the press?" I said, "Yes, you can't just have a press statement. You must. Business Times had made a close study of all your prices. They have opened up the Registry and they know exactly what has been sold, what level, to whom, which is the better flat, and so on. So if you start fibbing, you will be in very big trouble. Come out with the truth, you will help yourself. You come out with a clever answer which can be demolished; I come out with the truth; my son, the DPM comes out with the truth; you don't, you are always under a cloud dealing with SES and MAS."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he got the message from me. Yesterday, half an hour before he held his press conference, I met the press, gave them my statement that I had asked him to do this press conference, and the press were all those who knew about the case, including Patrick Daniel of Business Times who had decided to zero in on this case, because it is a big story. I said, "These are the facts, clear them. As long as you like, get the truth from him, because I am
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> going to tell you the truth. I think my son is going to tell you the truth, find out whether he is lying." Hence today's story.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One unfortunate thing happened yesterday. The foreign press wanted to go in and they were not allowed in because he was afraid they will ask him many questions about other things not connected with the sales of Nassim Jade and Scotts 28. So I told my press secretary, who was present at the press conference, "Show them the two-hour video and, if necessary, get Mr Ong Beng Seng to meet them again." There is nothing to hide. I can have a Commission of Inquiry. I can have a CPIB investigation. I can have a CAD investigation. At the end of it, the facts must be here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make no secret. From time to time, you can look up Hansard, I have told this House that in the last 30 years my wife earns many times more than I did. That is the reason why I was able to carry on as Prime Minister on the paltry salaries that I earned. She has been one of the most experienced conveyancers and top earners. They are all with Inland Revenue. In the legal profession at that time - 60s, 70s, 80s - she was a top earner. She has enough to help our three children, including our two married sons, to own their own homes, and to buy other properties. Our children are also joint shareholders of KGC (or Kwa Geok Choo) Pte Ltd, her own private holding company. I want to say this because we are not going to live forever - my wife and I - and if the DPM does not succumb to lymphoma, then he may own a few more properties in time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I told PAP MPs that my wife handles my finances, they were surprised. So I told her, "You see, you are the one wife that is treated differently without any feminist movement." She said, "You make me do all the donkey work." And she said, "You don't even sign cheques." So much so that for so many years I did not sign any cheque, the bank sent me a note and said, "Please let us have your new specimen signature because after 10, 15 years, your signature may have changed." But that is the truth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also do not keep track of my royalties, or the honoraria that I have been paid.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> And just to put them in proportion, I asked my PA to check it Things that are not small money but substantial sums. It is not going to make me wealthy. As Richard Hu, the Finance Minister, has said, I have given away more than $2 million. I cannot get rich on $2 million, whether out of my CD-ROM or my book of pictures, or my book of speeches. But I make no apologies that for the last 40 years, I have just concentrated on my job, and there is a lot to concentrate on. If you concentrate your mind on the future of Singapore, you will know that 10 years - yes, it is clear, assuming no war; 20 years - fair; 30 years - I will not vouch if we will be like this. It is not possible. Will there be a stable balance of power which enables a city state to survive? Will there be an international order - the UN, multi-lateral security arrangements - that enables a little island with no depth for any defence, and must be able to respond immediately, or perish, to survive?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My son came back from Tokyo on Saturday. He came for lunch on Sunday. I asked him, "How did it go?" He said, "Good. But at lunch they, Keidanren, asked me some searching questions." I said, "What were they?" He said, "One asked him, Singapore is a wonderful place. So successful, so clean, so orderly, so advanced, so alert, but you know, city states disappear. What will happen?" So I asked him, "What did you tell him?" He said, "I paraphrased what you said in Australia." Some years ago when I was in Sydney, I said, "100 years from now, there will be Australia with cows and sheep, and men, maybe more aborigines." But 100 years from now, the island of Singapore may be here, who is in charge of that island, and what has happened to it?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So today young people who extrapolate on the basis that what we have succeeded in doing will go on forever, I say, "Stop and think again." It is not as simple as that. My wife and I are over-invested in properties. For our life-time, I think that is sound. I am not sure it is sound for my children's life-time. At GIC (Government Investment Corporation), we have studied the investment patterns of all the big funds throughout the world. No fund puts in more than 10% into properties,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> anywhere in the world, whether in New York or North America generally, or Europe or Japan. It is the most illiquid, the most prone to political and government changes. So I have encouraged Singaporeans to own properties. I still do, because I believe it commits them. Having bought your HDB property at $400,000, or resale, $700,000, are you going, at the next elections or wherever, to take a serious risk and put in a government that cannot look after this place and see your prices plummet? I am in favour of it. But I say it to the young, beyond 30 years, please think. At the end of 10 years, if I am around, I might give you another forecast.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need only add that the rules of prudence that we inherited from the British, and updated from time to time, have worked, because since 1959 I set out to establish high standards of integrity in elected and public officials. Ministers have always been allowed to buy properties, with or without discounts, soft options, soft sells or official sells. There was not this frenzy. In fact, I urged several Ministers - my Malay Ministers who were not buying. When I saw from the returns, I was worried for them. I said, "You will be in trouble when you retire. I am going to save one third of your salary and dock it off for you to buy." Today, Rahim Ishak owns a house in Opera Estate, Othman Wok owns a house, all landed properties. Yaacob owns one near Bukit Timah worth hundreds of thousands of dollars bought for $20,000-$30,000. But I had confidence that my team and I were going to stay in charge and going to make this place work. And I think the Prime Minister must have the confidence to make sure that he does likewise or there will be an enormous property crash and that is the end of the Singapore miracle. And they need not have any permission from me because there was none of this frenzy to buy. But they never used ministerial influence to gain any advantage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My method was really the British method -- no special rules to say you do this, you don't do this. These are the guidelines, rules of prudence, you are on your honour as an officer. I do not know
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> whether it still works in Britain because if you read about Mr John Mellor and his football suit, and so on, maybe a younger generation is not of the officer type. But the Britishers that I knew were men of honour. Far better to have the word of an officer than to say, "I am guarding you all the time. I am watching you." And this is a system that has worked. I do not know. The Prime Minister has decided he would take the burden and he would say `yes or no'. Well, that is fine. It solves the problem for the Ministers. But I took a very British attitude, maybe outdated now. If you break that code of honour, you are finished as a gentleman. If you are an army officer, you get your epaulettes torn off. And that is a very severe punishment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take very great pride in the way this matter has surfaced. 37 years of office, same Government, almost same Ministers, being renewed constantly. No corruption has set in. And we have basic institutions and legislation in place to maintain these standards. But without honest men in charge, man like Koh Beng Seng, man like the Prime Minister, like Richard Hu, the Finance Minister, like the CPIB chief, like the CAD chief, we can have all the rules. You have a government Mafia in charge ends us in trouble. Everybody else gets prosecuted except the people who really should be in jail.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old system, the Prime Minister was the only person above the law, I was the only person. In other words, if I lower standards, that is the end. Because my secretaries must know, my PA must know, and they are going to do something silly too themselves. By the time the Prime Minister does this, I have to put something by for myself. So when we had this elected president, I suggested, "PM, why don't you protect yourself, and have it written in the Constitution that if you refuse permission to investigate, Director, CPIB, can see the President, and he can say investigate because he is a different person today." And I think many people now know that since he became President, he has taken a completely different position from the Government. So there have been cases to be adjudicated whether we can or cannot make certain amendments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is in the nature of human beings and of institutions. Once you change the rules, the person who takes over must exercise his responsibility. And he was not going to take the Government's lawyer, he chose Walter Woon and Tommy Koh. I do not know who else he chose. But he decided the Government's lawyer is bound to give him the same opinion. So he said, "I will choose some other lawyers." That is correct. So when I appointed a person in office, I always expect him to exercise that office.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My most important and precious contribution to Singapore has been its financial integrity, the cleanliness with which I have established the Government, the cleanliness in public life and, generally, in society. Our problem now is we are going regional in a big way. So I have had Ministers telling me, "Better don't meet these people." I have never met these people before. But to go regional, I have met Ng Teng Fong, I have met the Kwek brothers, Kwek Leng Joo, I have met Ong Beng Seng. Dr Aline Wong is very wise, she told my brother, Dr Lee Suan Yew, who told me recently, this is all very dangerous, giving these people face and stature in Singapore. My being seen with them. But there is no way. How can I help them go regional into China or Vietnam, unless I know how they operate, what are their problems, what can I do to clear these road blocks? I have met them privately in my office to discuss these problems. Now, if we, in going regional, and we have to play by the rules there, bring those practices back here, then I say we become a different place. We have lost that premium. I think we need not. I can eat with Ong Beng Seng and Koh Beng Seng and I would still be the same person. No difference. And that is again back to character and a code of honour.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very important factor, this code of honour. When the Japanese asked the British prisoners of war at Selarang to promise not to escape because there were too many of them to guard, the officers and men refused. And in February 1942, they were kept and punished for days because, to them, to give their word was to bind their honour. Finally, they did, and they did not escape. So ask yourself, at the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> end of the day, what will maintain this place? For the man in charge to observe that code of honour.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud that when MAS informed Richard Hu and he saw this discrepancy, 12% for BG Lee, 7% for me and for the others, he said, "Enquire". Indeed, when I was confronted with this, my first thought was: "This man, Ong Beng Seng, is a dangerous fellow. He is investing in the young man and not investing in the old!" To be fair to Richard Hu, I was suspicious. So I told him, when I saw him on Thursday evening, "Look, don't fool around. I look at it, I think you are up to no good. You say you are not up to no good, you explain."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the investigations had proceeded. Prime Minister found nothing wrong. SES was determined to issue a statement to criticise HPL. They could not find anything wrong because HPL had complied with the rules except that they were slow, they were tardy. Why they were tardy, I do not know. I think stupidity. So they issued a statement of criticism. But, by implication, my name, although not mentioned, I was a member of the family, so I was being criticised. So I said to my brother, "Why did you try to conceal my name?" He said, "No. We never did." So more data were uncovered. I produced them to Richard Hu. SES withdrew that allegation because there was no need to conceal my purchase. My lawyers had already registered the caveat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We met the MPs yesterday. We had a discussion among ourselves to make quite sure that all MPs are free to speak their own minds. There is no Party Whip. Speak your mind because a very important matter of principle is at stake -- the honesty and integrity of the system. I believe the way we handle this will become a plus to the system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No government in this part of the world will open willingly when it need not open a problem like this and take it out, whether a Commission of Inquiry, debate in Parliament, Select Committee, or even a prosecution if a case could be made out. But by being able to do so, we have proved something -- that the second
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> generation in charge is able to maintain the same standards. If I did it, they would say, "Well, when he is gone, the whole thing would be finished." But I think the Prime Minister has shown that although it was me and DPM that he had to investigate, he was prepared to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the English-educated sometimes see it too much in a two-dimensional way. Yazhou Zhoukan, the Chinese edition of Asiaweek, now bought over from Time magazine, had the right perspective. They compared the way three houses were bought in three places and the way it was handled. I think Ow Chin Hock showed it to me. If I remember from memory, they had a caption called " (fang shi kao yan zheng zhi jia)". (Fang shi) means double entendre. (Fang shi) means something secret going on, an illicit liaison in a bedroom. In this case, it means housing purchases. (Kao yan zheng zhi), testing politicians. " (Li Guangyao), (Chen-Fang Ansheng), [ that is Anson Chan], (Li Denghui) (de fang shi dou bei shou kao yan)." And the difference is stark.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other two cases, no investigation, no comment. And in Singapore, you have the facts. I have spent a lifetime against the odds, and they were very heavy odds, in building up confidence in Singapore, confidence of Singaporeans in their future and confidence of foreigners who will invest their fortunes in Singapore. I will not do anything to undermine the Government, its system or the men and women who are in charge of it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proudest thing I have is that there is a Singapore. My wife tells me sometimes, "Why do you do these things? They are just ungrateful, forget it." The proudest thing she is of are her three children: upright, well-behaved, honourable. I do not think my son was brought up to take a little grease. And if Singaporeans believe that he is lesser than his father, then Singaporeans are in for a very foolish mistake. They were brought up straight, they are likely to stay straight. It is like, as I have said, a code of honour. If you break
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that code, you have brought shame upon the unit, you have brought shame upon yourself and your family. And for PAP MPs, I say you have a proud tradition. Every one of you, if ever you buy a house and is questioned, must be prepared to come here and face it, like I have. [Applause].

   <b>AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER BG LEE HSIEN LOONG</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for permitting me to join in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to declare my interest as a property developer. I am also the current President of REDAS (Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me, Sir, now to bring this Chamber back to the days of 1994 and 1995. It is only when we know the then circumstances of the property market that we may better understand the context within which the transactions of Senior Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, BG Lee, took place.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the property market slowly strengthened after the Gulf War, but it was really in 1993, when it took off in tandem with high economic growth and low interest rates, amidst the rediscovery of Asia and the revaluation of Asian assets by the rest of the world, especially from Western investors. This escalation continued into 1994. However, by the end of 1994, the market already showed signs of cooling off.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By early 1995, developers were more cautious and less confident. Increased
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government land sales attracted thin bidding and prices were below market s expectations. Developers were faced with decreased sales and lower prices. They also had to contend with the impending completion of a large number of units coming onstream, yet more Government land sales and rising costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this point, I would like to seek your indulgence and also the indulgence of Members of the House for me to read some of the newspaper headlines during this period. It is necessary to get the full flavour of the times then, although, Sir, it might be a bit tedious. I must say that what I have here is just a very small sampling of another larger sampling of really my whole office records on newspaper headlines on the property market in 1995.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Times on 12th January 1995: "Prices down 17% at URA's first land auction this year." South China Morning Post in Hong Kong on 25th January 1995: "Bull run begins to lose steam in Singapore. Residential value tipped to fall 10%." 28th January 1995, Business Times: "URA's figures point to peaking of private property market." The Straits Times on 9th February 1995: "Private housing rental fall 2.6% in third-quarter. High-rise apartments took most of the decline by IRAS." Lianhe Wanbao on 13th February 1995 reports: "Private residential property prices will reduce by about 20% this year." On 30th March Business Times: "Analysts cool to URA's sale of sites for landed development." Lianhe Zaobao on 25th April 1995: "Prices of private residential properties are now at more reasonable level after consolidation. A 10% further reduction is possible before the end of this year." In the Straits Times issue of 25th April 1995: "Lecturer predicts 10% fall in private property prices."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many more such news reports. However, as I do not want to waste the time of the Members of this Chamber, I will now go straight to the period leading to October 1995. On 10th July 1995, this is from the Shin Ming Daily news: "As a thousand condominium units are to be launched, the trend of selling price has become market concerns." In
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the South China Morning Post on 12th July 1995, in an article on Singapore property, it states:"Residential property prices have eased by an average of 5% to 10% from first quarter levels." In the Business Times on 18th July, it states: "Residential property market slows further. Trend may continue." In August 1995, in the Straits Times: "Private residential prices cool even further." In the South China Morning Post, again in Hong Kong on 9th August 1995: "Prices flatten out in private residential sector." In the Lianhe Zaobao on 10th August 1995: "Developers sell residential units at reduced prices." On 16th August, Business Times states: "URA data show private residential property softening." There are a few more like this. I show all this to show that these two periods in general, both the period leading up to April 1995 and also the period leading to October 1995, the market was bearish. Here, I would like to ask your permission, Sir, to distribute two graphs showing changes in the property indices issued by URA, and here Members will get a very much better overall picture of the market then. [Copies of Graphs distributed to hon. Members.]
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be seen from the graphs, Sir, the rate of increase in the property prices began to drop from the middle of 1994 very rapidly till the fourth quarter of 1995, where it stabilised at about 5%. Sir, I would like to remind Members that these rates are not on a quarter to quarter basis, but on a year to year basis. I have spent some time on the market conditions and sentiments in late 1994 and 1995. The market then was bearish and developers were worried about price trend edging downwards. Developers were worried that they could not sell their products. They were worried to the extent that an independent study on the supply and demand of private residential property in Singapore was commissioned by REDAS sometime in June 1995.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study was done by the Applied Research Corporation, a research company owned by the Government. The general conclusion of the study was that there was a possible over-supply situation with attendant falling occupancy rates and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> negative impact on prices. In other words, the report which was completed in late August 1995, gave a bearish outlook of the market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the dates of the purchases by Senior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister were as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Nassim Jade, April 1995. For Scotts 28, October 1995.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these purchases were made when the market sentiment was bearish. There were no long queues. There was no speculation. Least of all, there was no frenzy connected with excessive speculation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a former banker and currently a property developer, I ask myself this question: Why would anybody want to buy properties when the market sentiment is bearish, unless it is for long term investment? In fact, had the purchases been made public at that time, for example, immediately in April, after the purchase of the two apartments in Nassim Jade, I believe that both SM and DPM would have been applauded. They would have been seen as confidence boosters for property values in Singapore. They would have been seen as putting their money where their mouths and hearts are. Instead, what do we get today? Disclosure came about one year later; not their fault, as they had nothing to do with the mechanics of such disclosure. Unfortunately, a year later was too late as, by then, the market had turned bullish. Prices were higher, speculation was beginning to be excessive and all of a sudden there was something not so right, something sinister about their purchases. Would they be so judged had these purchases been disclosed amidst the bearish sentiment of 1995?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister and the Senior Minister had already mentioned why developers have higher list prices and lowered them by giving discounts. They are not wrong in their analysis. Selling properties is not like selling oranges and television sets where a mark-up over costs is the normal practice. Developers have to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> sell their products at market prices, regardless of cost of structures. When the market is good as during the past five or so years, profit margins are high. However, when the market is bad, as during the 1985-1986 recession, losses are rampant and many property companies then went under. Market demand, and not cost, determines selling prices of properties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, trying to get the price right is an art; even if one has much experience. The normal practice is to have higher list prices, and through discounts bring the final prices as close as possible to the market. Sometimes, one gauges the demand wrongly and the discounts are then adjusted accordingly to vary the final prices. The Finance Minister earlier mentioned that the normal discount for early birds is 5%. I would like to say here that in the market there is actually no such thing as a normal standard discount for early birds, in the sense that they vary quite a lot. But if there were, it will be closer to 10% , rather than 5%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, property units are also not homogenous products. They have differing value factors, such as height, facing, shape, etc. Sometimes, one gets the pricing for particular units wrong. When priced too low, they would be sold or snapped up before adjustments could be made. On the other hand, if priced too high, they normally remain unsold. Higher discounts would then have to be given. Hence, the situation of varying discounts for different units in the same development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had gone into the reasons for discounts to show that selling new properties through the mechanism of discounts is very much part and parcel of the marketing practices of developers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an environment, giving a higher discount to keep a desirable potential customer or to prevent possible complaints, especially to the Controller of Housing, for mistakes made by developers is not uncommon. The extra 5% that was given to the DPM by the developer must therefore be seen in this light, especially since DPM gave up a unit
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> on which he already had an option. Most buyers would insist on having the original unit they selected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this morning's press report, it was obvious that the particular unit was double booked. In such cases, normally, the developer, having made a mistake, would try to get out of the situation by asking both buyers to select another unit. If both do not agree, then the developer would have a problem. Hence, it is in the developer's interest to induce at least one to give up the selected unit, and in this case, normally a higher discount would be given for the alternative unit. From the press report, it is not clear whether or not HPL asked both parties of the particular unit. What is clear is that DPM was prepared to give up his unit. Hence, I believe the higher discount was given to him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really do not see anything wrong with it. As a developer myself, I would have done the same for any customer, let alone the DPM, ie, giving an additional discount to one or the other customer since double booking would certainly have to be the developer's mistake.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If what they had done is not improper and above board, what then is this debate about? That they shoud not have purchased properties at all? Surely, as the Senior Minister has said, this is not what we want; that Ministers and Government leaders cannot own properties in Singapore. Surely they should be like anyone of us in Singapore, free to purchase property with their own money, especially so when it is through their leadership that property values in Singapore have appreciated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, being in charge brings a responsibility of having to be circumspect with one's personal dealings and having the integrity of not abusing one's high office. And, Sir, that is what this debate is all about. In this particular case, it is because of the integrity of the Senior Minister, the integrity of the DPM, and the integrity of the Prime Minister and of all those involved in the Government that we are having this debate. This debate need not have happened. That it is brought up into
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the open by our leaders themselves speaks a lot for them, for our system and for our country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the midst of the details surrounding this debate, let us not lose our way and forget this important fact. I share the Prime Minister's view that nothing improper took place with regard to the purchases by SM and DPM. I also hope that the PM in coming up with new rules and guidelines for Ministers, MPs, and senior civil servants - something which he said that he would do - he would not opt for drastic changes. Our present system has served us well and, if changes are needed, they should be evolutionary and not revolutionary. In the final analysis, Sir, it is still the election and appointment of people of character, integrity and capability that is the key to good and honest government; not more rigid rules and regulations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I sit down, may I say that I notice that the unofficial Leader of the Opposition, the hon. Member for Bukit Gombak, Mr Ling, is not present in this House. I am also surprised to find out that he is not listed down to speak on this subject. As he is the unofficial Leader of the Opposition, I am sure that Members of this House, and indeed members of the public, will be most interested to hear his views and comments. Does he think that there was impropriety or does he agree with the Prime Minister that the transactions were all above board and not improper? I sincerely hope to hear Mr Ling in the House tomorrow on this topic.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Toa Payoh GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to first declare that I work in a corporation whose shareholders own property development companies in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been quite a stir of excitement, quite unjustified in my view, over the discounts given to SM and DPM Lee Hsien Loong in their purchases of units in Nassim Jade and Scotts 28. Even though about one-fifth of the buyers in these two developments were also given varying discounts, the whole matter is being treated as an extraordinary affair.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not pretend that their purchases should arouse no interest nor
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> attract any attention at all. SM's actions especially, however mundane, are bound to attract attention but the degree of interest and gossip in this instance has exceeded normal curiosity. Why? Is it so unusual for developers to sell properties at a discount? It has been explained to us by both Senior Minister as well as Mr Heng Chiang Meng that this is very common. And Members of the House and members of the public who have had any experience of buying properties at all must know that discounts are very common in the property market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developers who aim to build a business which would support a steady stream of new developments over a long period of time make sure that their design, quality, and their sales and pricing policies are able to sustain a long term business with maximum profits. And discounts are part and parcel of their sales and pricing policies. They give discounts for the same reasons that any business gives discounts - they want to generate more sales and more overall profits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many kinds of discounts, some of which have already been touched upon. These are early bird discounts. There are also discounts if a company or institution can gather together 10 or 20 buyers and make a block booking. I remember, Sir, when I bought my first house in 1965, 10 of us who worked in EDB made a block booking and we were offered a 5% discount. Developers also pitch their prices as high as they dare and then they test the market with discounts at soft sales and vary the discounts according to the response.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A discount is also given, very often, to a small number of buyers who are known in society to be careful and discerning in their purchases. Purchase by such buyers becomes a seal of quality and reliability of the development and the developer. Developers spread word about such buyers to sell the units at a higher price. I am sure Members who have had occasion to go and look at developments would have been told that so-and-so bought that house, or so-and-so has booked this
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> house. So developers know that some people command respect in the market and others would take their actions as a guidance for their own actions. SM and DPM would certainly fall into this category, and their judgment would have a strong influence on others. I am sure that Members would agree that it would be absurd to suggest that because their purchases would influence others, they should keep out of the market or purchase secretly behind the names of nominees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all discount schemes, the developer is very selective as to who and how many people get discounts. This is in the very nature of their sales policy. These practices have always existed and discounts are not given as a favour to the buyers but as part of a sales strategy to maximise profits for the developer. In the cases of Nassim Jade and Scotts 28, about one-fifth of the buyers were given discounts. No developer would underprice such a large number of units in order to give these buyers a huge profit. In this case, the pricing policy was obviously one to test the market and to continue to adjust the prices upward according to demand. So what is the reason then for this sense of indignation that SM and DPM have bought units in Nassim Jade and Scotts 28?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason, Sir, is the fever, like a feeding frenzy, that seems to exist now in the residential property market in Singapore. Speculation has become a very strong feature of the market. The majority of buyers may intend to live in the property or hold it as a long term investment. But the proportion of speculators who book units to make a quick profit is very significant. Developers, in fact, would not mind if a few of their buyers make such speculative profits so that all their other buyers who intend to hold their properties would feel happy that they have properties with much more value than what they have paid. This would also, of course, help developers in their future projects. But if a large number of buyers in a housing project can turn around immediately and sell, and make huge profits, it shows clearly that the developer was unable to foresee the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> market strength and therefore underpriced his house, because no developer would underprice such a large proportion of his development.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prices in the residential property market have been moving up over the last 10 years. There have been, of course, periods of flats and dips, but on the whole, it has been rising steadily. And many think that there is no end in sight to the steep rise, although the measures recently announced by the Government to curb speculation should have a sobering effect.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in this buoyant market, in this fever, those who bought units in Nassim Jade and Scotts 28 seem to have done well, that is, if one goes by the stories of those who have sold their bookings and made huge profits. But could anyone have guaranteed at the time the buyers committed themselves that the market would continue to rise? Mr Heng Chiang Meng has already shown that it was, in fact, a period when the sentiment was bearish. It is only on hindsight that one can say that these properties were initially sold at attractive prices. But at the time of the initial sale, the prices even after discount were high, compared to similar properties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can quote one piece of evidence that shows that the price was indeed high and was not considered a bargain. Sometime in March 1995 when Nassim Jade was coming on the market, a company that is associated with the company I am working for, seriously considered buying the whole development as an investment for rental. A price of $1,500 per sq ft was offered to the agent, who was trying to broker the deal, but the developer wanted $1,600 per sq ft. No deal was done. The final selling price of Nassim Jade averaged well above $1,500 per sq ft, even after discount.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here clearly was a different judgment as to what was an acceptable and attractive market price at that time. With hindsight, it is easy to say that those who bought units in Nassim Jade obtained attractive prices. The market, however, is not so predictable. Even in the last 10 years, as I mentioned, there have been
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> periods of flat prices and even dips in the price. These flats and dips were temporary, but that they were temporary is only clear on hindsight. Nobody knew at that time that they were temporary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, those who purchased units in DBS Realty's Aspen Heights in October 1994 know this. Though there was strong interest before the sale was launched, the actual take up was below expectation. The market took a pause and for sometime, prices in Aspen Heights hardly moved from the initial sale prices. I know this, because I invested in a property in Aspen Heights in October 1994. And after about a year, I wanted to sell the property as I had found a better property to buy and hold. I could not even get a price that would cover my interest and other costs. It was only this year when prices began to move that I managed to sell it at a small margin. In this development, DBS Realty, in fact, decided as a result of market sentiment, to divide the sales into phases. The point I want to emphasize, Sir, is that there is no certainty of profit in property purchases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these feelings of indignation, unease about the purchases by SM and DPM do not arise, I think, out of any perception that gratification has been given for favours done by them, or favours that will be done by them in the future. Singaporeans, whatever their cynicism, do not believe that SM or DPM has done anything illegal or improper. But the perception is that they had got a good bargain because of who they are and this is considered unfair. Senior Minister has already very graphically shown that there is no such thing as a level playing field. But even if you look at the price that they paid, was this a discount? Was this discount a bargain? I have already said that at least one serious investor judged that the price above $1,500 per sq ft was too high. Both SM and DPM paid prices that were well above $1,500 per sq ft. Moreover, no developer would sell one-quarter of his development at bargain prices. Mr Ong Beng Seng is not in the business of charity. The fact that the prices today, barely a year after the initial sale, are so much above the developer's selling prices, shows that the developer was not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> able to foresee the escalation of prices. Hotel Properties Limited would surely have fixed a higher price, or even delayed sales, if they had known how the prices would move. At the time of the initial sale, Hotel Properties pitched their price at a level that they judged would meet the affordability of the small group of investors that they were targeting for their development. Buyers like SM and DPM had to make a judgment at that time whether the high prices that were being asked were sustainable. They turned out to be right. They had no privileged information about how the market would go and as to them being right, I think the jury in fact is still out. Who knows what will happen in the next few years?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another source of envy is that while they may have paid the same price as many others, it is unfair because they had the inside track in getting an opportunity to buy. This again has already been explained extensively by the Senior Minister. Of course, it is true that they have inside track. This will be so with any Minister. Even in normal times, without a property fever, good developments in choice sites will have a demand that exceeds supply. No developer has such a perfect knowledge of the market that he can fix the price at a level that will exactly clear his supply without any queue whatsoever. The developer will set his price so that it will result in slightly more demand than supply. In such a situation, some people like architects, lawyers and other professionals associated with the development will be on the inside track. And so would Ministers and certainly SM and DPM. Is there something wrong or improper about this? The only way that Ministers can avoid the situation would be for the developers to discriminate against Ministers. Or, alternatively, Ministers must only buy properties where the demand is so low that there are no queues, ie, they must only buy dud properties. This is patently absurd. What is important is that Ministers and civil servants who may have dealings with a developer must make sure that there is no hint that they have been singled out for special favours so that they
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will be obligated to the developer. Like Caesar's wife, they must be above suspicion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only legitimate question that can be raised is whether it is politically expedient for SM and DPM to openly buy properties in what are clearly high profile developments. Opinions can vary on this question. Should they have resorted to disguise and secrecy when buying these properties? To have tried to camouflage their purchases would go against the very grain of their character, especially since there is nothing illegal or improper about it. It has always been SM's philosophy to be open about his dealings. I am glad that instead of allowing the rumour mill to add juicy embellishments to the truth, we can put the record straight openly in Parliament. The investigation by PM, the statements by PM, SM, DPM, the Stock Exchange of Singapore, Hotel Properties Ltd, the public discussion, the proceedings in Parliament today, must all arouse considerable astonishment in outside observers of the Singapore scene. They must be wondering what is the fuss all about. But the public airing underlines the high standards Singaporeans have set for their leaders and the leaders have set for themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, that this exercise is irksome and time-consuming, but it should serve to emphasize that no one in Singapore is above examination. And this can only be good for our future.

  <b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, having been Chairman and CEO of OCBC, I would like to speak on whether it was proper or improper for Senior Minister and DPM Lee Hsien Loong to purchase a unit each in Nassim Jade and Scotts 28.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a little background. During the period, January 1992 to July 1995, when I served as Chairman and CEO of OCBC, the Bank sold the following properties:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 87 apartments in a condominium development at Tanjong Rhu. These apartments were sold by private treaty to various members of the public;
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 156 terrace and semi-detached houses in a landed-property development along Lentor Avenue. The houses were sold in two phases. The first phase comprising 81 properties was conducted on an open launch, first-come-first-served basis. In the second phase, 51 properties were sold by closed tender and 24 properties were sold by private treaty to various members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the above sales, OCBC, when necessary, gave discounts to list prices to effect sales, but no director or employee of the Bank was allowed to book units ahead of the public or given discounts which were not available to the public. This was in line with OCBC's established policy which seeks to maximise the return to the Bank in respect of properties sold by the Bank.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose for my relating how OCBC sells properties is not to promote OCBC but to make the point that developers use a variety of methods to sell their properties in order to get the maximum return. Buying and selling of properties is an inexact art, not a precise science. And even experienced developers find it difficult to read the market accurately.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was away from Singapore when OCBC launched the first phase of the landed development at Lentor Avenue, the Countryside. At that time, I was Chairman of OCBC and the OCBC Property Department faxed a message to me saying that people had been queuing up for three days in order to buy the properties and all the properties in the first phase had been sold in one day. My reaction was what a mistake we had made. Obviously, we had underpriced the properties. And so in the second phase, I told the property development people to try and sell it by closed tender so as to try and get a better gauge of market prices. The point, Sir, is not to denigrate the property development people at OCBC who are a very experienced lot of developers, but to point out that no one can read the market with accuracy and properties which may appear today to be underpriced would not have seem so at the point of sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different boards of directors will have different polices and adopt different practices. Each property development company is entitled to pursue its own approach to selling properties but all companies have to operate within the provisions of the Companies Act and listed companies additionally have to abide by the regulations of the Stock Exchange. If a company or a director is suspected of contravening the Companies Act, or the Stock Exchange regulations, or if there is any suspected irregularity in the sale of properties by any property development company, then it is the responsibility of the proper authorities to investigate the matter thoroughly and take the necessary action as we are doing today in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to HPL, the Prime Minister has explained carefully how he investigated the circumstances of the purchase by Senior Minister and DPM Lee of units in the two HPL developments. The Prime Minister has kept me informed of the developments in his investigation which my colleagues and I considered to be necessary to maintain our clean and honest system of Government even though the investigation involved the Senior Minister and DPM Lee. Having access to all the facts of the purchases, I am confident that no one can disagree with the Prime Minister's judgment that there was no impropriety in the purchase by Senior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Lee of a unit each in Nassim Jade and Scotts 28.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the case, I see no reason for the Senior Minister and DPM Lee to return the discounts they have been given to the Government, whether this is in the form of "unsolicited gifts" or otherwise. I expressed this view at a meeting with the Prime Minister, Senior Minister and DPM Lee shortly before the Prime Minister released his statement on 26th April. I see no reason to change my view.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have focused my remarks today on whether it was proper or improper for the Senior Minister and DPM Lee to purchase units in HPL's two developments. The reason I have done this is because the integrity of two senior Ministers in the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government has been questioned and I feel that the issue of propriety has to be settled first. Members should not allow this issue of propriety to be clouded by the wider questions of how to ensure fairness in property sales and whether it is appropriate or inappropriate politically for Ministers to be given discounts from list prices or priority in bookings by property developers or participate in soft launches of property projects. These wider questions are, of course, important and should be discussed. But they should not be allowed to confuse the issue of the propriety of Senior Minister's and DPM Lee's purchases. If necessary, Sir, and if there is not enough time in this debate, we can, I suggest, discuss these wider questions in another debate in this House.

   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>

  <br>6.10 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen (Nee Soon Central)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, recently, the purchase of private property at discounted prices by the Senior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Lee has caused a storm of disquiet among the people. Singaporeans are beginning to consider one question, that is, can Ministers, including the Prime Minister, Senior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister be allowed to buy other private properties or to invest in property.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My personal view is that the Government should legislate to stipulate that any Minister who is in office shall be allowed to buy and own not more than one private house for his own use and that he shall not be allowed to buy another property for investment purpose. If the Minister has to sell the house during his term of office and buy another new house, he must first inform Parliament and must obtain the approval of Parliament before he can proceed to do so. This is because Ministers possess the power of policy-making and law enforcement. This measure can minimise the possibility of Ministers abusing their power and influence to make huge profits from
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> property transactions. In addition, the Ministers' immediate family members should also own only one private property each.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the duty of Ministers is to serve the people and not to make money for themselves. In order to command their confidence of our local people and foreigners for the leadership of our Government, I suggest that the Government should require Ministers to make written declarations of their assets and sources of income to Parliament annually and have them gazetted in the Government Gazette. I feel that declaring to the Prime Minister alone is not good enough.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the purchase of private condominium units by the Senior Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, the parties concerned, including the Senior Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, have already made their explanations. I think we should leave the matter to the people to ponder over it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a big fuss just because the Senior Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister purchased properties. I am trying to fathom what this fuss is about and what are the real issues. I think most people in Singapore - I should say most thinking people and people who are in the know - and as a newspaper editor has mentioned, there is no question of illegality or improper behaviour by the two Ministers. As I can see it, the problem probably relates to the income of Ministers. I think these two issues are tied together. Because, last year, when we debated on the increase of Ministers' income, there was talk of Singapore Ministers not receiving any other income except their salaries. And therefore they are justified in pegging their salaries to the highest officers in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also mentioned that although other Ministers in the region received smaller salaries than Singapore's, they benefit from side incomes, perks and other favours and they live a good life. So
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> after the PAP Government has given to the people this kind of a mindset, now suddenly it was revealed that Ministers are given preference to buy properties, especially in this hot property market and they make big profits. Everybody is calculating, "Oh, 12% discount, property is $3 million, $360,000, just with a stroke of a pen, just to sign the agreement." This kind of a thing stirs up people. They say that $360,000 is a lot of money, seeing that the average worker earns only about $2,000 a month in Singapore. It is going to take him 20 years or so to earn that sort of money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we do not lose touch of the ground, this is how the men-in-the-street will react. Ministers are dealing with millions and sometimes billions of dollars and they forget what the ground is thinking, what they are looking at. Everybody seems to be making a fast buck, good money, in property speculation. It is called a property casino now in Singapore. And suddenly now we read Ministers are also playing in the casino. This kind of a thing will definitely bring up discontent.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> A clarification, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, will you give way?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> resumed his seat.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The houses that I and DPM purchased have not been sold. What casino is he talking about? And I have explained earlier that the purchases were made not based on DPM's salary nor my salary. The two purchases came to more than $10 million. May I add, before the Member goes too far, I asked my brother the night before - if it came to this as I thought it would - whether he would mind if I disclosed how much he had earned as a lawyer and the business he did. He is two years younger than I am. And when we started the firm of Lee and Lee, there were four partners, myself, my brother, my wife and Mr Barker. My share was twice that of each of them, because I had the market pulling power. So they took one share each and I had two shares. When I left, they carried on with equal shares. I pulled Mr Barker out to join us in Parliament. My wife and my brother carried on, one share each.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was and has been and is a very competent and successful legal firm. So I asked him if this issue cropped up, would he mind if I told the world how much he has made and saved. He said, "Not at all."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "What is your worth now?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "Well, shares more than $20 million; properties, more than $40 million."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "You are not afraid of kidnapping?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and said, "No, I don't go to countries where there are kidnappings."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add that my wife did not go into business with him because she did not want to get me into trouble. But let me add that she earned as much as my brother did. And if we are to sell our properties now and realise the assets, it would easily come to at least a third of what my brother has. So please be under no misapprehension that we are depending on our Ministerial salaries. The point I made was, I was able to do this all these years for a pittance because my family was being paid for and catered for by my wife. And I told the Prime Minister that he was also in the same position because his wife is a partner of Lee and Lee and also able to support him and his family. But you cannot go on to the next Prime Minister in the hope that that would be so. And let us face it. The men that we have assembled here, if ever they go to the private sector, are going to be paid higher than us. They are top minds, sound judgment, high helicopter quality. Any head hunter will go for them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether my son and his health would make him a Prime Minister. He will not have the advantage of a wife who is a lawyer. He has to live with a wife who works in Singapore Technologies and that is a Government-owned company and the bonuses are meagre.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can go on to the other Ministers. Some have wives who are lawyers and who may be as successful as my wife, but no country can run on that basis. Lim Hng Kiang, George Yeo, Teo Chee Hean, leave out Lee Hsien Loong. I saw them when they were President's Scholars in 1972 or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 1973 in a group of seven or eight. They went on to Cambridge and to Manchester and came top of the class. Lim Hng Kiang had a First with a star, that means not only a First Class Honours but a mark of special distinction. George Yeo had a First. George Yeo went to do a Harvard MBA and came out with high distinction. Teo Chee Hean went on to London to do a computer course and came out with distinction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not have this quality of men and you expect them to depend on their wives, Singapore will go down. Why should they be doing this? Because somebody, some group of men, must assume this responsibility. The Prime Minister persuaded them and I helped the Prime Minister to persuade them, especially Teo Chee Hean. He was quite happy to stay on in the Navy and later on go to the private sector. But we must have quality men.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look at the incomes in the private sector in a booming Singapore, in a booming region, it is stupidity to believe that you are going to get good government paying them miserable salaries. This is one social milieu. Their wives meet other wives. My wife has told me several times, "Why do you fret so much over Singapore? Why not just take it easy and do something else?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel very guilty today about Mr Barker, my friend Eddie. I robbed him of at least $30 million had he stayed in Lee and Lee. Had he gone into business with my brother, he would have had easily $60 million. When he left, all I could give him was a pension which he could commute. And he wanted to leave, from the 1970s, the moment the Government was stable, he said, "Can I leave now, Harry?" I said, "Who have I got?" He was honest. He was capable. He was honourable. I trusted him. He ran the Ministry of National Development. He ran the Ministry of Law and he ran it with competence. His wife was not a lawyer. He had only his salary. Can I repay him now? All I could do was to ask the Prime Minister, "Will you consider giving the old guards a little token of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> recognition?" It is too late. By the time he retired in 1988, time had passed, his energy levels were lower.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak and I hope the MPs would not mind it. You ask Davinder Singh whether he would want to be a Minister. Or Shanmugam. What for? With their capabilities, with Singapore's prosperity and the legal profession playing an important role in Singapore as a financial and an economic centre, they will surpass my brother's accumulation when they retire, provided there is a good government. With that gone, your properties will go down, your businesses will scatter. We will be worse off than we were before.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask yourself, Mr Chiam, be honest. We are going to have an election soon. You are an honest man. I hope you will be re-elected. Because at the end of the day, you are basically an honest man. Do not deceive people. You say, "Declare this." Mr Cheo says, "Announce everything." Mr Chiam, would you like to declare your income, although it is known to Inland Revenue? Would you like to declare your assets? No candidate would join the PAP, especially a successful one, if he has got to do that. Maybe Mr Low Thia Khiang would be prepared to do it because he has been having a pretty lean time. He has not been a lawyer. So he can show, "You see, how poor I am." But Mr Chiam, let us be honest, and then maybe you will still win Potong Pasir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, just as the Senior Minister, I am also concerned about the survival of Singapore. My perception is that salary cannot be everything. We want good men. Sure, we want honest people. I know it is difficult to get them. I also have had bitter experience in dealing with people in my Party.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With due respect to the Senior Minister, he is certainly the George Washington of Singapore, he has built up Singapore. But people do change, and great leaders do change with times. I was wondering whether if we just concentrate on the incentive of high salaries, without hoping that people would also have values with them, even without the high salary, that they can still work for Singapore. I think
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that would be the ideal. Because you are also talking about the long-term interest and survival of Singapore. I am also talking about the long-term survival of Singapore. If we depend entirely on the incentive of money, my view is that in the long-term of Singapore we may not succeed, with due respect to the Senior Minister. I have my own ideals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk of property. Dr Tan Cheng Bock asks whether I would be willing to declare. Sure, I would be willing to declare what properties I bought.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell Members of one incident. I was a school teacher. In the 1960s, I was in the Singapore Teachers Union. I came to know that there was this Teachers' Housing Estate project. They built terrace houses especially for teachers. I booked a corner unit. It was a very good unit, with a basement below. I arranged with the principal for a loan. I put out some money and I was successful in purchasing that property. But at that time I already had two flats. I was living in one and renting out the other. I was a single person at that time, and being a bachelor I did not want to live in a terrace house all by myself. I had to rent it out. I asked myself what would happen if other teachers got to know. You are depriving them of one house. You are buying it to rent it out and they have a family and they do not have a house to stay in. So I gave up that purchase. That is the sort of principle that I have. Because I gave that up, I probably would lose by now over a million dollars. I do not know how much it costs now, but at least over a million dollars. That is the sort of values that I hope can be inculcated among Singaporeans. Sure, we want high salaries. We want a good living. We want money for our children to be educated. But at the same time we must have dedicated and committed people in Singapore. It is not just because of the salaries that I come to serve Singapore. We may differ in our views. Of course, we must give people good salaries and at the same time a decent living.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee also talks of the British standards. I also admire the British people. I have worked in Malaysia for a while in a rural place. I gave two years of my service
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to teach in Malaysia with a very low salary. Nobody asked me to go there, but I had my own peace corps values and I went to serve in Malaysia for two years. I discovered that there were old British spinsters who had dedicated their whole life to be, first, a teacher, and then a principal in a rural school. Then I heard that when they retired they went home to England and some old pupils of the schools went to see them. Were they living well off? No, they were living in an old aged home, after serving all their life in Malaysia. This is the sort of dedicated people they have in England that built the British empire. So do we have such people in Singapore to keep Singapore going for the next 100 years? If we just depend on salary alone, this country is going to be like China sooner or later. Everybody just crazed for money. That is my point of view.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given up my time and energy for 20 years to be in politics, hoping that I can contribute. I think I have contributed something to Singapore. I think I have set an example, hopefully, that others will follow me when they are in the Opposition. We have also to help Singapore grow and be strong. It is not only the duty of the Government. It is also the duty of the Opposition. We are also nation builders.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> People have this perception. You may not buy them for speculation. But nobody knows, unless
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> you tell them. They have this perception because everybody buys property to speculate and hoping to make a quick buck.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> What is your perception of the purchases by SM and DPM?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes, I know now that they buy them for investment. There is no doubt about it. I am quite certain in my mind.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue is whether or not Ministers can buy property. Of course, they can buy property. But they have a problem now because Senior Minister and DPM have given back their discounts and so they have set a precedent. They have viewed the discounts as unsolicited gifts. Therefore, they felt that it was not right to have them and handed them over to the Government. But the Prime Minister seems to have a different view. He says that there is nothing wrong and they can keep the discounts. But since they have set this precedent, I think it would be difficult for Ministers in future, when purchasing a property, to knowingly accept a discount.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Can I seek a point of clarification? Not only the Prime Minister but Dr Tony Tan, the Defence Minister, has said quite clearly that we were entitled to the discounts. I think I have to explain why, in spite of that, the discount was treated as a non-solicited gift.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a meeting at which my son, the DPM, the Prime Minister, myself, Finance Minister, Teo Chee Hean and Wong Kan Seng were present. This was a random group, representative of the Cabinet and, hopefully, representative of the outside opinion in Singapore. I have asked them whether they would mind - I knew this would come up - because it is better that people know why we did what we did. My old friends know me well. They know that when I am right, I dig my toes in, I slog it out to the end. So they said, "Look, why do you give back the money because I know you? You give people the impression, those who know
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> you, that you have done something wrong." I said, "Hold on." We did a round robin. Richard Hu, the Finance Minister, said, "Completely correct. But DPM should give up his 5% because 12% was above the balance. For Scotts 28, no question of his propriety. Nassim Jade, 7% for me, no problem." That was the straightforward discount for the first eight, or whatever. But it became 12% for DPM. That is how the whole investigation started. So he thinks that although investigations did not disclose anything which was objectionable, he believed that it would be a good gesture if DPM gave up the 5% and took only 7% like everybody else. I think the Finance Minister will confirm that. [Dr Richard Hu indicated yes.]
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Teo Chee Hean, who had been Minister of State for Finance, supported that point of view. Keep 7%, return 5%. I keep everything. Wong Kan Seng, who had met three top SPH pressmen, who were jumping around, said, "Injustice of it all. Give up the whole lot." Loong, my son, decided, "How can I give up 5% and keep 7%? It is ridiculous. If I want to keep, I keep all, or give up, I give up all." So he decided, because he is not me. He may not be able to have that same weight. He said, "No, I give it up, all." Once he decided that he would give up all, I decided I had to back him. I had to give up all. Because otherwise it will look odd. Father is more selfish than the son!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not the slightest compunction in saying that what I did was right. I will defend this anywhere and I also have not the slightest compunction to say that we can have any commission of inquiry, go into DPM's purchases, he will come out clear. But he decided this. I will not have it said that I am more selfish than my son. But to say that every Minister from now onwards cannot take a discount is an absurdity. Then they cannot buy any house at all, without paying a premium on the house. We have to have a sense of proportion. This problem arose because I was incapacitated - not incapacitated, but not able to be active. If I were, it could never have come to this stage. Those who know me know that I react, and react very quickly, and fight to put something right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This having been done, I think we bring it all out. If you ask any more questions, I have more explanation because every step there was a reason, there was logic, there was good sense, there was good judgment. And I repeat again: for the long term future of Singapore, you cannot depend on Ministers having wives who are making incomes equivalent to the market. That may not be so. You look around you [referring to Mr Lee Yock Suan] he has not got a wife who is making a market income; he has [referring to Mr Yeo Cheow Tong]. [Referring to Mr Lim Boon Heng] I am not sure whether she is in a profession which will make money. Tony Tan's wife has retired to look after the children. Wong Kan Seng's wife retired to look after the children. Lee Boon Yang's wife was a music specialist, that is not a big money-making business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I could go on. But you want good men and you depend on the accident of their wives being willing to work and keep the family going, educate the children, make sure that you have enough to send them to university, make sure that when houses are phenomenal in 20 years' time that they can start off home with a house - these are thoughts that must go through every man's mind, every woman's mind. We live in this world. I feel sorry about the teachers that he has referred to. There are such people like Mother Teresa. But let me tell you what happens if you depend on Mother Teresa to save the world.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the British system when it was working in the 1940s. I now know one of the problems they face and it is populism, salaries. So their Ministers are under-paid, and because the Prime Minister and the Ministers are under-paid, their judges are under-paid. Every time there is a salary revision - I read the Economist and the London Sunday papers regularly - they concede for Division II, Division III, all the lower ranks, accept the recommendations. Every time they come to the senior civil servants, judges, Ministers, they reduce it drastically. The result: they could no longer get the best lawyers to be judges. My contemporaries are judges. I meet them when I go to England. Once upon a time, it was an
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> honour to be a judge. You finished your Bar, practice, your last year as a silk was tax-free, which was a vast sum. Then you went on the Bench, easier life, prestige, position. But now you pay tax even on your last year. So there is no nest-egg. And the quality of judges has not been of the best. Judges who have gone on the Bench, gone up to the Court of Appeal, being promoted, have decided, unprecedented in the old days, to resign and become arbitrators where they are paid per diem. Think about it, Mr Chiam.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the system is skewed. If we all have Mother Teresas, the world is a wonderful place. But we have only one Mother Teresa, that is why the Pope thought her wonderful, and so do all of us. In the real world, and Singapore lives in the real world, motivation, as Herman Kahn, the futurologist, once said to me: "God, glory, gold." It is very simple - GGG (God, glory, gold). Mother Teresa is God. Some people do it for glory. But in the end, you need gold to pay for houses, homes and other things. You need gold to have your children educated, go to a good university, have a home.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when I said to this House at the time the salaries were being revised, and I urged the Prime Minister to revise them, I was convinced he would never be able to recruit the next generation. Tan Cheng Bock said to me, "No, no. I am surprised to hear that." My generation cannot be repeated. If you ask me to start all over again, I may never have done that. And if my wife did not earn the money she did, I might have packed up by the 1970s. As my brother told me, "You tell them you were earning twice what I did." Let us not do the Singaporean a disservice and confuse him. They are honest, honourable, committed men, but they are not Jesuits. They are not Mother Teresas. They have children who will grow up. Some will be successful; some may not be.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did my wife help my son specially, to set up home? Because he has a disabled son who may have to be looked after for the rest of his life - visually handicapped, and otherwise also handicapped. You mean you go around and go
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to Kuantan and carry on if you had that problem? Let me be quite candid. All the leaders that I have met in Australia, in New Zealand, in England, marvelled at the courage we had in taking that White Paper through, changing the rules and pegging it to the market. And they said to me, "I wish I could do likewise." He is no longer in office. I think Mr Keating would not mind if I said that. When I went to Australia, Mr Keating said, "Well, I wish I could do that." Because he has quality men too who could not carry on, and on, and on. Or you can run it like the American system. I do two years, I do four years, I've got the connections in government, I am a consultant, I am a lobbyist. We have run our system. It has worked. Good men stay in, continue to stay in, do good work, get the experience, have the expertise, and we are able to give everybody a better and better life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please do not unwittingly deceive people who may well listen and believe that there will be so many Chiam See Tongs who are so willing to sacrifice that they can run the government. That has not been so in any country in the world. You have seen Japan, the monies involved. You have seen Korea. You have seen Taiwan - what they call "black mafia". You have seen Italy. You know the British have run into all these sleaze problems which never happened in my days as a student then. It was unthinkable. But if you pay Ministers that salary, when they in private life can earn more, you force them to take holidays at their risk in Paris, on a house account, which does a Minister no good. Better our style, and I say it is an honourable straight system and we answer for it every time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang says we are afraid to reveal the salaries. Not at all. Why should I be afraid? Why should any of the Members here be afraid? We will publish to you every year the figures which their counterparts are making in the private sector, and it is going up, and up and up, because the economy is doing well and Singapore is well run, and we are well placed. It is an art, not a science. The art of government is to get the right people to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the right places, and the right people often are the able and outstandingly energetic and sound, and they are the ones who will do well, whether in business, in the profession or in government. I took many years to learn that, that there is such a category that you can blanket across the board. So when I met the 100 CEOs at Williamsburg, many of whom I have met occasionally here, I recognise one quality - high energy levels, sound judgment, tremendous drive and confidence. You find them? They are not in government. They do not want to be. Only one of them - Mr Rubin, head of Goldman, Sachs, is now head of the Treasury, and he has ably defended the US dollar. He is paid a pittance. But he does it and, of course, thereafter the connections with the whole panoply of government. Do we want to run that system? Can we? No. So I honestly urge this House, say what you like, but don't demolish the system. It depends on two things - the future of Singapore -- having the right system, and having the right men in the key positions of that system, then we can have a lot of fun and games. Whether it is in Parliament, whether it is in the press, whether it is in radio or television, you need at the top a crucial man. Wrong man, system malfunctions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are our journalists amongst the world's best paid? Ask them. When they go to any conference in ASEAN, are their counterparts paid their salaries? No. But we run a system that pays a man in accordance with his talent and his performance, not patronage. There are countries in Asia where the writer depends on being paid by the person he is writing about. You pay me, I write you good story. You don't pay me, I write you bad story. That is your choice. That is not for us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would strenuously defend what we have done and I say, Mr Chiam, do not do a disservice. I hope he wins the next elections. I think he has done on the whole good for the House. I was wrong when I thought he was not going to do much good, but in his somewhat honest, bumbling way, he has been a voice of sanity, unlike his fellow MP, Mr Cheo. He knows what is right. He knows what is true, because he sits down next to me in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the Members' Room, he knows that I am not a crook. But he said " (rang ren min pan duan). " (shi bu shi)? "Oh, let the people decide." He doesn't know. Having heard all of us here - Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, me, Dhanabalan
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(wo bu da dong) I do not know, that is a minus for Singapore. If you are wanting to be an Opposition on an issue such as this, take a stand, either say, "I think we call for a commission of inquiry. Or I demand a further investigation." But to say, (wo mei you yi jian), sad!

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I will have to carry on from where I left off. Our leaders need to lead. They can only lead if they have the moral authority to lead. Once the people perceive that that leader has no longer any such authority, they would probably not follow what the leader says. So that is the reason why I think this issue has cropped up. People see the leaders are not sacrificing. The leaders are, in fact, paid well and by buying property, when property prices are going up, they see the leaders getting richer. So if a leader who is earning 100 or 200 times more than the working people, you tell them that they must sacrifice ---

  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chiam, I have just explained that I would not get rich with my salary. It is my wife's earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> We are talking about salaries comparable to the ordinary people of Singapore. I think this is the question. It is very subjective.
  <br>

  <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is my wife who buys these houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I have asked the Prime Minister but I did not get the answer. So I cannot reply to him. There are people who say that Ministers own one or two condominium units. Could I ask the Prime Minister now how many Ministers in fact own condominium units, without naming them?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I gave him the answer. I circulated his question to all the Ministers and the answer was from 1992
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to 1996, no Minister has bought condominium units under soft launches. So he has got the answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> But have they bought properties outside those offers?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, they have bought. But it was not his question. He never asked for it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If I were to ask him now, would he be willing to answer? We go one by one, if he wants to. Does he not deny that in fact Ministers do have properties in addition to their own homes? [Interruptions]. So with these high property prices, people would perceive that, in fact, Ministers are not really sacrificing than what is made out to be. So this is the problem. And if Ministers are in that kind of situation, in future, it will be difficult for Singapore to have leaders with that moral authority. This is probably the issue. People feel that Ministers are public figures. They, in fact, should do some sacrifice and not benefit from their positions. Probably that is the reason why there is such a hue and cry and also because of the escalation of property prices. Some of them have missed out on the purchases in which they have intended to get but could not get it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chiam, do I understand you that in order for people to respect me, I must be poor?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No. I did not say that at all. I say that they must have a good living. But people perceive that our Ministers now are the best paid in the world, for such a little island, and compared to the majority of wage-earners in Singapore, Ministers are earning the type of salary from public funds which is way beyond their imagination. Many people perceive that. This is one of the problems.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) what were the gross monthly and annual salaries of the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers, Senior Minister, Ministers, Senior Parliamentary Secretaries, Parliamentary Secretaries and Political Secretaries for the years ended 31st December 1994 and
  <br>
  <br>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 1995; and (b) what will be the projected gross monthly salaries of these persons from 1st July 1996.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1994 White Paper on Competitive Salaries for Competent and Honest Government established formal salary benchmarks upon which to peg salaries of Ministers and Administrative Service officers:
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>For Staff Grade I Minister:</i>Two-thirds AVE24 i.e. two-thirds the average principal earned income of the top four individuals from each of six selected professions (bankers, accountants, engineers, lawyers, local manufacturing companies and MNCs); and
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>For Superscale G:</i>15P32 i.e. the average of the principal earned income of the 15th person aged 32 belonging to the same six professions. The salaries for the other political office holders would be interpolated and extrapolated from these two benchmarks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper stated that the Staff Grade I salary would be increased from 48% AVE24 to 60% AVE24, and the Superscale G salary from 75% 15P32 to 100% 15P32, through progressive revisions over a period of three years. The first revision consequential to the White Paper recommendations took effect from 1st July 1995, and the second revision will take place from 1st July 1996. Table 1 shows how the Staff Grade I and Superscale G salary will compare with their salary benchmarks with each revision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 1: Movements of Staff Grade I and Superscale G
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;salaries against their respective private sector benchmarks

                1st Jan 94  1st Jul 95  1st Jul 96  1st Jul 97



Staff Grade I       48%         52%        56%         60%



Superscale G        75%         83%        91%        100%

</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a cross check, PSD has verified the rank order of Ministers' current salaries against the private sector. The White Paper had estimated that when public sector salaries reached 60% of the private sector, a Staff Grade I Minister would rank 134 against private sector earners. But based on the latest IRAS figures of private sector earnings in 1994, at 60% of the private sector average, Ministers would only rank 195. In other words, the private sector has generally moved ahead faster than anticipated, and the target of 60% of the private sector is a conservative one. Please see Table 2 below.
