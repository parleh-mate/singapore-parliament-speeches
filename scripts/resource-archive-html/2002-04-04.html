<div align="center"><b>INCREASE IN PETROL PUMP PRICES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Rationale)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  what  is the rationale for the recent  increase  in

petrol pump prices.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first let me say how honoured I am to

have been asked the first question by the former Speaker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With growing tension in the Middle East, oil prices have

been  going up and we are seeing this reflected in the prices

of petrol.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, petrol pump prices are determined by

market  demand and supply.  Consumer demand for  the  various

grades  of  petrol  determines the overall  demand.   On  the

supply  side, costs depend on several factors, including  the

costs  of  storage and distribution, the prices of crude  oil

and  wholesale petrol, and the foreign exchange rates.  Crude

oil  prices account for about 20% of the pump price.  In  the

short  run,  as  consumer  demand does  not  adjust  rapidly,

changes  in  pump prices generally reflect changes  in  these

cost   factors.    However,  because  of  the   oligopolistic

structure  of  the industry, prices tend to  be  sticky  both

ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) has asked

the oil companies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



to  justify the recent increases in petrol pump prices.   One

of  the oil companies, ExxonMobil, has explained in detail in

the  Straits  Times on 28th March that the rise in  wholesale

petrol  prices  since January this year was the  main  factor

that contributed to its decision to raise petrol pump prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question is whether there is price fixing by the

oil companies.  Looking at the fluctuations, the Ministry  of

Trade and Industry finds no evidence of collusion by the  oil

companies  either  to  restrict supply or  to  raise  prices.

Either  would be frowned upon by the Government and would  be

illegal once we put in place a Competition Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent price increases follow decreases in petrol

prices  last  year.   For the period between  July  2001  and

December  2001,  crude oil prices fell by approximately  26%.

Around the same period, and after taking into account a  time

lag,  petrol pump prices fell by 14%.  Part of this reflected

the  reduction in petrol taxes announced in October  2001  as

part  of the off-Budget measures.  I have circulated a  chart

showing  changes in the prices of crude oil and  petrol  from

1993  to  February  this year.  Last  year,  I  circulated  a

similar chart.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020404/20020404-HA-0740457.gif">Import Price Index for Crude Oil (1998 = 100) and Consumer Price Index for Petrol (1998 = 100) - January 1993 - February 2002</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep the retail market for petrol as competitive as

possible,   our  policy  is  to  facilitate  the   entry   of

independent petrol retailers.  Last year, I announced to  the

House  that  we  were planning to introduce "white  pumpers".

These  are  petrol-pumping facilities annexed to supermarkets

and  commercial buildings.  MND has identified several  sites

but  detailed studies need to be made to ensure that  safety,

traffic  flow  and  environmental requirements  can  be  met.

After  September 11, the security considerations have  become

more severe and this has caused a delay in the sites that  we

intend  to  let  out  for  white pumps.   Some  parties  have

expressed interest to operate these white pumps.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, if there is no

price  fixing among the major petroleum companies, why is  it

that  price  increases are always more or less  by  the  same

quantum  amongst the oil companies, and why is  it  that  the

price increase takes place almost on the same day?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

well   known  phenomenon  in  economics.   When  an  industry

structure reflects high fixed cost and, where there  are  few

players involved, normally, the lowest cost producer will  be

the  price leader and the rest will follow suit.  In such  an

industry, there is a tendency for price instability  and  for

price wars to happen.  So the smaller players have to be very

careful  not to trigger off a chain of events which may  lead

to  price wars and they will normally take the lead from  the

price  leader.   This is called monopolistic  competition  by

some  economists.  It reflects the nature of  competition  in

oligopolistic  structures.  The airline  industry  faces  the

same   problem.   Many  chemical  industries  face  the  same

problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, if that is the case, why is it

that  the  smallest petroleum company in Singapore, which  is

the  Singapore  Petroleum Company,  with  only  five  or  six

outlets  in Singapore has managed to keep its price  low  and

has not increased price and, in fact, is offering a discount?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

know, but I can guess that its position in the market is  too

small  for  it  to cause sufficient reaction from  the  other

players.  Oil companies compete in different ways, some offer

free  tissue paper, some offer loyalty programmes.  So  there

are  different  ways  to  compete and  to  hold  on  to  your

customers.   The  question is: should MTI  intervene  in  the

market?   We  should intervene if it is clear that  there  is

abuse of dominant position, or if there is price fixing.   As

I said, if you look at the chart which I have distributed and

if  I may draw Members' attention to it, we have two indices,

one is crude oil prices which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



fluctuate  quite  a  lot and are going up  again  because  of

tension in the Middle East.  Then we have fluctuating with  a

time  lag, in a much more sticky way, variations in the price

of  premium petrol.  I can understand why as consumers we get

very  upset  when  we see pump prices going  up.   When  pump

prices  go down, it attracts less attention.  This is natural

as  consumers.  These indices reflect nominal prices.  If you

look  at  the price in January this year and compare  it  to,

say, January 1993, nominal prices have not changed very much.

But I do not think that on the basis of prices we can draw an

automatic  conclusion  that  oil companies  are  deliberately

fixing oil prices at high levels.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> One last question, Sir. Would it not

be more logical to suggest that the larger oil companies, and

quite  naturally, will enjoy larger economies of  scale  than

the smallest oil company and they are in a better position to

follow  the  price set by the smallest company  which  is,  I

presume, still making good profits?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

familiar  with the prices offered by these five SPC  outlets.

I  do  not know whether they have the same loyalty programme,

whether they offer the same free gifts and points ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> $1.234 less 10%.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Do they offer the same points?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> No.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Consumers will make their own

decision whether they want to collect points, or whether they

want  to  take lower upfront prices.  But let us say that  Mr

Tan  is right that these five outlets offer prices which  are

much lower than the other retail outlets, then consumers will

vote  with their wheels, which means that when new sites  are

available  for  tendering, SPC will be able to  offer  higher

prices   for   these  sites  because  they  are   much   more

competitive.  In other words, the market should  be  able  to

resolve this problem, if there is a problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> The

Minister tries to justify that there is no price fixing among

the oil companies.  So he tries to use the crude oil price in

relation to the premium petrol price.  If you really look  at

the  drastic increase and fluctuations of the crude oil price

as  compared with the relatively moderate fluctuation of  the

premium petrol price from the chart, I would like to ask  the

Minister  does  he  arrive  at the conclusion  that,  at  the

moment,  in fact, the oil companies are making lesser  profit

as a result of the adjustment of the pump price.  That is the

first question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that the chart does not reflect

the  profit level of the oil companies.  I think what  people

are  actually unhappy about is the high petrol price and that

has resulted in high profits by the petroleum companies.   So

if  you  look  at the international petroleum spot  price,  I

would like the Minister to comment whether I am right or  not

on  this particular matter.  The international petroleum spot

price for 98 RON petrol ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, could you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> I am asking my question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please do so.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> I am asking the Minister

whether I am right or not.  The 98 RON petrol price based  on

the  international petroleum spot price on  12th  March  this

year  was  32.9  cents per litre and the  pump  price,  after

deduction of the Government tax, the margin gained  was  42.4

cents.   Assuming  that I am not familiar with  the  cost  of

operation  -  the  cost  is  not much  because  we  are  very

competitive in terms of our so-called business costs  -  they

are  making 130% margin from the international petroleum spot

price.  I would like to ask the Minister whether this kind of

margin is  acceptable.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

really  in a position to answer that question.  The  data  is

not available to me.  We do not require them to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



presented  or audited by any regulatory agency.   It  may  be

that  there  is  a  higher  margin,  but  then  the  cost  of

distributing petrol is not cheap either.  They  have  got  to

tender for the sites.  They have got to ensure that safety is

maintained.   They have got to hire people, many  operate  24

hours.   The cost structure varies from industry to industry,

from  product to product, and the fact that there is  a  high

margin over the wholesale price, by itself, does not indicate

anything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A matter of principle is this. Should Government be

concerned  with  whether oil companies are  making  money  or

losing  money?   If we decide that we are going  to  regulate

prices  and  regulate profits, then there is no  end  to  it.

Some  years  ago, one major oil company protested strenuously

to  MTI  that MND was releasing more sites for petrol  pumps.

It  had earlier tendered for sites thinking that we are going

to restrict the number of these sites and so it paid a lot of

money at the tender.  So he came to me and said, "Look.  Yes,

it  was not legal but surely there was an understanding."   I

said, "I am sorry.  MND has its own policy on the release  of

sites  for  petrol  pumps and these are the  risks  that  you

take."   So we are not responsible for the losses they  make,

neither  are we responsible for the profits they  make.   But

for  Dr  Low's exact question as to whether the  margins  are

justifiable  or  not,  I  am in no  position  to  answer  his

question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  ask the Minister what measure will MTI consider  to

ensure  that  consumers'  interest  will  be  safeguarded  in

sectors  like  this where there is little or no  competition.

Besides  white  pumps, how can we introduce more  competition

into the petrol retail sector?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are open

to  suggestions.   White pump was an  idea  suggested  to  us

slightly  over a year ago and we thought it was a good  idea.

White  pumps  are available in some countries, like  Britain,

where  they have attained a certain market share  and  so  we

decided to introduce them.  If CASE



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



or  anyone  here  has  got ideas on  how  to  introduce  more

competition  to the business, MTI keeps an open mind.   There

is no reason for us to want to restrict competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our general policy towards the economy is that

competition  is  good and competition should  be  encouraged.

Should  we  regulate to ensure competition,  like  through  a

Competition Law, which is the question which has been  raised

a few times in this House?  There is a draft being circulated

among  the  Ministries and various economic agencies.   There

are  a  lot of problems because, sometimes, when you regulate

to  force competition, you may in fact end up creating  anti-competitive  practices and imposing  a  higher  cost  on  the

economy.   The  key  is  to regulate, but  regulate  lightly.

Right  now,  the various regulatory agencies are  responsible

for   competitive behaviour within the sectors they regulate,

eg, in telecoms, power, health care or whatever.  But whether

there  should  be  an  overarching  competition  law,  it  is

something that we are now considering seriously.  We have not

decided  definitely to proceed.  It is likely that  we  will,

but  the  details are very important and we are  making  sure

that  before  we  present  a Bill  to  this  House,  we  have

consulted widely with the industries.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I  ask  the Minister whether the increase in oil  prices

will  lead to an increase in electricity tariffs, and whether

the  Government  will  soften the  impact  on  consumers  and

businesses, if there is any such increase.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The increases in energy prices

must  be  reflected in electricity tariffs.  I think that  is

necessary.   We  must  ensure that  the  signals  get  passed

through  to  the  economy so that every  consumer  and  every

industry  makes  its own adjustments to these price  signals.

Should the Government ameliorate it?  I would be against  the

Government ameliorating it directly, because then we would be

making  electricity artificially cheaper and, if  we  do  so,

there will be an over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



consumption  of electricity.  But the Government  can  always

ameliorate  its  effects through income support,  which  this

Government does from time to time.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> The Minister does not seem

to answer my question whether the profits are acceptable.   I

would  like  to ask the Minister, because he touched  on  the

issue of tender prices for petrol kiosks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the tender prices that have been accepted in

the  past, I would like the Minister to comment whether I  am

right  that  they  are  still very profitable  based  on  the

following  scenario.  When a petrol station is available  for

tender  and the land is about 30,000 square feet, the  common

tender price will be around $10 million.  If we work that out

in  simple  mathematical terms, it will be  around  $300  per

square  foot for a 30-year lease.  If, let us say  the  price

works  out  to be equivalent to a 99-year lease,  the  tender

price  for  a  petrol  station in a  noisy,  dirty  and  very

unattractive  roadside would be even more than  that  for  an

Oxley  Road residential land.  If they tender for a piece  of

land  at  that kind of price and the profit is not good,  why

should they do so?  Could the Minister prove that I am wrong.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

quite  sure  I understand the point of Prof. Low's  question.

If  it  is so self-evident that running a petrol kiosk is  so

profitable, then I am quite sure that the next time sites are

available, Prof. Low will be one of those who will tender for

those sites.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, I accept the challenge

if I can run a petrol company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for  allowing me to join in the debate.  Today is the  fourth

day  of  this debate.  As more than 40 speakers have  already

risen  to  speak, I would just like to focus on a  couple  of

specific  issues.   I support the Motion  of  Thanks  to  the

President moved by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.

<br><br><i>Competition is global</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President has highlighted the

immense   challenges  we  face  and  the  impact  of   global

competition.  Indeed, competition is global and is coming not

just  from  China and the region.  The World  Economic  Forum

recently    reported   that   Singapore's    global    growth

competitiveness has slipped two notches from second to fourth

placing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, Singapore has been holding the No. 1 or

No. 2 position, and our good rating has been well publicised.

But  little has been said about the drop in our ranking  this

time  round.   For the first time, we have been overtaken  by

Finland  and  Canada.   Fast closing  up  behind  us  include

Australia, Norway and Taiwan, whose rankings have improved by

three to nine positions within one year.

<br><br><i>The need to stay ahead</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do to tackle the present challenges determines

our  future.   Do  we despair and lose hope, do  nothing  and

allow others to overtake us?  Do we dismiss it and be content

with the slack,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



thinking  that things must somehow get better when the  world

economy gets moving again?  Or are we content to say there is

no  need  to stay at the top all the time?  If our answer  to

the  above questions is yes, we run the risk of being  tossed

out  of  the  race and get left behind.  We  have  to  regain

speed, make bold strides to catch up and stay ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not be daunted by the challenges before us. We

must  not be disheartened or feel hopeless.  On the contrary,

we  can turn them to our advantage.  We can do with a healthy

dose  of  the  "siege mentality".  We, like the employees  of

successful global companies, should be driven with a sense of

urgency  and purpose.  We must not be complacent.  Microsoft,

the  No. 1 PC software company, has been described to  behave

as if it were No. 2 and trying to play catch-up all the time.

Nokia succeeded in overtaking its much larger competitors who

had  the first-mover advantage.  Now that Nokia is No. 1,  it

fights  even harder to stay ahead.  These companies all  know

that  once  you slip, you can go all the way down  and  never

return to the days of glory.

<br><br><i>Challenges not unique</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenges Singapore faces are not unique. I would

like  to add to what Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee said yesterday

about Hong Kong with my own personal observations.  I was  in

Zhuhai,  China, last week.  I took the ferry to Hong Kong  on

Good  Friday  to  catch the SQ flight back home.   Going  the

other way were thousands of Hongkongers leaving Hong Kong for

mainland China.  The ferries were packed and we had to  fight

through  long  queues  of  people  waiting  to  buy  tickets.

Hongkongers go to Macau, Zhuhai and Shenzhen by the  hundreds

of  thousands everyday for dinner, movies and other forms  of

entertainment.  On a bad day, one has to stand more than  one

hour  to  clear immigration at the Hong Kong-Shenzhen  border

crossing.   Things are cheaper across the waters.  People  go

where  they find better value for their money, especially  in

these lean times.  When money



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



was  aplenty, people found it inconvenient to travel a little

distance, just to save some money.  But, now, where  they  do

not  make  thousands of dollars in one day  just  buying  and

selling  shares, or hundreds of thousands of  dollars  buying

and selling properties, every dollar counts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst it is important for us to build first-class

infrastructure  and  facilities and adopt  the  world's  best

practices,  we  have to be mindful of the  cost  burden  that

local businesses have to bear which, in turn, would translate

into higher prices for the consumers.  Sir, to overcome this,

we  have to attract and retain good businesses to our  shores

which  will in turn generate the purchasing power to  support

other local businesses and make this a thriving place.

<br><br><i>People - the differentiating factor</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then do we achieve competitive differentiation in

this   global  environment?   Others  can  import  the   same

technology  and  talent  to build the  same  or  even  better

factory,  airport and seaport.  It must be the people  factor

that is our strategic resource.  Responding to the challenges

we  face  means  that  we, the people,  have  to  change  our

mindset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to cite an example. A couple of years ago, I

did  some  renovations to my house and wanted  some  lighting

points  fixed up.  The main contractor, who drove a  Mercedes

Benz,  asked  me  to show him where I wanted  those  lighting

points.   So I went round the house with him and pointed  out

the  spots.   The next day, another man, the electrical  sub-contractor, came round in a Honda Accord and told me that  he

understood I wanted some lights to be put up and he asked  me

to  show him where.  I did that.  The next day, two men  came

on a 50cc Honda Cub with Johor number plates and told me that

they were there to do the job and asked me to show them where

I wanted the lights to be installed.

<br><br><i>Knowledge acquisition and skill development</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first word in "KBE" is "knowledge". We cannot

merely be brokers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



and middlemen in a knowledge-based economy.  Our workers, our

people,  must  change their mindset and their attitudes.   We

must want to acquire knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A manager of an MNC shared this observation with me. He

said  that while Singapore workers are hardworking,  they  do

not  have  an inquiring mind.  When a sophisticated high-tech

piece  of  equipment is installed, our workers are  generally

quite  contented  to  be told how to operate  the  equipment.

They  do  not have the desire to go beyond that  and  try  to

fathom   the   "whys"  and  the  "hows".   They   will   take

instructions  on  how to operate it and,  if  something  goes

wrong, the company has to call in the foreign experts.  It is

like  buying  a  car and learning how to  drive  it  and  not

wanting  to  open the bonnet.  If something goes wrong,  call

the   workshop.    I   know  today's   automobiles   are   so

sophisticated that there is nothing an amateur  mechanic  can

do  if  it  breaks down, but I hope we know at least  how  to

change the tyre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need to acquire the whole technology. Let me

cite this example.  I know a Norwegian.  He is spending a lot

of  his  time now in Singapore.  For many years,  he  was  an

engineer in Norway installing and maintaining pumps  for  oil

companies in the North Sea.  These pumps are part of a larger

system.   He  just  concentrated on the pumps.   But  he  was

willing to stick to his area of expertise and, in the  course

of  his many years of experience, he found out which areas in

the  pump can be improved for better performance.  Today,  he

owns a number of patents and he is here selling his own pumps

to our GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move up the economic ladder and progress to the

more  unstructured "innovation" state, we need to be thinkers

and  not  just  mere doers.  We need people who question  the

given  and  seek new ways to improve.  We need to breed  more

risk-takers and foster an entrepreneurial spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there seems to be a misconception that

entrepreneurs are necessarily school drop-outs.  I know there

are a few laudable examples of drop-outs who made it big.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



Their  success  stories grab media attention  and  create  an

impression  that university education is a hindrance  to  the

development of entrepreneurship.  Perhaps, when opportunities

are  aplenty,  it is those with less formal education,  those

who  have  to  take bigger risks, who have found  alternative

routes  to  success.  But in today's competitive  world,  one

must not disregard the acquisition of knowledge and skills to

have a fighting chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Managing Director of an MNC told me that the most

creative  person  in  his  company is  the  Chief  Technology

Officer who has doctorates in a number of disciplines and who

is  willing  to  think out of the box.  With  his  wealth  of

technical knowledge and his years of practical experience, he

is  able  to come up with very creative solutions to  complex

problems,   something  that  a  younger  person,  with   less

technical  know-how and less training, would not be  able  to

do.   While  we  celebrate  the success  stories  of  instant

entrepreneurs,  we must not forget the tens of  thousands  of

scientists,  researchers and developers  who  toil  away  and

churn  out  patents by the millions and help to  sustain  the

technological development of the largest MNCs of  this  world

and make these successful MNCs what they are today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are no short cuts. The days of easy money

are  gone for now.  We must be realistic and go back  to  the

basics, to the virtue of work and enterprise.

<br><br><i>Developing strong local enterprises</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although MNCs have and will continue to play a critical

role  in  our  economic development,  we  have  to  pay  more

attention  to developing local enterprises.  It is time  that

we developed our own indigenous proprietary technology.

<br><br><i>Cultivating innovative ideas</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the Government has done much in trying

to   create   an   environment  conducive   for   innovation.

Individual  risk-taking is encouraged and  failures  are  not

looked  down  upon.   The  various  economic  agencies,   the

universities   and  the  research  institutions   are   being

restructured to meet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



the  new  challenges.  Local enterprises have tapped  various

Government  sponsored  schemes to  their  benefit.   Funding,

grants, tax incentives are in general not an issue for  those

who  have  a  good idea.  But for start-ups, what  is  really

lacking   here  is  a  first  "reference  site"   where   the

entrepreneur  can use to fine-tune his ideas  for  commercial

deployment.  In a larger, more competitive economy  like  the

US,  there  are  hundreds of competitors  out  there  in  any

industry, each of them willing to try something new, with the

hope  that  it  is  a killer application  and  wipe  out  the

competition.   It  is  not a problem knocking  on  doors  and

finding  someone willing to give a new idea, a new method,  a

go.  But in a small economy like ours, this must be nurtured.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budding talents need a good break in their home

ground to build a track record or reference sites before they

can  hope  to  debut and achieve success in  the  competitive

global  stage.  We need to engineer some form of  demand-side

innovation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has been described as clean, efficient,

safe,  and  lately,  even  a  funky  place.   In  the  global

competition  among city states, branding and positioning  are

crucial  to  attract  the right talents and  businesses.   In

addition to the above mentioned descriptions of Singapore,  I

think we should put ourselves on the map as "the laboratory",

the place to experiment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh mentioned yesterday that we should set

up  a  string of technology and research centres  around  the

world  where talent is found instead of having just  one  big

centre  in Singapore.  I would like to disagree with him.   I

would  like  Singapore to be an even bigger laboratory  where

R&D  spill out of the confines of R&D centres into the  field

and  the  streets  -  Singapore as one big  integrated  field

laboratory for all ideas from all over the world, a  proofing

ground  for  innovation and ideas.   Let  it  be  known  that

whoever  in any part of the world who has a bright  idea  can

come to Singapore and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



we  have  the environment to let him or her try it out.  Tell

all the talents out there in the world that this is the place

to  be  in.  After all, it has been said that we are  a  good

place  to  attract pharmaceutical companies to try out  their

drugs  here  because  we are a cosmopolitan  city  with  many

races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true for other industries. We have it all

here in a small concentrated place.  So if someone has a  new

idea about using natural gas, we should let him try out on  a

few  of  our buses.  If he has innovation on how to light  up

our HDB common corridors more efficiently, let him deploy  it

in  some  precincts.   Of  course, we  have  to  structure  a

business  relationship  where we have  an  equity  stake  and

benefit  from  the  resulting  technology  and  anchor   that

technology  in Singapore for commercial deployment  in  other

parts of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years back, a water specialist from a French water

treatment company told me that we were very particular  about

certain  properties  of  our water  and  that  made  it  very

expensive  to  process  compared to our treatment  processes.

But  the  water  is very good.  Everyone knows Singapore  has

very high quality tap water.  I recall DPM Lee saying our tap

water tastes good and he misses drinking our water when he is

overseas.  But we use the French technology and they use  us,

our  good reputation, our good brand name, to pitch for water

projects  in  China.   To  convince the  Chinese  that  their

technology  is superior, this French company told  them  that

the Singapore Government is using it and therefore it must be

good.  Sir, our good brand name goes a long way.  It is  like

you want to buy this PC.  You think this is a good PC?  It is

'Intel  inside'.   You think Nestle has  good  SCM  and  ERP?

Nestle runs SAP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not leverage sufficiently on our top class brand

name  and  we  become a showcase for foreign  technology.   I

think  it  is about time that our local enterprises went  out

and  say  to  prospective customers  that,  "Yes,  I  have  a

reference  site in Singapore.  Come and evaluate  it."   That

reference  site can be more crucial than the monetary  grants

and tax incentives that are dished out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who love gardening know that to grow a rare bloom,

one needs to give special care and attention to the seedling.

Sometimes  you need to find a space to erect a  hothouse  and

allow   the  seeds  to  germinate  and  grow.   Occasionally,

grafting   and  hybrid  help  to  reproduce  better   quality

variables.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating innovation is like cultivating the rare bloom.

Bigger   organisations,  whether  GLCs,   statutory   boards,

Government agencies or bigger local boys, can play a  crucial

role   in  partnering  smaller  local  enterprise  to  enable

innovation to take root in Singapore.  This can be a  win-win

proposition  for  all  as  they have  distinct  complementary

advantages but share the same global aspirations.  Instead of

both   trying  to  compete  with  each  other,  a   strategic

partnership   can  be  forged  whereby  bigger  organisations

provide  the  environment for solution deployment  while  the

entrepreneur exercises his innovative spirit and creativity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, success cannot be achieved based on economic

factors  alone.  We also need to strengthen the  non-economic

factors or "soft" infrastructures that support our growth and

development.  Political and social stability top the list  in

the factors affecting foreign investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our multi-racial, multi-religious society, the

underlying  social  fabric is like a  beautiful  hand-knitted

sweater.   Inevitably, there will be a few  frays  and  loose

ends.  If we keep tugging at the loose thread and continue to

pull  at  it with no regard to the consequences, we  run  the

risk of unravelling the needlework and destroying all that we

have built painstakingly over the years.  In our own way,  we

have   strived  for  unity  in  our  cultural  and  religious

diversity.  As Singaporeans, we know that regardless of race,

language  or  religion, we share the same destiny.   This  is

particularly so in a small country like ours.   In  a  bigger

country, we can stay a lifetime in Chinatown and not interact

with  the other communities.  A prominent Chinese businessman

who  runs  a  business that is worth hundreds of millions  of

dollars in a large neighbouring country told me recently that

racial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



relations in his country are good and will not pose a problem

in  future.   He  sends his children to Chinese  schools  and

later  to  overseas universities.  He does  not  have  to  do

business  nor come into contact unnecessarily with the  other

races.  He has enough space to operate, mind his own business

and  survive.   But in our small country, with a closely-knit

society, we are one big community.  Community bonding, mutual

understanding  and  respect are pre-requisite  to  peace  and

prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have placed their trust in the Government,

just  like the patients pinning their hopes on their  doctor.

In  this case, there is no panacea for a quick cure.  We have

to  work together to regain our strength and health, even  if

it  means  swallowing  the bitter  pill,  even  if  it  means

suffering some short-term pain.  We have taken good  care  of

ourselves in the past.  Our body constituents are strong.  We

will find the best prescription to fight this bout of attack.

We will develop a greater resilience and emerge stronger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my great grandparents

came  from  India and China over 100 years ago to  Singapore.

They  were  immigrants.  The less charitable would say,  they

were opportunists who came in search for a better life and to

make a living for themselves and their family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two nights ago, my son, 11 years old, five generations

later,  asked  me, "Daddy, if there is a war, why  should  we

fight  for  Singapore?"  It was a question which I could  not

answer fully because  I was rushing to drop him off somewhere

and  going  off  for  my MPS.  But it  is  a  question  which

troubles me and haunts me even now as I speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look at the television, newsreels and the

newspapers, you see Palestinians, suicide bombers, young  men

and young women.  Rightly or wrongly, whether you believe  in

them or not, the point is that these people have a cause  and

have an ideal for which they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



dying  for.   And in Singapore we have our younger generation

asking, "What is it about this place, why should I fight  for

it?   What  happens  if I die?"  We just  came  back  from  a

holiday  in Australia and my son said, "Look, there  is  more

space  there, it is less crowded, we can get a  car,  we  can

drive around.  What is the point of sticking it out here?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then yesterday, I was having a chat with one of our

Mayors, who said that every time she is asked to be a  guest-of-honour at a National Service passing-out parade, it brings

tears  to  her  eyes.  She is a serious person who  does  not

exaggerate.   I  believed her and asked her why.   She  said,

"Well, because we might send these young men one day to their

death."   I  am  a  doctor and we would like  to  think  that

doctors deal with life and death.  I look around here  and  I

realise  that in this Chamber, in your hearts and minds   you

too discuss life and death issues.  You will or will not send

our  people  towards a better life, and  a  better  life  may

sometimes mean the ultimate sacrifice and these are difficult

things which we would have to face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are the real issues or real questions facing us

as  a country, as a nation, at this stage?  I want to make  a

couple  of points.  My son will not understand them now,  but

maybe  he  will  read the Hansard years hence and  understand

that this speech is for him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that Singapore is an artificial country.

Secondly, that we are subject to external forces which we  do

not  have  absolute control over and these forces  will  play

within our turf, within our country.  Thirdly, whilst we talk

about  filling the stomachs of our population,  we  must  not

forget  to  fill  the hearts and minds of  our  people.   And

fourthly,  as leaders down here, I remember Dr Wang's  speech

yesterday,  in  a sense, we need to be able to  spell  out  a

vision,  to give hope, to give guts and to build the  ability

of our people.  Because if we do not do that, our country has

failed and we would have failed our duties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the first point - an artificial country.

Geographically, if you go back far enough in time, geological

ages,   Singapore  is  at  the  southern  tip  of  the  Malay

Peninsula.   In fact, the Johore river and all  those  things

that  we  are  so  concerned about now for our  water  supply

probably ran through Singapore and probably its riverbed  was

somewhere  in  the  east  coast of Singapore.   There  is  no

geographical  reason  for the existence of  Singapore  except

that  the sea level went up and so now an island forms.   Now

all  this  ruckus about reclamation is almost  ironic  humour

that geography and geology are playing on us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History, yes, the Malays had come here first and we

regard them as the indigenous people of Singapore because the

Constitution  says that.  And the rest of our ancestors  came

here.   Again, is there a historical reason for Singapore  to

exist?   You go far back in time - the Sri Majapahit  empire,

Sri  Vijaya - you can always say, "Well, this is part of  the

Rhio  Archipelago, part of Indonesia, part of Malaysia,  part

of  Johore".  You can go back endlessly.  There is no natural

historical reason for the existence of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Size, we are very, very small. No doubt my Ministry is

doing its best to increase it but the fact is even after  our

extreme  efforts, it will still be very very small.  We  are,

in  a sense, trying to be Downtown Manhattan, without upstate

New  York, without the hinterland of the United States.   And

yet,  we  have to be a country, we have to be a  nation.   We

have   our  own  airport,  seaport,  Armed  Forces,   Police,

Parliament.   Again,  there  is no  natural  reason  for  our

existence as a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the composition of our people? A normal

definition  of  a  nation is a group of  people  with  shared

characteristics,  a  shared history,  a  shared  language,  a

shared religion, who happen to congregate and multiply  in  a

certain  area.   Our  multi-racial  composition  between  the

Chinese,  Malays,  Indians  and  others  is  not  a   natural

development.   It occurred because Stamford Raffles  happened

to come along here.  He decided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



that  he  liked the harbour.  Selective immigration  occurred

even  150 years or more ago.  It is a freak of circumstances,

not   a  natural  occurrence.   We  are  different  from  our

surrounding  neighbours, in terms of our  ethnic  composition

and  of  our outlook.  This is, after all, still a city-state

where  the  Chinese  race is the dominant  race,  as  far  as

numbers  are concerned, and that makes us different from  our

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no reason for Singapore to exist from a

natural  geographical,  historical, size  or  racial  reason;

which  then brings us to thinking why are we here  today  and

why  does  Singapore exist.  It exists because of a  man-made

obsession with an ideal called multi-racialism.  We  did  not

seek our independence for economic reasons or even to make  a

living.  We could make a living as a British colony, as  Hong

Kong  did  for a long time.  We could still make a living  as

part  of Malaysia, as the Chinese in Malaysia continue to  do

so.    But  we  were  thrown  out  of  Malaysia  and  we  got

independence because of this belief that we wanted  a  multi-racial place, a Singaporean Singapore, where all of us  would

have  our  chance to have our day in the sun.   That  was  an

artificial   ideal  which  was  promulgated  by   our   first

generation, which caught on amongst the population.   And  we

said,  "OK, fine, as an act of faith, we will do it,  and  we

will create a nation."  And whether you want to call it luck,

circumstance or whatever, the point is, we succeeded  and  we

got here today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, external forces. This is supposed to be a debate,

but  I  have been intrigued by the fact that there  has  been

almost  universal agreement among all the MPs, including  the

Opposition,   on   the  external  forces  impinging   on   us

economically. They all talked about globalisation, about  new

technologies, about free market.  There is actually no debate

about the recipe for economic growth.  The debate, if any, is

about  the implications of these three forces on our  society

and how we are going to deal with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take an even broader perspective, what is

happening really is what the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



Tofflers  called the "Third wave of change in  civilisation".

Ten  thousand years ago, when mankind discovered agriculture,

society  changed because they stayed put in one place.   Land

was  important.   They grew their crops.   Extended  families

were important because that was their labour source.  And  if

they grew enough crops and the weather was kind to them, they

had surpluses and they stored up.  That was the original CPF.

They prepared for a rainy day, and life went on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrial revolution occurred about 300-400 years

ago.   In  this case, it is not the farm any more, which  was

the  main source of wealth, but the factory.  Families became

nuclear  families  instead of extended  families.   Political

power  changed  from  a feudal structure  that  characterises

agricultural   society  to  the  two  competing   models    - representative democracy versus totalitarian socialism.  With

the  fall  of the Berlin Wall, we know which political  model

won as far as running an industrial age society is concerned.

Economically, it was about land; it was about labour; it  was

about  capital.  But what is happening now, when we  talk  of

the  information  age and knowledge-based  economy,  is  that

another  paradigm or sea change has occurred in the means  of

production  of wealth.  It is now about ideas.  It  is  about

social capital, and it is still about money, except it is now

global and it is moving very, very quickly.  And what we  are

still trying to find out and we still do not have answers for

is:   what  does  this mean to us politically,  socially  and

culturally?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Parliament. This is a form of representative

democracy.   We  are supposed to represent our  constituents.

But  you and I  know fully well that in this day and age,  it

is  impossible for any one person to claim or to pretend that

he represents all views.  We come here as colleagues with our

own  set  of beliefs, ideas, prejudices and biases.  We  hope

that  it  reflects what the larger society feels  and  thinks

about  it,  but it is not so simple.  When we cast the  vote,

does that mean every single person out there agrees with  us?

This  whole  thing about having Parliament and representative

democracy may not actually work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



in  the  future.   You  can, in a sense,  have  the  ultimate

expression of democracy because, after all, in a world  where

everybody  is  always on and always connected, do  you  still

need  Parliament?  Well, that may be for a debate in a couple

of  decades  or a hundred years from now.  But the  point  is

there is a change, and it is just that we do not have all the

answers to that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an optimistic side to the knowledge-based

economy.  Because in the knowledge-based economy, as  opposed

to  an industrial economy, land, capital, machinery and cheap

labour become less important.  It is about ideas; it is about

systems; it is about organisation; it is about branding,  and

these   are  all  things  which  Singapore  has  an  inherent

advantage in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this knowledge-based economy will cause problems

and  will cause dislocation, but we are actually ahead of the

curve.   And  the  fact that we worry about  it  and  we  are

thinking about it now actually gives us hope that we will  be

amongst  the  first people, the first wave of nations  to  be

able to take advantage of this revolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another side to this issue of

globalisation.  As the world becomes smaller and smaller, and

more  and more things become common, we sometimes forget that

whilst civilisations can change, 10,000 years is a very, very

short  time  in  evolutionary  terms.   Our  genes  have  not

changed,  certainly  not in the last  10,000  years  or  even

longer.   Therefore, human nature has not changed.  And  what

we  are  experiencing  now  is  the  clash  of  a  change  in

environment impinging and impacting on basically an unchanged

human  nature.   So,  in  this world  which  is  increasingly

interconnected  and global, we are suddenly  realising  that,

hey,  how  I  feel and how I think actually disconnects  with

what is happening around me and what I see around me.  And so

we  get  this  movement which we loosely call fundamentalism.

It  is  a human reaction against changes which we feel or  we

fear we have no control over, and which we feel or we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



fear dehumanises us.  Because, after all, the knowledge-based

economy  does not confer meaning, identity, purpose of  life,

solidarity,  love,  comfort.  It does not provide  all  these

things.   But  as  humans, we still need these  things.   And

fundamentalism is basically a reaction against that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before we start pinning labels on people and saying

these  are terrorists and these are not, sticking it even  to

religious  labels,  remember that underneath  all  this,  are

much,  much  deeper  tectonic  shifts.   It  is  a  clash  of

environment versus human nature.  And Singapore, as this tiny

dot,  bobbing  around in the sea, surrounded by tsunamis,  is

not immune to these changes.  Our key challenge therefore has

to  be how to manage some of the problems or consequences  of

these  changes,  key  amongst  which  are  the  economic  and

cultural  disparities.   And  this  is  where  you  see   the

opposition, and us disagree.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about economics first. We agree that we

have to connect ourselves to the world.  We have improved our

technology.  We have to have education, and we have  to  have

free trade.  We are all agreed on that.  We also accept,  all

of  us  on  both  sides  of the House,  that  there  will  be

increasing disparities in the income spread.  There  are  two

solutions in front of you when you see an increase in  income

spread.  Do not get on the bandwagon, in which case everybody

stays  the  way we are now.  But it is not possible,  because

staying put means you sink to the bottom of the sea.   Or  we

say  that  we  will accept that there will be  an  increasing

income  disparity, but the issue is what do we do  for  those

who  are falling behind.  And the metaphor which I could  use

is  that, yes, we have all talked about safety nets to  catch

people  who  fall.   But at what point does  the  safety  net

becomes a hammock, where you can fall and lie there and  say,

"This  is  good enough.  I don't need to get  up."   At  what

stage  do you have to convert a safety net into a trampoline,

so  that  you can say, "Yes, I've fallen off, but there's  an

inherent spring in this, and I can use it to bounce back up."

And  the  way to bounce back up, although it may be something

which our population does not want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



to   hear,  is  about  training,  education,  retooling   and

reskilling.  There is no other way to bounce back up from  an

economy which is changing, because your job has gone, because

someone else is doing it more cheaply, or a robot is doing it

more  efficiently, or because nobody needs that job any more.

So  we have got to find ways to convert our safety nets  into

trampolines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we still need the trapeze, because you

need  some people to do those high flying, dare-devil stunts.

And  do not say, "Well, if you get to fly up on that trapeze,

you  will  be  a star and everyone else will be a  pedestrian

watching."  We have to allow people to go up on the  trapeze.

Let  some of them succeed, bring glory to the whole act.  But

at  the same time, we still have got our safety nets, because

some  of them will also fall.  And when they fall, hopefully,

they will bounce back up because we have converted our safety

nets into trampolines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Culturally, it is not enough to say that we exist

because we want to be an independent nation.  We draw on  our

historical ethnic roots, whether it be from China,  Malaysia,

India  or  the West.  But we cannot rely on them  because  in

Singapore, this peculiar multi-racial mix and this  political

formula  that  we  have is unique.  You cannot  rely  on  the

models  which existed in the past or the models  which  exist

currently  in Malaysia, India, China or the West  to  use  as

lessons  for  how we need to do it.  Our ethnic  groups  must

realise  that  isolation  is not  an  option.   Reverting  to

medieval times is not an option.  Copying other countries  is

not  an option.  We have got to understand this principle  of

co-determinism, that what happens to the Malays, the  Chinese

or  the Indians in Singapore is not something which you  will

decide individually as a Malay, a Chinese or an Indian.  When

people  talked  about  collective leadership  for  the  Malay

community, what they did not understand is this concept of co-determinism.  The ultimate fate of the Malays in Singapore is

going to be determined not by the Malays alone, but by all of

us  and, similarly, for the Indians and for the Chinese.  And

if we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



start  creating a system where we say this is my problem,  my

business  and  I  will  lead it, I will  be  pre-eminent  and

predominant in making decisions on that exclusively, that  is

the  beginning of the end because we will unravel  the  whole

thing.   So  we need to move beyond this.  The Government  is

obsessively  secular,  and I think we must  continue  to  be,

because that is the best guarantee for religious freedom  and

religious security in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about the hearts and the minds. Samuel

Huntington has said that in the future our loyalties will  be

determined by what we believe rather than where we live,  and

this  applies, I think, very much to Singapore.  So, what  do

we believe in?  I share Mr Raymond Lim's views yesterday.  He

said,  yes,  we have done Singapore 21; we have  done  Shared

Values;  Agenda  for Action.  We are even  embarking  on  the

Remaking  of  Singapore.   But,  really,  I  think  the  best

statement of our Shared Values is still encapsulated  in  the

pledge  written, again, by our first generation  leaders  one

year  after  independence.  It is the  concept  of  a  united

people,   regardless  of  race,  language  or   religion,   a

democratic  society, justice and equality, and  all  this  in

pursuit  of  happiness first, then prosperity  and  progress.

These  values, I think, still stand.  It is the philosophical

basis  for the existence of our nation, and it is good enough

to  fill our minds and to continue to fill the minds  of  our

young  people.  For the hearts, my son said, "Well, I suppose

if  my  family is here, my friends are here, it may be  worth

fighting for this place."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get to Parliament from MND, or even to the

Istana from MND, I have to drive past Stamford Road.  I  look

at  the  National Library  -  I am not going to bring  it  up

again for discussion  -  but I look at it with a heavy heart.

I  drive  past  my old school, ACS, I see the  missing  clock

tower  with a heavy heart.  You look at hawker centres  which

have disappeared, it also brings something to you.  It is not

that  we  want  to  resurrect all those  things,  it  is  not

possible, but the fact that we have a heavy heart about it, I

think, is a good sign.  Whether you realise it or not,  there

is emotional rootedness to this place called Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we have been very stiff about saying, wipe out

dialects, wipe out Singlish, but the truth of the matter  is,

there  is emotion resonance in these.  And we have to realise

that,  yes, maybe it still makes sense to remove them but  be

aware of the cost, and be aware that emotional rootedness  is

as  important as material rootedness, as important as  mental

philosophical rootedness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I want to end up by telling my son that, like the

first  generation,  we need to reaffirm  our  faith  in  this

country;  we  need  to say that, yes, this is  an  artificial

country  but it is still my country.  Yes, my ancestors  came

from elsewhere and they were not citizens, but I am different

from  my ancestors because now I have a country and  I  am  a

citizen.   We need to tell our children that, yes, the  world

is in revolution but Singapore will survive.  It will survive

because  we  know who we are, what we stand for,  our  hearts

ache  and belong to something, to some place, to some  ideal.

And what we are going to leave behind is worth an inheritance

and  ultimately worth dying for.  In the final analysis, this

is our Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion, not just going through the motion,

but I support the motion from the bottom of my heart.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, a point of

clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the Minister of State with a heavy heart.

He started by quoting his son.  His son is not too young - 11

years  old,  am  I  right  - and he  is  a  fifth  generation

Singaporean.  And the son asked:  Why should I fight for this

country?  First, I think the Minister of State perhaps should

ask himself why is it that a young boy like him ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Wang, what is your point of

clarification?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Would he not want to ask himself what

is  wrong with our society that for a young boy like  him  to

ask that question?  Is there a failure in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



our  education system or is there a failure in our upbringing

of  the  family?  And, secondly, his son is going to National

Service in seven years' time, so what are we proposing to  do

to educate the young son that by the time he is 18 years old,

he is prepared to spill blood for Singapore, if necessary?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would you like to reply to that, Dr

Balakrishnan?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> I certainly do not want to

blame the schools.  This is a real problem.  And, yes, it  is

the  family; it is society.  But I am being honest with  you.

I  think  if  you ask your own children, to varying  degrees,

this is an issue.  It is something which, I am submitting  to

this  House, is worth us worrying about, thinking about,  and

trying to do something about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to sort out the answers among ourselves first.

Because  what do we tell our children if we have  not  sorted

this  out.   If we cannot, with a good conscience,  send  our

children  out  to fight and to die, then we  really  have  to

worry  about  whether we even have a right to sit  here.   So

these are the reasons why I am telling Members I have a heavy

heart,  I  am worried, and has been hanging over my head,  my

mind and my heart for the last few days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What point are you raising?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I try to find out from him whether he

is  speaking for a minority of Singaporeans or he is speaking

for  all Singaporeans.  I have three sons.  I am prepared  to

send  all  my  sons  to  fight  for  Singapore,  to  die,  if

necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise in support of the motion to thank the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President in his Speech gave a very

comprehensive all-encompassing sketch of the issues faced  by

Singapore today.  Allow me, Sir, to dwell on two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



issues,  namely, globalisation and social cohesion, and  even

in  these  two  areas  I would be speaking  only  on  certain

aspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards globalisation, I see that there are three

types  of  Singaporeans.  The first are those who can  handle

it; the second, those who get by; and the third are those who

find   difficulty.    The   first  group   who   can   handle

globalisation  are those who normally can take  advantage  of

it.   They master the new ropes, they make necessary  changes

and even profit out of it, sometimes quite handsomely too.  I

call them the "global literates".  The second group are those

who   adapt  and  manage  to  get  by.   They  undergo   some

retraining,  some  short-term pains, but they  come  out  all

right in the end.  But the third group finds it difficult  to

adapt,  and  even to retrain.  They remain jobless  for  long

periods,  they accumulate debts and their financial  problems

bring about social ones.  Even if they find alternative jobs,

these are the people who remain static in terms of income.  I

call them the "survivors", not the type who outlasts and gets

$1  million at the end of 39 days, but this is the  type  who

literally barely survives only.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the global literates progress and profit, the

survivors remain as they were.  Thus, there would be an ever-increasing  income gap between the global literates  and  the

survivors.  If unchecked, the increasing gap may bring  about

alienation, envy and social discord.  Sir, three months after

being out of job, a person would feel depressed.  But if this

same person sees his ex-employer driving the same 3-litre car

coming  out of a country club every weekend, the same  person

who  remembers  that the ex-employer was the one  who  talked

about  bad  business, who talked about cost-cutting measures,

who  talked about the unnecessary evils of retrenchment, then

this  person would feel very frustrated and very angry.  That

can bring about social discord.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read reports that arising from the economic

crisis  and  globalisation, companies resort to  cost-cutting

measures.  They streamline, they merge.  But these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



reports  also  say  that  more  often  than  not,  after  the

downsizing  process, most companies do not  earn  more,  they

just spend less.  Further, at the individual level, those  in

the  top management earn more or less the same income,  while

those in the middle and lower rungs are either retrenched  or

have pay reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has put in place many useful measures to

help this third group.  There are short-term schemes such  as

job-matching and EDRS, mid-term solutions such as  retraining

schemes, and even long-term ones such as educating the public

on  the  effects of globalisation and the need  for  lifelong

learning.  But I believe that more could be done by those  in

the first group.  I suggest the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That there be a set of best practices guidelines on

retrenchment  which  does  not only  state  how  retrenchment

should   be  done  but  what  steps  should  be  done  before

retrenchment is even contemplated, for instance,  wage  cuts,

retraining schemes, job placement measures, and so on.  May I

suggest  that the Ministry, the employers and unions  make  a

study  on  these to come out with a set of more comprehensive

guidelines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) I also suggest that there may be a structure to

enable  a  process whereby employers justify  their  proposed

retrenchment  exercise to the Ministry or to the  union,  and

then  advice be given verbally or in writing, and this advice

may  be  given  also to the workers so that the  workers  are

aware of the advice given by the union or the Ministry.  This

makes  the process more transparent and further, since  there

is no legal sanction against employers who refuse to heed the

advice  of the Ministry or the union, my suggestion  provides

some form of social pressure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am wary that we should not apply measures that

deter  present employers from continuing their businesses  or

potential employers from starting ventures here.  Thus, I  am

slow to suggest legislating the process.  But the idea really

is  to  ensure  that  employers  really  have  exhausted  all

measures,   including  looking  at  the   salaries   of   top

management, before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



deciding  that  people  should  lose  their  jobs.   In  this

connection, I also call on the first group to do more to help

the third group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every Singaporean matters, it is said. But this

does not only mean that every Singaporean should be heard  or

should  be  cared for.  It also means that every  Singaporean

should  contribute where he can.  I urge the global literates

to bend backwards a little bit more to help the survivors.  I

recall an advertisement which reads:  "If you have it,  flout

it."   Well, I say:  "Flout if you want and if you must,  but

do  so  by  giving  and contributing.  Stop  showing!   Start

sharing."   I  am aware, Sir, that many global literates  are

already  doing this, and I truly appreciate their effort.   I

am only seeking to encourage others to do their part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also aware that my calls are not in terms of hard

policies but, like the hon. Member before me, I seek to  make

calls  to  the hearts of Singaporeans.  I wish to  compliment

the  call  for policies, backed by sanctions and  enforcement

mechanisms,   to  appeal  to  the  hearts  of   Singaporeans,

especially  the global literates.  Now and then, Singaporeans

are called upon to do some soul-searching and perhaps this is

one  such call.  Soul-searching, Sir, may carry two meanings.

One  is  a search in the soul for something; two, is a search

for  a  soul.  I assume, and I hope rightly so, that  we  all

agree  we  do not need to do the second one.  But I reiterate

my  call  that we search in our soul for the three more  `C's

beyond the five - care, concern, character.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on to my next topic, which is the

President's  discussion  on the movement  from  tolerance  to

appreciation as regards inter-community relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy that we speak of cohesion and not

amalgamation.   In  previous years,  some  suggest  that  the

different  racial, religious and cultural  groups  melt  into

one.  We have since moved away from that concept to one where

we  recognise that differences among the groups are likely to

remain.  So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



we  conjure the image of a mosaic where different  tiles  co-exist  to form a colourful whole.  We have chosen the  mosaic

floor over the melting pot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a closer look at the mosaic floor. By

definition,  the  mosaic floor consists of tiles  of  various

colours, even shapes or sizes.  But for it to be pleasant and

useful,  it has to be coordinated.  There must be someone  or

something  that arranges these tiles so that, together,  they

form  a beautiful pattern.  Without careful arrangement,  the

same  tiles can be a mess and not mosaic.  Or perhaps if  you

have  all yellow tiles on one side, blue tiles on one corner,

green  tiles  in  the  opposite corner, brown  tiles  in  the

middle,  we  may have a floor of tiles but it is not  exactly

mosaic  either.   Thus,  the  arrangement  of  the  tiles  is

important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: who arranges these tiles and how does

he  decide?   Do  the tiles arrange themselves  or  are  they

patterned  by a transcendent force.  I recall that Dr  Vivian

mentioned  about  co-determinism,  and  I  say  that  in  the

Singapore  context, in view of the term "co-determinism",  it

is  a  combination of both the interaction between the  tiles

themselves  and  this transcendent force.  Here,  the  mosaic

imagery perhaps may find itself inadequate because mosaics do

not  move  by  themselves.  But instead of using the  sweater

metaphor  used  by  my  hon. colleague before  Dr  Vivian,  I

believe  it  was Mr Ong, may I suggest a garden instead.   It

consists  of  different  plants  which  had  hitherto   grown

naturally.   They  have hibiscus, aloe vera,  heliconia,  and

even grass.  If properly maintained by a gardener, the garden

is  an exhibition of life and colour.  If not, the aggressive

plants  will  take over and after a few months,  you  have  a

lallang  patch.  But yet, at the same time, if  the  gardener

does  everything, the gardener does not do everything.   Each

plant  or  each type of plant has its own way of  reproducing

itself.   Each type of plant has its own system  of  ensuring

its own uniqueness and its survival.  Yet, hybrids appear  in

forms  not  imaginable before.  The bougainvillea  may  creep

into  loops  and  hang at the most curious places,  sometimes

even among other plants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of inter-community relations, we

acknowledge that each community has traits which  are  unique

to  itself  and each community has an interest to  guard  its

identity.   Yet, every community interacts with  the  others,

without  one having to fear of being subsumed by  the  other.

On  top of it all, it is the common will to ensure peace  and

security  so  as to facilitate the continuous development  of

each  community and to facilitate the meaningful  interaction

among  communities.   The design and  plan  of  the  gardener

represent this common will of the people.  Without the common

will,  there is no nation.  Without the gardener, we have  no

garden.   Belukar, maybe.  Sir, Singapore is indeed a  garden

city in more senses than one may think.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while it may be pleasing to indulge in this garden

metaphor,  in reality, inter-community relations  is  a  very

intricate matter.  To allow each community to retain its  own

unique  characteristics while at the same time moving towards

national  interaction is to unleash two forces that may  pull

in  opposite directions.  I wish to humbly caution  that  the

road to appreciation is arduous.  There are three aspects  of

this road I wish to highlight.  The first is that it requires

each  ethnic religious or cultural group to be more open with

one  another.   For  some, it requires a change  of  mindset.

There  are  many beliefs which the community holds jealously,

kept  to  itself for years and for centuries, but  these  now

have  to  be exposed, lest such secrecy may arouse suspicion.

For  some, it requires a change of environment.  If you  have

been  avoiding discussing sensitive issues in public in order

to  maintain  peace and harmony, now we have to discuss  such

issues  in public in order to pursue the greater appreciation

of peace and harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, there was a short programme on the BBC

regarding the causes of extremism and fundamentalism.  Almost

all the fundamentalists agree that the growth of extremism is

inversely proportionate to freedom of expression.   In  other

words,  the greater the clamp down on expression, the  higher

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



chances  that  these  pent-up emotions  would  be  channelled

through extremist outlets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect of this road to appreciation is that,

by  opening  up,  if not handled carefully,  it  may  have  a

negative effect.  Expressions of differing and opposing views

on   cultural   or   religious  basis  can   heighten   these

differences.   They  can  cause  more  tension   instead   of

cohesion.   The  challenge, of course, is how to  pursue  the

engagement  process in spite of many controversies  that  may

arise as we open the lid on sensitive issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect is the need to maintain and develop a

comfort  base.  Even right now, we cannot discuss the  things

the  way  we do without first obtaining a certain  degree  of

comfort  and  confidence  among each  other.   This  we  have

achieved  over  the years through various measures,  such  as

effective national education, national service, intercultural

activities  and  bilingualism.  These are good  efforts  that

will  maintain  the present comfort level.  But  to  progress

towards appreciation, Sir, we need to do more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow effective engagement on sensitive issues, I

believe that three points must be looked into.  Firstly, each

community must be very clear in themselves of their  position

on  several points.  The first point is that groups  must  be

clear of their position as regards the development or changes

in attitudes of the members of each flock towards their race,

culture or religion.  The variety of such attitudes over time

and space has to be understood.  No group is always static or

totally  homogenous  in its attitude towards  its  own  race,

culture  or  religion.  This variety has to  be  appreciated,

otherwise  we  would  tend to draw general  conclusions  from

specific  instances  and  this does not  reflect  the  actual

situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each group also needs to be clear on its position

regarding    intolerance   and   extremism,   including    an

understanding  of what causes extremism, what factors  affect

extremism and how to counter extremism or intolerance.   Yet,

each group



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



has  to  reconcile  between  its  understandable  desire   to

eventualise, to promote itself, yet at the same  time,  being

mindful of contradicting positions taken by other groups with

the need to maintain the comfort base.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each group, Sir, also needs to clarify for itself how it

views  interaction among different groups  in  the  physical,

restricted   confines   of  Singapore   island,   reclamation

notwithstanding.  We wish to avoid a situation whereby inter-group  relations are progressing, but at the same time inter-group  relations  are having strains.  In this  regard,  each

group  should identify the items within its own value  system

that  has  the  potential to cause conflict with  the  second

nature  of the state and conflicts with other groups.   These

items that can cause conflict have to be honestly dealt  with

in a manner that moves towards the long-term outcome of peace

and harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, each group also has to have a clear

position as regards the role of race, religion and culture in

the  long-term future.  Inter-group appreciation is  a  long-term  desire.   And each group needs to search within  itself

the  values  and  principles  it makes  to  remain  relevant,

meaningful  and  contributive  to  the  well-being  of   this

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if each group is not totally sufficiently clear on

the  above points, then I humbly suggest that they embark  on

serious  studies  on them.  While we all wish  to  accelerate

this  engagement process, it is worthless, if not  dangerous,

if  the engagement process is supported by ill-prepared ideas

and thoughts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, for effective engagement, each group must

be  willing  to  share its views and engage others  on  them.

While  each group should search for common views among  other

groups,  yes,  each must be prepared to face  and  deal  with

diametrically opposing views as well.  Each group  must  give

its  commitment  to  maintain the engagement  process.   This

commitment can be enhanced by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



Government   making  policies  that  seek  to   unify   while

recognising differences, which it is already doing  now,  but

this   can   be   strengthened  by  (1)   ensuring   adequate

representation  of such differing views in national  debates;

and  (2)  incorporating greater flexibility as a feature  for

policies   so  as  to  cater  for  differences.    Also   the

communities, when expressing their views, must do so sensibly

and  sensitively  so as not to undermine the  comfort  level.

Because  if  the comfort level is undermined,  so  would  the

whole engagement process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point as regards effective engagement, Sir, is

that  confidence builds upon itself.  Confidence building  is

an  accumulative  process.  As we move 10 paces  forward,  we

would  face issues that may cause us to take two steps  back.

But  this does not mean that we retrogress for we would  have

by  then moved eight paces forward.  The journey will be full

of  stops,  or such stops, and step-backs.  But we  all  must

agree to maintain the general direction at a steady pace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the hon. Member Assoc. Prof. Koo that

we  should  not allow the rumour of gloom and doom to  fulfil

its  own  prophecy.  We must have the confidence to  come  up

better,  including this area of social cohesion.  As  I  have

said,  confidence  builds  upon  itself.   If  there  is   no

confidence  amongst us now, we cannot have any confidence  in

future for there is nothing to build on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light, let me share an anecdote which came upon

me  recently while I was in Morocco together with my two hon.

colleagues, Mr Zainul and Mr Chiam.  My wife chanced  upon  a

man who asked her a question where she came from, noting that

she  wore a different dress, and she said, "Singapore."   His

response was enthusiastic.  My wife carefully avoided what he

meant  by  "enthusiastic".  When she said that she came  from

Singapore,   the  man  was  so  pleased  and   rattled   into

conversation.   It  turned out that he was  an  engineer,  an

Argentinian  and  he liked to travel, he has  travelled  very

widely over six continents, and he has stayed for more than a

week in Singapore in the years of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



his  travels.   At  one point, my wife  asked  him,  "So,  is

Singapore  nice?"  His answer was, "No.  Singapore not  nice.

Singapore very, very nice."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I thank you for allowing me to  join  in  the

debate on the Motion of Thanks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian financial crisis and the global economic

recession took its toll on the Singapore economy.   Our  four

major  engines  of  growth,  the  US  economy,  the  combined

Malaysia/Indonesia economy, the world semiconductor sales and

domestic   construction  work,  stalled.   As  the  Singapore

economy  took a nosedive, job losses continue to mount.   The

greatest  challenge  facing  the  man-in-the-street  now   in

Singapore  is jobs and the job situation can only improve  if

we can grow the economy and create more jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move ahead, we need to develop new engines of

growth.   We recognise that China will be a major competitor,

but  we  also  recognise that China can be a  growth  engine.

While  the world's economy took a battering, China's  economy

continued  to  grow, although at a slower pace.  Singaporeans

must  awaken to the serious competition that China will  pose

to Singapore and the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last decade, I have had the opportunity to

visit China on several occasions.  Over the years, I have not

ceased to be amazed at the pace of development in China.   On

a recent trip, I met a Singapore company which makes external

claddings  for  buildings and windows.  They  have  relocated

their  factories and the entire operations to  China.   Their

cost  of  production  is  18% of the cost  of  production  in

Singapore.   The Chinese engineers they hired were  not  less

competent than the Singapore engineers.  They were willing to

work  harder  and put in longer hours.  They were  also  very

eager to learn and were good in research and development.  As

a  result, the company's products have improved at a fraction

of the cost that they would have to invest in, if the R&D was

done in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Chinese companies will wipe out the competition at

the  lower  end.  However, if we are not careful,  they  will

also   become  competitors  at  the  higher  end   as   well.

Manufacturing  as  an  engine of growth,  especially  in  the

semiconductor industry and the electronics industry, will  be

seriously  threatened.  Recently, we have   moved  into  life

sciences and chemical industries, but we need to look  beyond

manufacturing to grow our services industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond its economic competitiveness, China also becomes

a  serious threat to Singapore in terms of quality  of  life.

Major  cities  like Beijing and Shanghai have developed  into

modern  cities  with  rich  cultural  experiences  and   wide

recreational  choices.  In Singapore, on  weekends,  when  we

think of recreation, we will visit our neighbourhood shopping

centres, perhaps take the children to the zoo, go to Sentosa,

play  golf or, maybe, go to the beaches.  In China, a weekend

for  a  family  in  Shanghai  may  mean  driving  to  Suzhou,

Hangzhou, or one of the nearby scenic areas.  It is therefore

not  surprising that expatriates increasingly  find  China  a

favoured choice for location of their companies.

<br><br><i>Services will be new growth engines</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of severe competition to our manufacturing

industry,   services  can  be  new  engines  of  growth   for

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, Singapore has been a logistics and

financial  hub.  The telecommunications and IT services  have

also been key sectors but they have also been affected by the

downturn.  We have to look at other new growth areas  in  the

services sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should consider expanding into other services,

including  education and healthcare.  In education, Singapore

remains   one  of  the  choice  locations  for  many  Chinese

nationals.   Many Chinese are eager to come to  Singapore  to

learn,  study  or  be trained.  We must not put  up  barriers

unnecessarily.  We must make our visa process more efficient.

Companies have been asked to send their potential



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



students to our embassy in Beijing to be interviewed.   Quite

often,  the  officers in charge have many other  duties,  and

this  is not a priority for him.  Furthermore, many potential

students  find it troublesome to fly all the way  to  Beijing

just for an interview.  We must not put such roadblocks if we

are  serious  about growing these services.   Having  Chinese

nationals  to  study here will have economic  spin-offs  with

multiplier effects.  If we liberalise our student  visas,  we

will be able to grow the educational sector rapidly.  On  the

other  hand,  we  must  be  careful  to  safeguard  our  good

reputation.   The recent media reports on the cheating  cases

involving  Chinese  students who have  rented  apartments  or

Chinese  nationals who have remitted money, have sullied  our

reputation.  The frequent media coverage may give  the  wrong

impression  that these acts are common.  These acts  are  few

and  far  in  between  and are done by  a  few  and  are  not

representative of Singapore.  We must send the right  signals

that  Singapore  does  not tolerate such  acts  and  we  will

continue  to ensure that Singapore remains a conducive  place

for foreigners to live in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to grow our healthcare services, we have to

make  it  less  difficult  for those  who  wish  to  come  to

Singapore for their healthcare needs, to obtain their  visas.

We  should  also actively support the promotion of healthcare

services to countries in the region and jointly promote  this

with  the  tourism  board.  Support  by  the  Government  for

private  sector healthcare has seen a large boost in  foreign

patients  coming to Malaysia.  Malacca alone  attracts  about

40,000 Indonesian patients a year to their hospitals.  Penang

has also become a major medical hub for Indonesians.  Further

afield, the Bumrungrad Hospital in Bangkok has also become an

attractive  alternative.   The difficult  visa  process  runs

contrary  to  our intention to grow our healthcare  services.

For  example, patients from Bangladesh complained that it  is

more difficult to get their visas to come to Singapore.  As a

result, they find it easier to go to other hospitals  in  the

region.  A patient of mine, recently having encountered  this

difficulty,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



decided  to  fly  to a hospital in Bangkok  for  his  medical

review  and treatment and, subsequently, he faxed his results

to me to ask me for my medical opinion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ask ourselves how do we create jobs. The

answer is to grow the economy.  We have to ask ourselves  how

do  we grow the economy.  I think it is time we must also ask

ourselves  in  what  areas  can  the  Government  remove  the

roadblocks to the growth of the economy.  By putting in place

a  system for a fast-track visa processing centre for  health

and  educational  services, we will be  able  to  grow  these

sectors rapidly.  These will translate into benefits for  the

property  sector,  the  retail sector,  healthcare  services,

educational  services, hotel services and  even  the  tourism

industry.



<br><br><i>Growing our external wing in the China market</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not limit the growth to Singapore but we must

also  look at growing the Singapore economy overseas as well.

Singapore cannot ignore China's growth but we should use  our

natural  advantages to tap into China's growth.  Do  we  have

any  advantages over others in getting access  to  the  China

market?



<br><br><i>Building Bonds</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese have a healthy respect for Singapore's

reputation.    They   like   the  social   environment,   the

cleanliness  and the safety in Singapore.  As a result,  many

of  the Chinese parents feel secure in sending their children

to  Singapore for studies.  Many of the students studying  in

Singapore  on Government scholarships, grants or on  personal

expenses,  come from families where their parents  are  well-placed  or  are  important Government officials.   We  should

actively  build  bonds  with Chinese students  who  study  in

Singapore.   The  friendship and bonds  will  strengthen  the

bonds between Singapore and China.  We must not underestimate

the value of these bonds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another pool which we have not tapped on.

These are Chinese nationals who have either become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



permanent residents or citizens.  Their intimate knowledge of

the  Chinese way of doing things and the good relations  they

have   with  their  friends  and  relatives  in  China,   can

potentially smoothen our access into the Chinese  market  and

shorten our learning curve.



<br><br><i>Improving the Government and the civil service</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To face these economic challenges, we not only need new

engines  of  growth,  but we must ask ourselves  how  can  we

improve the internal operating milieu in Singapore.  We  must

improve  the  Government and the civil  service.   Government

must  accept  that it is not always right.  Ministries  which

put  up  legislation  in Parliament or which  discuss  policy

issues  with  MPs should not only explain policies  but  must

also   be  willing  to  acknowledge  differences  in  opinion

whenever  there is room for improvement.  I am glad that  the

Government  will  allow  more  debates  on  legislation   and

policies  that  will  give  more room  for  consideration  of

differing  views so that improvements that are suggested  can

be   taken   into  consideration  and,  subsequently,   allow

amendments to be made to legislation or policies.   This  new

era  of  openness will bode well for Singapore if  Ministries

can  see  that  they  do not have a monopoly  of  ideas.   It

remains  now for the Government to show that there is resolve

and  earnestness  to  remake the Government.   If  we  cannot

remake  the  Government,  how  can  we  talk  about  remaking

Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the civil service must learn to adopt a pro-people, pro-business mindset. There must be greater

transparency  and accountability in our civil  service.   Our

Government departments continue to be a formidable barrier to

both the business community and the ordinary Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service gives the perception that it is wrong

to  empathise with the ordinary Singaporeans, it is a sin for

businesses  to  make money, and it is best not  to  give  the

politician the full picture.  The civil service must remember

that   it  is  not  wrong  to  empathise  with  the  ordinary

Singaporean.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A resident of mine came to see me regarding the sale of

his flat.  He had applied to HDB to remove a half wall of his

service  balcony  so that he could extend  his  kitchen.   He

wanted to sell the flat and the HDB officer who inspected the

flat said that the flat owner had only applied for permission

to  remove  the half wall, but had not applied for permission

to  remove the low kerb adjoining the wall.  As a result,  he

insisted  that  the owner put back the kerb before  he  could

sell  the  flat.  I could not believe my ears  when  I  heard

this.   It is ridiculous to have a small kerb jutting out  of

the kitchen floor as it will be a perfect recipe for tripping

over  and  breaking one's bones.  The engineering  department

insisted  that  the kerb had to be put back before  he  could

sell  the  flat.  As I saw no sense in this matter, I  wanted

the  department to give a good explanation, failing  which  I

will  raise  this further up.  Following that, the department

relented  and  the flat owner was allowed to  sell  his  flat

without further alterations.  This is just an example of  the

problems faced by residents.  The civil service cannot  be  a

bureaucracy  that does not exercise its sensibility,  empathy

and initiative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service must remember that it is not a sin for

businesses  to  make money.  Let us not kill the  goose  that

lays  the golden egg.  If the businesses fail, jobs  will  be

lost  and  it  will  be  worse off for everyone.   The  civil

service  uses  a  technique called  "stalling  for  time"  to

squeeze the genuine businessmen to capitulate to its demands.

I will illustrate this with two examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A businessman had applied to participate in a Government

land  tender  put  up  by the Singapore Land  Authority.   He

complied  with the conditions and eventually won the  tender.

To  his  horror, when he applied to the URA, he  met  with  a

stonewall as URA had claimed that the usage of land,  as  put

out  in the tender document, required their consent as  well.

As  a  result of this, his application to start work  on  the

land was stalled.  After paying several hundreds of thousands

of  dollars to the Government and having been delayed  for  a

year, he was brought to his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



knees  and  was  at  his  wits' end.  He  finally  sought  my

assistance to appeal to the Government.  After writing to the

Ministers  concerned, I am glad that his appeal was  allowed.

However, through no fault of his, he had lost time and money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case. An entrepreneur-developer, who is also a

community  leader,  encountered a similar  problem.   He  had

applied  to  the URA for information on a development  charge

(DC)  on  a piece of land before deciding on the purchase  of

that  piece  of land.  Acting on the information  on  the  DC

given  by URA, he went ahead to purchase the land.   When  he

wanted  to  develop the land, the URA officer in  charge  had

left, and a new officer had taken his place.  The new officer

claimed  that  the  previous officer had given  him  a  wrong

computation and, hence, URA decided to unilaterally  increase

his development charge.  It has been several months since  an

appeal was sent to the Ministry of National Development  but,

to  date, no official reply has been received.  This stalling

has  made  it impossible for him to proceed with his  planned

development.  As a result, he had no choice but  to  pay  URA

according  to  what  URA wanted so that his  licence  can  be

approved,  otherwise his interest cost and land-holding  cost

will  become a major burden to him.  He has yet to receive  a

reply  from the Ministry of National Development.   I  wonder

when  they  will  give him a reply.  It has been  six  months

since.    Where   is   the   transparency,   where   is   the

accountability, where is the pro-business Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It saddens me that our bureaucracy can hold our

entrepreneurs  to ransom.  Our civil service  needs  a  major

change  in  mindset.   Time is cost in  the  business  world.

Increasing  Government transparency and accountability  is  a

key area where the Government can make a real improvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the civil service must remember not to hide the

truth from the politicians.  We are here to work together  to

make Singapore a better place for all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



Not  only do ordinary Singaporeans and businessmen face  this

stonewalling  by the civil service.  Even MPs sometimes  face

the  same  problem.   During  our Sengkang  Town  Development

Committee  meeting,  a representative from  the  Ministry  of

Health was asked by the MPs on the likelihood of a polyclinic

in  Sengkang town.  The representative replied that  a  study

was being conducted and the report had already been submitted

to  the Minister, but there was no confirmed plan to build  a

polyclinic  then.  The representative was then reminded  that

the  minutes  would  be made available  to  the  Minister  in

charge.   Upon  hearing that, the representative  immediately

retracted  the  statement and said that the  report  had  not

reached the Minister.  Despite the stonewalling by the  civil

service,  I am glad that, finally, after all the lobbying  by

the  MPs  in  the GRC, the Minister for Health supported  the

justification to have a polyclinic built in Sengkang and also

at an earlier date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for the civil service to show more

transparency and accountability.  It is time for them to  see

themselves as part of Singapore Inc to improve the quality of

life  for  our  residents, not to obstruct our entrepreneurs,

and to work with MPs to improve Singapore's future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the economic challenges we face are daunting. We

have  the  resources and the means to meet these  challenges.

Let us not set up roadblocks and obstacles for ourselves.   I

am  confident that if we have a Government which will  listen

and  be  more  open,  we will be able to  sail  through  this

economic turbulence and steer ourselves to a brighter future.

To  overcome these serious daunting challenges, we  need  all

Singaporeans to pull together.  Together, we will succeed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, September 11th was a turning point in the history

of  mankind.  It was indeed a defining moment in  our  lives.

Through CNN coverage, we watched in horror as the World Trade

Centre Twin Towers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



collapsed  right in front of our eyes.  Thousands lost  their

lives  in an instant. We were stunned.  We were numbed.   Was

this  the  beginning of the end of the civilised world?   Our

lives  have  been  changed.  Terrorism can  strike  anywhere,

anytime.  It also strikes at the innocent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism has globalised. So must be the fight against

terrorism.   Counter-terrorism has to be global.  The  United

States  has  taken the lead in this fight against  terrorism.

Singapore,  too, must support the anti-terrorist measures  in

our own national interests.  However, some may ask why should

Singapore be so closely identified with the United States and

seen to be supporting the forces aligned against terrorism.

The  answer is simple.  It is the right thing to do.  We must

take  a  stand against wanton destruction of innocent  lives.

We  must ensure safety in travel.  It affects each and  every

one  of  us.  If we do not stand up and be counted, who  will

come  to  our  help,  if terrorism rears  its  ugly  head  in

Singapore?   Others would then ask, "Where were you  when  we

needed you most? Now you are asking for our help?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this inter-connected world of security, trade

and  investment,  we cannot fudge the issue  or  sit  on  the

fence.  It  will be foolhardy to presume that the horrors  of

terrorism  will  not  strike  Singapore.   Indeed,   as   the

discovery and exposure of the JI plotters amply demonstrated,

we  have to be ever more vigilant against terrorist cells and

the protractors of violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has been lucky so far. Terrorists could

well  have detonated the bombs in Singapore.  Buildings might

have  collapsed.  Trade would be affected.   There  would  be

stupendous  loss  of  lives.   This  would  have  scared  off

investors  and  tourists.  MNCs might relocate  their  plants

elsewhere.   Jobs  would be lost.  The  economy,  already  in

recession,  would  plummet.  Worse  still,  it  would  put  a

tremendous  strain  on our multi-racial  and  multi-religious

harmony.  Despair, anger and distrust would reign.  It  would

be the severest test to our nationhood.  That



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



this  did not happen does not mean that it would not  happen.

We have to be vigilant.  We have to be prepared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore work even harder to promote multi-racial harmony and bonding. I applaud the Government's

efforts  to  form Inter-Racial Confidence Circles  throughout

the  island.  Whether in our schools, our workplace or  home,

multi-racial harmony must be our motto and way  of  life.   I

therefore urge Singaporeans to invite their neighbours of all

races  to  visit  their  homes and  to  join  them  in  their

celebrations and festivals, be it Hari Raya, Chinese New Year

or Deepavali.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the terrorist threat and the continuing

instability  in  Southeast  Asia  underline  once  again  the

importance of security and defence, and the vital role of the

Police and the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this connection, we are all well aware that the

pillars of our defence are our national servicemen.  We  know

that national service is a service to the nation and involves

an   element  of  sacrifice  and  indeed  sometimes,  supreme

sacrifice.  I would like to refer to the point raised  by  Dr

Vivian  Balakrishnan  and  Dr Wang  Kai  Yuen.   I  had  done

national  service myself.  I have two sons and both  of  them

are Operationally Ready National Service officers.  There  is

no   doubt  that  they  will  fight  for  Singapore  and,  if

necessary,  die  for  the country.  Indeed,  my  second  son,

James,  is studying overseas and one day he told me  that  at

the first sign of trouble, he would fly back to Singapore  to

bear arms.  I am very proud of him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of this supreme sacrifice, we must give due

recognition  to  our national servicemen.   But  the  limited

national  servicemen allowances have been kept frozen  for  a

number  of  years.   They have not kept  pace  with  economic

growth, cost of living or inflation.  Some parents of NS  men

fork  out money to help their sons with their expenses during

NS.   They do not mind but this is the hardest on parents  of

lower  income groups.  I believe that it is high time  Mindef

reviewed their NS allowances and give our NSmen their dues.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, relations between Singapore and Malaysia

have hit another rough patch.  We are now quite accustomed to

this  roller-coaster-like relationship between Singapore  and

Malaysia.   But what bothers me is that across the  Causeway,

Singapore  is  always  seen to be at fault  and  Malaysia  is

seemingly  blameless.  This attitude is not helpful,  to  say

the  least.   This  rather unsatisfactory  scenario  is  best

summed  up,  in my opinion, by a reader, Mr Yu Kok  Wah,  who

wrote  in  the Forum page of the Straits Times on  9th  March

this year.  According to Mr Yu, the picture that emerged over

the  years was what he labelled as Rule No. 1, that  is  "The

Singapore Government must always be sensitive to the needs of

the Malaysian government and its politicians".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rule No. 2 is "Before Singapore does anything, it

has to adhere to Rule No. 1".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule No. 3 is "Whatever Singapore has done, it is fair

game  for  Malaysian  politicians to  criticise  because,  as

always,  the Singapore Government has failed to observe  Rule

No. 1".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule No. 4 is "If the Singapore Government sticks to the

letter  of any agreement signed with Malaysia, it is  branded

as  too legalistic and is accused of not upholding the spirit

of Rule No. 1".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule No. 5 is "Any comments on our policies by Malaysian

politicians  are  to  be treated as good  neighbourly  advice

because of Rule No. 1".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule No. 6 is "Any comments on our neighbour will be

deemed offensive, intrusive and abusive because the Singapore

Government  will be seen to have failed to observe  Rule  No.

1".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this sounds familiar to us. It seems that only

Malaysians have sensitivities.  Mr Yu has hit the nail on its

head.   My  GPC colleague, Mr Ravindran spoke with conviction

on  Singapore-Malaysia relations in this  very  Chamber  last

Tuesday.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



He must be right on target, but now he has the distinction of

drawing  fire  from  Malaysian  Ministers  and  MPs  in   the

Malaysian Parliament.  Mr Ravindran, as Mr Yu predicted,  was

accused of being insensitive.  More abusive words were  used,

but I would not care to repeat them because the Speaker might

rule  it  unparliamentary.  Mr Ravindran's only  mistake  was

that he failed to observe Rule No. 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last weekend, to be sure and to satisfy myself, my

family  and  I  took a boat ride to the waters  off  Punggol,

Pulau  Ubin and Pulau Tekong.  It was in good weather and  my

guide  was  a  kelong  owner.   I  can  say  that  our   land

reclamation is well within our own territorial waters.  And I

assure you that I was not fishing in troubled waters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore will be mindful of the concerns of

Malaysia,  our  nearest neighbour.   It  is  only  fair  that

Malaysia  also  respects our sovereign  rights  and  national

interest.  It will be better for Malaysia to send Singapore a

full  and  comprehensive diplomatic note  on  all  issues  of

concern  and we can respond accordingly, rather than  talking

or  boxing through the press.  Please hurry, send us a  note.

We  want  a diplomatic exchange, not a media exchange  or  an

exchange through Parliamentary speeches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, I urge Singapore and Malaysia

together  to put the past behind us, put away the  historical

baggage  of merger and separation, and work closely  together

for the good of the people on both sides of the Causeway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot choose our neighbours. Geography and

history have devised and placed us side by side.  If  we  can

choose,  it  would  be easier.  But we  can  choose  to  work

towards  a win-win situation, to the mutual benefit  of  both

countries.   This  is  all  the  more  important  and  indeed

imperative in this inter-dependent world.  All the  more,  as

ASEAN  faces  new  challenges, stress and  strains  from  the

regional  downturn and the new economic challenges  from  the

fast growing East Asian region led by China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can see the big picture, we can understand the

strategic consideration and the global dimensions before  us.

But  we must relate and explain this to our heartlanders,  to

our  residents, to the man-in-the-street.  We must carry  the

ground with us.  Otherwise, in a crisis, we may fall apart or

pull apart by external forces and internal divisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, we must not talk down or talk over the heads of

the  people.   We  must make the effort to explain  in  clear

terms  to  our  residents,  for example,  through  dialogues,

presentations and skits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the people do not understand the bigger scenario

or  support and trust the Government, the best-laid  plan  we

have will come to waste.  In this debate, it amply shows that

we  have to not only convince the people, we have to convince

our own MPs in this House.  We have to make a start.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, it has been quite

difficult catching your eye.  In some way, I hope that we can

improve this process of catching your eye.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thank you for giving me the floor. I just want to

clarify  one point which Mr Ahmad Khalis mentioned  just  now

about  retrenchment and the workers.  I  want  to  assure  Mr

Ahmad  Khalis  and  all the Members of the  House  that  when

workers are retrenched, we in the trade unions do take  great

pains  to ensure that the retrenchments are not for frivolous

reasons.  And if we are not comfortable with the reasons  for

their  retrenchment, which we think are not valid,  we  would

challenge it in the Ministry of Manpower or in the Industrial

Arbitration Court.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President commenced his Speech by observing

that  the  last  five  years have been  momentous  times  for

Singapore.   A  new  lexicon that  has  found  its  way  into

mainstream  use  in  Singapore  perhaps  best  captures  that

sentiment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago, the words "Singapore" and "recession"

would  have  constituted  an unlikely  couplet.   After  all,

Singapore was one of the Asian tigers, a dynamo humming along

at  8-10%  annual  growth rates, sometimes higher.   The  odd

difficult year was almost viewed as a necessary respite  from

the  frenzied  pace of our growth, rather than as  a  serious

setback.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago, the words "HDB" and "terrorism" would

probably never have been used in the same sentence.  We  took

pride  in  the fact that it was safe to walk our streets  and

use our subways, even in the middle of the night.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago, a new batch of MPs in Parliament - and

I  was  one  of  them  - spoke, not on unemployment  and  job

matching, but on job-hopping and employee loyalty.  The focus

was  very  much on managing the consequences  of  success   - high cost of COEs, high property prices and high wage costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now know that a terrorist cell, based within our

HDB  heartland,  had been plotting unthinkable  crimes.   The

dreaded   "R"   words    -   Recession,   Restructuring   and

Retrenchment  -  are heard with nauseating regularity in  our

media.   And  we  now counsel our fresh graduates,  who  were

previously  spoilt  for choice, not to  be  too  choosy  when

looking for a new job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dramatic changes in the external environment have thrust

Singaporeans into uncharted territory.  And for a younger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



generation of Singaporeans, born and brought up in the  post-independence  era Singapore, recent events have  taken  on  a

surreal  quality,  for  this  is  so  far  removed  from  the

Singapore we have experienced and what we have come to expect

in our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question, Sir, is whether this situation is so

fundamentally  different  to  our  past?   Sure,  today,  the

symptoms are acute and we feel them sharply.  But the  threat

of such adversity has always been lurking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty years ago, if we had wagered on Singapore

accomplishing all that it has, I suspect we would  have  been

given rather long odds by the bookies.  Then the question was

whether  we  would  survive  the throes  of  separation,  the

withdrawal  of  British troops and early stages  of  economic

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago, in the depths of the Asian economic

crisis  and political upheaval in the region, if we had  once

again  wagered on Singapore's continued success, I  think  we

would  still have been given rather long odds.  The  question

was,  once again, whether we would survive an economic  melt-down, political upheaval and security concerns in our region,

in our economic hinterland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, here we are today, relatively intact, but facing

what   our  President  has  described  as  "the  most  severe

challenges  in the history of our nation."  Again,  it  is  a

question of survival.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the truth is, the odds have always been stacked

against  us.  External events have compelled us to constantly

rise  to  new  challenges.  But we have  pulled  through,  as

individuals  and as a people, through sheer grit and  passion

for  this  place.  Do we have the courage and  confidence  to

believe that we will once again survive and succeed?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in thinking about this question and answer, I was

reminded of my uncle, curiously enough.  He was born during



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



World  War  II and the 50s and 60s had a profound  effect  on

him.  For him, the cry "Merdeka", with clenched fist held  up

high,  is  still  resonant and it evokes vivid  and  somewhat

emotional memories.  And make no mistake, my uncle was not  a

political  activist; he was not a freedom fighter;  he  is  a

retired  civil servant.  And we all know, civil servants  are

not generally given to emotional displays.  But he was a firm

believer  in Singapore and what it stands for.   And  for  my

uncle and many of his generation, that cry from the steps  of

City  Hall was a rallying call.  It was a symbol of hope  and

it  was  a  call to stand up and be counted in  the  nation's

struggle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, another generation of Singaporeans must rise

to  this call.  We need the right policies, but we also  need

our  people  to rally behind the policies and the Government.

We  can  call it Remaking Singapore, Rediscovering Singapore,

but, in essence, we must once again find the words, the icons

and  the  spirit to inspire a new generation of Singaporeans,

to  imbue  them with hope and to ignite our people's passion.

So  that  a move by another liner to a neighbouring  port  is

seen,  not as a body blow to our prospects, but rather  as  a

spur  to  revitalize our efforts.  So that rising competition

in the region does not flag our spirits, but rather puts fire

in  our bellies to try even harder.  So that a bland cerebral

cost-benefit  analysis will give way to an emphatic  visceral

attachment to this place.  Only then can we pull ourselves up

by  the bootstraps, help each other the best we can, do  what

needs  to be done, and take this adversity in our stride,  as

we move forward.  If we cannot or we do not, then we would be

unworthy of the legacy of our forefathers.  Sir, that is  the

challenge  for  all  of us, the Government,  this  House  and

indeed all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present circumstances have also had a salutary

effect.   They  have  served as a timely  reminder  that  our

economy   and  security  are  works-in-progress.   They   are

vulnerable   to   shocks  and  require  constant   attention,

reinforcement and enhancement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that perspective, our social cohesion is yet

another work-in-progress.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



We have come a long way in our effort to build a multi-racial

Singapore.   And  today, we have heard many Members  describe

the  state  of  multi-racial  relations  in  Singapore  using

various metaphors  -  mosaic, garden, a knitted sweater, etc.

I  am  afraid  I  do not have a metaphor to offer.   But  the

question I wish to ask is whether it is appropriate  at  this

time  of challenge for us to also revisit our model of multi-racial  relations and ask if we are satisfied,  content  with

where we are today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have by now grown accustomed to multi-cultural

performances at grassroots and other community functions.  We

enjoy  each other's food and appreciate our diverse  cultural

heritage  and festivals.  We also have an awareness  of  each

other's  religions  and practices.  And these  are  important

foundations and we must treasure them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent Straits Times' article on a survey of some 300

students also concluded that inter-racial mixing is  fine  in

our  schools.   The  survey  asked questions  like:  what  is

another  name  for  the  Seventh  Moon  Festival,  the  Hindu

festival  of  lights and also which is the holy city  of  the

Muslims.   The survey found that 95% of students had  friends

of  other races, and 70% had six or more.  I would have liked

to have found out what percentage of those students had close

or even best friends who were from other races, and how often

they  socialised with them outside school.  While it is  good

for  a Chinese or Malay student to know that Deepavali is the

Festival of Lights celebrated by the Hindus, would it not  be

far  better for him to have a good Hindu friend who  can  not

only  furnish  him with the answer but, better still,  invite

him  to celebrate the festival with his family?  Would it not

be  better even as we share each other's food over  a  social

meal,  we were also comfortable enough to share each  other's

hopes, aspirations and fears?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is perhaps the quantum leap we should strive

for  in  our  inter-ethnic ties.  It marks a transition  from

itinerant  relations  perhaps to  life-long  friendships.   I

think it is time to challenge ourselves to strive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



for  this  higher  paradigm in inter-ethnic  relations,   one

underpinned by deep friendships and bonds of mutual trust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was inspired by recent discussions and dialogues that

were  held  on a variety of issues pertaining to  the  Muslim

community  in  Singapore,  in particular  on  madrasahs,  the

tudung  issue and the Malays in the SAF, while I thought  the

outcomes  may  not  have pleased everyone,  the  process  was

sincere, serious and dignified.  That sort of initiative  and

others like the Inter-Racial Confidence Circles pave the  way

for more that can be done in this respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the Government should commit itself to a

constant  review of its policies to ensure that they engender

more of such friendships and to ensure that it can remove any

impediments that might lie in their path.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been diligent in our efforts to build a strong

multi-racial  Singapore.   But  over  the  years,   we   have

introduced a range of policies and programmes that have  been

based  on  ethnicity and language  -  ethnic  quotas  in  HDB

estates,  self-help  groups,  GRCs,  SAP  schools  are   some

examples.   Some of these policies seek to further  integrate

Singaporeans.    Others  were  designed   to   meet   certain

objectives  but might have had the unintended consequence  of

further segregating us.  I  think it is hard to really assess

what the cumulative effect has been on our society.  At best,

I would say opinion is divided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore advocate that the Government consider

appointing  a standing Ministerial Committee to  monitor  the

state  of  ethnic relations in Singapore and to  periodically

review  policies and programmes that might have an impact  on

our  inter-ethnic  ties.   The  purpose  is  not  to  discard

policies that have served us well, but to take stock  and  to

ensure  that in their totality, they continue to move  us  in

the right direction in pursuit of this ideal.  That, I think,

will  ensure  that this important  work-in-progress  receives

regular  and  high level of attention it deserves.   Finally,

Sir, I do not wish to create the impres



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



sion that this is the responsibility of Government alone.   I

think each and every Singaporean has a role to play, and  our

schools  are  a good starting point.  Schools are  a  fertile

point  to  plant the seeds of such life-long friendships.   I

was  therefore  concerned to hear of anecdotal evidence  that

students  are grouping along ethnic lines in our schools,  be

it  in  their  choice of sports, CCA activities  or  even  in

project  groups or social activities.   I was at  a  dialogue

session   recently   when  one  of  the  teachers   who   was

participating  shared with me how he was conducting  a  class

and  he  asked the students to break up into groups of  four.

And  he said  three students of one ethnic group went out  of

their  way  to turn around so that they could have  a  fourth

member of the same group, rather than include in that group a

student  from another ethnic community.  I was not sure  what

to  be more troubled by, that there was such an occurrence in

the  classroom  or, as I later found out,  that  the  teacher

seemed to be somewhat helpless about the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we could argue that this is a natural occurrence and

that we really cannot do much about it.  But this House,  and

certainly  this Government, has never shied away from  action

on matters delicate when a larger national objective has been

at  stake.  And I concede, Sir, these are awkward situations.

If  you act, you draw unnecessary attention to it.  If you do

not act, you allow an unhealthy situation to perpetuate.   So

what do we do?  I do feel that in this sort of circumstances,

some  tact  and  with a little bit of deft action,  we  could

perhaps make a difference.  So perhaps our principals,  vice-principals and teachers could be trained, counselled or  made

aware  so  that they can deal with such situations tactfully,

preferably  imperceptibly, as and when  they  emerge  in  the

classroom, the school field or in the canteen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, I think all of us - the Government, the

grassroots   organisations  and  the  people  -   must   take

collective responsibility to ensure that Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



continues  to move resolutely towards our ideal of  a  multi-racial society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the

motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theme of the debate on the President's Address has

been the remaking of Singapore.  Remaking in the sense of new

policies, also in the sense of the process by which  the  new

policies  are  developed, the involvement, the  consultation,

the debate, the to-and-fro, the binding together of views  to

develop  a  national consensus.  There is a strong desire,  I

think,  among  a significant proportion of the  well-educated

public  for  meaningful participation in this  process.   And

there  are  encouraging signs that in fact  this  process  is

developing.  Letters in the Forum page now often attract well-argued rebuttals, and no longer require official replies.  We

have  people  who  spend their time reading the  Forum  page,

scanning for letters which need correction.  In the old days,

an error would be tracked straightaway.  Nowadays, if we wait

a  couple  of  days,  somebody else will come  back  with  an

opposite  way, and quite often a very sensible  and  balanced

correction,  and we can allow the debate to play itself  out.

So,  I  think  we  are  going in the  right  direction.   The

Government  is convinced that this is the right  way  forward

and is committed to involving Singaporeans in the process  of

consultation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One main exercise doing this is the Economic Review

Committee.  We are leaving no stone unturned in our review of

economic  policies,  whether it  is  labour,  whether  it  is

manufacturing, whether it is services, whether it  is  taxes,

in  order  to  ensure that Singapore prospers  in  the  years

ahead.  We are taking some time to do this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen asked yesterday:</b> Why is it so long?

Is it because the civil servants have no ideas?  I assure him

that it is not because the civil servants have no ideas.   It

is because we are dealing with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



long-term  measures, having already dealt with the  immediate

measures  last  year, in October/November, in a  $11  billion

special off-Budget package.  We are considering major changes

which  need  to be carefully weighed.  And we are taking  our

consultations extremely seriously.  In fact, if we had  acted

sooner,  he might have accused us of not taking the  feedback

with  the seriousness which it deserves.  But we have to take

the  consultations seriously and we have to  take  views  and

make  sure  that what comes out is in fact fully  cooked  and

properly deliberated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real constraint on the pace of our progress is not

the   Government;  it  is  not  the  civil  service  or   the

bureaucracy.  It is the people.  How quickly can  the  people

accept  new  policies  and adapt  to  change?   That  is  the

question.   Because new policies are unsettling, people  need

time  to get used to it, accept it, understand it, and  argue

about  it.   And we need time to understand how  to  get  the

policies  packaged, polished, rough edges smoothed  off,  and

implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not sending all sacred cows to the

slaughterhouse.   Mr  Lim Boon Heng said we  should  consider

sending  some sacred cows to the slaughterhouse.  We are  not

sending  all  of them.  But I assure you that we should  send

all  our  sacred cows, at the very least, to the  vet  for  a

thorough  examination to make sure that they are healthy  or,

if they are not healthy, something can be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pride ourselves that in Singapore no issue is too

sensitive  to be talked about, nothing is taboo which  cannot

be discussed.  If you raise a subject, we will debate it.  If

there is a problem, it will be solved.  But still some issues

are  very  sensitive - even to raise, never mind  to  tackle.

But  we  are  talking about a fundamental  review  in  a  new

situation,  in  a different world, and unless  we  grasp  the

nettle  and address these issues now, the problems are  going

to grow and are going to become even harder to tackle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review process has to be managed. We are talking

about many people.  We are talking about many views.  We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



to  discuss  issues  without alarming  people.   We  have  to

implement issues without jarring the system, but we  must  be

prepared  to  discuss many fundamental areas  which  we  have

taken  for granted.  As the President said, "No policy is  so

cast in stone that it can never be changed.".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for us is to fix things that ain't broke

yet.   If  something is broken, it is quite easy.   Everybody

can  see  it  is  no longer working, we have to  abandon  it,

something  has  to  replace it.  But when  something  is  not

broken,  but you can see difficulties and problems  down  the

road,  then  we have to manage that, and it is not  so  easy.

Because, first, we have to persuade people that we do have  a

problem.   And they will say, "Why do you want to  raise  the

subject  at all?  Matters are working fine."  And,  secondly,

if  our  policies  are still working, we  want  to  make  the

changes and derive the benefits of making the changes without

losing  the  benefits of the old policies  because  they  are

still  working, they have served us well, and we do not  want

to  change  them.   I  think in the  case  of  several  major

fundamental  economic policies, we have to address  them  and

approach them with this mindset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will cite three just as examples, which are important

ones: the CPF, our wage policies and tax policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CPF. It is one of the cornerstones of our

social  safety  net.   It  provides for  workers,  for  their

medical  benefits,  for their housing, for  their  retirement

benefits, even for their children to go to university, and to

borrow  from the CPF.  It is funded, it is sound.   It  is  a

valuable  instrument which we have patiently  built  up  over

many years.  But we now have to look at it again.  We have to

reconcile business costs versus workers' needs.  We have  got

to trade off multiple purposes to which the CPF might be put.

How much to go into housing, how much to go into medical, how

much to go into retirement, how to balance them, what are the

priorities.  We have to examine the structure of the CPF more

closely, to balance between these different uses and  to  ask

some basic questions.  As Mr Lim Boon Heng



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



suggested  yesterday,  are we investing  too  much  money  in

housing?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also ask, how do we get the members not just

to  leave  the money with the Government in the CPF and  earn

2.5% interest, which over 40, 50 years of our working life is

really  not enough, but to invest the money in pension  funds

for  better long-term returns at acceptable risk, not to take

it out and have a punt on the stock market, not to splurge it

on  a  consumption binge, but to invest it prudently  with  a

portfolio, with professional managers who will not  guarantee

you  a  return every year but over five, 10, 20  years,  will

offer  you much better than the Government can offer at  2.5%

interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to examine the structure of the CPF. We also

have  to  examine the specific problem of older workers  with

CPF  -  older workers meaning those nearly 55, maybe from  50

years  onwards - having difficulty finding replacement  jobs,

because  the job market is changing, and they are not willing

to  work  for  low  take-home pay  because  they  still  have

families to look after.  And if you say 20% knocked  off  for

CPF,  because that is his contribution, he says, "Well, take-home  $700,  not worth my while to work."  Often,  therefore,

they are doing odd jobs for cash, with no CPF at all.  And we

see  them, they come to our meet-the-people sessions, we  ask

them:   What are you doing?  And the standard answer  is  sua

kang, which means working for cash rather than for CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this group of people, nearly 55 years old, not very

well-educated in many cases, would a lower CPF rate make them

more  employable?  It is to be considered.  What about  their

obligations?   They may have committed to houses.   They  may

not  have  finished paying for their mortgages.  This  is  an

issue  which  we have to think about.  But, in my  view,  the

overall CPF contribution rate, which is 40% as a target rate,

is something which we should maintain.  We are not there yet,

we  are  back to 36% after the package in 1998.  But we  have

stated that 40% is our target, and I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



we  keep that target.  We promise to restore it when we  made

the  CPF  cut  in 1998/99, and I think we should  uphold  our

promise  to  the workers.  And I do not see any justification

to  see the CPF below 40% in general, because if you consider

the  needs of the workers, housing, medical and pension,  40%

is not excessive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is the first sacred cow which needs a medical

examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one which needs an examination is wages. One

issue  of  wages is portable medical benefits.  Members  have

talked  about  it.   The unions and the employers  have  been

talking  about  it  for some time, and the  issue  is  simply

stated.   A  young  worker starting  out  can  work  for  any

employer  and  the  employer will  take  him.   He  is  still

healthy.   If  he falls ill, the employer bears  the  medical

burden.   An  older worker, already with medical  conditions,

wanting to change jobs has a very serious problem, because no

new  employer  wants  to take him and carry  that  burden  of

taking on his medical benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do we provide workers with portable medical

benefits  so  that when he changes jobs from one employer  to

another, he carries his perks with him, in the same way as he

carries  the CPF benefits with him?  Right now, for employer-provided  benefits, if the employer retrenches or goes  bust,

he  loses  it.   But we need to move from that  to  something

which  is  portable, which means a change from  the  existing

employer-provided,   employer-paid  benefits,   which   means

something for workers to get used to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on wages, we have to think about retrenchment

benefits.  It is the traditional way for workers to tide them

over  a  period of unemployment.  It is based  on  length  of

service.   The  longer you work, the more  your  retrenchment

benefits, and it is unfunded, which means that when the  time

comes,  the  company  looks  for  money  to  pay  for   these

retrenchment  benefits.  This causes  a  problem.   From  the

point  of  view of the person who is retrenched, it is  good,

because he gets something.  But the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unions have found that sometimes the benefits of a long-serving employee are a huge drain on the company's financial

resources.   And the companies may be unable  to  pay  or  it

could  be that they can pay but it will endanger the jobs  of

the  remaining  workers, because if you pay the  retrenchment

benefits,  you  are  no longer viable and  able  to  continue

operating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the system has weaknesses. And as our business

cycles  become  shorter as more workers  find  themselves  in

between  jobs, we have got to find a better way to  do  this.

One idea which the unions have thought about and have floated

with  the employers is to get the employers and employees  to

put  aside  a  certain amount of money every year  while  the

company  is still in good health, for example, in an enhanced

bonus system which will vest in their employees over a period

of  time.  So you cannot draw it out straightaway.  It builds

up,  it  is yours.  After a certain period of time,  you  can

draw  it.   And  you  replace  the  traditional  retrenchment

benefits with such a scheme.  It is an individual-based fund.

Then  when  the employee is retrenched, you do not depend  on

the state of the company then, but you can draw down what you

have  earned  earlier  in this fund, in this  enhanced  bonus

system, until you can find a new job.  Some employers already

do  this.  It is something which needs to be studied.  It may

not work for all of the companies.  We should look at this as

well  as other ideas.  But we have to examine the problem  of

retrenchment benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key idea, when we talk about wages, is to free up

the   labour   market,  to  create  more  jobs.    The   more

restrictions  we may have, the more rules we have,  the  more

difficult  it  is we make for people to join jobs  and  leave

jobs, the more reluctant employers will be to take on workers

and the higher our unemployment rate will be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Khalis earlier this afternoon suggested, for

example,  setting  up a mechanism for employers  to  have  to

justify  to  the  Ministry  before they  can  retrench  their

workers and must give reasons and also answer for how much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



they  are  paying their senior executives.   It  is  a  well-intentioned   proposal,  but  it  is   a   counter-productive

proposal.   Because the result of this is for companies  when

they  would otherwise hire workers to ask themselves,  "Do  I

really  want to take on somebody whom I may not need for  the

long term, whom I may have difficulty letting go off when the

business  conditions change, whom I may be stuck with?"   And

the  answer is, "Better not, work overtime with the  existing

workers, don't hire extra hands."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a theoretical risk. It is a real problem.

In  Germany,  which has the tightest laws for firing  workers

and  is the most difficult of all to let go of workers,  they

have  the  highest  unemployment  rates,  and  it  is  not  a

coincidence.   It is because employers make the calculations:

too  hard to drop, better do not hire.  So the key idea which

we  must follow is to free up the labour market, make it easy

for  people to change jobs and then we will be able  to  have

high employment rates, not unemployment rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue which we have to consider is taxation.

Lower direct taxes, lower corporate and personal income taxes

are  essential if we are going to prosper in the next  phase.

They are essential because of competitiveness reasons.  Other

countries  have  been bringing down their  direct  tax  rates

drastically over the years and continuing to do  so,  and  we

have  to  be competitive with them.  The Europeans,  some  of

them,  the  Germans are 30%-plus corporate tax.   If  we  are

equal  to  them,  there is no reason why they  will  consider

coming to Singapore.  Others are bringing direct taxes  down,

we have to do the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to attract talent intensive service industries

to  Singapore.  We are not talking just about factories where

hundreds  of millions of dollars of investments, one  or  two

employees  ordered  to  go, he goes  to  Singapore.   We  are

talking  about  fund  managers,  we  are  talking  about   IT

companies, creative companies, people, movies, software.  The

people  are the company.  The people are high-earning people.

If  your  tax is not competitive, the person says,  "I'm  not

going to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



Singapore."  The company will not be here.  We have seen  it.

Our  promoting  agencies - MAS, IDA, EDB -  repeatedly,  when

they want to try and bring activities to Singapore, they  are

asked,  "How much more tax do I have to pay?"  So that  is  a

serious  reason to bring down not just the corporate tax  but

the personal tax as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to bring down direct taxes to encourage

entrepreneurship because an entrepreneur goes in, if you want

him  to  risk  everything, then he must have  the  chance  of

gaining  a  great  deal.   And  if  you  say,  if  you   risk

everything, you lose, too bad, I give you a pat on the  back,

perhaps a medal.  But you gain, you win, I will tax you  30%-40%,  you  would not get entrepreneurship.  It is  one  basic

reason  why there are not so many entrepreneurs in Europe  as

in  America  because, in America, tax rates  are  lower,  and

Europe  is not worth your while.  In short, we have to  bring

our  direct  tax rates down to encourage more investments  to

grow the economy and, ultimately, which is most important for

us, to create good well-paying jobs for Singaporeans.  Unless

you bring the direct tax rates down, you cannot do that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we cannot just bring the direct tax

rates  down.   You  have got to balance the  budget.   If  we

simply  cut  direct taxes, we will end up with  a  structural

deficit,  meaning  whether the economy is  up  or  down,  the

Government cannot balance its books and we will run a  budget

deficit.   For  example, Hong Kong now has  quite  a  serious

fiscal  problem  because they have lost one major  source  of

revenue, which is land sales.  Their tax rates are very  low,

their budget is in deficit. The Financial Secretary hopes  to

bring it back into balance over a period of seven years,  but

there  are no easy solutions and raising taxes is very,  very

difficult.  But we have to balance the budget and a  balanced

budget, in fact a modest surplus maintained over many  years,

has  been  one  of the fundamental reasons why the  Singapore

dollar  has  been  strong, why inflation has  been  low,  why

everybody's CPF balances and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



savings have had their value protected.  So unless we protect

the  balanced budget, we are going to have a very fundamental

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we are going to bring direct taxes down and we are

going  to  balance the budget, there is only one  conclusion,

that  we  have to bring up indirect taxes.  What are indirect

taxes?  We have car taxes.  We could raise those if they  are

not  high enough.  But I am not sure many Members will  agree

that  they are not high enough.  And there is GST,  a  broad-based  tax  which applies to everything, paid  by  everybody,

weighs  lightly on the whole economy because it is very  well

spread,  efficient to collect and a stable source of  revenue

for the exchequer, whether the economy goes up or the economy

goes down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we are going to lower direct taxes, we will have

to consider raising the GST.  But before we raise the GST, we

have  to think very carefully about a couple of issues.  One,

timing,  to  be  only done when the economy is  on  a  firmer

footing.  We have to judge when we think that will be  ready,

because  we  do  not  want to put the  economy  back  into  a

recession by an ill-judged move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have to consider the impact of any GST

adjustment  on  the  lower income group.  Because  the  lower

income  group  consumes a large part of their income  or,  in

some  cases, even all of their disposable income and  so  any

extra tax  is an extra burden to them.  Therefore, if we  are

going to adjust the GST, we have to buffer the overall burden

on  these  lower income groups.  And we also have to  address

specific  concerns over certain vital essentials - education,

healthcare, public transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the way we did it in 1994 when we first introduced

the GST was we had a comprehensive offset package so that  we

could  make  a  calculation  and assure  everybody  and  show

examples that if you are in a 3-room flat or 4-room flat, the

offset which you get to tide you over a transition period  is

more  than enough to offset the tax which you would  have  to

pay in GST every year for every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



household.   And in addition to that, we also had reassurance

on education, on healthcare, on public transport, on specific

critical items so that nobody will be alarmed, panicked  into

thinking  that  this is going to be an unbearable  burden  on

him, which it is not.  That was what we did last time when we

have to do GST.  This time, we must do the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members will agree with me that it is never

popular  to suggest the possibility of new taxes.  But  going

forward,  restructuring our taxes is a vital step for  us  to

gear  up  our economy for the changed environment  to  create

more jobs.  I look back to 1994 when we first introduced  the

GST.   We  reduced  direct taxes in 1994 and,  in  subsequent

years,  whenever  our  finances  strengthened,  we  gradually

brought  direct taxes down again.  So, today,  our  corporate

tax  is 24 1/2%, our personal tax is 26 1/2%.  Because of that,

our  economy grew after 1994-1995, 1996;  1997, we did  well;

1998,  the  Asian crisis came, we still had positive  growth;

1999, we picked up;  2000, we had a boom year;  2001, the  US

economy tanked, the electronics sector went into a slump,  we

went  down.  But we went down from a high level, we went down

from  an economy which was strong, we went down with reserves

in our pocket so that when we needed to help people, we could

take  some of these reserves and we could have generous  off-Budget  packages last year - the New Singapore Shares  -  and

therefore,  we could pull through the crisis and manage.   If

we  did not have that, had we kept our tax rates around  30%,

which  is where they were when we first started this process,

and  just gone ahead, I think we would have gradually  slowed

down  well before 1997/1998; and come 2001, we would  have  a

serious  problem and unemployment would have been much,  much

higher than it is today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, these are the considerations which the Economic

Review  Committee  is working through.  The  subcommittee  is

finalising  their recommendations.  The subcommittee  on  tax

which Mr Tharman is chairing, I believe Mr Tharman intends to

release his recommendations next



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



week.   When the Government receives his recommendations,  we

will consider them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the specific issues which we have to deal

with, one broader issue which we should consider, as we  look

forward, is the question of our social safety nets.  We  have

been  careful over the years to avoid subsidising consumption

in  Singapore.  We subsidise investments, broadly understood,

education, housing, basic healthcare.  It has been  important

to  us that we did this because we are not just a free market

economy,  we  are also a nation and we are also investing  in

our  people and building a population together.  These social

safety nets will remain major elements of our social compact.

It  is part of the deal.  You are a Singaporean, this is  the

package.  You work, you do well, but to start off with,  here

are  things which you will get, not quite a birth right,  but

which  every  Singaporean  will get.   The  safety  nets  are

especially necessary to protect the minority who cannot  fend

for  themselves.  But for education, housing and  healthcare,

our  target group is not just the bottom 20% who cannot  look

after  themselves.  In order to fulfil our social objectives,

we  are aiming these expenditures on a broad middle ground of

Singaporeans because we want full and equal opportunities for

everybody.  So everybody goes to Government schools.  We want

a home owning society.  So 90% of the population lives in HDB

flats.   We want good basic medical care.  So we have  social

policies which reach the vast majority of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These social supports are still important. But we have

got  to  fine-tune them and especially, we have got to  fine-tune  the housing and healthcare part to keep them effective.

The  State  must not over-provide because, by over-providing,

we  may  undermine enterprise and self-reliance  and  we  may

create  a  dependence  mentality.  Our  experience  with  the

Economic  Downturn  Relief Scheme, which we  introduced  last

year,   is   quite   salutary.   MPs  will  have   first-hand

experience.  We did it because we needed to do it, because we

were in a sharp recession.  So we said up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



to $200 for three months.  But quite a number of Singaporeans

spread  the  word around that the Government is  distributing

money.  And they came to queue up for the hand-out because it

would  have  been remiss of them not to come  and  take  this

opportunity.  And they came and we met them at the  meet-the-people  session.   I had one young man come  perfectly  able-bodied,  strapping, he said, "Where is my  money?"   I  said,

"What do you mean by where is your money?"  He said, "I  only

got $100."  I said, "Why should you have more than $100?"  He

said,  "You  said $200 x 3 months here."  He  produced  me  a

newspaper  cutting.  I said, "It says up to  $200  for  three

months."   He  looked at it, he said, "You said up  to  $200.

You  did  not  say  up  to three months."   So  I  asked  the

grassroots leaders to review his case again very carefully to

determine how much he really needed from the EDRS.  But  from

his  point  of  view,  and many other  Singaporeans',  it  is

rational.  "You are distributing, I better make a bid."   So,

if  we  are  going to help people, we will have  to  be  very

careful  to make sure people make an effort.  And it  is  not

just a hand-out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we very quickly learnt. Now, when they come, all the

MPs  say,  "Here you are.  I have a list of jobs.   Have  you

applied  for  any  of them?  If not, here is  an  application

form.   After  you  have tried, come back  and  look  for  me

again."   And  even  the  new  MPs  have  also  learnt   this

technique, because this is the way human nature is  and  that

is  what we have to guard against.  We are nowhere near that,

but  we  have  to make sure that our safety nets avoid  that.

And in the case of healthcare, we are making some adjustments

and  the  Ministry of Health is introducing  selective  means

testing to direct the benefits to where they are most  needed

and, in the case of housing, MND is also making some reviews.

These are major adjustments which can only take place over  a

period of time because they affect a lot of people.  But they

are adjustments which we have to begin to think about and  to

implement carefully, step by step.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now speak about the role of the

Government.   Dr  Wang Kai Yuen asked what is the  Government

for.  The people have elected us.  What do you expect of  the

Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say this is what the Government needs to do, as

far  as  economic management is concerned.   First,  set  the

strategic  direction for the country.  Make this a prosperous

developed   economy,  one  where  everybody   benefits   from

progress, make this a stable and harmonious society where all

the  races and religions live peacefully together.   That  is

the  first  requirement.   Set the goal,  set  the  strategic

objective,  persuade everybody, that is what we  are  working

for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, pursue prudent macro-economic policies: be

careful  with our taxes; be careful with our budget spending;

be  careful with our exchange rate policy or monetary policy,

meaning  the  Singapore dollar exchange  rate;  do  not  take

liberties, do not take shortcuts, because if we decide to  go

for deficit financing, borrow money to spend or we decide  to

depreciate  the  currency as a way out of our  troubles,  the

logical  conclusion of that is Argentina.  We are not getting

there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Government has to set the rules for micro-economics, to make it efficient, to make sure that people can

do  business properly.  So we liberalised telecommunications.

You  can  have  001,  008, 018, any number  of  international

telephone numbers.  Let there be free competition.  We cannot

go  and micro-manage who can charge you how much, but we  can

set  an environment where there will be competition and  that

will  bring  the price down.  So we are talking about  petrol

prices.   We cannot decide how much the petrol companies  can

charge  you.    It is impossible.  We are not  operating  the

petrol  companies.  But we can say, "Here  are  white  sites.

Take  them."   If  NTUC  wants to run a  petrol  station  and

compete  against the petrol companies, by all means  may  the

cheapest  petrol win.  But please manage the  queues  outside

the petrol station.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we need to have the right micro-economic rules. We

set the rules.  We do not play the game.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we have to invest in people, in infrastructure.

That  is  critical.  You could take a purist  view  and  say,

"Well,  the  market will do it.  I will not build  trains,  I

will  not  build  schools,  I  will  not  fund  education  in

university."   But as a pragmatic approach, we  think  it  is

right,  we think it is the best way.  The Government will  do

this,  because  if  the Government did  not  do  this,  quite

frankly,  I  do  not think it would be done  and,  certainly,

would not be done as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, overall, we can foster a pro-growth environment in

Singapore.   You can go to China.  Yes, it is  cheaper.   The

land  is cheaper.  Many people brighter, some of them  better

educated than ours.  But a whole pro-growth environment, that

is  not  so  easy for them to produce, and that is  something

which  we  can  produce  in Singapore.   We  have  harmonious

tripartite  relationships.  The unions  work  with  us.   The

employers  work  with us.  We have the whole system  working,

whether it is the banks, whether it is the telecommunications

companies,  the  Government  is  predictable,  there  are  no

arbitrary impost, there is no red-tape.  We have a pro-growth

environment, but we will focus on what the Government can  do

but  the private sector cannot do.  If the private sector can

do  it,  we will leave it to them.  If they cannot do it,  we

will  do it.  What we cannot do, as a Government, is  to  be:

employer  of last resort - if you cannot find a job,  I  will

hire you; investor of last resort - you need somebody to  buy

into  your  company, I will do that; or Father  Christmas  of

last resort - nobody else will do for you, we will do that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen says how can we be going just on the

basis  of  self-reliance, we are such a small country,  small

island without resources.  I say, on the contrary, because we

are  a  small island, because we have no resources, therefore

we  have to be self-reliant.  If we were a big country, if we

had oil, gas, timber and gold, then we do not have to be self-reliant.   You  just sit back, the Government  will  provide.

But,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



lacking  those,  we  have  to fall  back  on  our  wits,  our

strength, our effort, and that means Singaporeans have to  be

self-reliant.  Those were just the cards we were  dealt  with

when we were created, and that is the way we are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs raised the question of keeping costs low.

Mr  Ravindran  mentioned this first.  He  asked  whether  the

Government departments were making huge profits.  After that,

Mr  Steve Chia echoed him.  I have a friendly word of  advice

for Steve Chia who may be new, that he should be careful when

he  picks up points from the PAP Backbenchers and uses  them.

Usually  it is quite safe because our Backbenchers make  good

points but, once in a while, they are off target and then  he

will be in trouble.  In this case, I think they are wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans get Government cheaply. The total tax

burden  in  Singapore is only 18% of the GDP.  If we  go  for

welfare  programmes, if we have more subsidies,  if  we  have

unemployment  benefits, if we go for free medical  care  like

European countries or like Britain, then the burden  will  go

up  and  the  cost  will  go up.  In Europe,  the  government

consumes 45% of GDP.  We are 18%.  In America, which has much

lighter burdens than Europe, the government consumes  30%  of

GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the way to have low costs is for us to have a small

Government and keep our subsidies to a minimum.  There is  no

free  lunch or, as the Opposition sometimes says, in Chinese,

"yang  mao  chu zai yang shen shang", ie, wool on  the  sheep

grows  from  the  body  of  the sheep.   Anything  which  the

Government spends, it is the people's money.  If  we  do  not

recover  the  costs of services, then the Government  has  to

fund  these services from taxes or from printing money.   Our

policy  is  to recover the costs, no more.  We  try  hard  to

improve  efficiency  and  cut costs further,  and  there  are

opportunities to do that.  And I would not say that, in every

single  instance,  we are as lean and as  trim  as  we  could

absolutely be.  But, by and large, we are not doing too badly

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just to make quite sure, let me make you all a

generous offer.  Anybody who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



thinks that we are overcharging for any service and that  you

could  do  it cheaper, make us an offer, take over  providing

that service, and we will make a deal with you.  You take  it

over,  you make a reasonable margin, we will save some  money

and  the  public  will also save some money.   We  are  quite

serious about that.  From the Ministry of Finance's point  of

view,  if people will come forward with such offers, it  will

make  it  much  easier for me, as Finance Minister,  to  keep

expenditures and taxes down.  But, by and large, we  are  not

doing badly and our policy, as stated in the Addenda, is  not

for  us  to make a profit from our services.  It is  just  to

break even and cover our costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if I may put in a good word for civil servants.

Assoc.  Prof. Chin Tet Yung blames civil servants  for  rigid

policies  and  for not listening with their hearts.   Dr  Amy

Khor  also  asked  for civil servants to be  less  rule-bound

because,  otherwise, they may be neither civil nor  servants.

After the former Speaker's speech yesterday, I hesitate to be

misunderstood  as  being thin-skinned, but  since  the  civil

servants  are unable to defend themselves, it is my  duty  to

speak on their behalf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil servants do not always measure up to the ideals

which we have set for ourselves in the Public Service 21, but

we  have  set  our ideals and we do try our best,  first,  to

implement efficiently, flexibly and courteously policies and,

secondly,  to be transparent and to explain the decision  and

why  we  have reached a certain decision, even if  we  cannot

accede  to  it.  It is not always possible, because sometimes

reasons  are  confidential, sometimes a matter  of  judgement

and,  if  it is a matter of opinion, then a panel of decision

makers  has  to look at the facts and decide.   There  is  no

right  or wrong.  If you are the appellant, you will say,  "I

want  it";  if  he is the decision maker, he has  to  make  a

decision.   But, to the extent possible, we will explain,  we

will  operate  efficiently, quickly and we will  give  you  a

proper answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But remember that the policies are decided by the

political leaders, not by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



civil   servants.    We,   the  Executive,   have   to   take

responsibility.  If the policy is wrong, the MPs should raise

it  in Parliament and we can debate it and decide whether  we

are  right, in which case, the policy stands, or, if  we  are

wrong, in which case, the policy should be changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the specific case which Assoc. Prof. Chin raised

about  HDB  not  approving premature requests to  sell  flats

because  owners cannot afford it and they want to  downgrade,

it  so  turns out that it is not true that HDB never  agrees.

From time to time, HDB does agree.  It examines all the cases

and,  in  specific cases where there are good justifications,

HDB  will act.  Last year, they had about 30 cases where  the

minimum occupation period was waived for financial hardship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if there is a policy which is not right, Parliament

is  the place to debate it.  If there are cases which are not

properly handled ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the cases are

not properly handled and in Members' view an exception should

be  made  or  the rule should be changed, raise it  with  the

Parliamentary  Secretary, raise it with the Minister  and  it

will  be seen to.  We all take meet-the-people session  (MPS)

cases, we have seen hundreds and thousands of them.  Not  all

the  MPS  cases  can  succeed.  If  somebody  has  a  traffic

offence, he will come to you and say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



"Please, can you waive the demerit points?"  If we waive  all

the  demerit points, we would be in a state of anarchy,   "bo

cheng hu".  So not all the cases can succeed but, if you  are

a  conscientious  MP, you will know that some  cases  deserve

special  effort.  And if there is a special case, it is  your

duty  to  take  it  up.   If  you cannot  get  joy  from  the

Parliamentary Secretary, you raise with the Minister.  If the

Minister cannot solve it, then the MPs can raise with  me  or

the PM.  Everybody knows that PM is a very gentle man, and  I

try  my  best not to bristle.  So I think the matter  can  be

resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil servants have to listen with their hearts but,

actually,  it is the duty of the political leaders to  listen

with  their  hearts and also to think with  their  heads  and

then,  when  you  set policies, set the right policies  which

will achieve the best results for Singapore.  That is how the

system is supposed to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done well for many years because we have always

looked  beyond our immediate problems to anticipate  problems

and events which are over the horizon.  I just give you a few

stray examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water tariffs. We started revising them up in 1997. We

did  it  over three or four years.  Now they are at  a  level

where  it  is  viable  for  us  to  develop  NEWater  as   an

alternative additional source of water.  That is critical.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial services. We liberalised it in 1997, just

before  the  Asian financial crisis.  There  we  should  have

foreseen  things a little earlier, but we were in  time,  and

just  in  time to get ourselves repositioned.   So  there  is

still  a  basis for Singapore to be a financial  centre  now,

despite the difficulties of the countries around us.  Had  we

not  moved  in 1997, I think we would be in deep difficulties

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GST, in 1994, which enabled us to reduce direct taxes

over  the years and kept us competitive, enabled us to  reach

here  and  to think of the next step of the restructuring  of

our tax system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And political self-renewal, done over many years, which

has brought us this new Parliament, not just the latest batch

of  MPs  but  the successive batches of MPs -  fresh  voices,

fresh  ideas, representatives of the population in tune  with

the mood ready to bring Singapore ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we expect if we look ahead? Slower growth,

less   equal   distribution   of  income,   more   structural

unemployment.  Mr Low Thia Khiang highlighted these words  of

the President and they are on the cards.  Our policies cannot

prevent these trends from happening because these are  global

trends  which  will  carry us along.  But  our  policies  can

mitigate these trends.  If we do the right things, we can  be

competitive,  we  will attract investments,  we  will  create

jobs,  we  will enable people to earn their own  living,  far

more than any Government hongbaos or generosity.  That is why

we  have  got to make the strategic choices now.  The changes

are  uncomfortable and unsettling, yes, but if  we  make  the

changes now, if we accept the discomfort and the pain, if  we

find ways to minimise the difficulties and implement what  we

need  to  do, then we will give ourselves the best chance  of

succeeding as a nation in the uncertain times ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br>4.02 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his

Address,  the  President  has  outlined  the  challenges  for

Singapore and the steps we need going forward in this era  of

a  globalised economy.  I would like to echo his call and  to

specially  mention  three areas that are  worth  our  further

deliberations.  They are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The inevitable outcome of globalisation in widening

the income gap, thereby increasing the societal divide;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The redesigning of the education system in

Singapore; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The revamping of the healthcare scene in the

globalised economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my first topic, Sir, Singapore families are earning

more than a decade ago but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



the  2000  Census  data  shows that the  divide  between  the

richest and the very poor has widened.  During the last year,

the top 20% of households had an average income 21 times that

for  the  lowest 20%.  This trend is going to  stay  and  the

divide  is  going to broaden further in the  next  10  to  20

years.   This  is  inevitable with the  change  when  we  are

striving towards an entrepreneurial and innovative society in

the face of a globalised world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this is a concern was reflected in what the

President  said,  and I quote, "our income distribution  will

stretch",  and  "as we upgrade our economy, we must  maintain

and  strengthen  our social cohesion".  The  fear  from  this

divide is the disruption of the stability and very fabric  of

our  society.  The social and political implications will  be

great.   Sir, my concerns are especially for those low income

earners  who  will be further marginalised due to  their  low

education and significant structural unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an urgent need for efforts to maintain social

cohesion  as globalisation pulls the wages of top earners  up

while pressing those of the least well-off down.  What can be

done?   The  assistance for the lowest strata of the  society

that  are  existing from our Government must be re-looked  to

see  if  they  are  adequate to keep  up  with  this  present

widening income strength.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to review our various schemes on a more

regular  basis.  Especially as Mr Lee just said earlier  that

there  may be a rise in indirect taxes that will have  impact

on  lower  income groups.  Sir, the PAP won a strong  mandate

from Singaporeans because the PAP has a tremendous record for

being  able to deliver on its promises to the people.  Today,

I  would  like to ask on behalf of Singaporeans that the  PAP

Government not only make good the promises it has made in the

last  GE,  but  also  make it at a speedier  pace.   This  is

especially so where there is much sufferance incurred on  the

needy,  the  retrenched and on the children of families  with

difficulties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As DPM Tony Tan has said, "The job of MPs is to attend

not just the big picture, but also these personal concerns of

their  constituents".  Sir, whilst all MPs should  contribute

towards  remaking our future, they must also have a  hand  on

forging   a  new  social  impact.   Therefore,  more  schemes

involving MPs should be put in place in the delivery of  help

and care to the residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second topic, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this. In the past

few  years,  education in Singapore had undergone changes  to

provide  for flexibility and innovations to enhance  national

economic   competitiveness  in  the  global   economy.    The

President has said, and I quote, "We should inculcate in  the

young  a more inquiring and adventurous spirit, and encourage

them  to  think  up new ideas and create new  opportunities".

Sir,  I agree with the President and I would like to add that

such  inculcation  in our young must be started  early,  when

they are still in school, to have greatest impact.  Whilst  I

applaud  the Government for redesigning our education  system

to  one  where,  among  other things,  creativity  is  highly

encouraged,  one  cannot  help but wonder  how  this  can  be

achieved  if our students are under constant stress.   Surely

this  will  have  a  negative impact on and  can  potentially

stifle  the development of creativity and innovation  in  our

students.   Although  we  have an internationally  recognised

education   system,   we  have  unfortunately   developed   a

reputation for having a stressful education system.  Children

complain that they have little time for play because they are

burdened with plenty of homework and studying for assessments

and  examinations,  besides having to participate  in  extra-curricular  activities  and going for tuition  or  enrichment

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study by Dr Stella Quah of the National University of

Singapore on the Singapore Family revealed that the  greatest

worry for about 45% of them came from the problems associated

with their children's education.  In 1998, 2,358 new cases of

children  aged  below  18  were  registered  at  Government's

psychiatric clinics.  In almost 95% of the cases, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



children  were  not mad.  Sir, they were just  stressed  out.

Half  of these cases were children from primary schools,  35%

from  secondary schools and 15% were pre-schoolers.   Parents

have been blamed for the stress in children.  If this is  so,

then  it  is  time  to also look into the causal  factors  in

parents and address them accordingly.  We need to re-look  at

heavy syllabus with too much homework and stress, ranking  of

schools, streaming and varsity-entry criteria and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the stress of education is real for students. The

Government   has  recognised  that  innovative   skills   and

creativity are important.  But its push to promote innovative

skills  and creativity in children may be jeopardised by  the

amount  of  maximum curricula in the name of maximising  each

child's potential.  Sir, how do we transit into the new  way?

Are   there  existing  policies  that  in  fact  impede  this

transition?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning my last topic, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

development of Singapore into the Medical Hub of  the  region

and turning Singapore into the Mayo Clinic of Southeast Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that recently, Government leaders have said

that Singapore's economy can be revamped by promoting it as a

regional  hub  for  services like healthcare,  education  and

tourism.   Sir, it is possible to develop Singapore into  the

Mayo Clinic of Southeast Asia if we put our minds to it.  The

Mayo  Clinic  in the United States is one of the top  medical

centres  in  the  world, giving comprehensive  treatment  for

virtually  any  disease.  I would like to  discuss  the  ways

towards this path.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortage of doctors and medical personnel is a limiting

factor  and I feel the way to overcome it now is to  maximise

the  pool we have at the moment.  Training new ones will take

time, but this is not to say we need not start training  more

new  ones  right  now.  Maximisation of our present  pool  of

doctors  has to come from the integration of the  public  and

private sectors. We need to treat both sectors as one  entity

and  tap  their potential fully so as to become the  regional

medical hub we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



aspire.   We  can  call upon the many private specialists  to

contribute  more.   They can return to  work  in  the  public

hospitals  and  many of them can even go into research  work.

We  must  train  more  medical personnel  to  cater  for  the

increased  demands.   We  need  to  enhance  development   of

clinical education and research.  These are but a few aspects

that  have  to be seen to quickly or we may lose the  cutting

edge  we  have against our neighbouring countries  that  have

started going in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the case against our becoming a medical hub

was  the fear that the healthcare costs will rise further for

the  locals and that the country could see another exodus  of

top  specialists  into the private sector.   Sir,  a  mindset

change is required here.  As a medical hub, we may not face a

rise in healthcare costs for local patients.  This is because

full-paying foreign patients may even be a source of subsidy,

apart from giving spin-off effects for our other services  by

having  more visitors to Singapore.  Moreover, we can  always

have  mechanisms put in place so as to limit  the  amount  of

public sector resources that can be used for foreign patients

and to cause all doctors who want part of the foreign pie  to

contribute  some  of  their  time  in  treating   our   local

subsidised patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as long as quality and priority healthcare services

are provided for in our public hospitals to Singaporeans,  as

Mr  Lee  said  earlier,  good basic  medical  care  for  all,

provision of healthcare services to foreigners should be seen

as a new strategy for us to move to the next level in the new

economy.   A visiting Harvard don said that Singapore  has  a

clear  edge  in  the consulting, engineering  and  healthcare

industries  in Asia.  Sir, he said that there are  tremendous

needs  in the region for healthcare services and the industry

can be much bigger than IT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for increased collaboration between

private  hospitals and private entities to promote  Singapore

as  a medical hub.  Under present circumstances, such schemes

should not be undertaken by the public hospitals as this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



will   further  tax  their  resources  and  may  also   cause

misunderstanding  in  perceived  differential  treatment   to

patients.   Promoting  its  services  overseas  can  be  done

through  and  with  the  Singapore  Tourism  Board  and  tour

agencies with innovations that combine healthcare services as

part  of  tourism  promotion.  Having packages  in  insurance

products  that can be sold in the region resulting in  people

coming  to  Singapore for medical check-ups  every  year  and

having  their  travel,  hotel and even shopping  needs  being

looked  after  as  well.   The spin-off  effect  of  being  a

regional medical hub will be big for other services, such  as

hotel, retail, convention industries and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this new economy, Singapore must reinvent itself

to  achieve  greater  success in the  future  and  the  above

considerations should be part of this process.

rise in support of Mrs Lim Hwee Hua's motion of thanks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coincidentally, there are four medical doctors,

including  myself, speaking today.  Allow me  to  present  my

diagnosis of what ails the ground.  It is however by no means

a  contradictory  second opinion from  my  previously  spoken

medical colleagues.  It will be difficult to speak after  DPM

Lee, as he has addressed many of my concerns that I would  be

listing.   Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me  deliver  my

concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his Speech at the Opening of the Tenth

Parliament, has charged this House with the responsibility of

seeing  Singapore through severe challenges.  The President's

Speech  struck  in me a disturbing thought.  I  realise  that

Singaporeans  of my generation have grown up with  the  world

view  that  if we work hard and gain good qualifications,  we

will be guaranteed a secure future.  We took for granted that

Singapore  will continue to enjoy rapid growth, while  issues

of racial and religious harmony



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



were never in our conscience.  But things have changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two recessions in the last five years have shown us that

good  qualifications, extensive experience and hard  work  do

not  guarantee continued employment.  The new reality is that

Singapore  is  plugged  into the global  economy.   A  ripple

elsewhere can turn into a tidal wave for us.  In the past, we

could  ride  out these waves because our ship  of  state  was

better  equipped, our people better trained and, while others

floundered,  we   sailed through.  But  now  everyone  has  a

comparable  ship  of  state.  Everyone is  investing  in  and

upgrading  their human capital.  Everyone is  vying  for  the

same talents which today, more than ever, is globally mobile.

I  shall now stop this maritime simile in case the House  may

think that I am all at sea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are indeed very severe challenges facing

Singapore.   We  are in the midst of an unprecedented  storm.

Unemployment has reached a high of 5%, and this situation  is

likely  to  get worse before it does get any better.   Hence,

the resounding victory of the last General Election is by  no

means   an  absolute  support  for  all  the  PAP  Government

policies.    In  fact,  there  is  some  disquiet   that   is

reverberating  across  Singapore over  some  issues,  causing

Singaporeans to think whether they are second class citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to just highlight briefly some of these issues.

At  the  meet-the-people sessions, the  number  of  financial

assistance  cases, as a result of job losses,  has  increased

manifold.  It is heart wrenching to see a grown up man of  50

years  old  asking for help to pay his son's school  fees  of

about  $300, amidst the fact that he has mounting rental  and

utilities arrears.  Here is a hale and hearty man asking  for

help  because he is jobless.  What more the numerous  elderly

citizens  out  there in the society?  Here is a  man  who  is

antithesis  to our perennial fear of Singapore lapsing into a

welfare  state if we give handouts.  He wants  to  work,  yet

cannot  find one, maybe through no fault of his, and  he  and

his family suffer for it.  This is a common sight at the meet-the-people sessions, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



I  am  sure  it  is  also  a common sight  with  many  of  my

parliamentary colleagues in their meet-the-people sessions as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we might therefore need to review our many-helping-hands policy towards the needy. The current economic crisis

affects  almost  every  layer  of  Singapore.   It   is   not

discriminative.  Presently, the State intervenes  only  after

exhausting the needy person's immediate next-of-kin, ie,  his

siblings and the extended family.  Many themselves are facing

critical  difficulties  in  times  like  this.   I  urge  the

Government to consider how we may increase our assistance  to

the needy, which need not lapse into welfarism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, there is no denying that foreign talents have

contributed to Singapore.  However, what we have gained  from

the  new foreign talents, we have lost many of our own  local

talents  who  have  migrated overseas in  search  of  greener

pastures.  I am however apprehensive to the long-term effects

to Singapore of the loss of Singapore's sons overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not saying chase out the foreigners. Rather,

while we have the added contributions of foreign talents, are

we doing enough to prevent a local brain drain?  Are we doing

enough to boost the morale of local talent  and prevent  them

from slipping into thinking that they are not wanted and they

are  second  class talents?  Are we doing enough to  increase

the  competitiveness of Singaporeans in the global employment

market  now  that we are very much plugged into  the  world's

system?   Singapore's  youths suffer in the  competition  for

employment  opportunities, since they spend two  and  a  half

years of the prime of their life serving the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the thousands who are unemployed, schemes to reduce

taxes and to upgrade the infrastructure merely add insult  to

their  injury.  Of what benefit are lower taxes if  one  does

not  even  earn  an income?  Of what use is  a  spanking  new

airport  if going on holiday is but a distant dream?  Arrears

in  utilities  charges, rental payments,  traffic  fines  and

unable to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



service  the financial obligations are definitely  increasing

in  numbers.   I  wonder what is happening to  our  Singapore

dream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Government's response to the critical

structural unemployment has been for retrenched workers to go

for training and further retraining.  There are also a number

and  variety  of  training  schemes  in  place  offering  job

matching, services to the unemployed and financial grants  to

those  who are especially needy.  But to the majority of  the

108,000 unemployed and, to me, these are efforts to build our

hardware and not our "heartware".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build heartware, we must tackle the issues at the

fundamental level.  We must ask ourselves what we can  do  to

serve  those  who  are  particularly vulnerable  to  economic

downturns.  For instance, it is an often-heard comment of the

unemployed middle age, "what is the use of retraining when we

know that after going through it, I am still unable to find a

job?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unemployment problem has become more complex. The

jobless  bug has bitten not only the older workers  but  also

the  younger  tertiary  educated  as  well.   Our  young  and

tertiary educated are now facing greater challenges from  all

over  the  world.  They are however handicapped  by  national

service as well as financial obligations upon graduation.  It

is  tantamount to our S-League footballers in their late  20s

facing  younger  and faster players, such as  David  Beckham,

Ronaldo and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also address the needs of those who are

disadvantaged.   For  example, a recurrent  theme  among  the

unemployed  has  been  that the older  workers  face  greater

hurdles  in  re-entering the job market.  Companies  tend  to

discriminate against such workers for a variety  of  reasons,

and   if  age  can  be  a  handicap,  what  more  a  physical

disability.  We have to ask ourselves if what we are building

is a Singapore that is home only to the hale and hearty, that

our  hospitals  offering world-class medical treatment  cater

only to rich foreigners.  Obviously



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



not.   The  point  I  want to make is  that  our  competitive

advantages  can  no longer come from mere  hardware.   World-class   infrastructure,  competitive  tax  structures,  well-trained  workers  can and will, over time, be  replicated  by

others.   Where Singapore must distinguish itself is  in  its

heartware.   By  this, I mean a spirit among Singaporeans  to

pull  together  to overcome adversity, to feel an  unshakable

sense  of  belonging  to Singapore.  I  admit  that  this  is

definitely easier said than done.  Some may argue that such a

process,  which  we  could call nation  building,  cannot  be

engineered.  But such argument goes against the very grain of

what  Singapore stands for.  It is through the sheer will  of

our  founding leaders and their colleagues that we are on our

way to nationhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on and turn to the theme of providing support

to  our  elderly  and our infirm.  Developing heartware  also

involves  recognising the contributions of our  elderly.   We

must   also  embrace  those  who  are  disadvantaged  through

physical or mental disabilities, and we must not develop into

a  society  that  nurtures  its people  only  when  they  are

productive, and to cast them aside when they can no longer do

so.   We must show Singaporeans that they are not like  curry

leaves,  discarded  after the curry is made.   What  we  must

remember is that Singapore is built on the sweat and toils of

our  elders, and this is an obvious point but one that merits

reiterating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another obvious point is that the proportion of the

elderly in Singapore will continue to increase, and hence the

need  for  step-down care services.  Sir, let me  declare  my

interest  at this point of time, as I am the Medical Director

of  a  local VWO that offers step-down care services.   Step-down  care  refers to services that are offered  to  patients

after  they are discharged from hospitals, and such  services

are   important  because  they  serve  two  major  functions.

Firstly,  they allow patients to be discharged from hospitals

faster,  thereby  relieving the pressure  on  hospitals  that

constantly face shortages of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



hospital  beds,  and also thereby reducing the  cost  to  the

patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a patient who is discharged from hospital

cannot be considered to have fully recovered.  A good example

would  be a stroke patient.  He or she might not be  able  to

feed  himself, bathe or walk independently.  Thus,  step-down

care services are needed to nurse these patients back to  the

best  possible  condition.  This  is  a  step  in  the  right

direction  for  our healthcare industry, and the  net  result

would  be  a  healthcare cost that is at a manageable  level,

while   the  level  of  service  post-hospitalisation   would

increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we have a good range of nursing homes and

rehabilitative  day care centres.  However, what  is  lacking

are  home  care  services, especially home medical  and  home

physiotherapy.  Through Government's healthcare policies, the

majority  of these services are offered by voluntary  welfare

organisations.   By and large, the VWOs are  doing  exemplary

work,  but there is still room for improvement.  We  have  to

find   a   way   to  raise  the  standard    and   level   of

professionalism among the VWOs and, at the same time, seek to

identify those that can serve as role models for others.  The

Government   must  develop  and  support  more  organisations

offering  such  services to our elderly, and also  constantly

audit the standard of their services.  It is no doubt a  step

in the right direction for the Government to devolve the step-down   services   to   professional   VWOs.    However,   the

Government's role in providing overall healthcare  cannot  be

diminished as a result.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many professional VWOs are left to the vagaries of the

free  market system, thereby having to compete against market

forces  in maintaining their cost.  They struggle to  balance

their  books  and, consequently, sometimes have to  sacrifice

services for cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the not too distant future, the demand for step-down care services would proliferate in leaps and bounds,

including many of us in the House.  Surely,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



there is a role for the Government to ensure the adequacy  of

such  services and the quality expected of does not diminish.

Again,  failing to do so would send the wrong signals to  the

general  citizenry.  I am happy to note  that  Mayor  Teo  Ho

Pin's  CDC  has  launched a scheme to ensure  that  step-down

services  are available to the non-ambulant patients  in  his

CDC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the tasks that face us are no less

monumental.    Though  monumental,  the  challenge   is   not

insurmountable.   We must use this opportunity  to  put  into

place  initiatives which will instead root Singaporeans  more

firmly  in our nation, and establish a society which is  able

to   withstand   adversity,  because  we   have   world-class

heartware.   Even  as the Economic Review Committee  and  the

Committee on Remaking Singapore proceed with their  work,  it

is incumbent on Members of this House to drive home the point

that all our work must centre around the average Singaporean.

More  importantly, while we proceed to remake  Singapore  and

review the measures needed, we need to continuously strive to

win  the  hearts  and minds of the people.  This  is  an  old

theme.  Lest I be accused of a young person sounding like  an

old  record, this is the theme that has universal importance,

and it cannot be over emphasised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to speak in support of the motion by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua to

thank the President for his Address to this Parliament.

<br><br><i>Change</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Change', Mr Speaker, Sir, is the buzzword today. In

fact, throughout history, change is the only constant.  It is

the only way by which our body renews and rejuvenates itself,

our  mind  keeps pace with the dynamo of the  world.   Change

changes life and change will not change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is confusing, that is indeed how many people

react  to change.  Confusion, uncertainties, pain and  a  new

world order,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



which  not  all  can understand or keep pace  with,  are  the

products of change.  As a sociology student, I used to sit by

Orchard  Road and watched the world go by.  I used to observe

how   people   react  towards  unanticipated  events.    When

something happened, some shrugged their shoulders and  walked

away,  some  screamed  and got angry, and  some  launched  an

investigation to see if there was an opportunity to reap.   I

realise  that for every action, and that includes non-action,

there is a reaction, there is a consequence.  Therefore,  how

we  react  to the changes around us today will determine  our

social, economic and political destiny.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, my question, Sir, is how are we responding to the

changes  today?  Do we respond as a victim of change, thereby

feeling helpless, willy-nilly?  Or do we respond as a  critic

of change, thereby generating negative energy?  Do we respond

as  a bystander, awaiting for all to move before hopping onto

the  bandwagon?  Or do we respond to change as  a  navigator,

seeking  to  lead and reap, and write our own  story?   Every

generation  has a story.  What is the story for  our  current

and future generation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a national level, I am thankful that we have a

`navigator' Government that chooses to grab the bull  by  its

horns  and  ride  on  the  waves of change.   Our  Government

realises  that  we need to constantly check on ourselves  and

stay  relevant to the dynamos of the world.  We are  at  this

milestone check now, and we have promised to `leave no  stone

unturned'.

<br><br><i>Personal response and choices</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an individual level, however, the picture is less

clear.   My  question here is:  Are we aware, as individuals,

that  we  do have a choice?  Earlier on, the hon. Member,  Dr

Vivian Balakrishnan, stated that his junior asked him why  he

should  be  fighting for Singapore and dying  for  Singapore.

And  the hon. Member, Dr Wang Kai Yuen, asked him whether  it

was  a  result  of our education or social system  or  family

upbringing.  I suppose my question is:  Is it because we have

been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



so  caught up with our own work, at our individual, adult  or

parent level, that we have not spent enough time to inculcate

some  of these values, such as emotional rootedness, that  Dr

Vivian  spoke about, in our children?  It appears  that  more

than  40  years  of  prosperity have bred  a  new  cohort  of

Singaporeans who have not made a habit of making up their own

minds   and  whipping  up  enough  courage  to  pursue  their

passions.  There is no denial that many of us would prefer to

hit the well-beaten path.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could it be that some of us still live in the shadows of

the  1960s' state of emergency?  Or could it be that we  have

been  running so relentlessly up the economic ladder, sparing

little  time to pause, reflect and dwell deeper into what  we

really  want or what we are really about?  Or is it  that  we

have  a  Government that cares, and cares so  much,  that  we

often  look to our Government for all directions and  answers

to  our  life  -  from economic means to  business  ideas  to

personal  life  choices?  Obviously, I have not  heeded  that

call yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was once said that when the US sneezes,

Singapore  catches pneumonia.  Similarly, when our Government

opens  a  door, many people rush in there without questioning

why.   Obviously, when something goes wrong,  the  Government

gets  the  blame.  Sometimes, the Government also  gets  away

with it, because there simply does not seem to be another way

out.   Many of us are in our comfort zones, and some  perhaps

do  not see or even want a way out.  I cannot agree more with

the  hon.  Member  Koo Tsai Kee who said that  as  we  become

richer,  we become more kiasu, or scared to lose.   I  myself

was in that trap before.  Years ago, I sold my car and was in

the  midst of shopping for a bigger and better car.   When  a

friend  asked me out, I told her that I could not  because  I

had no car.  She screamed and said:  "You have no car but you

have  `kahs',  meaning my legs.  So what  is  your  problem?"

Sir,  I was awakened.  I realised that years ago when  all  I

had was a backpack on my back, I was mobile and dexterous.  I

could go anywhere I wanted, to pursue my dreams.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



Not  kiasu, not kiasi.  As I accumulate some wealth, I became

hesitant  and cautious, thereby suffering from paralysis  via

analysis.  What an irony!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, but I realise I am not alone in my predicament. I

have  come across many people at the meet-the-people  session

who  are  handicapped by their material trappings,  and  they

could not harness new horizons as a result.  We know of  many

retrenched workers who place more importance on job types and

job distances, even in the face of mounting debts.  Many will

rather  wait  for  the  right job  and  apply  for  financial

assistance  meanwhile.  Sir, the Government can  only  do  so

much.

<br><br><i>People and Government</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jack Neo's recent production `I Not Stupid', which

has  been mentioned many times in this Parliament, there  was

this  mother  who had so over-provided for the well-being  of

her child, that the child did not even know how to butter his

own  bread.  What will happen when mummy is no longer  around

or as able?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to put our citizens in the driver seat. Not one

person, not a small group of people, but all Singaporeans  at

large.   We  must  get our people to say `what  I  can  do?',

rather  than `what can the Government do?'  In our  quest  to

remake   Singapore,   let  us  focus   on   encouraging   and

facilitating  our  people to think and  work  for  what  they

believe  in, rather than provide all the answers.   Let  each

one  take  ownership of his destiny, and switch gear  from  a

reactive  to a proactive mode.  We must switch gear,  from  a

government-centric approach to a people-centric approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not advocating the abdication of the Government's

role or responsibility.  That just cannot be the case.  I  am

advocating  shared responsibility for a common destiny.   The

Government  should  be  after all, by the  people,  from  the

people  and for the people.  For what is a government without

popular  support?  In Karl Marx's theory about the  bourgeois

and proletariat, polarisation will lead to a revolution.   We

are  far  from that but we must be mindful of any  divide  or

gap.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Needed space</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bridging will certainly mean more risks and take more

space.   However,  this  is  the necessary  space  needed  to

germinate  a  self-conscious society,  the  space  needed  to

encourage   an   enterprising  population,   the   space   to

experiment,  fall and rejuvenate.  Rome was not  built  in  a

day, we must be patient and tolerant.  However, we do need to

accelerate our learning curve in Internet time, in real time,

and for the sceptical ones, for real this time.

<br><br><i>Core value system as anchor</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where do we start? I suggest we start with the

basics, with the fundamentals.  There was a time where  quick

fixes  and get-rich-quick dot-com companies ruled the market.

That  did not last very long.  When the Internet bubble burst

and  the  dot-coms became dot `cons' and dot  `gones',  value

stocks   and   fundamentally  strong   companies   prevailed.

Similarly, let us invest in our own value system.  It is only

when  we  know what we are about, then can we battle external

pressures.   Sun Tze once said: Zhi bi zhi ji, bai  zhan  bai

sheng (    ,     ).  Translated literally, it means "Know thy

enemy,  know thyself, hundred battles fought, hundred battles

won."  To a certain extent, we are only what we think, so let

us  jointly  identify and strengthen our shared core  values,

let it permeate the different strata of our society, not just

via  talk,  but  via  conscious efforts to externalise  these

values in our daily activities.  In other words, let us  walk

our talk.

<br><br><i>Adjust responses to harness opportunities</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we know what we stand for, then let us adjust our

reactions  to change.  We are in a challenging  time  and  we

have  crisis  to surmount.  The Chinese term  for  crisis  is

weiji (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Weiji means weixian de shi hou, bi you jihui

(     ,       ).    It   implies  that   there   are   always

opportunities amidst adversity.  After all, good value  cheap

sales  surface only in hard times.  Hence, if we  can  change

our collective dominant thought from that of facing adversity

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



finding opportunities, then the net result must be better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to break through glass ceilings and expand our

mental  box.   As  water has no fixed form, survival  has  no

fixed   rules.    In  the  industrial  age,  a   hardworking,

experienced  and  highly-educated person is almost  made  for

life.   In the information age, experience and age can become

liabilities, not assets, if we choose not to respond positive

to  changes.   Many  people will become contract  workers  or

freelance consultants in this era.  This change will not only

affect jobs and careers; it affects the entire lifestyle.  We

need to take stock of where we are now, and where we want  to

go,   in   order   to   harness  the  regional   and   global

opportunities.

<br><br><i>Stock take: Government ok, people?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to taking stock, I think the Government

has been prudent in its spending and some say, aggressive  in

its investments and earnings, and therefore we have built  up

enough  resources  to tackle the challenges  and  to  harness

opportunities.   However, the same  cannot  be  said  at  the

individual  level.  Many residents came to me  with  numerous

bills  unpaid  and little resources to last.  Many  of  these

bills  relate  to  lifestyle  expenses.   I  am  very,   very

concerned.  Here, again, I refer to the value system  of  our

people.  Does more mean better?  "Money no enough!" - that is

the  common outcry of many Singaporeans.  The truth is, money

is  never  going  to be enough as long as we are  buying  the

latest  hi-fi,  upgrading, having posh  furniture,  and  keep

paying  them in instalments.  Are we heading towards becoming

a  society  of consumerism and debt?   The latest  report  in

2001  showed  a  28% increase in credit card  debts  and  19%

increase  in personal, not business, bankruptcy.  This  could

be   conveniently  attributed  to  the  recession,  but   the

underlying  cause  is  largely  spending  on  credit.    With

anticipated slowdown in wage increment, we must not develop a

new generation of big spenders with huge debts and be trapped

in  the obsessive pursuit of the 5 `Cs'.  Do we want to  hold

our future generation hostage to debts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



created  today?  The answer must be `no'.  Spending  of  what

one  earns is not wrong, but spending beyond one's means runs

contrary  to the basic economic formula of save,  invest  and

accumulate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that for some people, poverty is a stark

reality.   For others, it could just be a state of  mind.   I

would like to ask, is it the high cost of living, or the cost

of  high  living, that leaves us breathless?  I  believe  the

answer  lies somewhere between the two ends.  Perhaps instead

of  working non-stop to acquire more and more, we  could  re-evaluate our financial objectives, lest we end up chasing our

own  tail.   While we work hard to make money, we could  also

learn  to make money work harder for us.  A particular credit

card  company  urges us not to `leave home without   it'.   I

say,  if you cannot resist temptations, you better leave home

without it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good financial discipline and the attitude towards money

can  be  nurtured  from young.  Young children  should  learn

about  the  importance  of savings.  Older  students  can  be

encouraged  to operate school cooperatives, thereby  incubate

entrepreneurs  who will learn about the value  of  money  and

financial  management.  With social and domestic sciences  in

our  academic  curriculum, perhaps  it  is  time  for  us  to

consider  including  financial  science  as  well.   We   can

increase FQ, or financial quotient, this way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adults, parents and retirees too can benefit from such

knowledge  and  proper understanding of  money  attitude  and

tools.   Yesterday, the hon. Member Mr Lim Boon Heng wondered

aloud  if  there is a way to reconcile the lack of retirement

funds  with  perhaps  too  much  housing.   May  I  offer  my

observation.   Our CPF savings for the ordinary  folks  is  a

powerful   retirement  tool,  but  only  if  it  is  properly

understood and utilised.  To illustrate using the Census 2001

report  of  an average household income of $4,943 per  month,

and assuming an average household works for 30 years of their

life, they would potentially be able to accumulate a combined

CPF savings of $1.037 million,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



based  on an average compound interest rate of 3% per  annum.

In   other  words,  the  average  Singaporean  household   is

potentially a millionaire household.  If only people  realise

this  and  moderate their demand for a nice roof  with  their

need for a nice retirement nest-egg, retirement funding would

become more achievable.  The problem here is, Sir, that  many

Singaporeans  do  not  perceive their CPF  savings  as  their

retirement nest-egg.  What they perceive their CPF savings is

money  stuck in the Government's coffer.  As such, they  will

seek  all ways to withdraw it.  Housing withdrawals  have  no

cap,  and  is perceived as a status symbol, and  a  means  to

release  their  funds from CPF.  I agree  with  Mr  Lim  that

taking  a  huge  mortgage loan in one's 50s when  one  cannot

afford it is disastrous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have designed a world-class retirement system,

the CPF system.  It is now time for us to go one step further

to  ensure  that our people fully understand its prowess  and

utilise it accordingly.  While the CPF liberalisation is much

welcomed,   systematic  education  is   needed   to   prevent

unsystematic leakages.  May I suggest that the CPF Board  and

HDB  look into the possibility of playing a much bigger  role

in advising Singaporeans in their finances?  It may sound out

of this world, but I know and I understand that these are not

traditional roles, but perhaps we can think out  of  the  box

and either build or outsource some of these services to start

a  financial  counselling process for very major purchases  - much  like that of marriage counselling.  The emphasis should

be  on the attitudes and habits around money, rather than  on

technical calculations, as is being done today.  Certainly, a

financially savvy population will save us from the  need  for

more financial hand-outs and more taxes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am under no illusion that financial literacy

would  eliminate  all  financial hardships.   I  believe  the

Government has a social obligation to help the less able  and

less  fortunate.  I join the calls of my colleagues  in  this

House  to  seek ways to lower the cost of basic  necessities,

like  public  transport, healthcare and  utilities.   In  the

Sengkang part of Punggol North



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



division,  where  void  deck  coffeeshops  are  replaced   by

airconditioned food courts and neighbourhood centres come  in

the  form  of an airconditioned mall, my residents  not  only

miss  the  hawker centres there with a heavy heart, but  also

with  a  very affected pocket.  The cost of living has indeed

shot up.  This problem is compounded where there are job loss

and wage cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another group that has caught my attention

lately.   This is the `asset so-so, but cash poor'  group  of

people  that  is sandwiched between the haves and  the  have-nots.   These  are  citizens  who are  faced  with  financial

difficulties, despite owning a roof.  They have paid so  much

for  their  property that little is left to see them  through

their  silver days.  In 20 to 30 years' time, some  of  these

properties  would have only 60 years or less of  lease.   The

current  legislation makes it difficult  to  borrow  on  such

property,  especially  if  it  is  HDB  property.   Can  they

downgrade?  It is easier said than done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we then look into the needs of this group of

people by revisiting the legislation, and perhaps under  very

stringent   conditions,   based  on  compassionate   grounds,

consider acting as a lender of last resort?  I know  DPM  has

just said that the Government cannot be a last resort of  any

kind.   While I concede that that is true and we have  to  be

very careful, if it is undesirable, then can we explore other

options?  For example, relook at the mortgage policy for this

group  of  people so that they may use their  last  available

assets to ease their retirement years.  The problem is  there

and  more will be affected as time passes.  We need to tackle

these issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a Government that has continuously shown

its  wits and tenacity - ensuring Singapore remains a premier

business  hub.   We  do not ask "Who moved my  cheese?",  but

proactively  look for new cheese and create new  cheese.   We

have  a  Government  with great financial  wisdom,  one  that

adopts a policy of building up and protecting our reserves so

that  we  can  seize the opportunities to become  bigger  and

stronger.  Our Government has made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



a  conscious choice to do so.  What about our people?  We now

need  to  foster this culture in our people so that they  too

can  one day lead the dance with our Government, at the world

stage,  to the same tune.  Let us provide the space  so  that

our  youths,  our people, can grow.  To quote an  old  adage,

`Give  a child a fish, you feed him for a day.  Teach a child

to  fish,  you feed him for life.'  It is therefore  my  hope

that  we  - the people, the public and the private sectors  - can  establish mutual trust and cooperation, not just to ease

the  possible pains of change, but to also embrace the  winds

of  change.  Not just as `you', not just as `I', but as `we'.

United we stand, divided we fall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly support

the motion to thank the President.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> I rise on a point of

clarification since my son's conversation has been a  subject

of  much  interest.  We ended our conversation  with  my  son

saying, "Yes, he would defend Singapore because this  is  his

home,  his  family and his friends are here."  One additional

statement  which  was a bit odd when I first  heard  him,  he

said,  "And  if Mr Nathan treats me well."  I think  what  he

actually  means is that if the Government treats him  fairly.

But  really the more important point behind all this  that  I

wanted  to  make was that it is important for each generation

to ask themselves the fundamental questions of nationhood and

transmit that to their children.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I rise to support the motion moved by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua,

Member for Marine Parade GRC, in expressing our thanks to the

President for his Address at the Opening of this Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing speeches after speeches for the last three

days on how we can tinker with our economy and how costs  can

be  reduced  in  the remaking of Singapore, let  me  try  and

attempt  to  look  at these areas from a different  angle  by

referring  to some examples and to learn from them  important

values that can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



found  in  these events.  The general tone of the President's

Address  is that we must be ready to face hard times  and  be

vigilant  in the face of tougher competition and  to  protect

our people from the unexpected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us must strive to achieve this and few could

dispute  the  underlying  tone  of  the  Government  in   its

continuing  goal of creating jobs and a safer  life  for  the

people  of  Singapore.  This is going to be a great challenge

for  the  Government and the people as the present  uncertain

economic  environment has led many industries  to  experience

varying  fortunes.  Only 1,600 new jobs were created  in  the

year 2001, compared to 108,500 in the year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been encouraging businesses to expand

beyond our shores and has seen new technology, especially  e-business   and   the  dot.com  bubble  and  trading   partner

economies,   such   as  Japan,  Korea,  Thailand,   Malaysia,

Indonesia  and  even  the  US, going  from  high  to  low  in

unpredictable  ways.   We  have seen some  spectacular  local

bankruptcies and with the likelihood of more to come.   There

have  been  major mergers and acquisitions and the demise  of

well-known companies, such as the energy company,  Enron,  in

the  United  States,  Ansett Airlines in  Australia  and  the

falling-out  of  favour of telcos and almost anything  to  do

with e-business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest rates have never been so low among major

economies.  Yet, many businesses are so uncertain  about  the

future  that they do not really want to borrow more  or  take

any  more chances.  Businesses in Singapore however are going

about  their usual way of meeting the challenges to  maximise

the   chance   of  survival  and  prosperity  in   times   of

uncertainty.    They  will  formulate  and   implement   risk

management   and  strategy  plans  that  focus  on   economic

fundamentals,  competitiveness, cash flow, profitability  and

the  factors that drive these forward.  But it is not as easy

as  it  sounds.  As it requires robust planning and execution

of integrated plans, we borrowed lessons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



learned from past events.  There are no short cuts, no  magic

wands.   It must surely require the support and will  of  the

power  and  the  resourcefulness of our  Government  to  work

together in close consultation to improve our economy so that

businesses can thrive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When developing our country's economic blueprint for

survival, I would support the Government's stand in  building

strongly  on  our cultural diversity and self-esteem  of  the

people  and  promote  an  awareness  to  organisations,  both

Government  and  private, to prepare plans for contingencies.

The Government must continue to adopt a humane management  of

its citizens and put its primary concern on the well-being of

those  people.  Their physical safety must be protected  from

the  expectable and their recovery from the unexpected should

be facilitated.  How we reinvent ourselves will determine our

destiny  as a strong and compassionate nation.  Do  it  right

and  we  will  emerge stronger.  As my hon. colleague  Assoc.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee said yesterday, we must have confidence in

overcoming our difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this point, please allow me to use

some  lessons  from  the business world  to  demonstrate  the

resourcefulness of people in adapting to changes and  without

losing  their dignity and pride in the process.  Firstly,  in

transforming Singapore from the present economy to  one  that

will  be  economically stronger, we must be  careful  in  not

destroying its identity, such as its cultural diversity.   We

can  look  at the case of a business entity, such as  Nissan,

which  was a struggling Japanese motor giant, and learn  from

its   blueprint   for  survival.   Nissan   became   a   huge

conglomerate  when  the  economic climate  was  conducive  to

Japan.  But as high costs and the inability to recognise  its

force,  faults seeped in.  It struggled to turn a profit  for

eight   years   in   the  1990s.   Its  operation   generated

notoriously low margins and it was estimated that Nissan gave

away US$1,000  for every car it sold in the United States due

to  competition from better-known brands.  At the same  time,

Japanese factories alone could produce



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



almost a million more cars a year than the company sold.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If nothing was done to turn the company around, Nissan

would  cease to exist.  Nissan had to make changes and, while

doing so, they have to protect the company's identity and the

self-esteem  of its people.  These two goals, making  changes

and  safeguarding  identity, can easily come  into  conflict.

Pursuing   them  both  entails  a  difficult  and   sometimes

precarious  balancing act.  Nissan managed them by mobilising

its  own  executives in teams and, through a  set  of  cross-functional  teams,  identified and  spearheaded  the  radical

changes  that  had  to  be  made.  These  changes  that  were

implemented went against the grain of not only Nissan's long-standing  operating  practices  but  also  of  some  of   the

behavioral norms of Japanese society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, its major shareholder, Renault, which is a major

French motor maker, remained sensitive to Nissan's culture at

all  times,  allowing  the company  room  to  develop  a  new

corporate that built on the best elements of Japan's national

culture.  Less than three years later, Nissan, at the turn of

the  century, is profitable again.  The robust turnaround  at

Nissan  shows  that  we have to respect the  dignity  of  the

people,  even  as you challenge them to overturn  deep-seated

traditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee, set up early this year to

review our country's performance, is somewhat like the cross-functional  teams set up in Nissan, and will  be  Singapore's

attempt in the right direction in reviving its economy.   And

we  were  told that no stones would be left unturned  in  the

process.  But when deciding on the course of action to  take,

the  Government must remain sensitive to the varied  cultures

of Singaporeans and their dignity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, before Singapore could recover from the

slowing-down  effects  of the Asian crisis  that  drastically

reduced  the  economic activities of regional countries,  the

United  States of America, Singapore's main business  partner

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



terms  of  trade,  suffered an overnight  economic  breakdown

after the September 11th terrorist attack.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have discovered that disaster has now

been  redefined after 11th September 2001, and Singapore  has

to  take  another look at its economic and social  continuity

plans.   The importance of a continuity plan for the  country

can be learnt from the examples of two business organisations

caught  in  circumstances  beyond  their  imagination.    The

accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche, already knew the value of

a plan when it was forced to evacuate its office at the World

Trade  Centre in 1993 after a car bomb blew up the bottom  of

the building.  It took immediate steps to move into a smaller

target  after  that.   Unfortunately, it  was  not  far  away

enough, just across the street at Two World Financial Centre.

The  plan did not specifically direct 3,500 employees to drop

their  briefcases and dash through a shower of debris,  smoke

and  dust  as two huge buildings thundered down behind  them.

But,  as  the managing partners regrouped at a safe distance,

they  knew the plan called for them to head across the Hudson

River to a branch office in New Jersey.  There, they took out

a  big,  nice red book, the firm's business continuity  plan.

With  that,  they  proceeded through an excruciating  3-stage

process of contacting all employees, reconnecting them to the

firm and its clientele, and recovering the firm's position in

the marketplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Deloitte & Touche, the securities firm, Morgan

Stanley,  was  in the WTC in 1993.  Morgan Stanley,  however,

stayed  in the building.  Some 2,700 worked between the  43rd

and  74th floor of the South Tower.  All but six survived the

attack.   The  company  survived  too.   Under  its  business

continuity  plan, it has already determined  its  fundamental

activities and how to support them.  On the Monday after  the

attack,  when  the stock markets opened, Morgan  Stanley  was

offering business as usual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to learn that the Government Ministries have a

contingency plan called



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



NESTS, short for the National Emergency System, formed  under

the  auspices of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and  that  the

Government  is  working closely with the  private  sector  to

ensure  that the nation's infrastructure will still function,

should a disaster strike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me next to turn to medical care. It is

heartening to note that in the Ministry of Health's  Addendum

to the President's Address that healthcare facilities will be

made  closer to Singaporeans with the development of two  new

regional  hospitals: Jurong General Hospital and the Northern

General Hospital.  While this move may be good for the nation

in its overall contingency plans, it is causing some concerns

to  the  private sector, as it increases greater  competition

among  healthcare providers in an already crowded market.   I

would  suggest that a deeper study on the complementary  role

of  the Government and the private sector in the provision of

quality healthcare, which is ever increasing in demand  among

Singaporeans, needs to be looked into so that duplication  of

services leading to wastages can be minimised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, does it mean that by adding more hospitals,

the  quality of healthcare will increase?  Modern  technology

may  aid  in the diagnosis of sicknesses and, in some  cases,

prolong  the  life  of patients.  But can  we  say  that  the

quality of healthcare has improved?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a reasonably-sized hospital sitting on

top  of  a hill along Upper Serangoon Road known as Youngberg

Memorial  Hospital.  It was situated opposite the  well-known

Bidadari  Cemetery next to Sennett Estate  at  Potong  Pasir.

Unfortunately, our hon. Member for Potong Pasir is  not  here

to  listen  to  this.  It was then a modern hospital  run  by

missionaries.  Some healthy adults among families staying  at

Sennett  Estate were born there.  And the doctor who  treated

the  sick was well liked by the people.  With a name such  as

Dr Coffin, many could not have forgotten him.  Compared to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



today's  hospital and medical facilities, that  hospital  was

outclassed.   But  the medical care and love  offered  by  Dr

Coffin  and other learned doctors there would not  have  been

any  less  than those shown by today's medical practitioners.

Today, the Northeast MRT line has caused that hospital to  be

pulled  down  for  redevelopment.  With many  happy  memories

built on compassion linked to good knowledge of medicine, had

that  hospital  been  given a chance to continue  in  another

location  in that constituency, with upgraded facilities  and

assistance  from the community groups, I am sure that  people

in that part of Singapore would have benefited much.  Medical

care,  in  the  eyes  of the people there,  I  am  sure,  was

excellent and reasonably priced as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our mission to provide the best medical care to

Singaporeans,  let us not forget the medical assistants,  the

support staff and nurses, who collectively, with the doctors,

make up the human touch which all too often also helps in the

healing process.  As such, their training should include,  if

not   already,  behavioral  sciences,  among  other   medical

subjects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the best laid-out plans can even

break  down  in  times of tragic circumstances  when  we  are

suddenly  faced  with a drastic challenge.  Such  events  can

cause  unspeakable  pain  not only for  the  people  directly

involved but also for those who see misfortune befall others,

even  total  strangers.  That pain spills into the  workplace

and  the  country.   Indeed,  the  Government's  ability   in

reaching  out  compassionately to those affected economically

by the current downturn directly affects the nation's ability

to  maintain high performance in difficult times.  It fosters

a nation's capacity to heal, to learn, to adapt and to excel.

Those  in  leadership  positions cannot eliminate  suffering.

Nor  can you ask people to check their emotions at the  door.

But  the  Government  can  use its leadership  to  begin  the

healing  process  and,  through our action,  we  can  empower

people  to find their own ways to support one another  during

uncertain times.  This is the kind of leadership we  wish  we

would never have to use.  Yet, it is vital, if we are

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  in  support of the Motion  of  Thanks  to  the

President.  Thank you also for allowing me to participate  in

this  debate, albeit the arduous task being one of  the  last

few speakers.  I do not envy those who are speaking after me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From brisk walking to running, from rowing boats down

the river to exploring the larger seas, the eloquent speakers

before   me  have  articulated  not  just  challenges  facing

Singapore   but  recommended  solutions  to  overcome   these

challenges.   I  hope  the House is not speech-fatigued  just

yet.  I shall try to entice your attention buds with keywords

like "explosion", "tension" and even "honeymoon".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about remaking Singapore and the

new  vision of what Singapore can be.  One key theme that has

received  much  attention is about rooting Singaporeans  here

and  calling Singapore our home.  I would like to speak about

the nurturing of the Singapore Home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current economic crisis is a rude shock to many

Singaporeans.  As the labour MPs in the House have repeatedly

said,  no one is spared.  From the uneducated cleaner to  the

factory  operator,  from  the  clerical  officer  to  the  HR

manager,  many  have been victims.  Many also  probably  feel

abused   psychologically,   emotionally   and,   of   course,

financially.  Abused by whom?  By the uncompromising, emotion-free global economic market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current situation we are facing can be akin to

domestic  violence.   Like the victims of domestic  violence,

the  victims  of  the  current  abusive  economic  conditions

manifest  emotional reactions of fear, anxiety, helplessness,

hopelessness, denial, anger, the list goes on.  Sir, domestic

violence is a vicious cycle.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been involved with domestic violence for

some  time  now,  but  let  me  assure  the  House  that   my

involvement is as a counsellor, not as an abuser.  I  do  not

think  I look like an abuser.  Tensions will build up  before

an   abusive  incident  takes  place.   After  the  incident,

commonly  known as an explosion, the storm will  subside  and

the  honeymoon period will emerge again.  But the  nature  of

violence is that it will happen again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In domestic violence work, we help to empower the

victims to protect themselves and to raise their self-esteem.

The  reality is that many of them will endure many  years  of

abuse   before   they  decide  to  say  no  and   leave   the

relationships.  As social workers, we continue to  work  with

them  to minimise the impact of the potential abuse.  We also

work  with  the  perpetrators in  overcoming  their  problems

psychologically  and  behaviorally.  Unmet  expectations  are

common  precursors to tension build-up and further  violence.

We help the couple to negotiate each other's expectations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unlike domestic violence where we can work with the

victims  and  where  the  victim  may  decide  to  leave  the

relationship   should  the  violence  continue,  Singaporeans

cannot  leave  the  relationship  with  the  global  economic

market.  Worse still, we cannot counsel the perpetrators.  We

are  at  their mercy.  What we can do then is to continue  to

work with the victims and the potential victims.  We need  to

empower them to be prepared for the next explosion, such that

the  impact  is  minimised.  Sir, in  incidents  of  domestic

violence, we always have the police to protect and doctors to

cure.   At  least we hope that they are there all  the  time.

But, often times, these are remedial actions.  As much as the

perpetrators  are  responsible for the actions,  the  victims

have also to protect themselves and minimise the impact.

Sir,  Singaporeans must realise by now that we are not immune

to  the  potentially abusive global economic  realities.   We

cannot  leave the relationship.  In the Singapore Home,  this

marriage is for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



life.   Divorce  is  not an option.   We  need  to  make  the

relationship  work.  We can empower ourselves,  lengthen  the

honeymoon  period, recognise tensions building  up,  minimise

the  impact should the explosion or abuse happen again.  Like

victims  of  domestic  violence, we must  come  out  of  each

abusive incident stronger and more strong-willed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sooner Singaporeans accept the reality and work

towards  protecting  themselves,  the  sooner  they  will  be

prepared for the next onslaught of abuse.  Singaporeans  need

to  increase their resilience, be nimble and make adjustments

quickly  but, above all, increase their repertoire of  coping

skills.   They  also need to know their partners  and  adjust

accordingly  to  meet  the latter's  expectations.   While  a

marriage  requires  both  parties  to  make  adjustments  and

negotiate expectations, the marriage between Singaporeans and

the global economic market, unfortunately, seems unfairly one-sided.   We  have  to  make  the  adjustments  to  meet   the

expectations of the new global economy.  We need to find  the

fit  or  else we will feel victimised again.  The  sooner  we

know what our partner expects, and the sooner we fulfill  his

expectation, the longer will be the honeymoon period.  As  we

know, honeymoon periods are the best times in any marriage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government must continue to provide the

infrastructure  for Singaporeans to improve their  repertoire

of  skills  to  fit  into  the new  global  realities.   This

infrastructure, however, should not only focus  on  providing

an  array of training programmes, but to include the  complex

realities that individuals and families face as they  embrace

the  value  of  life-long  learning  amidst  functioning  and

managing a household in a fast-paced society like Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this reality has serious implication on the Malay

community,  as  they are hardest hit in this recent  economic

crisis.  The community must focus and concentrate its efforts

at  reducing future psychological and emotional abuse brought

about by the merciless economic realities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



Unless  the  members  of  the community  are  able  to  equip

themselves  with the required skills and the technical  know-how  of the new economy, they will feel abused again when the

cycle  returns.   This  requires the  coordinated  effort  of

everyone  in  the community.  We need to focus our  resources

and  energies  in  such efforts which  are  critical  to  the

survival  of the community, as well as the Singapore  society

in general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me return to the Singapore Home. The constituents

of  the  Singapore Home are the different ethnic communities.

Family  systems theory noted that the whole is  greater  than

the sum of its parts.  The strength of the Singapore Home  is

not merely the existence of the different ethnic communities,

but  rather  the  dynamic interaction  between  them.   These

interactions are key ingredients to the development of social

support networks and systems in the Singapore Home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, social support systems are critical in the home as

they often buffer the impact of domestic violence.  While the

global  economic market may be a potentially abusive partner,

the  abuse may not come from the economic sphere alone.   The

threat  of  global terrorism calls for Singaporeans  to  look

within ourselves and assess the support system that we  have.

The  analogy  of domestic violence that I have  used  is  not

unintentional.  Indeed, the threat of terrorism is no more  a

foreign  and external issue.  It has become a domestic  issue

on the threats of violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to September 11 and the JI arrests, we seem

to take our social support network for granted.  Not only are

social support systems critical during times of crisis,  they

are  indeed  our  first line of defence.  Our social  support

network is not a static phenomenon.  It is dynamic and fluid.

It requires constant effort at building and sustaining.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1994, I conducted a study on social support

network of low income families.  One aspect of the study  was

to  assess  the role of social support network as buffers  to

economic  hardship.  What surprises me is that  families  are

less likely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



to  have individuals from different ethnic groups as part  of

their  social  network, even when they are neighbours.   This

spurred  me  to  include cross-cultural understanding  in  my

classes  at NUS.  In the class, one of the exercises  that  I

usually  task my students to do is to interview five  persons

who  are different from them ethnically, to understand  their

values  and  belief  systems.   Many  of  the  students  have

difficulty  doing so, even when the exercise  did  not  limit

them  to  talking  to strangers only, ie, they  can  actually

interview  friends  that  they had  known  even  before  they

entered  university.   Many have difficulty  completing  that

exercise.   Each  time I give them a quiz on what  they  know

about  each  other's  community, they fail  miserably.   When

September 11 took place, one senior Chinese grassroots leader

came up to me and asked why do Muslim women need to wear  the

tudung.  I am sure many of us have many questions about  each

other's values and practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do these findings and anecdotes indicate? I am not

too  sure.  Our integration policies are in place.   Yet,  we

are  still  seeing such outcomes.  Perhaps the outcome  could

have  been worse if the policies had not been in place.  Sir,

it  is not surprising that people gravitate to their own kind

and  remain in their comfort zones.  I am not advocating  for

more Government intervention, but for Singaporeans to realise

that they need to be committed to the process of inter-ethnic

integration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the threat of terrorism came knocking on our doors

recently,  the issue of inter-ethnic relation was  pushed  to

the  forefront.  It is a timely reminder that  we  cannot  be

complacent.    We  need  to  recognise  that   building   and

sustaining  relationships  and networks  require  effort  and

commitment.  It is not enough for us to merely smile  at  our

neighbours  or  get  our children to dress  in  each  other's

ethnic  costumes during Racial Harmony Day.  These  are  good

starting  points but we cannot remain at the starting  block.

Each community must make the effort to reach out to the other

communities.  The best way is, of course, to open the common



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



spaces.  Yes, we do recognise and respect the private spaces.

But  to  build  relationships, we need to  step  out  of  our

private spaces and enter the public spaces more readily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of cross-cultural understanding and

interaction  requires  a  high level  of  self-awareness  and

openness.  While we are presently "gung-ho" about wanting  to

improve interaction and getting to know each other better, we

must  be  mindful  of the potential threat of  ethnocentrism.

Each community must respect the values and cultures of others

and  avoid  the perception that one's values are better  than

the  others'.  This is ethnocentrism.  The issue of  religion

and   value  systems  is  so  intrinsically  rooted  in  each

individual  and community that it is often all too  sensitive

to  discuss  it  in  the  open.  Self-awareness  is  crucial.

Mutual  respect is imminent.  The work of the IRCC must  take

into account these key factors for it to succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we continue to nurture the Singapore

Home  with  strong  inter-ethnic bonds,  another  significant

pillar of the home that needs attention is the family.  There

has  been  talk  that  many Singaporean families  are  highly

stressed.  Indicators that our families are stressed  include

incidences  of  juvenile  delinquency,  marital  dissolution,

domestic violence, drug abuse, etc, in these families.  While

statistics show that these problems are either on  a  decline

or  are  stabilised,  we cannot pretend  that  they  are  not

important.   Often  times, these problems do  not  happen  in

isolation - they actually co-exist and we typically have what

social workers call multi-problem families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The systemic effects of any of these problems are

tremendous.  A family who has a juvenile delinquent not  only

deals with the behavioral problems presented by the teenager,

but  also  the effects on the other family members.   Marital

relationships  are often strained with couples placing  blame

on one another.  The compensatory efforts at dealing with the

delinquent child often result in unintentional neglect of the

other children. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



potential  effects  go on.  The juvenile delinquent,  if  not

well rehabilitated, may graduate to be adult offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, families need to be strengthened to prevent the

onset of such incidences. The family today is different  from

the  family of yesterday.  Yes, in its form and function, one

may argue that there is no difference.  However, the dynamics

of role performances must change to keep up with the changing

environments. I read with great interest the issues raised in

the   last   Parliament  as  it  debated  on  family-friendly

practices.   I should not belabour the point nor  repeat  the

points  raised.  However, I would like to reiterate the  need

for  us  to  recognise some of the changes that families  are

subjected  to,  and  respond with a  clear  message  that  we

support   these   changes  through  relevant   policies   and

legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to strengthen our families, we need to ensure that

emotional  bonds between each family member are strong,  such

that  support  would  be  available  when  called  upon.  The

emotional bond between mother and child is a given and, often

times, assumed to be a natural order of things.  However, the

emotional  bonds between fathers and children are  considered

rather  alien,  especially in the context of Asian  cultures.

Fathers  are seen more as disciplinarians in families.   They

are  not supposed to be emotional.  Our boys are still raised

not  to  show their emotions.  Sociological and psychological

research  has  begun to show the importance  of  father-child

bonds in the development of children and families.  Bonds  do

not  appear  overnight.   They  need  to  be  cultivated  and

nurtured.  In my work with fathers, I have heard many  lament

that  they  do  not  know how to relate to  their  adolescent

children, as much as they realise the importance of doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, bonds of fathering must be developed when children

are  young and most dependent.  I am pleased to note that the

Government has made provisions for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



paternity  leave for fathers to be involved in the  lives  of

their new born.  The current three days of paternity leave is

a  good  start,  though I would encourage the  Government  to

consider  extending it.  And I think we have  the  next  five

years  to  discuss  that.  An infant child  is  at  his  most

dependent  state, and this is the most excellent time  for  a

father to establish the bond with the child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another opportunity for bonding is when the child is

ill.   Today, we have child sick leave only for female  civil

servants.   Sir, this seems to send the message that  when  a

child is sick, it is the responsibility of the mother to care

for  the child.  I would recommend that the child sick  leave

benefit  be  extended  to  male  civil  servants  to  send  a

consistent  and  clear  message  that  fathers  are   equally

responsible and capable of looking after a sick child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other opportunities like facilitating father's

presence in parent-teacher meetings in schools.  I have often

given  parenting talks in schools, and one clear  observation

which  is supported by many school principals, is that, often

times,  only mothers attend these talks and meetings.   Where

are  the  fathers?   Working? Many mothers who  attend  these

meetings  are working mothers too.  Children often  read  the

absence  of  fathers as their disinterest in their  education

and  the  lives  of their children.  These are  opportunities

lost for fathers.  The result is a distancing of the children

from their fathers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a society, we need to send a clear message that

fathers  must be involved in the total development  of  their

children, as do mothers.  In this regard, may I be so trivial

to  suggest that the Ministry of the Environment ensure  that

every  public  men's  room be equipped with  diaper  changing

facilities.   Once,  I had a hard time  finding  a  place  to

change  my son's diaper after I took him for swimming,  as  I

could not find a place in the men's room to do so.  But, rest

assured, I did not go to the ladies' room.  There are ways of

doing  it  though.  We need to normalise such behaviours  and

encourage fathers to feel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



comfortable about doing such fathering practices in public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, gone are the days where fathers can be contented

with  merely bringing home the bacon, or the halal  meat,  or

the vegetables.  He is expected to share in the parenting and

household  responsibilities, just as his wife is  sharing  in

his  traditional role of income provider.  The  family  bonds

can  be  strengthened with mutually supporting  partners  who

share  the  same  vision  and  responsibilities.   Sir,   the

measures above may seem small and insignificant in themselves

but,   put  together,  I  am  confident,  as  shown  by  many

researchers,  that they would go a long way in ensuring  that

children are raised as successful and confident adults  in  a

safe, secure and supportive environment, with the presence of

both fathers and mothers.  Sir, as the saying goes, a journey

of a thousand miles begins with one single footstep.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sharing of parenting roles and responsibilities

in  families is even more critical as we study the impact  of

restructuring the economy on Singaporean families.  As  women

are  a force to be reckoned with in the economic sphere, they

too   need   to  constantly  upgrade  themselves  to   remain

employable   and   relevant.   Such   demands   have   direct

implications  on  how  families  negotiate  their  times   in

relation  to parenting responsibilities and individual  needs

for  training  and upgrading.  It is thus most  critical  now

that  we  begin  to  sow  the  seeds  of  positive  fathering

practices  as  we prepare Singaporeans moving  into  the  new

economic structures.  As we remake Singapore, we need to also

remake  our  perception of the family - a key pillar  of  the

Singapore Home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I talk about the new age father, the way the

Singapore  Government  has  been  described  comes  to  mind.

Paternalistic,  patronizing, patriarchal are adjectives  that

have been used to describe the Government.  Yes, the children

of  Singapore have been raised well with a father figure  who

knows what is best for them.  I have a similar father too   - dogmatic, disciplinarian and no buts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the children of tomorrow are different. The

fathering practices that my father used on me no longer  work

with  my  children.  I have to be present in their lives.   I

have to listen to them  -  listen not just with my ears,  but

with   my   eyes  and,  more  importantly,  with  my   heart.

Recognising  this,  I try to reach out  to  my  father.   The

initial  hesitancy is slowly changing.  He is  more  able  to

express his emotions.  He can change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been calls to remake the Government. I think

the   Government  should  continue  being   the   father   of

Singaporeans.  But the new age father also nurtures his child

and  provides the emotional support when needed.  He is  more

than a disciplinarian, more than the decision maker.  He is a

friend  who  has  built strong bonds when  the  child  is  an

infant.   It is timely for the Government to invest in  these

bonds  today.  The children are reaching out to  the  father.

Like my father, I am confident that the Government is capable

of  responding to this call.  Take time to listen, take  time

to nurture, take time to provide the emotional support.  I am

confident  it will go a long way in building up  a  Singapore

Home that is united, strong, resilient and supportive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am as old as independent Singapore is. I have

seen how my parents built a strong home for my eight siblings

and I  -  from the kampong house at Coronation Road to the 1-room  rental flat in Toa Payoh and, subsequently, to a 3-room

purchase flat in Toa Payoh where they still live today.  Like

many  other  first  generation  Singaporeans,  they  overcame

insurmountable challenges.  It is a process that is on-going.

Today, like many other young couples, my wife and I strive to

build  a  strong  home for our children.  I  have  spoken  of

nurturing the Singapore Home  - preparing ourselves  for  the

expectation of Singapore's marriage partner, ie,  the  global

economic market, strengthening the bonds between communities,

strengthening families through enhancing the role of fathers,

and developing new age fathering practices in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



the relationship between the Government and the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is my vision as a Singaporean, as a young

father  of another generation of Singaporeans.  For Singapore

to  survive,  we  need to accept and move  towards  a  common

destiny.  Singaporeans must share the same vision.  My vision

for  the  remade  Singapore is one in which  the  people  are

economically successful, yet rooted and bonded to the family,

individually  confident, yet socially  networked,  global  in

outlook,  yet Singaporean in identity.  These are ingredients

that will continue to nurture the Singapore H ome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
