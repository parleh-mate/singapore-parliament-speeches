Culture how many (i) television licences; and (ii)

radio  licences were issued during the year ending

28th February, 1973.



<br><br><!-- Encik Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Encik Sha'ari Bin Tadin) (for the Minister for Culture):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number

of  television  licences issued  during  the  year

ended 28th February, 1973, totalled 210,000.  This

number includes an estimated figure for the  month

of  February, 1973. Of this number, 28,800 are new

licences  issued during this period,  and  181,200

are renewals of old licences.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A television licence will enable the licensee,

members   of  his  family  and  domestic  servants

residing at the same address, to use any number of

TV   and   radio  receivers,  including   portable

transistor  sets. It is not possible  to  indicate

how  many of these 210,000 TV licensees own  radio

sets as well. However, from the experience of  the

Inland Revenue Department, it is known that almost

every household which owns a TV set would have  in

addition one or two more radio sets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of radio licences issued during the

year   ended   28th   February,   1973,   totalled

approximately  70,000.  This  number  includes  an

estimated  figure for the month of February  1973.

Of   this  number,  about  35,000  are  car  radio

licences  and 35,000 are household radio licences.

Of  the 35,000 car radio licences, 10,000 are  new

car  radio licences and 25,000 are renewals of old

car radio



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



licences.  Of the 35,000 household radio licences,

4,800  are  new  radio  licences  and  30,200  are

renewals of old radio licences. A household  radio

licence will enable the licensee, members  of  his

family and domestic servants residing at the  same

address,  to  use  any number of radio  receivers,

including  portable transistor  sets.  A  separate

licence is required for every radio and television

receiver   installed  in  a  vehicle,  vessel   or

aircraft registered in Singapore. A radio  licence

is  $12 per annum whereas a television licence  is

$36 per annum. A radio licence may be converted to

a  television licence on payment of an  additional

$24.

Speaker, Sir, taking first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



the  monetary  aspect of inflation,  Members  will

recall  that in my Budget statement I singled  out

inflation   as  a  problem  deserving   particular

attention.  I  have outlined in  some  detail  the

monetary measures which have been taken to  absorb

the  excess  liquidity  in the  economy  to  check

inflationary  pressures. The  most  recent  policy

action  was  the  increase of the minimum  reserve

requirement which banks and finance companies have

to   maintain  with  the  Monetary  Authority   of

Singapore against their deposit liabilities from 5

per  cent  to  9 per cent. Similarly, the  special

deposit  which banks have to keep with MAS against

their  net  foreign liabilities has been increased

from 5 per cent to 9 per cent. These measures came

into  effect on 16th March, 1973. The  effects  of

these  measures on credit creation and  the  money

supply will be felt in the coming months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic monetary situation will be closely

watched   particularly  in  the   light   of   new

developments   in   the   international   currency

markets.  We can draw on a number of other  policy

instruments  to  meet any new situation  that  may

arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as to local price increases of

essential commodities, I have already outlined  in

the  debate  on the Ministry of Finance  Estimates

the  steps we can take and have taken to  moderate

such  prices.  What we cannot  do  is  to  prevent

failure  of  crops in large areas  of  the  world,

causing  a  world shortage of rice, wheat,  sugar,

and  other  essential commodities, which  cause  a

rise  in the prices of these commodities.  Let  us

hope  there  is a fair harvest this year  so  that

grain  prices will go back to normal. However,  we

cannot  avoid  a rise in the cost  of  imports  of

manufactured  goods, resulting from the  increased

wages  and inflation of some industrial countries.

Of  course, some of these countries may have, from

time  to time, to devalue their currencies but  it

never brings prices back to what they used to be.

<div align="center"><b>REVISION OF SALARIES FOR THE PRESIDENT AND CABINET MINISTERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>





<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it is 18 years, since 1955, when the  salary

for  the  post of Chief Minister, and subsequently

Prime  Minister, was fixed at $3,500. The position

for Ministers became intolerable by 1970, when  an

adjustment had to be made. It is time to do a more

complete revision of these salaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discussed this matter with my colleagues

in Cabinet and decided as follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) All Cabinet Ministers will be paid the salary

of $7,000, i.e. $500 more than Superscale Grade  A ($6,500).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Dr Goh Keng Swee, who acts for me from time

to  time,  will  fill  the post  of  Deputy  Prime

Minister. It will carry a salary of $8,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Dr Toh Chin Chye will have a Charge Allowance

of  $700  for  discharging  the  duties  of  Vice-Chancellor of the University of Singapore, as well as being Minister for Science and Technology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Senior Minister of State will be equivalent

to  Superscale Grade C ($4,500), Minister of State

equivalent to Superscale Grade D ($3,500),  Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary equivalent to  Superscale

Grade    F   ($2,750),   Parliamentary   Secretary

equivalent  to  Super-scale Grade G ($2,500),  and

Political Secretary, $1,750.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) My own salary as Prime Minister will be $9,500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The President's emoluments will be raised

from  $4,000, which is tax-free, to $12,000,  with $4,000   tax-free.  However,  the  President   has requested me to inform the House that he does  not

wish to make use of this increase in his salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of civil servants, these salaries

will be effective from 1st March



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



this   year,   and  they  will  be   revised   and

consolidated every four to five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making these adjustments in salaries, two

considerations have been uppermost in  our  minds.

First,  the  need for some rough correlation  with

the  Civil Service pay scales. Second, they should

be  sufficiently realistic, so that in  the  years

ahead,  it  will not be so much of a sacrifice  to

give  up  a job in the private sector in order  to

take on the responsibilities of public office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is seldom possible to pay a man in his

Ministerial position as much as what he would get,

either in running a business or practising his own

profession. Some sacrifice is inevitable. But  too

great a disparity between Ministerial rewards  and

what  Ministers,  with  business  experience   and

professional  qualifications, could  earn  outside

will make it increasingly difficult to assemble  a

successor government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No salary, however generous, can ensure the

complete   honesty   and  integrity   with   which

Ministers  must  discharge  their  duties.  Honest

mistakes  or  errors  of  judgment  by  Ministers,

however  costly, are not as damaging to a  country

as  the  suspicion of bias because of  corruption.

Once  a  government  is  tainted  with  this,  the

contamination      spreads     throughout      the

administration. Then we shall go down the slippery

slope, at the bottom of which are carcasses of  so

many corrupt governments whose peoples have had to

suffer  for the dishonesty and greed of  those  in

authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be possible to gather another team as

the  one  thrown up by the challenge of tumultuous

events  and  cataclysmic  changes,  from  Japanese

occupation  to  guerilla  insurgency,   to   self-government,  to merger, to separate  independence.

But  it  is possible to set standards of integrity

and  competence and to establish them  as  minimum

norms for people holding public office.

<div align="center"><b>RADIATION PROTECTION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker) (for the Minister for Science and Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionizing radiation from radioactive materials and

irradiating  apparatus are potentially  dangerous,

and  excessive  exposure  to  such  radiation  can

seriously impair human and animal health.  It  was

for  this reason that the Minister for Science and

Technology appointed an Ad Hoc Committee  in  May,

1969, to advise on matters relating to the use  of

radioisotopes and irradiating apparatus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through specific licensing on imports introduced

by  the  Ad  Hoc Committee in 1970 and  through  a

survey   conducted   by  the  Ministry,   it   was

ascertained that currently there are at least  170

irradiating apparatus and at least 4,500 curies of

radioisotopes  in use in Singapore.  Further,  the

rate   of   importation   of   radioisotopes   and

irradiating apparatus is estimated at  an  average

of  18  imports  per month for the  year  1971  as

compared  to  15 imports per month  for  the  year

1970.  Most of the irradiating apparatus are X-ray

machines while in the case of radioactive material

they  are  mainly in the form of  Cobalt  60  (for

healing  purposes),  Iridium 192  (for  industrial

radiography) and a scatter of Tritium and  Caesium

and others (for use in non-destructive testing  or

as  radioactive  tracers). The number  of  persons

trained   to   handle  radioactive  material   and

irradiating apparatus is also on the increase  and

at the last count, they numbered about 150.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irradiating apparatus and radioisotopes are

mainly   used  by  three  major  sectors,  namely,

industries, Government and institutions of  higher

learning.  In the industrial sector, the  uses  of

irradiating apparatus and radioisotopes are mainly

confined    to    non-destructive   testing    and

radioactive tracer technology



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



with    the    shipbuilding   and   ship-repairing

industries as a dominant user (testing  of  weld).

In the Government sector, these are mainly used in

hospitals  for  diagnostic  and  healing  purposes

while in the institutions of higher learning, they

are used for research purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With growing sophistication and expansion in our

industries and medical services, it is anticipated

that  the  variety  and  quantity  of  imports  of

radioisotopes  and  irradiating  apparatus   would

register  very significant increases in the  years

to  come  to  be  accompanied by  a  corresponding

increase  in  the  number of  persons  trained  to

handle such material and apparatus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the main, the Bill seeks to make provision for

the   regulation   and  control  of   importation,

manufacture,   sale,   disposal,   transportation,

possession  and use of radioactive  materials  and

irradiating  apparatus such that these  activities

may  not be permitted except with a licence to  be

issued by the Director of Radiation Protection who

shall be appointed by the Minister for Science and

Technology for the administration of the  proposed

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically, the Bill provides for the

licensing  of  pharmacists, medical  practitioners

and veterinary surgeons to authorise these persons

to  sell and to use radioactive materials for  the

treatment  of human beings and animals.  The  Bill

further   requires  workers  handling  radioactive

material and irradiating apparatus to be protected

from the hazards of over-exposure through constant

monitoring  of their exposure levels  and  regular

medical examination. There are also provisions  in

the   Bill  whereby  persons  aggrieved   by   the

enforcement of the proposed legislation  may  have

an avenue of appeal to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill empowers the Minister to make

subsidiary   legislation  for  a  more   effective

enforcement  of  the proposed legislation  and  to

establish a Radiation Advisory Committee to advise

on  matters  pertaining to the provisions  of  the

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large numbers of high-rise flats and other

buildings  have been constructed in  Singapore  in

recent  years, and many of them are  not  properly

managed and maintained. In many cases, the owners,

management corporations or persons responsible for

their  maintenance and management  have  not  been

discharging  their  functions  properly  and  have

allowed  the  buildings to  fall  into  disrepair.

Steps  have  to  be  taken  to  ensure  that  this

unsatisfactory  position is  rectified  before  it

further  deteriorates. With the  encouragement  of

condominium  development, the need to ensure  that

the  buildings  and the amenities  and  facilities

shared   in   common  are  properly  managed   and

maintained has now become even more urgent. It  is

therefore  proposed to set up a  public  authority

with appropriate powers to deal with this problem.

It is to this end that this Bill is now before the

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, provision is made for the

appointment of a Commissioner of Buildings who  is

empowered  under clause 4 to direct the owners  of

buildings  and  common properties, which  are  not

kept  or  maintained  in  a  state  of  good   and

serviceable  repair  or  in  a  proper  and  clean

condition,  to carry out the necessary maintenance

and repairs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



Failure  to  comply  with the  directions  of  the

Commissioner  will be an offence under  the  Bill,

for  which the penalty shall be a maximum fine  of

$5,000 with a continuing fine of up to $25 a  day.

If  his  directions  are not  complied  with,  the

Commissioner  may also carry out  the  maintenance

and repairs to the buildings and common properties

or  authorise  any other person to carry  out  the

necessary work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 5, the Commissioner may require

deposits to be made within seven days by owners of

buildings and common properties who fail to comply

with his directions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 provides for the recovery of costs and

expenses  incurred  by the Commissioner  from  the

owners  of buildings and common property, as  well

as  for  the apportionment by the Commissioner  of

such  costs and expenses amongst owners, if  there

is   more  than  one,  in  such  manner   as   the

Commissioner thinks fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 empowers the Minister to make rules to

provide, amongst other things, for the prescribing

of  proper standards of management and maintenance

in  respect of buildings and common property,  and

for the payment of deposits by any person erecting

or  constructing a building to ensure  its  proper

management  or maintenance and for the  forfeiture

of such deposits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, it seems fair enough for a  Bill  of

this  nature  to  be  introduced.  But  there  are

certain defects in the Bill. I do not know whether

the  definition of "owner" of property would  also

include  the  Government. The  Government  owns  a

great number of buildings and properties, and I do

not  really know whether the intention of the Bill

is  to include the Government in the definition of

"owner".  If  the  Bill is  meant  for  owners  of

properties in the private sector, then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



if any such owner infringes the provisions of this

Bill,  he may be sued by Government in court.  But

if   the  Government  itself  is  guilty  of  such

offences,  who  will  serve  the  summons  on  the

Government  to appear in court? I am  therefore  a

bit  puzzled  as  to  whether  the  definition  of

"owner"  in this Bill includes the Government.  If

it  does not include the Government, then I  think

it is necessary to look further into the matter to

see  whether  there  is any need  to  include  the

Government in the definition. Otherwise the people

will  say  that the Government is allowed  to  get

away  with  all  sorts  of infringements  but  the

common people are not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, this Bill is all-embracing. There

is  nothing specific to put the Government or  any

statutory  board  outside the  provisions  of  the

Bill.  Perhaps to keep the Member for  Bras  Basah

happy, I will enlighten him. He has asked to  whom

should  any notice be served? Well, in  this  case

the  Commissioner will have the duty, pleasant  or

unpleasant,  of  serving  notice  either  on   the

Government or on the head of any statutory  board,

whether  it is the Housing and Development  Board,

the  Public Utilities Board, the Port of Singapore

Authority, or even the Singapore Tourist Promotion

Board, if it owns and lets out property.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the

Minister.  But I still think that we should  write

it into the Bill. Otherwise it is very vague. I do

not  think the Commissioner of Buildings is likely

to  take  such steps, and this is exactly  what  I

fear will arise later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, it is very difficult to satisfy

the Member. There is no need to specifically write

it  into  the  13i11. If we wanted to direct  this

Bill  at  the private sector only, we  would  have

said  so and would have specifically exempted  the

Government  or  any  statutory  board   from   the

provisions  of this Bill. We have not  done  this,

which means, as I said earlier, this Bill is  all-embracing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Road Vehicles

(Special  Powers) Act (Chapter 120 of the  Revised

Edition)  to enable the Court to order  forfeiture

of  vehicles  used in the commission  of  offences

such as assisting in carrying on a public lottery,

and  writing, printing or publishing  any  lottery

ticket.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the passing of the Common Gaming Houses

(Amendment)  Act,  1971 (No. 25  of  1971),  these

offences were embodied in paragraphs (c)  and  (f)

of  subsection  (1) of section  4  of  the  Common

Gaming  Houses  Act  (Chapter 96  of  the  Revised

Edition).  By  the  passing of the  Common  Gaming

are now embodied in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b)  of

section 4A and in paragraph (c) of subsection  (1)

of section 4 of that Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule to the Road Vehicles (Special

sets out the offences where the Court has power to

order   forfeiture  of  vehicles  used  in   their

commission. This Bill seeks to make the  necessary

consequential  amendments  to  that  Schedule   by

substituting   the  references  to  the   repealed

provisions  of the Common Gaming Houses  Act  with

references to the existing provisions of that Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the recent reorganisation of the

junior ranks of the Police Force giving effect  to

the  recommendations of the Lee  Soo  Ann  Report,

police  officers of the rank of Sergeant  and  the

newly  created rank of Station Inspector will  now

take  over  some  of  the investigatory  functions

formerly  performed by Inspectors. To enable  them

to  discharge  their new responsibilities,  it  is

necessary  to  confer  on  Sergeants  and  Station

Inspectors,  Police  powers  hitherto  exercisable

only  by  officers  of the rank of  Inspector  and

above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the various Statutes of

our Republic to achieve this objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the reorganised set-up, recruitment to the

junior  ranks of the Police Force is from  persons

holding at the minimum, the School Certificate  or

its   equivalent.  The  Police  Academy  is   also

conducting various courses to improve the  skills,

upgrade  the professional expertise, and generally

raise  the  standards  of Police  Officers.  As  a

result,  the junior ranks of the Force  are  being

staffed by better calibre officers, and those  who

have been promoted to the

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Entertainments Duty

Act  (Chapter 136 of the Revised Edition) in order

to  enable  more  effective  action  to  be  taken

against touts of cinema tickets. Touting in black-market  cinema  tickets has  increased  in  recent

years   despite  regular  raids  mounted  by   law

enforcement officers. In July last year, a special

anti-tout   squad  was  formed  by   the   Customs

Department, and since the inception of this squad,

sustained  raids have been made resulting  in  the

arrest  of  106  touts and 68 cinema  patrons  for

reselling   tickets  and  purchasing  black-market

tickets respectively. Despite the sustained raids,

the  black-market and touting unfortunately  still

exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major problem for the authorities is the

large  number of enforcement officers required  to

prevent  touting in black-market tickets, whenever

popular films are shown. The purpose of this  Bill

is  therefore to make better use of such  officers

as  we have to fight such cinema touts. Clauses  2

and  3  of  the Bill seek to empower  any  customs

officers  or  police constable to  arrest  without

warrant any person whom he reasonably suspects  of

committing or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



attempting  to  commit  any  offence   under   the

Entertainments Duty Act, including black-marketing

in  cinema tickets. The customs officer or  police

constable  is  also empowered to seize  from  such

persons any document or any other thing in respect

of which an offence is reasonably believed to have

been committed. Presently, these powers are vested

only  in  senior officers of the rank of Assistant

Superintendent of Customs and above in the case of

the  Customs Department, and officers of the  rank

of  Inspector and above in the case of the  Police

Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 seeks to dispense with the provision in

the   Act   which  requires  sanction   from   the

Comptroller of Entertainments Duty before a  Court

can take cognizance of any offence committed under

the  Act.  This  should speed up  the  process  of

bringing the black-market touts before the  Court,

and   demonstrate  clearly  that  punishment  will

swiftly follow the crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last amendment contained in clause 5 seeks to

correct  an  existing  anomaly.  The  penalty  for

offences  committed under the Entertainments  Duty

Act is prescribed in the Act, but the offences are

set  out  in  the Entertainments Duty  Rules  made

under the principal Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four amendments proposed in this Bill will

facilitate  enforcement of the  law,  particularly

against organised gangsters and racketeers touting

cinema tickets. I should emphasise, however,  that

legislation   alone  cannot  wholly  control   and

eradicate    black-marketing.    Greater     civic

consciousness by the public is also required.  The

black-market  in  tickets cannot possibly  survive

without  patronage  by  the  cinema-going  public.

While  our  enforcement officers in taking  action

against  black-marketeers will try to ensure  that

law-abiding    cinema-goers   are    not    unduly

inconvenienced, they will expect the public to co-operate  with  them  in  stamping  out  the   very pernicious practice of black-marketing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of experience gained from the

operation  of the Insurance Act, which  came  into

force on 1st January, 1967, certain amendments  to

the Act seem necessary and desirable for: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) additional provisions to ensure that

insurance   companies   conduct   their   business

strictly   in  accordance  with  sound   insurance

principles;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) powers to the Insurance Commissioner to deal

expeditiously with insurance companies that become

insolvent or are likely to become insolvent; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) more effective control and supervision of

insurers and Lloyd's agents and brokers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objectives of the Bill are those

contained in clauses 6 and 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 empowers the Commissioner to cancel the

registration   of   an   insurer   under   certain

circumstances  which include the  failure  of  the

insurer   to   effect   satisfactory   reinsurance

arrangements,     non-compliance     with      the

Commissioner's  order to make good any  deficiency

in  its insurance fund, and failure to maintain  a

surplus  of assets over liabilities of $1  million

in  respect of life business or general  business,

or  $1 1/2 million in respect of both classes.  The

present  Act gives the Commissioner the  authority

to  register an insurance company, but it does not

empower him to cancel the registration other  than

on  the ground that the insurer itself, on account

that  it  has ceased to carry on business, applies

for cancellation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 empowers the Commissioner to issue such

directions as he considers necessary to an insurer

if he is satisfied that the affairs of the insurer

are  being  conducted  in a manner  likely  to  be

detrimental   to  the  public  interest   or   the

interests  of the policy owners or prejudicial  to

the interests of the insurer. Among the directions

which  the Commissioner may give include immediate

suspension of business, taking all steps to  avert

future    insolvency,   making   of    reinsurance

arrangements   as   the  Commissioner   specifies,

removal  of  unsuitable persons from positions  of

authority in the insurance company, and prevention

of  unscrupulous and unfit persons being appointed

as agents by the insurer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other salient clauses are as follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 will prevent firms and companies,

particularly   those  carrying  on   business   as

insurance   agents   and  brokers,   from   having

misleading  names containing the word  "insurance"

or  any of its derivatives indicating the carrying

on   of   business  as  an  insurer,  and  thereby

deceiving the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 enables the Commissioner to impose

conditions  on  registration of  an  insurer,  and

clause 4 enables the Commissioner to add to,  vary

or   revoke   the   conditions,  or   impose   new

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides for the annual renewal of

registration  by  insurers  and  the  payment   of

prescribed   fees.  This  will   place   insurance

companies  on the same footing as banks and  other

financial   institutions  which  are  at   present

required to pay annual licence fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 relates to agents and brokers for

Lloyd's underwriters carrying on general insurance

business  in Singapore. It is intended  to  ensure

that  the  intermediaries  placing  business  with

Lloyd's  underwriters are financially  sound.  The

provision  requires persons who carry on  business

in  Singapore as insurance agents for  Lloyd's  to

have  a surplus of assets over liabilities of  not

less than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



$100,000, and in the case of insurance brokers who

place business at Lloyd's to furnish a certificate

of  solvency  and effect a professional  indemnity

cover  of not less than $500,000. This will  bring

insurance agents and brokers for Lloyd's  in  line

with  insurance  companies which are  required  to

have,  inter  alia,  a  surplus  of  assets   over

liabilities of not less than $1 million  in  order

to  be eligible to apply for registration to carry

on  life  business or general business,  or  $1 1/2

million  for  both classes; a deposit of  $300,000

with  the  Accountant-General  for  one  class  of

business;  and  to  satisfy the Commissioner  that

they  will  be  able to conduct  the  business  in

accordance with sound insurance principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 also provides for the payment by

insurance agents and brokers for Lloyd's  of  such

annual fees as may be prescribed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 will facilitate payment even where the

policies   exceed  $10,000,  provided  that   such

payment does not exceed nine-tenths of the  policy

monies  or  $10,000 whichever is  the  lesser.  At

present  insurers  cannot make  any  cash  payment

where   the   policies  exceed   $10,000   without

production    of    probate    or    letters    of

administration.  The  provision  will   save   the

dependants  of  the deceased unnecessary  hardship

and expedite payment of a claim where the value of

the life policy exceeds $10,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments in this Amendment Bill

are of a more urgent nature and will serve until a

more  comprehensive review of the  Insurance  Act,

which will take some time to complete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -.[Mr Hon Sui Sen].

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Parliament, in accordance with

section  4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter  270),

approves  the  construction by Government  of  a

jetty and berth within the fore-shore and seabed

at  Jurong  containing  approximately  29  acres

edged  red  and yellow and the dredging  of  the

several  portions of seabed coloured  orange  on

the  plan  marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION  PLAN

NO. 4/73" which is deposited in the Land Office,

Singapore.'

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the GATX Terminals (Private) Limited (a

joint venture between the Jurong Town Corporation,

Port  of  Singapore  Authority,  INTRACO  and  the

General  American  Transport  Corporation  of  the

United  States) has been allocated  a  site  shown

edged  purple  on  the  plan marked  "LAND  OFFICE

RECLAMATION  PLAN NO. 4/73" (a copy  of  which  is

displayed  in  the Library of this House  for  the

information of hon. Members). The site is for  the

construction  of  a  terminal to  provide  storage

facilities for bulk chemicals required to meet the

needs of our local industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has now applied for the allocation of

the  foreshore and seabed shown edged red  on  the

plan  for the docking of bulk tankers to discharge

their  liquid  cargo to the storage  tanks  to  be

constructed at the terminal, and for permission to

dredge  the portions of the seabed shown  coloured

orange on the plan to provide the necessary  depth

for  the  berthing of tankers. As the  area  shown

hatched  black which falls within the  area  edged

red now required by the Company has been allocated

to  Caltex Petroleum Terminal at Jurong,  together

with  the  area shown hatched blue, it is proposed

to  allocate  in replacement the area shown  edged

yellow to Caltex for its berthing facilities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction works and dredging to be

undertaken  by  the  Company  as  agent   of   the

Government,  and  estimated to  cost  the  Company

about  $5  million, however, require  approval  of

this  House under section 4 of the Foreshores  Act

(Chapter 270).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4  of  the  Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves

the  construction by Government  of  a  jetty  and
