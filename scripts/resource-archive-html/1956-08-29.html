<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Excellency the Governor entered the Chamber,

accompanied by Mr Speaker who was preceded by the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Clerk announcing "His Excellency the

Governor", the Governor delivered his Opening

Address.



<div align="center"><h4>GOVERNOR'S ADDRESS</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>His Excellency the Governor:</b> Honourable Members,

the  inauguration  of  Singapore's  second  elected

Government  marks a further stage in  the  vigorous

development  of  democracy in  Malaya.  The  former

Government  under the leadership  of  Mr  Marshall

forged a pattern of democratic progress and the new

Government,  with  the advantage of  continuity  of

personnel, will seek to ensure continuity of policy

and  its  plans for the future are linked with  the

achievements of the past 17 months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 4</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Government stands for the early attainment

of complete internal self-government and recognises

that  successful self-government must be  based  on

national prosperity and national solidarity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Friendly contacts and discussions with our

trading  neighbours have already brought  Singapore

benefits   and  the  Government  will  take   every

opportunity   of   continuing  to   explore   trade

possibilities    and    promote    sound    trading

relationships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Government will also promote the expansion

of  existing  industries  on  the  island  and  the

establishment of new industries. For  this  purpose

there  must be adequate capital investment.  It  is

hoped  that  the  rate of capital formation  within

Singapore  can be increased so that the  people  of

Singapore can finance their own prosperity.  It  is

recognised, however, that there is a need to import

capital   and,  consequently, to  attract  foreign

investment,  if  employment  opportunities  are  to

match the needs of our growing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. As recommended by the International Bank

Mission the Government is preparing legislation  to

set  up an Industrial Promotion Board to assist the

small-scale  manufacturer  and  is  examining   the

possible  establishment of an  Industrial  Research

Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Government attaches much importance to the

encouragement  and  expansion of  agricultural  and

fisheries  production. The island-wide Agricultural

Show  to  be  opened  on 1st September  will  bring

together,  for  the  first time in  Singapore,  the

varied  and  valuable products of our  farmers  and

fishermen  and  will encourage them  to  adopt  new

techniques   and   aim  at  higher   standards   of

achievement. It is hoped to secure the services  of

an   experienced  veterinary  geneticist  who  will

improve  the  breeding of local  pigs  and  poultry

whilst   the   Animal  Husbandry  and  Agricultural

Station  to  be  built shortly  at  Sembawang  will

decentralise  the  veterinary services  and  enable

farmers  to improve their livestock, to  learn  the

use  of  chemical fertilisers and to secure  better

seeds.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



Experimental fish ponds to provide fry for commercial

breeding purposes will be included.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The need to provide and to improve farming

lands is accepted and the Government will give  its

consideration  to measures aimed at giving  farmers

both   security   of   tenure  and   freedom   from

exploitation.  Road development  will  continue  to

open  up  farming and rural areas  both  for  their

economic  advantage  and for  provision  of  social

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. A special campaign will be conducted to

emphasise  the  aims  and  advantages  of  the  co-operative  movement, and all possible encouragement

will be given to farmers and fishermen to establish

and develop co-operative enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Development of the fishing industry will

receive close

attention,  particularly the expansion of  deep-sea

fishing. The plan for local fishermen to operate in

conjunction  with skilled Japanese  interests  will

develop more advanced methods and improve supplies.

A  pilot co-operative scheme is now being put  into

operation  for  fishermen at Ponggol  and  if  this

proves  successful consideration will be  given  to

further  schemes of this nature in  order  to  free

fishermen from debt and at the same time to improve

marketing methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. It is the objective of the Government not only

to increase the total wealth

of  Singapore  but also to ensure  that  wealth  is

diffused throughout the population and that the gap

between  the  largest incomes and the  smallest  is

steadily reduced. Whilst this is partly a matter of

the  cash  earnings  of  the worker,  diffusion  of

wealth  also  occurs  through  improvement  of  the

social  services provided out of national  revenue.

In  this  connection Government policy  is  one  of

improving  social services of all kinds  especially

in those areas, whether urban or rural, whose needs

have not been fully met in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Extended medical facilities will be continued

through  a system of clinics throughout the island.

Increasing  provision  of  trained  personnel  will

enable nursing attention to be given in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



homes  of  the  people. The implementation  of  the

education policy laid down in the White Paper  will

ensure  that local schools will provide a  steadily

improving   standard   of   education   at   points

convenient and accessible to local residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. The building of community centres will be

accelerated  in  co-operation  with  the   numerous

groups  who are already establishing or seeking  to

establish   community   centres   on   their    own

initiative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Whilst Singapore's business community is

served  by  a  system of excellent  communications,

there  is a growing need for expansion in the rural

areas.  The  Five-Year Postal Services  Development

Plan  will bring real benefits to neglected  areas,

priority  being given to the islands. At  the  same

time  the  Singapore Telephone Board  is  expanding

telephone  facilities through its  own  large-scale

development plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Plans are also in hand for decentralisation of

other  social services, including public assistance

and the Citizens Advice Bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. Hand in hand with decentralisation and

diffusion  of services will go decentralisation  of

the local government system on the lines set out in

the  White  Paper,  Cmd. No. 30 of  1956.  District

Councils  will be established before the middle  of

1957,  and will enable rural dwellers to deal  with

their    own    problems    through    their    own

representatives  and  to make  democracy  a  living

reality  in their daily lives. The Local Government

Bill  and the Local Elections Bill, to give  effect

to  this  policy, will be introduced  at  the  next

sitting of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. Improvements in the standard of living of the

people depend to a considerable extent on expansion

of  productive industry, for which an  increase  in

the number of skilled workers is required. This has

been, and will be, given the highest priority.  Two

secondary  technical schools are now operating  and

more  are  planned. The building of the Polytechnic

will  commence shortly. A Joint Industrial  Council

has  recently been set up to advise on an expanding

system  of apprenticeships which will enable  young

people to learn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



on   the   job  with  an  appropriate   amount   of

theoretical teaching in the classroom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. The Government intends to increase

opportunities  for careers in the merchant  marine.

Approval has been given to a scholarship scheme  to

assist  likely students to acquire secondary school

education in order to qualify for entry to  careers

as  deck  and  engineer officers. Plans  are  being

worked  out to assist locally domiciled  seamen  to

qualify  for more responsible positions.  Proposals

for  training  Local Trade Masters as  pilots  have

already   been   announced,   and   it   is   hoped

progressively  to  absorb more  local  men  in  the

pilotage service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. The teaching of certain technical skills

cannot  be provided economically in a territory  as

small  as Singapore. For this a co-ordinated scheme

for  the  use  of overseas facilities  through  the

Colombo  Plan and similar aid programmes  is  being

worked   out.  This  will  ensure  that  everything

possible   is   done   to   produce   the   trained

technologists  and professional workers  which  the

development of Singapore demands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. The Government is continuing to give careful

study  to  the problems of road communications  and

transport.  The  establishment  of  a  unified  bus

system   will  play  an  important  part  and   the

Government  will  publish a  White  Paper  on  this

subject shortly. The problems of traffic congestion

in  Singapore's streets are becoming, as  in  other

cities in the world, increasingly acute as more and

more  vehicles are registered. Measures  to  ensure

that  traffic  can  flow as  freely  as  conditions

permit  and  to  reduce obstruction  from  kerbside

parking will be introduced in a phased programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. Increasing inter-continental and regional

passenger traffic at Singapore Airport, which  from

January-June   1956   has  exceeded   figures   for

January-June  1955  by 38 per cent,  and  which  is

expected  to  total  more than  300,000  passengers

during  1956,  shows  that Singapore's  Airport  is

flourishing  and  may  in  future  be   almost   as

important  as its seaport. This should bring  added

business and prosperity to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



community,  and  the Government  is  determined  to

encourage  this development. For these  reasons  it

has  been  decided to go forward at once  with  the

permanent  Terminal  Building  at  Paya  Lebar  and

construction will start early next year. Additional

hangar accommodation is being provided immediately,

and  work  on  the  apron and  taxi-way  system  is

continuing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. Good progress is being made between the

Governments  concerned and the  Company  about  the

future of Malayan Airways. The final agreement will

be tabled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. The frequent and increasing floods which have

caused  serious damage and suffering  in  the  past

constitute a major problem for which the Government

now  has the technical solution, but which can only

be  dealt  with  as  funds can be  made  available.

Adequate  land  will be reserved for  future  flood

drainage  works. The anti-flood scheme at Bedok  is

now  almost  completed, and the first  stage  of  a

scheme  for the Geylang/Paya Lebar area will  start

shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. The importance of telecommunications in

Singapore's commercial and social life is shown  by

an  increase  in 1955 of more than 16 per  cent  in

overseas  radio telephone calls, and by a total  of

nearly 2,000,000 trunk calls between Singapore  and

the  Federation, the latter figure illustrating the

very  close  ties between the two territories.  The

Government will seek to maintain the efficiency  of

these  essential  services and to  expand  them  as

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. The Government is considering whether the

requirements  of  broadcasting in  Singapore  could

best  be  served by setting up a public corporation

and  the  prospects of introducing  television  are

being  examined  by a committee in accordance  with

the resolution of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. Means for prevention, control and treatment of

disease  and  ill  health  will  continue   to   be

strengthened.   In  conjunction  with   the   Royal

Singapore AntiTuberculosis Association, whose  work

in  this  field  has  been  outstanding,  and  with

Colombo  Plan  aid  from Australia,  a  large-scale

campaign  against tuberculosis is planned to  begin

in 1957.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



Simultaneously,  an expanding programme  of  health

education  for  the  public, and  of  training  for

doctors,  nurses,  midwives and  ancillary  medical

workers  will limit and reduce human suffering  and

economic  waste arising from preventable  diseases.

With an initial grant of $20,000 from Government, a

Health  Education  Council has been  created.  This

Council  unites all willing persons  and  voluntary

bodies  in a cooperative health education  project.

It has already received most welcome support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. Departmental training awards have risen from 17 in 1955 to provision for 66 in 1957, whilst the

output  of fully trained nurses will increase  from 25  in  1955 to more than 100 in 1957. In order  to

facilitate the specialist training of local medical

officers,   the   Government  has   arranged   with

Australia  for  the holding of an annual  "Primary"

Examination  in  Singapore of the Royal  Australian

College  of Surgeons, thus saving time and  expense

on  sending  officers overseas, and  also  for  the

training  of  young  specialists  by  exchange   of

doctors  with Australian teaching hospitals.  These

arrangements will facilitate the training of  local

medical  officers and assist in the  Malayanisation

of the Medical Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. In addition to the 1,200 beds provided by

construction  between April 1955 and December  1956

work   will  soon  start  on  a  500-bed   district

hospital, on five more maternity and child  welfare

clinics  and  on two more out-patient dispensaries.

Plans  are  being  prepared for a  200-bed  chronic

hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. The principles governing the Master Plan have

won general acceptance and the Government will seek

to  ensure  that land is wisely used and  carefully

developed  for  the  national  advantage  and  that

ownership   of   land  is  not  used   for   unjust

exploitation.  Legislation  is  being  prepared  to

provide adequate machinery and powers for town  and

country  planning  under  the  Ministry  of   Local

Government, Lands and Housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. Steps are in hand to provide the machinery

required  for the operation of the new Land  Titles

Ordinance, which will reduce the cost and  simplify

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



procedure   in   land   transactions.   The    Land

Acquisition  and the Land Purchases  Control  Bills

will  be  brought  to this Assembly  after  further

study  has been given to certain aspects  of  their

operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. Public housing development has hitherto been

slowed  down,  and in some projects  even  stopped,

because  nearly  all potential urban  and  suburban

building  sites  are occupied by  poor  people  who

would  suffer great hardship if evicted.  The  Land

Clearance  and Resettlement Plan, accepted  by  the

previous   Government,  makes  fair  and   adequate

provision  for compensating and rehousing  in  such

cases, whether in appropriate permanent housing, or

in  semi-urban  planned attap areas with  municipal

services,  or in farming settlements.  This  should

much  facilitate the clearance of sites for housing

and  also  for other development and the Government

building  programme  aims at  steady  expansion  of

permanent  dwellings. To carry  out  this  building

programme, the Singapore Improvement Trust will  be

replaced by a Housing Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. Since rents at present constitute a very heavy

burden  on  the  poor,  the  Government  has   been

studying  schemes  for  housing  subsidies.  Whilst

these  must  be  related on the  one  hand  to  the

ability  of the occupant to pay, they must also  be

reasonable   in  relation  to  the   public   funds

available.  It is therefore proposed  that  housing

subsidy  commitments should be  subject  to  annual

discussion  by  the Assembly, and it  is  hoped  to

present  the first scheme for housing subsidies  to

the Assembly in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. The Government wishes to encourage owner

occupation of houses and will proceed with  further

schemes  in  this direction, on the  lines  of  the

recent  offer  for  sale of 68 houses,  which  drew 1,312 applications, and will seek to apply the same

general principles to ownership of flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. Singapore's financial position continues to be

sound,  and  the Government intends that  it  shall

remain  so and that nothing shall be done to  shake

confidence in the stability of our economy and  our

currency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. Essential development requirements have

been re-examined and a revised plan will shortly be

laid  before the Assembly, setting out the priority

of  requirements  for  schools,  hospitals,  public

utilities and other projects. Whilst this  plan  is

flexible,  it  will  state the  broad  outlines  of

development   policy  within   the   framework   of

available funds over the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35. The Government will continue to ensure

economy in development spending by reference of all

plans  to  the high-level Advisory Panel on  Public

Buildings   or   to  the  Public   Works   Standing

Committee,  by which large economies  have  already

been achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36. Development can be partly financed from

existing  reserves  but prudence  forbids  draining

these  too low and very large sums will have to  be

raised by loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37. Simultaneously with large capital expenditure

on development expanding social services will cause

a  rapid  increase in recurrent expenditure,  which

must  be  met  by  increased revenue.  Considerable

taxation  potential  remains  to  be  tapped,   and

measures to be introduced to increase revenue  will

seek  to  lay the burden on the shoulders of  those

members of the community best able to carry it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38. Singapore's fiscal and economic policies are

inter-dependent  with those of  the  Federation  of

Malaya and consultation and co-ordination on  these

subjects   with  the  Federation  Government   will

continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39. With its population increasing very rapidly,

Singapore  has  peculiarly urgent  youth  problems,

which  involve provision both for proper  education

and  upbringing  and  for economic  employment  and

satisfactory living conditions when education ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40. Development of the education system is

proceeding  rapidly and is not far from  the  point

where  free  compulsory primary  education  can  be

enforced. It is not at present possible to envisage

providing secondary education for all, but the  co-ordinated  development  of education  and  training

facilities outlined



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



earlier   in   this  Address  should  ensure   that

opportunities   match  individual   abilities   and

national needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41. The Government appreciates the need of

the  pupils leaving the Chinese middle schools  for

an  institution  of higher education  in  which  to

continue  their  studies  and  the  enterprise  and

enthusiasm  which  brought the  Nanyang  University

into  being. It is aware, however, of the  need  to

maintain high academic standards without which  the

qualifications  to be acquired will  be  of  little

value.  The  Government is therefore at  all  times

ready to help the Nanyang University authorities to

attain  standards  which  will  be  internationally

recognised, so that the graduates will be  able  to

find    worthwhile   employment   and    contribute

effectively to the welfare of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42. Whilst providing for the needs of the

outstanding,   the  able  and  the   average,   the

Government  will  also  care  for  those  who   are

handicapped in mind, body or character.  Plans  are

in  hand  for  accommodation of mentally  deficient

children;   the  school  for  the  blind   is   now

operating;  further provision is  planned  for  the

deaf  and the dumb; an approved school for juvenile

delinquents,  and a new block for  girls  at  Mount

Emily  are  scheduled;  Borstal  training  will  be

available  very  shortly and necessary  legislation

will  be  introduced  in  the  Assembly;  the  most

valuable probation system is ready for expansion as

required; two Prison  Welfare Officers will provide

not  only  for  the  morale and  rehabilitation  of

prisoners,  but  also  for  assistance   to   their

innocent and distressed families; it is planned  to

build  two hostels for unemployed boys and one  for

girls within the next 18 months; and close study is

being   given  to  the  possibility  of   a   rural

settlement   for   old   people.   Healthy    youth

organisations will continue to receive the  maximum

encouragement and full training facilities, without

being devitalised by excessive paternalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43. The Government is paying particular attention

to  the  complex problems of social security.  When

the Minimum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>

Living Standards Committee has completed its study

and  its recommendations have been correlated with

those  of  the International Labour Office  expert

who  has  been making a separate study, Government

intends  to formulate and present to the  Assembly

schemes  for ensuring that the first steps towards

social  security and relief for the  hardships  of

the unemployed are taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44. The Government will also continue to

ameliorate the working conditions and standards of

living  of  the workers, and, in particular,  will

introduce legislation to ensure fair conditions of

employment for shop assistants and clerks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45. The Government is profoundly convinced that

the   expansion   of  national  prosperity,   with

accompanying expansion of social services  and  of

development, can only be achieved on the basis  of

national solidarity and national effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46. In the field of economic production the

Government  considers that employers  and  workers

must  recognise the need for co-operation in their

joint  task of service to the national prosperity.

Every  effort of energy and patience will be  made

by   the  Government  to  eliminate  wasteful  and

damaging   disputes  by  the  timely  removal   of

grievances and by the education of both management

and labour in the processes of negotiation, in the

means  of joint consultation, and in understanding

of  the  importance of good human relations within

industry.  It  must  be realised  that  plans  for

relief  of  unemployment and for creation  of  new

industries   can  be  frustrated  by   unnecessary

stoppages, which reduce production or even halt it

forever,  thus throwing workers into the  miseries

of unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47. Detailed study of the report of the

Malayanisation Commission is now far advanced  and

will  soon be completed. The Government will  then

publish a programme for the phased replacement  of

expatriate  officers by Malayans.  This  programme

will  provide  for  rapid  Malayanisation  to   be

carried  out  without unreasonable  sacrifices  of

efficiency  in the public administration  at  this

vital



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



time  in  Singapore's history. Simultaneously  the

Government  will introduce a scheme for  fair  and

reasonable  compensation to  expatriate  officers.

Negotiations  with the Staff Associations  are  in

progress. All expatriate officers will be informed

of  their prospects for future service here and of

the   terms  on  which  their  services  will   be

terminated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. A Public Services Commission with executive

powers  will  be established as soon as  agreement

has been reached on a compensation scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49. It is clear that it will be some years before

an  adequate supply of suitably qualified Malayans

is  available to replace all expatriates and until

then  expatriates  will be  needed  especially  in

professional    and   technical    posts.    Where

appropriate   those  expatriate   officers   whose

services are needed for a further period  will  be

guaranteed   consideration   for   promotion    in

accordance with normal service principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50. The Government has been gravely concerned by

the  danger  to the public welfare from gangsters,

from  secret  societies, from armed violence,  and

from  corruption. It is determined to continue  to

take strong action to remove these threats and  to

protect all good citizens from anti-social forces.

In  that  task the Government appeals  confidently

for  the  co-operation and support of the  public,

which   are  essential.  It  is  intended  to   do

everything  possible to foster  moral  welfare  by

encouragement of healthy youth activities  and  by

ensuring,  as  far  as may be, that  young  people

receive  proper moral teaching and  guidance.  The

Government  is  anxious that parents  should  give

more  care  to  watching over the  characters  and

occupations   of  their  children.  A   thoroughly

revised Ordinance for the protection of women  and

girls will be introduced during 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51. As Singapore moves towards complete self-government and national status, the

need to maintain its own armed forces becomes more

urgent.  Recruitment for the new Regular Battalion

will  open  shortly  and  it  is  hoped  that  all

sections of the community will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



not only support the new Battalion in principle but

will  also  come forward as Singapore  citizens  to

enlist as regular soldiers of high civic quality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52. Aspirations of political freedom must be

accompanied   by  genuine  national   efforts   for

economic  independence.  Whilst  Singapore,  as  an

international  centre of trade, must always  retain

close  links with its trading neighbours, and  must

give scope for foreign capital, it is of the utmost

importance  that  the citizens of Singapore  should

provide as much as they possibly can of the capital

needed  for  national development. For  the  future

every  good citizen should recognise the need,  for

his  own  and  for the nation's prosperity,  to  be

economical  in  his  spending and  thrifty  in  his

habits  so  that  he can save in  order  to  invest

within  Singapore. The Government is examining  the

feasibility   of  initiating  a  national   savings

movement.  In  this  way every  citizen  could,  in

greater  or  lesser  degree,  contribute   to   the

national prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. Whilst the Government recognises that

Singapore  lives  by  the free movement  of  trade,

steps  must and will be taken, as indicated briefly

earlier in this Address, to encourage and build  up

our  local production for home consumption and  for

export.  All citizens can, and should,  play  their

part  in  the development of secondary industry  by

consuming goods produced on this island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. The Government does not intend that the

development  of national solidarity should  in  any

way   conflict  with  or  damage  the   traditional

cultures  of  the different communities  living  in

Singapore.  The education policy laid down  in  the

White  Paper  Cmd. No. 15 of 1956  will  ensure  to

every  child  the opportunity of education  in  the

language  of the parents' choice, together  with  a

second   language   which  will   enable   him   to

communicate  with  his fellows of  different  race.

Whilst   Singapore's  trade  demands  an   adequate

knowledge  of  English as a  world  language  by  a

proportion of its citizens, there is no doubt  that

under  the  new education policy the languages  and

cultures of the Malays, the Chinese and the Indians

will flourish as they have never



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



done  in  the  past.  It  cannot  be  too  strongly

emphasized  that the Government is determined  that

all  children  should  be given  equal  educational

opportunity.  To  this end it is  preparing  a  new

Grant  Code which will govern the payment  of  full

aid to different kinds of schools. Whether a school

is to receive a grant or not will certainly depend,

not  on  the language of instruction of the school,

but  on  two over-riding conditions: that  its  aim

should  be to turn out children whose loyalty  will

be  to  this country and that the grant  should  be

wisely used and accounted for properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55. The Government is aware of the need to provide

for  older  people  some of the  opportunities  for

education   they  were  denied  in   their   youth.

Experience during the past years has shown the need

for   a  number  of  reforms  in  the  arrangements

previously  made for providing adult  education.  A

new constitution is being drafted for the Singapore

Council for Adult Education which it is hoped  will

make these reforms effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. As a factor of encouragement for all cultures,

the Government is considering a proposal to set  up

a  Department of Fine Arts and Cultural  Relations,

which    will   without   discrimination    provide

facilities  and  encouragement  for  the  different

cultures  of  Singapore  and  which  will  make  it

possible  to  fertilise  them  through  visits  and

exchanges with the cultures of other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. The Government considers that an important

contribution  to national solidarity  can  be  made

through  widening the understanding of  the  people

with  regard  to  the structure  and  work  of  the

Government and its Public Services, and  will  seek

to   give  this  understanding  of  the  democratic

process by providing a scheme of civics courses for

representative groups from all parts of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. The Government is aware that the hysterical,

unreasonable  and  often  criminal  activities   of

undercover Communists are harmful to national unity

and   national   prosperity.  Whilst   willing   to

facilitate in every way the retirement to Communist

countries  of those who favour a Communist  way  of

life, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



Government  asks those who call this country  their

home to give sincere loyalty to the free democratic

Malayan way of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. Whilst the business of Government proceeds

from  day  to day and from year to year,  it  ought

also to be planned with proper thought for the long-term  future and for this purpose planning must  be

based   on  sound  economic  surveys  and  economic

advice.  The  Government will seek  to  expand  and

strengthen  the office of the Economic  Adviser  in

order that no factor should be overlooked which can

contribute to the future welfare of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. The first elected Government recognised that

the  welfare of the people of Singapore could  best

be  served  by  the  early attainment  of  complete

internal   self-government  and  union   with   the

Federation  of Malaya and accordingly directed  its

efforts to achieving these ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. The setback sustained by an All-Party mission,

comprised  of Members of this Assembly, which  went

to  London earlier this year to seek constitutional

advancement, while dealing a grievous blow  to  the

aspirations of the people of Singapore, is regarded

by   this   Government  as  being  temporary.   The

resources  and the energies of the Government  will

be   applied   to  ensure  that  these   legitimate

aspirations  are attained in the very near  future.

In  this the Government is confident of the support

of all Parties represented in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. Although the goal of union with the Federation

of  Malaya is still not in sight, the links already

forged   are  being  strengthened  to   make   both

territories   indivisible.  The   Government   will

continue  to foster and strengthen these  links  so

that  ultimately  the narrow gap will  be  bridged,

bringing  about  the fusion of the two  territories

into  a  single, united nation. We look forward  to

this Greater Malaya taking its rightful place among

the  Comity  of Nations. With God's help  it  shall

grow  in stature and prosperity and advance in full

glory into that era of Universal Peace destined for

Man-kind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the Governor's Address, Mr

Speaker,  preceded  by the Serjeant  at  Arms,  the

Clerk   Assistant  and  the  Clerk,  escorted   His

Excellency out of the Chamber, and the sitting  was

suspended until twelve noon.



<br><br>Twelve noon
