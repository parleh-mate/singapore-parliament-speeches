<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the last and third part of the question,

of  the  Board.  In  fact, in the  Board's  housing

estates, it is quite common for a barber to share a

shop  with  a  hairdresser, and a Chinese  medicine

dealer to share a shop with a cosmetics dealer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Income Tax Ordinance provides  exemption

from  income tax on contributions to funds for  the

educational



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



institution  which  is not operated  as  a  profit-making   body.   This  relief  is  provided   under

paragraph (c) (vi) of section 37 (2) of the  Income

Tax Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering applications, my Ministry would

regard  as desirable criteria to qualify  for  such

reliefs that the funds be properly constituted  and

that the scholarships and bursaries be open to  all

members  of the public, irrespective of their  race

and  religion.  My  Ministry  would  find  it  more

difficult to allow the same privilege to registered

associations which restrict their scholarships  and

bursaries to members of the associations and  their

families only, as this can easily lead to abuse. If

such  exemption  is allowed, it would  not  require

much imagination for people to take advantage of it

to   avoid   payment  of  income  tax  by   forming

associations  of  small  groups  to  pay  for   the

education of their children.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  if he will make a statement on the  recent

shortage of cement in Singapore, the reasons therefor  and  the steps he proposes to take to overcome

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is not aware of any

real  shortage  of cement recently, although  there

have  been fears expressed of such a shortage.  Any

threat to the smooth tempo of building construction

activity  is, however, the concern of  my  Ministry

which has, therefore, investigated this matter. The

alarm  appears to have been created because a small

proportion  of  clinker imports did  not  meet  the

required specifications for cement manufacture. The

production  of  acceptable cement  in  one  of  the

factories  consequently fell, and this  created  an

unnecessary panic. However, the position of clinker

supplies  in  Singapore is  quite  healthy  at  the

moment, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>



three  manufacturers within the  industry  are  co-operating with one another to maintain a production

level in line with the demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be of interest to Members to know that the

production capacity for manufacture of cement is at

present  one  million tons per year,  and  this  is

expected to increase to 1.2 million tons by October

1971.  The  demand for cement in the year  1971  is

expected to be in the region of about 850,000 tons,

averaging  71,000 tons a month, or 2,400  tons  per

day. From the information provided by the industry,

the  manufacturers are at present supplying between

2,300  and 2,600 tons a day. This is sufficient  to

meet the local demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our cement industry is dependent on

imported  clinker, and any short supply of  clinker

could well affect the supply position in the cement

industry. Because of this, my Ministry is keeping a

constant review of the position of clinker  stocks.

Should we find that the clinker stocks are such  as

to  threaten cement supplies, we shall not hesitate

to  take  immediate  action to allow  imports  into

Singapore duty free to meet the local demand. It is

very unlikely that this will be necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be mentioned that my Ministry has

established    a   consultative   committee    with

representatives   from   manufacturers   and    the

Contractors' Association to review the position  of

cement from time to time.

The first concerns the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>



use  of  languages in Parliament, that is  Standing

Order  43,  which provides that an hon. Member  may

speak  either in Malay, Mandarin, Tamil or English,

as   it   is  permitted  by  Article  37   of   the

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second Standing Order is paragraph (2) of

Standing Order 47 which provides, inter alia,  that

reference shall not be made to any matter which  is

sub  judice. I would urge hon. Members to  exercise

caution in referring to any matter which is  before

a court of law awaiting adjudication. Thank you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the Development Estimates of

Expenditure  for Singapore for the  financial  year

1st April, 1971, to 31st March. 1972, contained  in

Paper  Cmd. 4 of 1971. I shall take the  total  for

each  head of expenditure as it appears in the last

column  of the Summary of Estimated Expenditure  on

pages 5 and 6 of the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure

in  respect of which amendments stand on the Order

Paper Supplement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 01 -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 01 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item 001 of  subhead

101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that everybody will be very glad to note that an initial sum of $2 million has been set aside for the construction of the proposed subordinate court building at Havelock Road. I wonder if the Minister can give us additional information about the architectural and

other  features of the proposed building:  that  is

information  additional to what  has  already  been

given   in   the  Memorandum  on  the   Development

Estimates, as well as from any other pronouncements

recently made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that justice should be meted out in circumstances of proper appearance of physical dignity, and that the law should be administered under conditions that reflect the progress that we see in other aspects of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



Singapore life. Currently, without going  too  much

into  tedious  details, an atmosphere  of  physical

gloom,  congestion and dilapidation hangs over  our

subordinate  courts. I had an opportunity  recently

to  take  a  look  at  them  and  it  was  quite  a

depressing experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that in the administration of the law

we  want to get the maximum public co-operation.  I

would hope that after this proposed new building is

completed,  there  will  be appropriate  space  and

amenities for witnesses and the general public. Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  every  year  thousands  of  people,

including witnesses, have contacts with the courts.

What sort of impression do these people get if  the

conditions  they experience are such  as  they  are

experiencing now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally. I note with some anxiety that the

Memorandum on the Development Estimates states that

work may start in mid-year. I would urge that every

effort  be made to implement the decision  that  is

involved in the vote on which I am speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say at

the outset that I agree with the views expressed by

the  Member for Katong. The subordinate courts were

already  in  a bad way when I used to  practise  in

them  eight years ago. They must have become  worse

since then. Hence, the new court building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $2 million against subhead 101

is  required to meet the cost of construction works

for  the  first  year only. The  whole  project  is

estimated to take about 31 months to complete, from

the  date  of  obtaining vacant possession  of  the

site. Reference to this subject was made in January

1971.  Actual piling work is scheduled to  commence

next  month,  but there have been  delays  in  site

clearance,  and  the present Havelock  Road,  which

forms part of the site, cannot be closed until  the

alternative proposed major road system in that area

is implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will be pleased to know that the

subordinate court complex will be the first of  its

kind in this part of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



Science  Centre  is  not  responsible  for  science

research.  It  is  an organisation responsible  for

some  kind  of  a  museum. I hope  the  Member  for

Sembawang  will be able to distinguish between  the

kinds  of  work to be undertaken. I hope  that  the

Science Centre will be completed by 1974 or 1975.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Augustine Tan.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the University of Singapore is considered to

be one of the best institutions of higher learning.

It is responsible for the training of professionals

required   for   the   country.   Therefore,    the

expenditure to be voted for is justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, when will the construction of the

building be completed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how will the furniture and equipment

and  land be acquired with $10 under each item? Are

there  any  plans to proceed with the  purchase  of

furniture  and  equipment and  the  acquisition  of

land?



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in addition

to  the queries of the Member for Sembawang, may  I

ask  the  Minister for Science and  Technology  the

following questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in regard to the sports complex in the

new  University site, may I know whether a swimming

pool is envisaged?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister

whether  it is proposed to provide housing of  some

kind for the University staff at the new site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, is it proposed to air-condition all the

offices and lecture halls at the new campus?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will reply

in  a  language  which  will be  familiar  to  both

Members  who have asked me the questions. First  of

all,  to  answer  the Member for Sembawang  on  the

question  of the $l0 vote. This signifies that  the

Ministry  has  staked  a claim  for  furniture  and

equipment and for land. Of course, you cannot buy a

table these days for $10 unless it is a second hand

table.  But  the  $10 vote is to indicate  that  in

future,  if  it is necessary for the University  to

acquire equipment, a submission will be made to the

Ministry of Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of land, nothing has been settled. I

have no idea at all how the University is going  to

pay for the acquisition of land at Kent Ridge. This

is a problem which is beyond the University, and it

has  to  be  settled  between  the  Bases  Economic

Conversion  Department, representing the  Singapore

Government, and the British Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, what has happened is this. We have

submitted five papers providing the data which have

been  asked  for by the World Bank. The World  Bank

has  sent officers periodically to discuss with the

University  Development Unit the progress  that  is

being  made in planning. We are now waiting for  an

appraisal team to come out from Washington so  that

studies can be further elaborated if necessary, and

the  World  Bank can make a final decision  on  how

much of the application which we have made will  be

supported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of the sports complex

which has been raised by the Member for Whampoa,  I

would  just like to point out that it is  very  far

distant in planning. We have no immediate plans for

it, although the intention, of course, is to devote

a part



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



of the land to sports activities which will include

facilities for students and staff who wish to  play

soccer,  rugger, hockey, and cricket if  necessary.

But  we  have  to  make  optimum  use  of  existing

facilities. There is already in existence a  sports

complex  about 300 yards north of Kent Ridge,  next

door to the St. John's International School and the

Polytechnic which will be sited at Dover Road. This

sports  complex has been built at very heavy  cost.

Several  claims  have  been  made  for  the  sports

complex  which includes a swimming pool, a pavilion

and  changing  rooms.  I believe  the  Ministry  of

Social  Affairs and the Ministry of  Education  are

also making a claim. But until a final decision has

been  made, I cannot guarantee that we need to plan

for  another swimming pool, because I believe  that

whatever  facilities  are available  in  that  area

should   also  be  made  available  to  the   whole

community and not to the students only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for University staff housing, I am told that

there  are  existing,  as of this  moment  in  Kent

Ridge,  houses  which  are now  being  occupied  by

officers in the British Army. Of this number, about

55  will have to be demolished in order to make way

for  Phase One of the development project. So there

will  be 45 houses left which can be used to  house

the  University  staff. There are  also  houses  in

Medway and Sussex Parks which are adjacent to  Kent

Ridge.  Again I have made a bid for them on  behalf

of  the University and the Polytechnic as well,  so

that  we can utilise them for teachers who wish  to

teach at the University or the Polytechnic. But  no

final  decision  can be made on the utilisation  of

these  houses  because,  excepting  those  at  Kent

Ridge,  real  estate problems  have  to  be  solved

between  the Singapore Government and the  British,

Australian  and New Zealand Governments  which  are

proposing  to  place a token force in Singapore.  I

believe  there  is at the moment an examination  of

the  needs  of this token force which  will  be  in

Singapore.  But our intention is that,  as  far  as

possible,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



the  locality  in  Pasir  Panjang  should  be  made

available for economic and educational development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, where possible and where land is

available,  it  will  be  the  intention   of   the

University  to build flats for housing  its  staff,

and   similarly  I  have  also  suggested  to   the

Polytechnic that when it moves over to Dover  Road,

flats ought to be built to house its staff. In this

way,  we  can bring the staff nearer to the campus.

These two problems are being looked after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for air-conditioning, I am more concerned with

the annual maintenance costs and the public utility

charges which the University will have to pay, than

with the capital expenditure which will be incurred

by  installing air-conditioning plants.  I  believe

that  the annual operating cost of air-conditioning

is $1.10 per square foot per annum. The Faculty for

Engineering alone is asking for a total floor  area

of  393,750 square feet. But of this area, a  total

of  315,000  square feet is to be  air-conditioned,

because   laboratories  which   contain   sensitive

equipment will have to be air-conditioned and it is

the  intention to provide air-conditioned rooms  in

the  lecture  theatres as well as in seminar  rooms

and  staff rooms. The annual operating cost of air-conditioning  this space alone for the  Engineering

Faculty is $346,500. If you extrapolate the cost of

maintaining   air-conditioning   for   all    other

faculties   -   Science,   Architecture,   Business

Administration and ultimately the Teaching Hospital

-  you  can  imagine how much the annual  recurrent

costs   of   upkeeping  the  University  will   be.

Therefore,  we have to be very careful that  we  do

not air-condition every part of the University. The

workshops and the corridors are decidedly not going

to  be air-conditioned. The whole campus complex is

being  planned  on a modular basis so  that,  where

necessary, air conditioning can be installed as and

when members of the staff feel fit. And when it  is

not  necessary, the air-conditioning  can  also  be

turned off. This is uppermost in our minds.  It  is

not  just the capital expenditure which is required

to put up the University at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



Kent  Ridge but the annual recurrent costs as well.

I hope I have answered all the questions which have

been  raised  by  the  Members  for  Sembawang  and

Whampoa.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I wish to raise a few

questions for answer by the Minister concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) How is this money to be spent? Is it for the

purchase of land or any other purpose?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is this expenditure going to offset the

economic losses caused by the British pull-out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Are further donations being received towards

the National Defence Fund? What is the total amount

of contributions to date?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir,

this  money will be spent not only in buying  land,

but  also on weapons, equipment, vehicles and  that

kind of thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will it help to offset the expenditure on the

British  military run-down? The answer is no.  This

money  is meant to equip our army and not  to  help

the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards donations to the Defence Fund, I do

not have the exact figure, but it is very close  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I wish to seek further

elucidation from the Minister for Communications on

the  setting up of the Mass Transit Planning  Unit.

Though the Minister has already answered a question

raised in this House some time earlier on the  Mass

Transit  Planning Unit, I would like  to  know  how

this  vote of half a million dollars will be  spent

and  what  the Mass Transit Planning Unit  will  be

doing within the next 15 to 18 months, as indicated

in  the Memorandum on the Development Estimates  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much assistance will the United Nations

Development  Programme be giving to Singapore?  The

Minister  has  also mentioned that  loans  will  be

asked  for  from the World Bank. In  this  respect,

perhaps  he will enlighten this House on  how  much

the  cost will be, if eventually such a mass  rapid

transit project is set up in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Sir, I shall be only too happy to explain

this  matter  of mass rapid transit, in  particular

the Mass Transit Planning Unit which has a vote  of

half a million dollars for the next financial year,

as  mentioned by the Member for Punggol. As  stated

earlier   in   the  debate  on  the  Estimates   of

Expenditure  for the year 1971-72, we have  applied

to  the  United  Nations Development Programme  for

assistance  to  carry  out  a  mass  rapid  transit

feasibility study. This is now under study  by  the

U.N.D.P. We expect a decision to be made some  time

in June this year. If it is in the affirmative, the

study is expected to commence in January next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October last year, it was decided to set up

within  the  Ministry  of  Communications  a   Mass

Transit Planning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



Unit to administer and service this proposed study.

The  Unit  will comprise both foreign  consultants,

who  will  be employed by the World Bank  for  this

project,    and   local   counterpart   staff    of

professional calibre. In addition, related services

required  for the efficient operation of the  study

team  will  be  provided for the  duration  of  the

study. In terms of manpower, it is anticipated that

the  staff will be about 50, comprising 13  foreign

consultants,  12  local  professional  staff,  and

about  24  administrative technical supporters  who

will   be  working  on  this  project.  The   local

professional  staff  will consist  of  serving  and

newly  recruited  administrative officials  in  the

Ministry  of  Communications and experienced  staff

seconded   from   the  State  and   City   Planning

Department,  the Urban Renewal Department  and  the

Ministry of Finance. It is always essential to have

the  Ministry of Finance officials right  from  the

very  beginning, so that when the report comes  up,

it  will  have  already  been  processed  by  their

officials  and is more likely to be approved  at  a

later  stage. That is one of the secrets of getting

things done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of the local professional staff will

be sent overseas for advanced training and study on

mass transit planning, technology and management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to expansion needs in the State and City

Planning Department, the original plan to site  the

Mass Transit Planning Unit in their premises has to

be  revised.  In  view of the  short  duration  and

specialised nature of the study, it is proposed  to

convert   a  bungalow  in  the  Port  of  Singapore

Authority to house the Unit for the duration of the

study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated total project cost is expected to

be  in  the  region of over $4 million  and  it  is

expected  that  the  U.N.D.P, may  contribute  $2.8

million,  and Singapore's contribution will  be  in

the  region  of $1.2 million, partly  in  cash  and

partly   in  kind,  especially  the  rendering   of

professional services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol then asked what the cost

of  the  Mass Rapid Transit System would be if  and

when we do decide to implement this proposal. I  do

not  think I could do better than refer him to  the

budget  statement made by the Minister for  Finance

on 8th March, 1971, in Hansard, col. 591:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Development expenditure requests, however, have

been increasing in size from year to year. Some  of

the needs in the coming years for projects like the

Mass  Rapid Transit System or for renewal of  urban

areas will be for sums beyond anything we have been

accustomed so far to consider.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary indications are that it would be to

the  tune  of  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.

Perhaps  we  had  better  wait  for  the  study  to

indicate  how many hundreds of millions of  dollars

will be involved.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is it possible

for  the  Minister perhaps to indicate  alternative

systems   that   are  being  generally   considered

feasible in the light of Singapore's circumstances?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, perhaps the Member for

Katong  is somewhat impatient and wants to  have  a

statement  from  me  as to what  is  the  preferred

system.   I  think  we  should  allow  the   expert

technical  staff  to put forward  their  views.  It

could be an underground or an overhead railway. May

I  plead  with the Member for Katong  to  hold  his

horses till we get the feasibility report?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I most heartily agree with the

Minister's  last  suggestion. I am  also  extremely

grateful  to  the Minister for having indicated  to

this  House  what plans are in hand concerning  the

to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to ask the Minister a question. In

the  White Paper on the Reorganisation of the Motor

Transport  Service  of Singapore  tabled  recently,

there  was  a  proposal to allow  authorised  motor

workshops and repair shops to issue certificates of

inspection  to  vehicle  owners.  May  I  ask   the

Minister when this can be implemented?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, the House is being asked to allocate a sum  of

money  totalling  $823,000  to  establish  a  Motor

Vehicle  Inspection Centre at Upper  Thomson  Road.

Last  week this House heard the reply given by  the

Minister,  that  the  new Motor Vehicle  Inspection

Centre  would be completed at the end of 1971,  and

that  the R.O.V. headquarters would be moving  into

its new building at Upper Thomson Road.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard recently that renovations are being

carried  out  at the R.O.V., Middle Road.  I  would

like to ask the Minister a few questions. First, if

the  Registry of Vehicles is going to move  out  of

Middle Road, why are renovations being carried  out

there? Second, how much floor area is the new Motor

Vehicle Inspection Centre going to occupy, and what

sort  of  a  building is it going to be?  The  last

question is, how many cars can be inspected at this

new Inspection Centre?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may

first answer the question raised by the Member  for

Toa  Payoh  referring to that section of the  White

Paper  on the Reorganisation of the Motor Transport

Service of Singapore, Paper Cmd. 21 of 1970. It  is

true  that  in  para. 12.2 of  the  Paper,  it  was

indicated   that   it   is   proposed   to   accept

certificates  of  inspection issued  by  authorised

motor  workshops or repairers in lieu of inspection

by  the ROV. We have not implemented this decision:

it  is  not  kept in cold storage, but  just  being

deferred, because there are many problems now being

tackled  by  the Registrar of Vehicles,  especially

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>



proposed re-routing and reallocation of bus  routes

which will begin about two weeks from now and there

is  a  tremendous amount of work involved. Once  we

have  got over the bus services reorganisation,  we

will  come  back again to this other  proposal,  by

which  time we hope that the new Inspection  Centre

which is being built at Sin Ming Road will be ready

within  five  months from now, i.e., in  September.

When  certain sections of the Registry  have  moved

out  from  Middle Road to Sin Ming Road, off  Upper

Thomson Road, there will be less congestion in  the

administrative  headquarters at  Middle  Road,  and

with  more  room  to  spare we shall  get  down  to

implementing  the  decision  about  acceptance   of

certificates  of  inspection.  I  hope  this   will

convince the Member that the matter has not  really

been  forgotten  but deferred for  a  little  while

because  of  other  pressing  problems  of  greater

magnitude. And as usual we will be carrying on with

the  same  number of staff, although  we  shall  be

recruiting  new  staff who will  not  come  to  the

establishment  until  some time  after  April  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Mountbatten, there is no

doubt that he is very observant and alert. Probably

he goes to Middle Road rather frequently to be able

to notice that there is some work being carried out

at  the R.O.V. premises there. It is true that some

alteration work is going on, but that is to convert

existing quarters into offices, for which a  tender

for  $21,000 has been accepted. Only a part of  the

Registry is expected to move over to Sin Ming  Road

in  September/October  this  year,  and  the  first

movement  will  be  the  Motor  Vehicle  Inspection

Centre   where   all  vehicles  can   be   properly

inspected.  The  bulk will still remain  in  Middle

Road  until  such  time  as  we  can  come  to   an

understanding  with  the Urban Renewal  Department,

which is eyeing the R.O.V. Middle Road site. It  is

only  after all these matters have been  agreed  to

that  we are in a position to say, "Yes, the  whole

Registry can now move over to Sin Ming Road."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Member himself will agree to the

$21,000  expenditure  on  renovations,  which  will

enable  our  staff to work under  better  and  more

desirable  conditions. After all, the  Registry  of

Vehicles gets an annual income of $60 million,  and

$21,000 is chicken feed really.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten also asked for

information on the Sin Ming Road site. At this  new

Motor  Vehicle Inspection Centre, there will be  10

inspection pits as compared with only six  pits  at

Middle  Road. That means an increase of four.  This

Inspection   Centre,   together   with   its    own

administrative office, stores, etc., will occupy  a

total  floor area of over 20,000 square  feet.  But

the total land area that will be made available  to

the  proposed Registry of Vehicles offices will  be

2.37 acres. So at present we are really building on

only  one  part of the area that has been earmarked

for the Registry of Vehicles. There will also be  a

car park to accommodate over 40 vehicles at any one

time,  and we have the capacity to carry out 63,000

proper  vehicle inspections per year. I  think  the

Member asked how many inspections could be made per

day.  At  63,000 inspections per year, it  will  be

about  200 inspections per working day. This number

can  be increased to 100,000 inspections per  year,

as there are possibilities of future expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a little bit of the background to the

present Middle Road site. It was built way back  in

1930, and it occupies an area of over 30,000 square

feet.  These  premises are situated in the  central

city area, and there is no space for expansion.  As

I   have  said,  with  only  six  inspection  pits,

vehicles have to queue up for inspection, and quite

often  there  is  serious congestion  along  Middle

Road,  Bencoolen Street, and the roads  surrounding

the  R.O.V.  Because of this, we have to  think  of

moving  out  of the city area into the suburbs.  At

present the Inspection Centre is planned to  handle

only 36,000 inspections a year. But last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>



year   there   were  as  many  as  78,000   cursory

inspections, which means that the vehicles were not

really  thoroughly checked. They were just given  a

quick  look-over, and then off they went. Moreover,

these  inspections were confined to public  service

vehicles, buses, taxis, and goods vehicles. That is

why this vote is a fairly urgent requirement, as it

is  necessary  for  us  to get  on  with  this  new

building which we hope to be able to move  into  in

five months' time, i.e. September this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, in view of the

Minister's explanation. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 31 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 302.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I merely wish to

seek  clarification of the New  Postal  Stores  and

Garages at Clementi Road. I note that for the  last

financial  year there was a provision of  $400,000,

and  there  is a footnote to indicate a  revote  of

$150,000  subject to Development Planning Committee

sanction.  So doing simple arithmetic, I find  that

only  $27,000 is further required to  make  up  the

provision  of  $177,000 asked for  in  the  ensuing

fiscal  year.  I shall be grateful if the  Minister

for  Communications will be kind  enough  to  throw

some light on the New Postal Stores and Garages.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a

good explanation for the reduction in the vote from

$400,000  for the last financial year  to  $177,000

for  the ensuing year. I think it is a good example

for  all  concerned to know that, although  we  may

have  a  rather large vote to draw from, we  always

give  due consideration to the fact that if we  can

get what we want at a cheaper price, it is our duty

to  choose the cheaper alternative, provided we  do

not lose by doing so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in this case was this. In 1969 the

Master  Plan Committee recommended that new  postal

stores  and  postal garages should be  built  on  a

three-acre  site  at  Tannery Lane.  The  site  was

allocated  by  the Commissioner  of  Lands  to  the

Postal Services Department on 8th September,  1969,

and  a  provision of $400,000 was included  in  the

1970-71  Development Estimates  for  this  purpose.

However,  because  of the high  estimated  cost  of

building  the  new  postal stores  and  garages  at

Tannery  Lane, the department looked for a  cheaper

alternative  and  approached  the  Bases   Economic

Conversion  Department  in May  1970  for  suitable

stores and garages which were being vacated by  the

British  Military  Forces. The  B.E.C.D. indicated

that  No. 4 Sub Depot, 3BOD, at 7¼ m.s. West  Coast

Road/Clementi Road, where there were stores  and  a

garage complex with a covered storage area of  over

90,000 square feet, was available and it agreed  to

release  to  the  Postal Services  Department  just

three  of  the  store buildings, not all,  together

with  the open area around it, which cover a  total

area  of  over 30,000 square feet. The  two  Nissen

huts  there  will be converted into postal  stores,

garages,  workshops, and parking areas. Because  of

this alternative, the Postal Department decided  to

relinquish the three-acre site at Tannery Lane.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the conversion of part of the West Coast

Road/Clementi Road facilities into postal stores, a

sum  of $47,000 was approved by the D.P.C, and  the

D.P.S.C.  (Development Planning  Sub-Committee)  in

1970.  Conversion  work,  which  is  currently   in

progress, is expected to be completed by the end of

April.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the architect in charge, the total

progress payment during the financial year  1970-71

is   expected  to  amount  to  only  $20,000   and,

therefore, there will be a revote of $27,000 in the

1971-72 Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the postal garages, which are also to

be  shifted  to  the West Coast Road/Clementi  Road

location,  conversion work is expected to  commence

in the early part of the next financial year. A sum

of  $150,000 is included in the 1971-72 Development

Estimates  for  this project. So the two  together,

$27,000  plus  $150,000, give  a  gross  figure  of

$177,000.  This  therefore means that  there  is  a

great saving of over $230,000, and this is for  the

good of the country.

Sir,  if I may refer to the Hansard of 26th  March.

1970, Vol. 29, col. 1189, in which the Minister for

Communications quoted the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>



second paragraph at page 4, Head 51 - Civil Aviation - of the Memorandum on the Development Estimates of

Singapore (Misc. 2 of 1970). He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The major project will be the redevelopment of

the  Passenger  Terminal Building, for  which  $3.0

million is provided. This project is scheduled  for

completion by late 1971.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following those remarks, the Minister was kind

enough  to  indicate the facilities that  would  be

available as a result of the redevelopment of  this

terminal.  Today  this  House  is  being  asked  to

approve a sum of nearly $2 million to complete this

project.  I  would  like to ask the  Minister  what

progress has been made on the redevelopment of  the

Passenger  Terminal Building. In  addition  to  the

facilities  he indicated last year, what additional

facilities will be available? For example,  matters

like  the  delay  in the handling  of  baggage  was

brought   up  last  year  and  the  Minister   then

indicated to the House that steps would be taken to

ensure that baggage handling would be much quicker.

I do hope that this is so today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also brought up a point about the transit

lounge in the terminal building. I had occasion  to

visit  the  transit lounge and I noticed  that  the

facilities  are still quite inadequate even  though

there  are  some  tax-free  shops  sited  in   this

redeveloped terminal building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be grateful if the Minister will

enlighten  this  House on the  type  of  facilities

which will be available, because I also notice that

in  his  reply last year he did indicate  that  the

Passenger Terminal Building would be handling about

three  million passengers. In other words, this  is

three  times  the number of passengers  handled  in

1970.  In this respect, I shall be grateful if  the

Minister can comment on my remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will try

to  provide  the "oral answers" asked  for  by  the

Member  for  Sembawang. I should have thought  that

there  must be questions tabled before there  could

be  oral  answers! However, I will try my  best  to

provide  the  information in detail. I believe  the

Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



asked   when  the  present  redevelopment  of   the

Passenger  Terminal  Building  is  expected  to  be

completed.  The answer is September of  this  year.

This  is just about six months from now, when this

project should be completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next question was whether there will be

closed-circuit  television  and  a  public  address

system.  There  will  always be  a  public  address

system.  In  fact, this morning's  paper  announced

that the new mushroom-shaped information counter is

already  in  use from today. Our airport  hostesses

will  be  there to serve Members if they  have  any

queries to ask.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for closed-circuit television, we have decided

not  to  install  this. What we  have  in  mind  is

something more expensive. It will cost about half a

million   dollars  and  works  on  the   electronic

principle  and  will provide information  regarding

the  movements of aircraft, expected  arrivals  and

departures and so on. They will appear on something

like a television screen and this is supposed to be

an  improvement  on  the  old-style  closed-circuit

television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question was, when will the first Jumbo

jet  land in Singapore? All this while we have been

planning  on  the basis of the Australian  Airline,

Qantas, starting the Jumbo jet service from  Sydney

to  London.  It  was scheduled to be  September  or

October of this year. But they have been beaten  to

it  by  an  American Airline, Pan-American Airways,

which  is  expected to inaugurate the thrice-weekly

San Francisco/Singapore service on the 26th of next

month.  The  first Jumbo jet landing  in  Singapore

will  therefore  be 26th of April. The  plane  will

come  all the way from San Francisco. This  is  six

months ahead of schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of passengers in the Jumbo

jet,  fortunately I have gone inside one  of  these

Jumbo  jets before they started to fly. I  went  to

the factory when the first Jumbo jet rolled out.  I

was  two  days behind time, otherwise I would  have

been  present at the ceremony in Seattle  in  1968.

The  plans  are that most airlines would carry  360

passengers, but some airlines would like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



to  have 450 or 500 passengers. For the time being,

all  the  airlines operate on the basis of  perhaps

362  passengers. However. I will stick to  360  for

the  time  being. That answers all the  four  "oral

questions"  asked  by the Member for  Sembawang.  I

hope I have answered them to his satisfaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Punggol, he says that

there has been a reduced vote for the redevelopment

of  the  Passenger  Terminal  Building.  I  beg  to

disagree  with him. For the financial year 1970-71,

it  was $3 million. For the financial year 1971-72,

there  is  a provision of $4.8 million.  There  has

been an increase and not a decrease.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I said "increase".



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am sorry. I thought I heard

the  Member  say  a decrease. I hope  he  supports

this increase



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I support it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Good, I thank him very much.

Once  the  redevelopment of the Passenger  Terminal

Building is effected - as I have said, it  will  be

totally  completed  in  September  1971  -all   the

problems  and  complaints of  slowness  in  baggage

clearance  will  be  solved.  There  will  be   new

equipment installed for faster movement of baggage.

The transit lounge will be expanded. It is only six

months  from now when everything will be completed,

and  I shall then invite the Member for Punggol and

the  Member for Sembawang to go for a little  visit

to  the airport and we can have tea to celebrate it -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And lunch!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> And lunch may be thrown in -- to

test the restaurant service there to see whether it

satisfies the two Members. That will then be a much

happier  time to answer all the questions to  their

satisfaction.  The  facilities  in  the   Passenger

Terminal Building will be improved. When everything

is completed, I will invite the two Members to come

along  with  me  and, of course,  my  Parliamentary

Secretary will also be interested, and we will  all

go and have a look around.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I think the Minister for

Communications  has  not  answered  a  part  of  my

question, that is, the increase of $1.8 million. To

what  use  has  this $1.8 million  been  channelled

apart from the redevelopment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Perhaps I have to give him

more details, if that is what he wants. Perhaps the

calculation  was  a little underestimated  and  the

cost has moved up a bit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> There should be economy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> We practise economy when it is

necessary,  but sometimes the cost  moves  up.  For

example, the cost of equipment is $l 1/2 million,  but

at  the time the estimates were drawn, it was  $1.2

million. You will then have to provide for  another

$300,000. There is no alternative.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Fair enough.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> May I say that the

redevelopment  of  the Passenger Terminal  Building

was  put  at  an  estimated cost of  $6.4  million.

Tenders for the project were called on the 12th  of

June  and  the contract that was awarded was  $5.87

million for building work alone. I suppose that  is

how costs have moved up. The new Passenger Terminal

Building  will  have double the capacity  in  floor

space  as compared with the existing one. So  there

will be twice as much room to move around.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 33 be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vote is $400,000 for radio

communications equipment for the offshore industry.

I  have two questions to ask the Minister. Firstly,

when  will  this service be implemented?  Secondly,

what  kind  of  revenue can be  derived  from  this

service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the special

vote    of   $400,000   for   establishing    radio

communications equipment for the off-shore industry

is  to meet the rather large needs of the off-shore

industry  in Singapore. They are being catered  for

at  present,  of  course, by our so-called  medium-range  maritime radio telephone service. There  has

been  considerable development since 1968 when  the

off-shore  industry  decided to  establish  various

offices  in  Singapore. For example, in 1967  there

were  only  677  calls.  In  1968,  it  practically

doubled to 1,331. In 1969, it shot up to 3,807. And

last  year,  there  were  6,228  calls.  There  has

therefore been an increase of 10 times in the  last

three  years. About 90 per cent of these calls  are

directly   or  indirectly  due  to  the   off-shore

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there were the usual complaints of

delay   in  meeting  their  requirements.  So   our

Telecommunications  Department  decided   to   have

special  discussions with representatives from  the

oil industry. That was done last year. Two meetings

were  held  and it was then decided  to  provide  a

special  high-quality radio communications  network

exclusively  for  the off-shore oil  industry.  The

network, for which we are now asking for a vote  of

$400,000, is really part of a number of phases. The

whole project will come to $1.3 million spread  out

over  five years. Phase One will cost $800,000  and

the  sum  of  $400,000 is included in  next  year's

estimates  so that we can slowly build it  up  into

something  much bigger. This network  is  timed  to

come into operation in early 1972, and will provide

very     high     grade,    almost    cable-quality

communication, which means to say that it  will  be

free of interference and very clear signals will be

obtained through this special network.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the cost effectiveness of this

expenditure,  i.e., whether we are going  to  spend

all  this  money  and what about the  returns,  the

Telecommunications Department  is  working  on  the

basis  of an economic service, which means that  we

provide a service but we make sure that at the same

time  we  also  make money. We are not  part  of  a

social service where money goes out and very little

is  received in return. If we provide large capital

sums  for establishing a service, we expect returns

which will make it not only economically viable but

also  profitable,  both  for  the  users  and   for

ourselves.  We  believe  that  the  annual   costs,

including staff salaries, maintenance, depreciation

of  equipment and other overheads, will  be  around

$100,000  per annum. But the revenue we  expect  at

the  rate  matters  are  developing  can  well   be

$330,000  per  annum. I think it is a  fairly  good

business. We spend about $100,000 per annum and  we

should  be  getting over $300,000  as  revenue  per

annum.  I  think  that is why we  had  the  Finance

Ministry's approval for this project.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank the

Minister  for  his  answer  and  I  beg  leave   to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 33 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 401.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment. I merely wish to

draw the Minister's attention to the complaints  by

businessmen  and  others  who  find  it   extremely

difficult  to  book international telephone  calls.

According to the telephone directory, if one wishes

to book an international call, all one has to do is

to dial 908. But it is becoming extremely difficult

to  get  even this number, let alone get  the  call

through to another country. I hope the Minister for

Communications will care to look into  this  matter

and remedy the situation, because I believe that  a

lot of business can be done and is being done as  a

result of telephone exchanges between Singapore and

other countries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, it is conceded that there

has  been some justification for the complaints  by

the    public    against   our   Telecommunications

Department.  There is really no excuse,  but  there

are  certain circumstances which I hope the  Member

for  Punggol and members of the public will be able

to   accept.   When  debating  the   Estimates   of

Expenditure  last  week,  we  have  explained   the

difficulties the Telecoms Department has  to  face.

First, we have a high vacancy position of 9  to  10

per  cent, and the existing staff have to cover  up

for the deficiency of staff. It is all very well if

development  work is going on at the normal  tempo,

and   so   forth.  In  the  case  of  the  Telecoms

Department, it is doing a very fine job coping with

what  goes on in the commercial world, because more

business   is   transacted,   more   requests   for

telephones,  telex, international  telephone  calls

are  made.  Our range of development is spectacular

and  much  too rapid for the staff or the equipment

that we have, and therefore when businessmen try to

put  through  calls,  there is congestion.  And  so

there   is  delay.  Naturally  this  brings   about

complaints.  Under  these  circumstances,  a   high

vacancy  position  of  9 to  10  per  cent  and  an

exceedingly  high rate of demand for  our  services

have,  together, compounded the situation and  made

it appear to be worse than before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last week I assured the Member for Telok Blangah, who raised a query about gross overtime and so much time off that the Telecommunications staff could not really make use of it, that I was very confident that things should improve this year with the very large recruitment

of  staff.  A  doubting Thomas, he did not  believe

that anything could be improved this year. I should

like  to  tell him that we have taken a  number  of

steps  to  improve the situation. For example,  the

exchange  capacity at any one time for simultaneous

calls,  now put at 62, will be increased to  88  in

the  middle  of May. That is why we are asking  for

this provision of $39,200. This represents only the

first phase of an extension



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



programme which was started way back in 1967 with a

capacity of only 55 calls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By early 1972, the second phase will begin to

increase  the  capacity to 118 calls.  Furthermore,

there   will   be   no  shortage  of  international

channels,  because our Earth Satellite  Station  at

Sentosa,  which  we hope will be operational  later

this  year,  will have a capacity of 132  telephone

channels. So the capacity is suddenly doubled and I

suppose  it  should be adequate for the foreseeable

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. I have explained that the Public

Service   Commission   has  already   completed   a

recruitment  exercise  to fill  vacancies  for  the

financial year 1970-71, which is soon coming to  an

end,  and  in  addition we have  done  a  projected

increase  in  staff  for  next  year.  So  all  the

additional  posts should be filled and  the  second

half  of  1971  should  be  a  good  year  for  the

Telecommunications    Department,    with     fewer

complaints and more men to staff the positions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another matter which has not been given much

limelight  has been the great inadequacies  of  the

department  because of lack of proper training.  In

October last year we were able to start a temporary

training centre at No. 8, Stevens Road, and  I  had

the pleasure of performing the opening ceremony The

International  Telecommunications  Union  has  been

approached and, with the assistance of finance from

the United Nations Development Programme, they will

shortly  be providing us with two experts who  will

be  lecturing on technical subjects,  and  a  third

expert will be responsible for overall training co-ordination and development.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have this proper training school, crash

courses will be conducted. All the new intakes will

be  required  to  undergo this  training  and  they

should  be available to man positions in the second

half  of this year. These are all the measures that

are  in  hand,  and  I hope they will  improve  the

situation in the second half of 1971.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of Educational Television

to  schools has come about some time ago and I wish

to seek some information from the Minister of State

for  Education, or the Parliamentary  Secretary  to

the  Minister for Education, as to what  evaluation

studies  have been undertaken in this respect;  how

much  benefit  school  children  are  getting  from

attending E.T.V. lessons; and how many schools  are

involved.  This  takes  my mind  back  to  a  short

exchange  between  my  colleague,  the  Member  for

Katong, and the Minister for Education regarding an

E.T.V. programme which the Member saw.  It  is  in

that spirit that I am asking such questions.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the overall picture of reactions  to

E.T.V. is  compounded from the regular  evaluation

returns  made each week by a statistical sample  of

schools. The programmes in general are accepted  by

teachers  as  providing a good deal of  useful  and

positive  criticism  of  individual  progress.  For

instance,   the  series  on  Science  and   English

Language  are  particularly well  received,  taking

note of the criticisms received. The latest returns

show  that  96.5 per cent of our secondary  schools

and 75.8 per cent of our primary schools are making

full  use  of  our  E.T.V. programmes.  Of  course,

programming for primary schools, as we know,  is  a

pilot project initiated from January 1971.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I thank the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



Education  for his reply. I understand that  E.T.V.

has  also  made some films which have  won  awards.

Will  it  or will it not be possible for E.T.V. to

concentrate  more  on the type  of  lessons  to  be

introduced  into secondary or primary schools  than

to  try  to produce a film with the idea of getting

an  international award? I am not saying that it is

no  good.  What I am trying to imply is  that  more

energy  should be channelled towards the  education

of school children rather than to try to produce  a

film  for international competition. From  time  to

time  we  read  in the papers that E.T.V. has  won

awards far and wide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not very happy with the answer given by the

Parliamentary Secretary regarding the percentage of

primary schools participating in E.T.V. lessons. It

is  not  100 per cent. He mentioned that  75.8  per

cent of our primary schools are making full use  of

the E.T.V. programmes. In the secondary schools  it

is  also  not even a 100 per cent. In other  words,

there  is still room for tremendous improvement  on

the   part  of  E.T.V.  I  hope  the  Parliamentary

Secretary will care to comment on this.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ghazali:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take

note  of  the suggestion put forward by the  Member

for  Punggol. It is true that our E.T.V. is  making

films  for competition. I would like to inform  the

winning  entry, The power of words,  was  a  poetry

programme for secondary two pupils, and E.T.V. won

another  special prize the following  year  in  the

are  not specially made for participation in  those

produced by E.T.V., and because they think that the

quality  of  the  production  is  very  good,  they

therefore   choose  one  of  them  to   enter   the

competition.  I  am  quite sure that  they  produce

these programmes for telecasting to our schools and

not  really  especially with the  aim  of  entering

international competitions in mind.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker. Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by 510 in respect of subhead 203.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University is a university built by the

community   and   financially  supported   by   the

Government.  If it is our hope that the development

of  the University will be in keeping with reality,

then  the  Government should give massive financial

support to the more urgent development plans of the

University.  I refer to students' hostels  and  the

sports complex which are not receiving full support

from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University has recently established

honours   classes,   post-graduate   classes    and

provisional  classes.  As  a  result,  the  student

population has increased. This year the  number  of

students



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>



from  Malaysia  has  increased  by  about  a

hundred, and the provisional classes' enrolment has

increased  from  77  to 150. In  keeping  with  the

changing  circumstances and  its  own  development,

Nanyang  University will strive to absorb  students

beyond    Singapore   and   Malaysia.   In    these

circumstances, the development of students' hostels

is   most   pressing.  If,  because  of   technical

problems,  the Ministry of Education is  unable  to

give  immediate financial aid to Nanyang University

to  build  students' hostels,  it  will  delay  the

development of the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, there are about 2,000

students and teaching staff at the University.  Yet

there is not a single sports stadium. No doubt  the

Government  has allotted about $700,000  last  year

for  the  development  of  a  sports  complex,  but

because  of  underestimation or some error  in  the

estimation,  Nanyang  University  asked  for   $1.2

million instead, but this was not approved  by  the

Ministry  of  Education.  In  order  to  meet   its

pressing needs, the University has come out with  a

compromise  proposal  to  build  an  indoor  sports

stadium  and  a swimming pool first. However,  this

compromise  proposal has also not been accepted  by

the  Ministry of Education. The sum of $700,000 has

been  allotted, but Nanyang University cannot  make

use of it because of this difficulty at the moment.

We  must realise that the University wants a sports

complex,  not the $700,000. The Education  Ministry

has  already given, free of charge and without  any

bargaining,  a  library  to Nanyang  University.  A

promise to aid is a promise to be executed  to  the

end.  So the Ministry must similarly give a  sports

complex too. Only thus will people believe that the

Ministry  is not placing importance on intellectual

pursuits only at the expense of physical education.

At  present, we are in dire need of P.E. or  sports

teachers, because there is no such institution.  So

the  Nanyang  University sports complex  should  be

able   not  only  to  contribute  to  our  national

sporting  activities  but  also  to  train  up  the

necessary P.E. teachers for the various streams  of

education.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Member for Delta

in  his  amendment. In my view, as a  graduate  of

Nanyang  University, it is my wish  that  my  alma

mater  will  improve all the time. As  a  Chinese-educated person, I will always bear in mind what I

have  obtained from Nanyang University. Therefore,

I  urge  the Government to give the same treatment

to  it as it gives to the University of Singapore.

The  two  universities have different origins  and

backgrounds, but they are, after all, our national

universities.  The students and  graduates  turned

out  by  both of them are the human resources  of

our country.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier in this House we heard from the Minister for Science and Technology, in reply to questions raised, that the Government is spending a lot of money on the development of the University of Singapore. It was a very rosy picture painted by the Government. It is,

therefore, my hope that the Government  will  give

similar treatment to Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Nanyang University happens to be in my

constituency  and,  therefore,  the  question   of

students'  hostels  concerns  and  interests   me.

Because of the lack of hostels, the students  have

to  lodge  in the cottages and attap huts  in  the

vicinity of the University. Those students who are

unable  to get accommodation have to stay  a  good

distance  away from the University. They  have  to

spend  a  lot of money and time commuting  between

their homes and the University. Sir, I am sure you

will agree that, because of a shortage of hostels,

the  students  suffer  great inconvenience.  Their

studies  are  also affected because of  this.  The

construction  of  students'  hostels  in   Nanyang

University is a matter of great urgency and should

be carried out forthwith.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Nanyang University has all the land it

needs,  and  there is no problem  of  getting  it.

Since the University has the land and the need for

students' hostels is so urgent, we hope that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



Minister will give the money straightaway to  the

University authorities to build them.  I  am  sure

that  Members  in  this House  will  support  this

allocation in the Development Estimates, and  will

also support a supplementary vote for this purpose

if it is found necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the staff quarters are estimated to cost

about  $2.8 million, but the Government  has  only

allocated $500,000, which is less than one-quarter

of the actual estimate. Therefore, I would like to

ask  the Minister whether the Government is giving

full  support  to  this plan,  or  whether  it  is

implementing it in stages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have always said that we are trying to

build  a rugged society but the Government is  not

giving  full support to the building of  a  sports

complex  in Nanyang University. This is  a  matter

for  regret.  As  far  as I know,  the  Government

department concerned has already estimated that  a

sports  complex of this nature will require  about

$1.2  million.  This  being  so,  why  cannot  the

Ministry of Education be generous enough  to  give

all  the money required and let Nanyang University

have its sports complex? The land for this complex

has  been levelled, but construction work has  not

yet  begun. So I hope the Minister will reconsider

the  vote  for  the  sports  complex  for  Nanyang

University.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I rise to

speak  in full support of the views raised  by  my

two  colleagues,  the Member  for  Delta  and  the

Member for Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that in respect of

subhead 203, with regard to the sports complex for

Nanyang  University, we are asked  to  revote  the

1971-72  provision against the 1970-71  provision.

In other words, last year this House already voted

a  sum  of $700,000 to set up a sports complex  in

Nanyang University, and today this House has to be

asked  to revote $692,000. I would be grateful  if

the   Minister   of  State  for  Education   could

enlighten  this  House  on  why  this  revote   is

necessary.  The money was already  voted  for  and

ought to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



been  spent.  If the money had been spent,  my  two

colleagues  who,  I  believe,  come  from   Nanyang

University,  would  have  no  squabble   with   the

Ministry  of  Education. I can understand  why  the

Member  for Jurong wants more money. It is quite  a

reasonable request, because he has some very strong

grounds  for  it, and I am with him on this  point.

And if I may draw the attention of the Minister  of

State   to  page  4  of  the  Memorandum   on   the

Development Estimates, para. 25 under Head 41, the

intention is extremely clear:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A sum of $2.85 million is provided for the new

Raffles Institution...'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if Raffles Institution, which is a secondary

school,  can get $2.85 million, why cannot  Nanyang

University,  which is a university, get  the  money

asked  for?  And why must we come here to  grant  a

revote?  I would urge the Member for Delta,  should

he   get  an  unsatisfactory  reply,  to  put   his

amendment to the vote.

for  Delta, who is a member of a certain committee,

should be aware of the delicate situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as 1969, the Ministry of Education was

already  aware of the problem of students'  hostels

for Nanyang University. In August of that year, the

Ministry   made   certain  proposals   to   Nanyang

University to rent a block of flats in Jurong  Town

for   use  as  students'  hostels,  for  which  the

Ministry  was prepared to allot a sum  of  $58,000.

Perhaps the Member for Delta was aware of this. But

in  February 1970, Nanyang University rejected this

proposal.

The  question of students' hostels has been brought

up  for  reconsideration, and the new  proposal  is

under  active  consideration  by  the  Ministry  of

Education. After the technical problems  have  been

solved, we shall proceed with the construction work

forthwith.   Meanwhile  the  Government   is   also

discussing  with  the Jurong Town  Corporation  the

possibility of renting one 16-storey block of flats

for use as a students' hostel. I believe the Member

for  Delta and the Member for Jurong are aware that

the  Council  of Nanyang University  have  recently

started a campaign to raise funds with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>



a  target of $2 million, part of which is meant for

building a students' hostel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the question of a sports complex, as

early  as 1969 Nanyang University proposed  to  the

Ministry  of Education a plan for a sports  complex

costing  $620,000. After consideration the Ministry

counter-proposed with a $700,000 plan.  They  asked

for  $620,000  and we gave them $700,000!  In  this

plan  the  facilities included a swimming pool  and

other    amenities.   But   subsequently    Nanyang

University  wanted  to  make  amendments   to   the

original  proposal by including the building  of  a

stadium. The amendments would require a further sum

of  $500,000 making the total cost of the plan $1.2

million. This matter is now under consideration  by

the  Ministry  of  Education and  the  Ministry  of

Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol asked why a revote of

$692,000  is asked for, when we have already  voted

$700,000 for the last financial year. I am not able

to  answer  this  fully. However, we  have  already

allotted the money to the University, and it is  up

to  them  to spend it. One of the reasons  for  not

spending it could be that the plan for $1.2 million

is  still  under  consideration. You  cannot  first

build  a sports complex costing $700,000, and  then

decide to build another one for $1.2 million. So we

must  wait for the overall planning to be completed

before  we can proceed with the construction.  That

is  one of the reasons why a revote is being  asked

for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Jurong also asked why we

do   not   have  a  development  plan  for  Nanyang

University. The University authorities have already

set   up   a   committee  to  prepare  a   ten-year

development  plan  of Nanyang University.  When  we

receive these development plan proposals, we  shall

be  able  to  give more details to the  Member  for

Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the staff quarters, Nanyang University

asked  for about $2 million for their construction.

I  think the Member for Delta has already said that

the most important matter is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>



development  of  a sports complex and  a  students'

hostel.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  a point of clarification. The Minister of State

for  Education has said just now that since I am  a

member of the teaching staff of Nanyang University,

I   should  be  aware  of  the  position   in   the

University.  As an ordinary lecturer, I  cannot  go

round   Nanyang  University  asking   for   details

regarding the position of the University because if

I  were  to  do  so,  I would be called  up  by  the

Minister  for Education and asked why I should  put

my finger into every pie



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was Nanyang University which first

proposed  a  plan  for the sports  complex  costing

$620,000.  But  after a review made by  the  Public

Works Department, it was increased to $700,000. But

on   further,  reconsideration,  $1.2  million   is

actually required. I do not know whose fault it is.

Since  a  provision of $1.2 million has been  asked

for and since the Minister of State agrees with  me

that  these  two  items are important  and  require

urgent  attention,  I wish to  know  why  immediate

approval is not given for this money.

made  as late as February this year. We are now  in

purposes  the fund will be put before consideration

comes?  Just  now  we have had a  very  interesting

debate  in  which  one of the Ministers  said  that

evaluation  was all wrong. I am not  an  economist,

and  frankly  I  do not know. However,  I  am  very

spent  and why this House is today being  asked  to

As  at  the end of last month work on the  building

has  reached the 13th floor. This means that 52 per

cent of the project has been completed. In February

this  year, a total of $410,000 was paid  out  from

the sum provided for the project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also answer the other questions raised by

the  Member  for Punggol? The capital cost  of  the

Regional English Language Centre has been estimated

at  $6.6  million. It is being financed jointly  by

the  United  States  Government and  the  Singapore

Government,  with Singapore contributing  $600,000.

In  addition,  Singapore is  responsible  for  land

acquisition, amounting to $200,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also inform the House that the building

consists   of  16  storeys,  and  currently   under

consideration is a proposal to add two more storeys

to  the  building to make it altogether 18 storeys.

The  additional  cost to be borne by  Singapore  is

expected  to  be  $275,000, subject to  Development

Planning Committee sanction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I also inform the House that the

date  of completion of the building is expected  to

be December 1971.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want

to  clarify that the capital cost of the  Regional

English  Language Centre is being financed  jointly

by the Singapore Government and the South-east Asia

Ministers of Education Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am very grateful that the

Minister of State for Education has come in at this

juncture, because I have been doing a little bit of

calculation  here. The Parliamentary  Secretary  to

the  Minister for Education has mentioned that  the

total  project will cost $6.6 million, of which  $6

million   will   come   from  the   United   States

Government.  We  have just heard interjection  from

the  Minister of State. I do not know how  the  two

statements  in  this  respect  are  going   to   be

reconciled.  It  is very clear in  the  Development

Estimates that the vote is for the Regional English

Language



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



Centre. To what extent will this money be used  for

the  Centre, bearing in mind that there has been  a

correction from the Minister of State and that  the

money  is coming from the South-east Asia Ministers

of  Education Council? In other words, a large  sum

of   American   dollars  is  being   brought   into

Singapore. I will leave Members to imagine  what  I

am driving at. But my interest is this: what is the

optimum  use to which the Regional English Language

Centre will be put?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

just  clarified, the other portion of  the  capital

cost  will  come  from  the  member  countries   of

S.E.A.M.E.C.  I do not understand the reference  to

American  dollars.  It  is a regional  project  and

Singapore  contributes a certain  portion  and  the

other member countries contribute their portions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the operation of the Centre, it is

used to train teachers in the English language.  So

far  about  six  or seven batches of students  have

been trained. The Centre is temporarily housed in a

Government  bungalow  in Watten  Estate.  When  the

building  is completed - I cannot recall the  exact

date  -  we  will  move to the new Centre.  As  the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Education  has  just mentioned, the  building  will

consist  of 18 storeys. The first few storeys  will

be for the Regional English Language Centre and the

top  ten  storeys will be in the form of a  60-room

hotel for those attending conferences and also  for

hostel facilities for students from the region.

* The amendment, which also stood in the name  of  Mr Ho Kah Leong, reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 401.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 301+



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note with dismay the amount which has been

allocated for new primary and secondary schools  in

the  Development Estimates. In my constituency many

parents  have difficulty in getting their  children

admitted to the schools near to their homes. At the

moment,  there are only three primary  schools  and

one  secondary school in the town proper.  We  have

talked about Toa Payoh being a self-contained  town

and  I  really wonder why the Ministry of Education

has   not  seen  fit  to  build  more  primary  and

secondary  schools in this constituency. There  are

about  14,000  children of primary school  age  and

10,000  children  of secondary school  age  in  the

whole  Toa  Payoh  Constituency. The  Minister  may

explain  that  there are other schools  around  the

outskirts  of the town, but under the new transport

system,  as  stated in the Wilson Report,  children

have  to travel more than three miles to reach  the

schools  outside Toa Payoh town proper. It is  also

stated in the report that there are 22 routes,  but

only  four of them pass through the schools outside

the  constituency, that is along Thomson  Road  and

Braddell  Road. Out of these four routes, only  one

route  has  a service at four-minute intervals  and

the  others are at 15-minute intervals. We can just

imagine  the inconvenience that will be  caused  to

the  children  travelling to  the  schools  in  and

around the area.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand there are several sites in Toa Payoh

town  reserved for schools. May I ask the  Minister

of   State   for  Education  or  the  Parliamentary

Secretary what steps are being taken to build  more

primary  and secondary schools in Toa Payoh?  Every

year  I  hear  a  lot  of  problems  from  parents,

particularly  towards the end of the year  and  the

beginning  of the year, when they ask for  transfer

of their children from schools in other areas.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully

appreciate the difficulty of the children. In fact,

it  is very much my concern to see that they do not

have  to travel too far to their schools. When  the

Member  for Toa Payoh was raising this question,  I

saw very approving nods from the Frontbenchers.  We

are  now  making  a  micro-analysis  based  on  the

population density of the nation as far as 1989, so

that  in  future  we  will site our  schools  where

students do not have to travel far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the particular point raised by

the  Member  for  Toa  Payoh,  we  are  considering

resiting  schools  which  are  affected  by   urban

renewal into densely populated areas where there is

an urgent need for schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment I would like to ask

the  Minister a simple question. We all  know  that

Jurong  Town  is  a  new town.  Its  population  is

increasing.  At  present, there  are  about  25,000

people  living in this town but there is  only  one

primary  school, unlike Toa Payoh town where  there

are  several schools. In this respect,  the  Member

for Toa Payoh is more lucky than I am. I would like

to  know whether the Ministry of Education has  any

plans  to  build a secondary school in Jurong  Town

and, if so, when?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, when I

replied  to the Member for Toa Payoh, I did mention

that the Ministry of Education is now considering a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>



long-term plan to build schools and priority will

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 402.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment I would like to ask

the  Minister of State about the extensions to  the

existing  Jurong Integrated Secondary School.  This

school in Jurong was set up in 1963. I am afraid it

is  the  smallest of the secondary schools  in  the

republic.   It  has  only  eight  classrooms,   one

laboratory and, of course, some toilets. There  are

no  other  facilities. It is just a  simple  school

with  simple facilities. Of course, one  laboratory

is not enough and so the facilities are inadequate.

In  spite  of  this, in the academic field  and  in

sports,   this   school  has  had   good   results,

especially in horticulture. For instance,  in  1969

and 1970, it was the champion school in a gardening

competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister of State

whether  the  Ministry of Education would  consider

allotting  more  funds for the  expansion  of  this

school. At the moment, there is an urgent need  for

one  more  laboratory and one  classroom  for  home

economics.  In  addition, the  school  needs  other

facilities,  such  as  a library  and  one  or  two

additional classrooms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is now paying attention to the

quality  instead of the quantity of  education.  In

this context, I would like the Minister to give his

comments on my request.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while it is

a tribute to the principal and the staff when their

school wins prizes, I am afraid this is not one  of

the  major considerations for expansion of schools.

However, in reply to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>



specific  request of the Member for Jurong  to  pay

attention  to  Jurong Integrated Secondary  School,

this  school  will  be under consideration  by  the

Ministry  of Education which is currently  studying

the plans which I have just mentioned.

details  of  the capital grants to Government-aided

schools. I note on page 4 of the Memorandum on  the

Development Estimates that the sum of $1.3  million

includes  the  Government's  contribution  to   the

be  provided  for  each college;  and  whether  the

construction of these junior colleges?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, there will be a total of

will commence on two some time this year, three  in

1972,  and  two in 1973. The Government will  match

the  funds  raised  by the voluntary  organisations

dollar  for  dollar, subject to  a  maximum  of,  I

believe, $1.1 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, my question is out of the

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, this $1 million is

on  the  density of the population, may I  ask  him

in Toa Payoh?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, there is no provision

for  building a vocational institution  within  Toa

Payoh.  But  all  new  secondary  schools   to   be

established will have a technical wing. At present,

Toa   Payoh  is  being  serviced  by  the  Aljunied

Vocational   Institute  and   the   Geylang   Serai

Vocational Institute which are about three and four

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hotel and Catering Training Centre was

previously under the Ministry of Labour, and it has

now  been transferred to the Ministry of Education.

I would like the Minister concerned to indicate the

number  of trainees who have been trained in  hotel

catering by this Centre, whether or not there  have

been cases where some graduates of this Centre have

been  sent for further training, and the number  of

graduates in the various categories.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I mean is that with the accelerated building

up  of the hotel industry, there is, to my mind, an

acute shortage of hotel staff. I wonder whether the

Hotel  and Catering Training Centre, when it  moves

into  new premises, will be able to cater  for  the

requirements of the hotel industry in the next  few

years. Also, will the Centre consider training  not

only   those  involved  in  waitering   and   other

services,  but  also  those  concerned  with  floor

management, that is, the supervisory and managerial

posts? We had occasion in this House to hear one of

the  Members  remark that working as attendants  in

wash-rooms  is  a  lucrative business.  Surely  the

Centre   should  train  our  youngsters  for   more

responsible positions in hotel catering  than  just

being  attendants in wash-rooms. I  sincerely  hope

the  Minister of State for Education will  care  to

comment on my remarks.

attendants whose job is much more lucrative!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centre does not send any graduates overseas

for   further  training.  I  believe  the  brighter

graduates from this Centre are being sent  overseas

by the industry which engage them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised by the Member is the acute

shortage  of  hotel catering staff and whether  the

Centre  will  be  able to meet the demand.  Between

1967, when the Centre was established, and now, the

number of hotel rooms has increased eleven-fold. It

is  hardly  possible  for the Centre  to  meet  the

sudden  large demand for hotel staff, but I believe

most  hotels are training their own staff. However,

when  the  new  Centre moves into new premises,  we

will  be  gradually  shifting our  emphasis  on  to

training the middle and higher levels of personnel,

leaving  the  training of waiters  and  waitresses,

stewards and stewardesses, room chambermaids,  etc.

to the hotel industry itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of pure numbers, the new Director

of  the  Centre arrived a month ago. In conjunction

with  the Adult Education Board, he is now  working

out a joint programme whereby the girls who are  in

the  special  classes  will  be  able  to  take  up

training  within the shortest possible  time  after

finishing the Adult Education Board programme. Part

of  the  training  will be provided  by  the  Adult

Education Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would  like to ask the Minister of State whether

the   Hotel   and  Catering  Training   Centre   is

contemplating starting a training scheme for cooks.

One of the problems which the hotels are faced with

today  is the shortage of cooks. Many of the  cooks

are  engaged  from foreign countries and  they  are

paid  exorbitant wages. Is there a scheme  to  meet

this shortage of cooks?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, there is at present a

two-year  course for the training of  cooks.  There

are  some 20 trainees at present. Since the  course

takes two years, we have not produced any graduates

as  yet.  So this figure was not mentioned  in  the

statistics which I gave just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, from what I can gather, the

new  Centre will be able to train about a  thousand

people  annually, but I wonder whether the Minister

of   State  will  clarify  what  the  criteria   of

selection will be if there is more than the  number

required  for the courses; in other words,  if  the

number of applicants exceeds the number per course.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, unfortunately the

response was not as good as we would like it to be.

Therefore,  generally, the criterion  is  not  very

strict.  In fact, the Ministry's Research Unit  has

conducted  a  survey  of  the  graduates  from  the

Centre,  and has discovered a very large turn-over.

One  of  the  reasons for this is that  the  Centre

aimed  for too high a qualification in the previous

training  scheme.  They only  took  in  girls  with

H.S.C. or  a  very good School Certificate.  As  a

result, the trainees never stayed in their jobs. In

fact,   one  does  not  need  a  Grade  One  School

Certificate  to  be  a room steward.  It  would  be

better to get someone who does not have a Grade One

School Certificate!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in view of the reply of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I have a simple and

straight-forward question to ask. I note  that  the

title  to  this subhead is "Conversion of Academic/

Vocational Schools into Bilateral Schools". I would

be  grateful if the Minister of State could  inform

this House what "bilateral schools" are.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must

apologise   for   the   term  "bilateral   schools"

appearing   in   the  Estimates  of   Revenue   and

Expenditure  (Paper  Cmd. 3), and  the  Development

Estimates  (Paper  Cmd. 4). This  is  a  term  used

administratively  within the Ministry  to  indicate

schools  which have a Technical wing as well  as  a

General  Education wing. In fact,  a  circular  has

been   sent   to   all  schools  instructing   them

henceforth  not  to  use such terms  as  "technical

schools",   "bilateral   schools",   "multi-lateral

schools",   "integrated  schools".  All   secondary

schools are henceforth known as secondary schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

of  State  has  taken the words out  of  my  mouth,

because  this  was what I was coming to!  I  notice

that  there has been a conversion of all  sorts  of

schools  - "bilateral", "trilateral" and what  not.

Anyway,  he has given a satisfactory answer  and  I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 802.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, we have the title "Conversion of

Vocational  Schools into Vocational Institutes".  I

do  not  know  what  is  the difference  between  a

vocational school and a vocational institute. When

I  cast  my  mind  back to last  year's  debate,  I

recollect that the Minister of State, who was  then

Parliamentary Secretary, did explain the  whys  and

wherefores  of these two institutions.  What  I  am

driving  at is this. Looking at the number  of  so-called  technical schools, vocational  schools  and

vocational  institutes that have been set  up  over

the  past  two years, I believe that  there  is  no

clear-cut policy on technical education. I hope the

Minister of State for Education will enlighten  the

House  on  this,  There  seems  to  be  a  lot   of

conversion.  We  are  treading  on  very  dangerous

ground by using children as guinea pigs in order to

find out which type of technical education will  be

most  suited to our conditions. Since the  emphasis

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



on   the   acceleration  of  our  industrialisation

scheme,  therefore there is a need for skilled  and

semi-skilled technicians. There has been a shift in

emphasis over the last two years. Whilst I  believe

this  shift  is correct, the Ministry of Education,

however, does not seem to have any clearly  defined

technical  education policy. I do not know  whether

the  Technical Education Department of the Ministry

of Education is aware of this fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started off with vocational schools for the

primary  six failures, keeping them in  school  for

two  years. Some courses were concocted. After some

time  the  scheme fell through. Then the  Education

Ministry  said,  "Well, put  them  into  vocational

institutes  and  teach them."  But  how?  They  did

acquire  some sort of skill. Later on the  Ministry

of  Education came up with another idea  and  said,

"Look,  now  we want the vocational schools  to  be

converted  into  vocational institutes."  But  Sir,

these  vocational institutes carried another  name.

They were called "Industrial Training Centres".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that the Technical Education

Department of the Ministry of Education  is  trying

to  mislead this House with regard to the technical

education policy. What I wish to know is what  sort

of   courses,  and  up  to  what  level  are   such

institutions giving? There is a saying "A  rose  by

any other name smells just as sweet" - but I do not

believe  that  this can be applied to the  schools!

There  is  the "bilateral school", the  "vocational

institute" and the "industrial training centre"! We

have  a lot of our young students who may not  have

the  intelligence to proceed to the purely academic

stream.  So  when  the  shift  comes  to  technical

education,  we have all sorts of institutes  called

by  all  sorts  of names. We have  to  ensure  that

whilst  we  put  up  such institutes,  the  courses

organised  must  be so designed as  to  enable  the

students  to obtain jobs that will be available  to

them.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I have in my constituency the

Ponggol Vocational Institute,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  the  item under this subhead should not  read

"Ponggol   Vocational  Institute",   but   "Ponggol

Industrial  Training Centre". What is unique  about

it  is this. I noticed that at the beginning it had

a  small name-plate put up near the fence, and  the

name  was  `Ponggol  Vocational School".  This  was

removed,   and  the  new  name  was  the   "Ponggol

Industrial  Training  Centre".  But  down  it  came

again.  I  do not know whether or not the  students

there  are  trying  to apply the skills  they  have

learnt  in this Industrial Training Centre. I  hope

the  Minister  of  State for  Education  will  take

serious  note of this, otherwise this will lead  to

very  serious trouble. We say that we have to  rely

on  semi-skilled and fully-skilled labour, and  yet

we cannot produce enough from such institutions. So

the  present situation is, as I believe Members  of

the  House are fully aware, that we have to  import

certain types of skills, even the common skills. In

other words, there should be a clear-cut policy  on

all  the  courses conducted, spelling out  whatever

level  of skills the courses are designed  for,  so

that  the parents when they think of sending  their

children to such institutions, will be rest assured

that  their children are going to acquire a certain

level of skill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I admire

the  Member  for Punggol for his deep understanding

of  the  history  of technical education.  I  would

like,  first  of all, to deal with the question  of

vocational schools, and then go on to the policy of

technical education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has very clearly pointed

out that the vocational schools were instituted  in

1960 to train those pupils who failed in Primary VI

for  a  certain  trade up to a semi-skilled  level.

That did not prove to be as successful as we wanted

it  to  be. When the Technical Education Department

was established in 1968, one of the first decisions

made  was  to  abolish the vocational schools.  So,

instead of taking in pupils who were thrown out  of

their  former  schools, we took in pupils  who  had

finished Secondary II for two years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



of  instruction, and let them acquire a  vocational

skill that is employable. This is on the same lines

as  those run by the Singapore Vocational Institute

at  Balestier  Road which, I  think,  is  a  well-established  institute and everyone knows  what  it

stands  for. The vocational institute is  to  train

semi-skilled  craftsmen; I would say craftsmen  who

have  the skill but not the experience. We  decided

to  convert  all vocational schools into vocational

institutes. This conversion commenced in  1969  and

is   continuing  to  this  day.  Since   1969   all

vocational schools have been abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol raised the question of the

Ponggol   Industrial  Training  Centre  which   was

originally  the  Ponggol  Vocational  School.   The

reason why it was changed to the Ponggol Industrial

Training  Centre was this: The Industrial  Training

Centre  was  first established to  provide  a  very

short  crash  programme  for training  semi-skilled

operatives,  not  craftsmen,  say  people  who  lay

bricks, plasters, plumbers, and so on. Their's is a

very  limited skill and requires only a very  short

training  period.  After  a  year's  operation,  we

decided  that  we should enlarge its activities  to

provide  not  only just short training courses  but

also  two-year training courses. With this in mind,

we  introduced  in 1969 the module training  scheme

that  integrates  all training  systems  under  one

single scheme. I shall touch on this later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the confusion arises because of this. In order to clear up the confusion, there must be more confusion to begin with. That is why in order to have all secondary schools called secondary schools, you begin with bi-lateral schools and integrated schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Technical Education Department do have a very

clear-cut policy on technical education,  and  this

is  stated  in the Second Annual Report  which  was

tabled in this House as Paper Cmd. 22 of 1970. Very

briefly  we separate the scheme into areas -  those

within the school and those outside the school. The

training  within  the  school  system  is  done  in

ordinary secondary schools which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>



have  a  technical department. The courses  have  a

higher   theoretical  content,  and   prepare   the

students  for examinations leading to  the  General

Certificate  of  Education,  Ordinary   Level   and

Advanced Level. The training for those outside  the

former  secondary school system is carried  out  in

vocational institutes. All the industrial  training

centres are being converted - I should not use  the

word  "converted" but rather "upgraded" to take  in

more machinery. It is not the same syllabus. If you

go  through the budget you will find that  actually

more  machinery has been provided so as to  improve

the  facilities  and  methods of  training  in  the

vocational institutes. The training programme is in

accordance  with the module training system,  which

is mentioned in the Report. It is widely adopted in

European countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it was recently adopted by the British.

The   Research  Department  did  a  very   thorough

research   of  all  the  technical  education   and

vocational  training  programmes  in  the   various

countries at various stages of development and,  as

a result of such an intensive study, they have come

out  with  this  module  training  scheme  for  our

vocational institutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that

respect,  I  wish to know whether the  Minister  of

State  for Education is able to indicate the number

of   graduates  who  have  passed  out  from   such

institutions, and whether they have  been  able  to

find employment. In other words, whether the skills

or  semi-skills which they have acquired from  such

institutions are adequate for the labour market.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer

to  the  question from the Member for Sembawang,  I

believe  I  did  mention that the capacity  in  the

secondary schools is 8,000 per year. But the output

of  the  vocational institutes will be raised  from

about 1,800 in 1970 to about 10,000 in 1980.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the point whether the graduates

have acquired employable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>



skills, the difficulty is for them to get deferment

from  national service to enable them  to  take  up

employment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I do not think that is the

answer.  I am not quite happy with it. The Minister

of State has quoted 1970 figures, but we know quite

well  that  these vocational institutes started  in

1969  and the Minister of State has mentioned short

courses.  In  other words, in the  course  of  time

there must have been a good number of students  who

have  passed  out from such institutes.  Therefore,

has  the  Ministry taken a closer look to  see  how

many of these students who have passed out have got

employment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, first of all, let us

take,  for example, the vocational institute nearer

to  the  Member  for  Punggol,  i.e.,  the  Ponggol

Vocational  Institute. One of the  difficulties  we

are  facing in respect of this particular programme

at  the  Ponggol Vocational Institute is  that  the

students  are required to go outside  and  work  in

industry  for three months, and they have  acquired

so much skill by then that they will not come back.

The  pay  is  so good! That is one difficulty.  The

other  example  I can think of is  in  the  welding

trade,  for  example. I think the biggest  training

institute  we have is the Pasir Panjang  Vocational

Institute,  and our graduates are booked  up  until

the end of next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, though I agree that there

is  an  institute  known as the Ponggol  Industrial

Training Centre sited in Punggol, I can safely  say

that more than 90 per cent of the students are  not

from  Punggol. However, I beg leave to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker.

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that over the past few years the Government has exerted great efforts in the promotion of technical education. This has been done in keeping with the requirements of our industrialisation policy. Because of this, many technical schools have been built all over

Singapore,  and  technical education  has  received

popular  support  from  the  parents  who  are  now

prepared   to  send  their  children  to  technical

schools  and  institutes.  This  is  a  matter  for

rejoicing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question is whether technical education

has been very effective, whether its programme has,

in  fact,  been able to provide the talent required

for  the  various  industries as a  result  of  our

development.  Therefore, I would like the  Minister

of State to answer five questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Since the establishment of the vocational

institutes and technical schools more  than  a

year  ago have there been any statistics taken

of   the  number  of  students  trained,   and

whether   they   have  been   able   to   find

employment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) With particular reference to the Singapore Technical Institute, when will it be

completed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What facilities are available at present, and

which   countries   supply   us   with    such

equipment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Up to the present moment are there adequate

technical   instructors  to  cope   with   the

requirements for technical education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) I would like to ask the Minister of State

this  question,  and that  is  whether  he  is

aware  that,  because of poor  maintenance,  a

lot   of   new  machinery  in  many  technical

schools  has  broken down. That  is  not  all. Nobody  is  able  to do the repairs.  This  is

actually  a  waste of public  funds.  I  would

like the Minister to take immediate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



action  to look into this matter and see  that

the   machinery  is  properly  maintained  and

repaired in case of break-downs.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Parliament has

been asked to approve a sum of $1.8 million for the

Singapore  Technical Institute.  From  what  I  can

gather  at  the present moment, this  Institute  is

sharing its premises, that is, workshops and  other

facilities, with another institute which, I believe

is  the  former  Junior Trade School  at  Balestier

Road.   The   Singapore  Technical   Institute   is

considered   an   institute  of  higher   technical

learning.   Why  should  it  share  its  workshops,

probably   classrooms  too,   with   a   vocational

institute? The Minister of State for Education  has

clearly explained just now the different levels  of

instruction  between the vocational institutes  and

the  schools.  I believe that there is  a  distinct

difference  between the level of instruction  in  a

vocational  institute and a technical institute.  I

suspect that the Singapore Technical Institute will

somehow be duplicating some of the courses  run  or

organised  by  the Polytechnic. In his  reply  last

year, the Minister of State clearly explained  that

there  was some duplication and he would see to  it

that  there would be none. In other words, if there

is  a  duplication of courses, what is  the  use  of

having  both  the  Polytechnic  and  the  Singapore

Technical Institute?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask is the level

of   instruction  which  the  Singapore   Technical

Institute  offers. The House has occasion  to  hear

just now of the training of semi-skills and skills.

What  kind  of skills will the Singapore  Technical

Institute provide?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

first answer the question which has been raised  by

the  Member  for Sembawang. The first part  of  his

question has been amply answered in my reply to the

Member  for Punggol in an earlier question. Perhaps

the  Member for Punggol may like to explain to  the

Member for Sembawang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Sembawang asked a question

about the output of graduates in 1968. I happen  to

have  the  figures  here. The  Technical  Education

Department  was established in 1968. The vocational

institutes produced 518 graduates in 1968,  400  in

1969 and the same number in 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Technical Institute, which was

formed in 1969, produced only the first batch of 96

graduates in February this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also asked when the

Singapore  Technical Institute will  be  completed.

Just  now on my way from the airport to this House,

I  did some counting of the storeys of the building

and  it  has  come up to the 10th floor.  They  are

putting  a roof on it. It should be completed  some

time this year. It is in MacPherson Road, in a very

clean environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about the facilities and

equipment.   These  are  provided  for   mechanical

engineering,  electrical engineering,  electronics,

refrigeration  and air-conditioning  and  furniture

production.  Most  of this equipment  is  purchased

overseas, particularly from the United Kingdom, as

this  Institute is being financed under the British

mitigatory aid scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next question is whether we have sufficient

teachers  for technical education to cope with  the

rapid  expansion in industry. The answer is no.  We

are  trying  our very best to train them.  We  hope

that  in about two years' time we shall be able  to

produce enough teachers. Unfortunately, in the case

of   technical  teachers,  we  cannot  have  relief

teachers. They must be properly trained. We will be

expecting  something  like  300  trained   teachers

coming  out  this year. One of the difficulties  we

are  facing  is that every time we finish  training

the teachers, the industries find that they are  so

well trained that they just grab them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> We can bond them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> This is a free country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I mean an education bond.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> With regard to the last

question about the maintenance of equipment, I hope

the  Member for Sembawang will appreciate that this

is  a  training institute. They are students.  They

are not skilled workers. They are being trained  to

be skilled workers, so that they cannot be expected

to be skilful in maintaining machinery. If they are

skilful  they should not be there for training.  We

can  expect more damage to be done to the machinery

there than in an ordinary workshop. As a result  of

the  frequent break-down in the machinery - in  the

past we always depended on the P.W.D. to repair  it

-  arrangements have been made with the Ministry of

Finance   to   establish  a  Central   Supply   and

Maintenance   Unit   in  the  Technical   Education

Department  to  carry  out  the  maintenance  work.

Skilled teachers are being assigned to this unit to

maintain the machinery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has asked why the

Singapore Technical Institute is temporarily housed

in  the Singapore Vocational Institute, and whether

this temporary arrangement will be of any good. Can

I take the Member for Punggol back to 1960? He will

recall  that  the present Vocational Institute  and

the Polytechnic were housed together under the same

roof in Prince Edward Road. In fact, in the case of

the  Polytechnic in London, they train people  from

semi-skilled level right up to Ph.D. in Engineering

under  the  same roof. The reason why the Singapore

Technical  Institute  is housed  in  the  Singapore

Vocational Institute is that, first, we  feel  that

there  is  a  need  for a supply of  what  we  call

industrial technicians. They are the lower level of

technicians.  There is a great need for  them  and,

therefore, we borrow the premises at the  Singapore

Vocational  Institute to make an early  start.  The

Singapore  Vocational Institute is about  the  best

equipped  institution we have, and since the  class

is small we have it there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has also asked whether

there  will  be  some duplication  of  instruction.

Duplication will be inevitable, Sir. The  Singapore

Polytechnic runs two types of courses, a three-year

Technician  course, which is called the engineering

technician,  and  a two-year Industrial  Technician

course, which is called the General Certificate  of

Industrial   Training.  The  course  run   at   the

Singapore  Technical Institute is similar  to  this

two-year course. I believe that at present there is

a   joint  committee  of  the  Singapore  Technical

Institute and the Singapore Polytechnic to work out

a  common scheme. I appreciate the concern  of  the

Member  for  Punggol  that as far  as  possible  we

should  not  duplicate, but since  the  demand  for

technicians  is so large, the Singapore Polytechnic

alone   will   not  be  able  to  train  sufficient

industrial technicians. Hence the establishment  of

the  Singapore  Technical Institute.  I  hope  that

answers the Member's question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, cannot the

Singapore Polytechnic conduct a diploma course at a

level higher than the ordinary technician level?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, coming to the point where the Minister

of  State  has  just now mentioned  that  when  the

Singapore  Technical  Institute  has  trained  some

instructors  and  teachers,  invariably  they   are

pinched  by  industry. I believe  the  Minister  of

State is fully aware that when a serving officer is

sent  overseas for further training, he is required

to  enter  into a bond whereby, upon the completion

of  such  a course, he serves the Government  or  a

quasi-government body for a period of no less  than

five  years.  I  would  suggest  that  he  continue

exercising   this  condition  when  the   Singapore

Technical   Institute,  or  for  that  matter   the

Ministry  of  Education sends anybody overseas  for

any course.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

referring to the teachers trained locally: they are

not bonded for five years. We had occasions when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



the  teachers marched into the principal's  office,

threw  down a cheque for three months' salary,  and

walked off.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like the Minister of State to make  a

further  clarification. He said a few  moments  ago

that, in using the machinery, the students are  not

as  skilful as the skilled workers. My question  is

that  when  the  instructors  are  available,  they

should  repair and maintain the machinery  and  not

allow it to break-down and then put it aside like a

pair  of old shoes. I wonder whether we have enough

repairers to look after this machinery so  that  we

do  not  have to waste money on this item.  Perhaps

the  Minister  of  State  did  not  listen  to   me

correctly. I was not referring to the students.  My

point is that you must have people who know how  to

repair  and  maintain the machinery. The institutes

should  make  full  use of the machinery  available

instead of buying a machine and, after a few months

when  it breaks down, just leaving it there without

doing anything to repair it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, as I have

mentioned,  there  is a unit to  maintain  all  the

machinery. The frequency of the break-downs is high

because  the  students are using the machinery  for

training purposes. A certain delay in repairing  is

inevitable  Of course, the best way to maintain  it

is  not to let the students touch it. But then  you

will not train anyone at all!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Since the

Minister  of  State has said that the machinery  is

used  to  train  the  students.  I  beg  leave   to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1202.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I am somewhat

astonished to find that the Polytechnic will have a

new campus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>



at  Dover Road. As stated in the Memorandum on  the

Development Estimates of Singapore, (Paper Misc.  2

of  1971), $6 million is required for this  campus.

If  I can refer the Minister of State for Education

to  Hansard, Volume 29, dated 26th of March,  1970,

at  col.  1182, in which the Minister for  Law  and

National  Development  interjected  and  said  -  I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... if plans for moving the University of Singapore

to Kent Ridge are implemented, then the Polytechnic

may  move  to  the present site of the  University.

When  the University moves, we must find a use  for

the  present building and grounds. In my view,  the

present University site would be the best site  for

the Polytechnic.'



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to know why there is a change of mind

and  I  hope  the Minister of State will  not  say,

"Look,   previously   I   was   the   Parliamentary

Secretary, but now I am the Minister of  State  and

we have a new Minister for Education." That kind of

argument will not get us anywhere. Anyway, Sir,  I

will  be  interested  to know why  the  Polytechnic

cannot  make  use  of the University  of  Singapore

campus when the University moves to Kent Ridge. Why

should we spend millions of dollars on constructing

a new building for the Polytechnic? I am well aware

that the present Polytechnic building is inadequate

for  the purposes for which it was set up. In  that

respect,   Sir,  if  the  Minister  of  State   for

Education  can  kindly  enlighten  this  House  the

reasons for the change of site and the construction

of  a  new building for the Polytechnic, I will  be

most grateful.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Punggol has quoted correctly. In fact, it  was

the  intention then to move the Polytechnic to  the

University  of  Singapore Campus.  But  on  further

analysis,  we found that it is not very  economical

for  various  reasons. First of  all,  timing.  The

University  is  going to move to  Kent  Ridge.  But

there will be a time-lag and the development of the

Polytechnic will be hampered if it is to wait until

the University has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>



moved  to  Kent  Ridge. I was  not  here  when  the

Minister   for  Science  and  Technology   answered

Members'  queries on the University  of  Singapore.

But  I  believe it will take some time to move  the

University  from  Bukit Timah to  Kent  Ridge.  The

polytechnic  cannot  wait  that  long  for  further

expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the present building in Bukit Timah is

not really suitable for the Engineering Faculty for

purely  engineering  reasons.  It  was  built   for

laboratories  and lecture theatres  of  very  light

load.  Whereas for an engineering institution  like

the   Polytechnic,  we  have  heavy  machinery   in

operation. It may end up with the 10 storey Physics

building  coming down to the ground floor with  all

the  machinery! In fact, considering the conversion

costs, it will be cheaper to move to a new site. It

is  with that in mind that the Polytechnic will now

be moved to Dover Road. That decision is final.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am not quite convinced

that  it  is  cheaper  or economical  to  move  the

Polytechnic to Dover Road because it involves a sum

of  no less than $6 million and a token vote of $10

for  that  matter. I am no engineer and,  with  due

respect to the Minister of State who is a Doctor of

Engineering,  I  am not very conversant  with  this

matter. But as a layman, I think in terms of saving

money. The Minister of State has just now mentioned

that   the  present  University  building  is   not

suitable  for the Polytechnic. But is he or  is  he

not  aware  that there are ample vacant grounds  in

the  University campus where buildings suitable for

accommodating engineering equipment can  be  built?

And  with  the  money  saved, we  can  have  better

facilities. The Minister of State says the decision

to  site the Polytechnic at Dover Road is final. If

it  is  final, let it be final. But I am  making  a

plea that if we can save money, why not use it  for

better facilities?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not

quite   follow  the  Member  for  Punggol.  Is   he

suggesting constructing new buildings in the  Bukit

Timah campus for the Polytechnic?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> There are some vacant grounds at

the University campus.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Vacant grounds, meaning that

we  have  to  put  up  new buildings. Instead  of

building  at  Bukit Timah Road, we are building  at

Dover Road. It is not going to cost --



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> What about the University

complex?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> The University complex is too

big for the Polytechnic and it would be a waste  of

buildings. The University has at present 4,000 full-time students. For the purposes of the Polytechnic,

it  would  be much too big, especially if  you  are

going to put up new buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Punggol misunderstood me

when  I  said  that the decision is final.  I  said

"final" not with any arrogance but just in case the

Member  thinks that the Ministry of Education  will

change  its  mind  again and site  the  Polytechnic

somewhere else.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, before I beg leave to

withdraw  my  amendment. I have just one  point  to

add.  Perhaps  in  the next 10 or  20  years,  more

engineering   graduates  will  be   required   than

graduates from the academic side. On that  note,  I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Yeo Choo Kok



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(15) That the total sum to be allocated for Head 41 be reduced by $100.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yeo, you have three minutes to

"guillotine" time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

the  fact  that  I shall not have  enough  time  to

long debate, I do not wish to move my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $27,166,960 for Head 41 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 51 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 51 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead the sum to be voted for

is  $95,000  for  the  purpose of  purchasing  T.V.

outside  broadcasting  equipment.  In  moving  this

amendment,  I  do not want to criticise  too  much,

because  a  few  days  ago criticism  of  the  T.V.

programmes has already been made. All that  I  want

to  say now is that we hope that there can be  some

improvement in our T.V. programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to ask the Minister

concerned  a few questions for clarification.  What

kind  of  work  is involved in the  so-called  T.V.

outside   broadcasting?   Can   the   T.V., outside

broadcasting  equipment  bring  better   and   more

programmes for our viewers? What sort of  equipment

are  we  going to buy for T.V. outside broadcasting

and from what countries are we buying it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

equipment  represents two sets of  micro-wave  link

equipment  for  the  outside broadcasting  vans  of

Radio and Television Singapore. Each of these  sets

of  equipment  consists  of  a  transmitter  and  a

receiver.   These  two  sets  of   microwave   link

equipment  represent the additional minimum  number

required  to  allow for the programmes  originating

from  a venue outside the T.V. studio centre to  be

transmitted back to the centre. In years past,  two

sets  of  such  microwave link equipment  could  be

considered sufficient. But recently, in view of the

increase of building activities in Singapore,  many

high-rise buildings constitute obstructions to  the

line of sight between most of the venues of outside

broadcasts   and   the  T.V. studio   centre.   The

additional  two  sets of microwave  link  equipment

would  help  to  alleviate  such  difficulties.  In

addition,  these two sets of equipment  would  also

help  to  provide a microwave link  system  between

Fort   Canning  and  Broadcasting  House   if   the

facilities of the Telecommunications Department are

to be made use of, especially the Satellite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



Earth  Station,  either for  sending  or  receiving

television   programmes   to   or   from   overseas

broadcasting organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang asked three questions on

the  outside broadcasting vans. The first was, what

are  the  outside broadcasting vans used for?  They

are  used  for  relaying  outside  programmes  like

sports,  or programmes which we have to relay  from

the  theatres, like the National Theatre,  back  to

the  studio centre. Some shows cannot be staged  in

the T.V. studio and, therefore, we need to hire  or

borrow space in the National Theatre or some  other

place  to  stage  the shows and  make  use  of  the

outside  broadcasting vans to send  the  programmes

back via microwave link to the studio centre either

for recording or for direct broadcast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang then asked whether or

not this equipment would provide more programmes. I

would say yes, for outside broadcasts are something

which  we have to use at functions like sports  and

also like the National Day parade. We can broadcast

these events direct to the people at the time  when

the function is on. It provides a sense of intimacy

to  the  audience and in a way it would enrich  the

contents  of the programme and give rise to  better

audienceship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I am unable to give the Member the

details  of  the  equipment that  we  have  in  the

outside  broadcasting unit. Basically, we have  two

vans and there are lots of equipment in the vans. I

think  there  are  at least one or  two  video-tape

recorders,  cameras  and other  equipment.  If  the

Member for Sembawang wants to know further,  I  can

give him a list of the equipment. I am afraid I  am

unable to read it out because most of the equipment

is in very technical terms.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I am very satisfied with the answer given  by

the  Minister for Culture. He has told  this  House

that outside broadcasts have a lot of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



advantages. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 51 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 103.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I merely wish to know

from  the Minister for Culture what steps have been

taken   to  introduce  Adult  Education  Television

Service in Singapore. No doubt this is only  a  $10

token  vote,  but I believe there is some  thinking

behind   the   introduction  of   Adult   Education

Television  Service. I shall  be  grateful  if  the

Minister will throw some light on what Adult E.T.V.

will do for Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer

to the question posed by the Member for Punggol was

given  when  I answered the Member for  Katong  who

asked about the Adult Education T.V. Production  and

Training  Centre Project during the debate  on  the

Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will, however, briefly reiterate that it has

been agreed between the Frederich Ebert-Stiftung of

West  Germany  and  the  Singapore  Government   to

establish   an   international   centre   for   the

production of adult education programmes  and  the

training of T.V. producers and technicians in  this

field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's contribution will be the cost of a

building  to  house the offices, T.V. studios  and

other  engineering  facilities, together  with  the

provision of the necessary staff of relevant grades

required  for the project. The Stiftung,  that  is,

the  foundation  from  West Germany,  will  provide

capital equipment and five experts and officials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual recurrent expenditure for production

costs  will  be  shared. Government's  contribution

towards  capital  expenditure is indicated  by  the

token  vote of $10 under subhead 103 of Head 51  of

the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is anticipated that the finalisation of the

building  plan and the construction of the building

will proceed over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>



the  next two years. The building plan may now have

to  be  changed  to accommodate the E.T.V. of  the

Ministry of Education, which is looking for  a  new

site.  The first payment in respect of construction

is  not  expected  until the end of  the  financial

year.

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 52 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item 001 of  subhead

101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the population in Toa Payoh now is more than

100,000.  There are only two community  centres  in

the  constituency. Both of these  two  centres  are

sited  in  a very inconspicuous position,  and  the

facilities  there are particularly  inadequate  for

the  large number of residents in the constituency.

I  am  aware  that there is another  self-contained

community  centre which is being completed  in  the

western sector. I believe this new community centre

is  to  cater for residents in that sector. I would

like  to  ask the Minister whether he will consider

putting up another self-contained community  centre

in the eastern sector to cater for the residents in

that area. I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

at present three, and not two, community centres in

the  Toa  Payoh  Constituency.  The  Member  should

consider  himself fortunate to have three community

centres  in  one  constituency because  many  other

constituencies have only one. However, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>



is agreed and accepted that Toa Payoh needs another

community  centre  in  the eastern  sector  of  the

constituency. In fact, the People's Association has

been  discussing this matter with the  Housing  and

Development Board for quite some time, but  so  far

it  has  not  been able to obtain a  suitable  site

there. The Association will continue its search, in

consultation with the Member for Toa  Payoh  for  a

suitable  site  in the future. In  order  that  the

community    centre   will   provide   satisfactory

amenities to the residents, a building of at  least

the   size  of  the  present  one  which  is  being

completed  in  Toa  Payoh  West,  will  be  needed.

Therefore, there is this necessity to search for an

empty  piece  of land rather than to incorporate  a

community centre in an existing flat. If the Member

has any suitable site in mind, he is welcome to put

forward  his  proposal to the People's  Association

and we will consider it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, it is indeed

heartening  to  listen to the Minister's  comments,

but may I make just a point of clarification? There

are at present two community centres in operation -

one in Kim Keat Avenue and the other in Lorong 5. I

did mention one centre which is being completed now

at Lorong 1A. I believe there are quite a number of

vacant  plots of land in Toa Payoh East. I will  be

glad   if  the  Minister  can  indicate  when   the

officials of the People's Association will be  free

to  come  along  with me, and I will  suggest  some

suitable  sites  for  them.  But  in  view  of  the

Minister's reply, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Thank you, Sir. According to the

Memorandum on the Development Estimates, in page 5.

section 37, it is very clear that the sum of  money

to  be voted for will be not only for the Pasir Ris

Holiday  Flats but also for two community  centres.

Paragraph 2 of section 37 states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A sum of $313,000 is provided as subsidy for

resiting the Kampong Glam Community Centre and  the

Kota  Raja  Community Centre. The  balance  of  the

provision  is  for  the construction  of  five  new

standard  community  centres  and  five  new  rural

community  centres.  The sites of  these  community

centres have yet to be decided.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not asking that there should be a new

community centre in Punggol. I am not going to  ask

for  any more community centre. My quarrel with the

Minister for Culture is that if one takes $3l3, 000

out of this allocation for subhead 101, nothing  is

left  in  the  provision  to  construct  five   new

standard  community  centres  and  five  new  rural

community centres. I do not know how this  equation

is going to work out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is about the

facilities  at  these community  centres.  We  have

management   committees  in  all  these   community

centres, and invariably facilities are lacking.  As

a  result, the management committees have  to  look

for funds to enable them to have more facilities at

their    centres.   I   understand   the   People's

Association  does  give a certain  sum  as  subsidy

depending  on  the  type of centre,  to  all  these

community  centres.  If they are  of  the  standard

type,  they get more, and if they are of the  rural

type,  they  get less. In this respect,  I  do  not

think  it  is wise simply to subsidise a  community

centre  so  that  it will be run by the  management

committee, and not lift a finger to help  when  the

management committee asks for extensions and better

facilities for their community centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reinforce my argument, I will bring up one

point,  and  that is the extension to  the  Punggol

Community Centre. The management committee did  not

get a cent from the Government, but fortunately  we

had some good Samaritans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



They pooled their resources together and managed to

put up the extension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, these points have been raised and

Ministers have replied, "Why not do it on your own,

since  other centres can get more money to increase

the  facilities  of  their own  centres?"  This  is

hardly a wise move, because we have a provision  of

$313,000  in  the  Development  Estimates  for  two

community  centres affected by urban renewal.  What

about   those   centres  that  really   need   such

facilities,  for example, the rural  type?  Such  a

centre has only one room, partitioned into a  small

office and a store room. They expect the management

committee to run kindergarten classes with  limited

space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Culture will bring these

points  to the attention of the authorities in  the

People's  Association and take the necessary  steps

to remedy such a situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

under this amendment, I would like to bring up  one

or two points about community centres. Earlier on I

said  that  Jurong is a new town and the population

is increasing all the time. Probably in five years'

time the number of people will exceed 100,000.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a lack of recreational facilities in Jurong. At night it is a dead place. At the moment we have a community centre in Jurong, but it is sited in one of the flats belonging to the Jurong Town Corporation. I hear that the People's Association intends to build a community

centre, not in a flat, but elsewhere. There are one

or  two community centres in an isolated corner  of

Jurong. They are quite inaccessible to many  people

in  Jurong. Therefore, there is a need to build not

just  a  community centre but a bigger one  in  the

centre of Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his reply to the Member for Toa Payoh, the

Minister   said  that  he  could   not   find   any

appropriate  site  for a community  centre  in  Toa

Payoh. But in Jurong I know that the J.T.C. has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>



already  designated a certain area for the building

of  community  centres. I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister if the People's Association have any  plan

to  build a community centre in Jurong and, if  so,

when they intend to carry it out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must

congratulate the Member for Punggol on bringing  up

the  point  of  adequacy  of  funds  for  community

centres. But I hope that not all the $313,000  will

be  taken up for the resiting of the two centres as

mentioned  in  the  Memorandum on  the  Development

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to seek information from the

Minister  whether there is provision for a standard

community centre at the Old Kallang Airport  Estate

in  my  constituency, and whether a site  has  been

located  by  the  People's  Association  for   this

purpose.  Sir, a site near Block 93 at Jalan  Satu,

off Old Airport Road, was, in fact, proposed by  me

in  1965 for a community centre. But it was  turned

down by the Housing and Development Board as it was

meant for some other purposes. Up to now, this site

is  still  left  vacant. I wonder if  the  People's

Association  will  reopen  negotiations  with   the

Housing   and  Development  Board  to   develop   a

community centre on this site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to stress that there is a great need for a

community centre in the Old Kallang Airport  Estate

in  view  of the fact that about 34,000 people  are

now living there. You will agree with me, Sir, that

community  development is important  in  a  housing

estate. Although there is now a community centre at

Guillemard  Road,  which was  formerly  the  Katong

Boys'  Club  and was converted into the Mountbatten

Community Centre in 1960, it is sited in  a  remote

corner of my constituency and is far away from  the

bulk  of  the population. This being the  case,  it

does   not  adequately  serve  the  needs   of   my

constituents. In fact, it serves predominantly  the

people  from  the Geylang area. Will  the  Minister

look into this matter?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, I have only one

point to raise. In Anson Constituency there is only

one  community centre. I am not going  to  ask  for

more  as  there is no land available. Fair  enough.

But  this  present community centre is very  small.

Originally  we estimated that the community  centre

would   cost   about  $80,000,  but  the   People's

Association said at that time that since funds were

not  available they could give us only $40,000  for

it.  Therefore, we could only build  a  very  small

community centre in my constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he will

consider  extending  the  building  of  the   Anson

community  centre. Perhaps the management committee

could  try  to get some money from the public  and,

together   with   assistance  from   the   People's

Association, we could then extend the  building  as

soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Punggol  need not worry that we are  going  to

spend  a  large  amount of money on  the  community

centres affected by urban renewal. In fact, out  of

the  $300,000 asked for under subhead 101,  we  are

only  allotting  about $50,000 to the  new  Kampong

Glam  Community Centre which is affected  by  urban

renewal,  and only about $10,000 for the  community

centre  at Nelson Road which is affected by certain

projects. Another sum of $10,000 will be  spent  on

resiting   the   Kota   Raja   Community    Centre.

Altogether,   about  $70,000  will  be   spent   on

community  centres  which  are  either  resited  or

affected  by urban renewal. The bulk of  the  money

asked  for is meant for five new community  centres

costing $46,000 each. They are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) At the former Christian cemetery, off Bukit

Timah Road. This new community centre is asked  for

by  the Member for Cairnhill, because he is of  the

opinion that his constituents living in the Selegie

Road area, which forms part of his constituency, do

not  have  community centre facilities at  present.

Therefore,  he  needs one to serve  the  population

there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The second one will be sited at Upper

Aljunied  Road. There is at present  one  community

centre in Aljunied Constituency, at Joo Seng  Road.

This  community  centre is situated  in  a  Housing

Board   flat   and  is  found  to   be   not   very

satisfactory.  The  Member  for  Aljunied  and  the

management committee of that community centre  have

asked  for a new centre to be built on a  piece  of

land  along  Upper  Aljunied Road  to  replace  the

present  one. So another $46,000 goes towards  this

new community centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The third one is to be built at Whitley Road.

There are only two rural-type community centres  in

Tanglin  Constituency at the  moment,  namely,  the

Kampong  Chantek  Lama  Community  Centre  and  the

Onraet Road Community Centre. We have now completed

plans to build standard-type community centres  for

Tanglin, because it is the only constituency  which

has no standard-type community centre at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The fourth community centre will be built at

Kallang  Basin.  The  present community  centre  is

situated  on  the ground floor of a  Housing  Board

flat.  Again,  it is not suitable for the  purpose,

and therefore the Housing Board has agreed to build

a  new one in that constituency. This needs another

$46,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The fifth community centre is the answer to

the  query from the Member for Mountbatten. It will

be  at  the  Old  Kallang Airport Estate.  But  the

problem is that we still have not been able to find

a  piece  of land suitable for a community  centre.

The  money is there but we will have to wait  until

the  Member  for  Mountbatten is satisfied  that  a

suitable  piece  of land can be found.  As  I  have

said,  the problem is not that we are not  spending

money  on  the building of standard-type  community

centres, but how to spend it wisely and get maximum

value out of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of extension of a community centre

and  expansion  of  its  existing  facilities,  the

expenditure  involved  is  not  as  much  as   that

incurred  in  building  a  new  community   centre.

Normally the cost ranges from a few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



thousand  dollars to about $20,000. In  such  cases

the  public-spirited management  committee  of  the

community   centres   have  undertaken   to   raise

donations  on  their own and have  taken  pride  in

doing   so.   They  only  approach   the   People's

Association  for  technical  advice,  such  as  the

preparation of building plans, the cost of which is

normally  borne by the Association.  In  the  event

that   the   management   committee   has   genuine

difficulties in raising donations, the  Association

has  always  rendered financial  assistance.  There

were,   in   fact,  instances  when  the   People's

Association   constructed  basketball   courts   or

provided basketball stands and lights and so on for

community centres.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were, however, cases where community

leaders  were  over-zealous and  wanted  to  extend

their community centres to a size out of proportion

to  the  centres'  actual  requirements.  In  these

circumstances,   the   Association    had    always

discouraged them from doing so. Where they insisted

on  going  ahead with the project by  assuring  the

Association that they could manage on their own, it

is  understandable that the Association was  unable

to  help  much, bearing in mind that we  have  only

limited   funds  provided  in  our  estimates   and

excessive  expenditure  of  public  funds  is   not

justifiable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a recognised fact that the management

committees have rendered invaluable services  since

their  inception  in  1964. Besides  providing  the

vital  link between the Government and the  people,

they  serve  as  a catalyst in the evolution  of  a

spirit   of   public   involvement   in   community

activities. Because of the public spirit  of  these

people, the community centres are accepted as  part

of  the people's own property. There is, therefore,

the existence of a sense of pride in the people  in

these  centres. This is a healthy sign and  may  be

regarded  as  a  national asset. It is,  therefore,

felt  that  financial  assistance,  if  given   too

readily,  will serve to curb the spirit  of  public

involvement   which  is  being   nurtured   through

relentless



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



efforts,  and  will  encourage  a  sense  of  over-reliance by the community centre on the Association

to provide every recreational facility. It need not

be emphasised that the spirit of public involvement

must not be hampered. On the other hand, it must be

encouraged and allowed to develop until  the  stage

is reached when the community centres will be built

for  the people, by the people and managed  by  the

people themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has asked for a community

centre  in Jurong. The answer is that we intend  to

build  one, but the problem is, where are we  going

to get the money?

is  expected to be completed in mid-1971. The  need

for  the  home is well established and urgent,  and

there   is   no   question   of   postponement   of

expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 61 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 205.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to learn that the prisons in

Singapore are conducting training courses  for  the

inmates  who  are  serving their  sentences.  Thus,

their time is not wasted whilst they are in prison.

They  therefore  have  an opportunity  to  increase

their   knowledge  in  various  spheres  of   life,

particularly  in  the technical  field.  This  will

provide  them  with the opportunity  to  use  their

skills  to  obtain a legitimate means of livelihood

when  they  are discharged. This, in effect,  means

that  they are given the opportunity to make  their

contribution  to  the economic  well-being  of  the

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise a number

of questions for the Minister in charge to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What type of training is being given to the prisoners?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the revenue that can be derived

by  the prison authorities every year from the sale

of  handicraft work, such as baskets and  furniture

making, undertaken by the prisoners?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) How are the products of such handicraft

marketed, and can members of the public like myself

purchase  them? It so, where can we  buy  them?  To

travel  to  the prisons in order to make  purchases

will  be  shameful  as people will  have  to  enter

through the prison gate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Are there classes in the prisons teaching

academic  subjects? I think it  is  very  important

that the prisoners increase their knowledge through

education  so  that  they  can  become  responsible

citizens in the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would  like  to inform the Member for  Sembawang

that  in  our  prisons every prisoner is  given  an

opportunity to learn a trade. I would like to  give

some  examples.  First,  if  he  has  worked  as  a

carpenter before, he can continue with this  trade.

Then  there  is metal work. Some are doing  laundry

work, sewing or rattan work and upholstery. We have

all kinds of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when a juvenile delinquent enters a

prison, the first thing we do is to find out why he

has  come to prison. If he is intelligent, we  give

him a more complicated job to do. If he is not very

well  educated, he will be given any work  that  he

prefers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot give the Member for Sembawang all the

information.  In 1956 we collected revenue  to  the

tune   of   $287,000.  But  in  1970  we  collected

$1,221,135. We can see from these two figures  that

we have made progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's other question was, where can

members of the public buy the handicraft works that

have  been made by the prisoners? They can get them

from  Changi Prison, or Penang Lane, or any of  the

Social  Welfare homes. We have show-cases in  these

places  and  any Member who wants to  buy  anything

made  by  the prisoners is invited to go there  and

buy it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding academic studies in prison, this is

really  a  very important matter. If  our  juvenile

delinquents  enter prison and are not given  proper

training,  they  might,  after  discharge,  get  in

again.  Sir, we have a definite plan for prisoners.

The  inmates do not just sit and waste their  time.

They learn a trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also asked what we

have achieved in Changi Prison. We have classes for

languages  as well as academic subjects. This  year

four  of  the  prisoners who sat for the  Cambridge

School Certificate examination



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



managed  to obtain very good results. One  of  them

obtained a Grade I certificate with distinctions in

English  and English Literature and had credits  in

Bible  knowledge and History. Two  of  them  had  a

Grade  two certificate. This is a good example  set

by  these  prisoners.  We  do  not  like  prisoners

wasting  their  time in prison.  We  like  them  to

improve themselves and when they get out of  prison

later  on, they will have the necessary skills  and

knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every year we in this House have to approve

money for land acquisition by Government for public

purposes. I believe that the Minister for  Law  and

National  Development  has already  said  something

about  land  acquisition and compensation.  What  I

want  to  know is whether the allegations  made  by

some quarters that Government acquires land cheaply

and  sells it at a big profit are true. That is the

first point for clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is in respect of reclamation

schemes. Sir, I have two amendments+ under  Head  72

but  I propose, with your permission, to range over

them  now  so  that I need not have  to  move  them

tomorrow. I notice that a vast stretch of land  has

already been reclaimed on the east coast, and  many

questions have been posed to the Government on  the

optimum  use of the land. At the moment, I  believe

that  certain stretches of the land are  ready  for

development.  In  fact, a few military  camps  have

already  been  set up at Bedok. I  would  like  the

Minister  to  clarify his Ministry's plans  on  the

question of land reclamation and land acquisition.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wish  to  speak on the  question  of  land

acquisition  by the Government. Two days  ago,  the

Minister for Law and National Development said that

the  Government  does not make  exorbitant  profits

when  it acquires land and subsequently resells  it

for  urban  renewal  projects.  I  agree  that  the

Government incurs expenditure on clearing the land,

laying out the site and setting aside a portion  of

it  for road widening, and, when the site is  ready

for  development, sells it. But how much  does  all

this  cost  the Government? It acquires land  at  a

very low price. The clearance of squatters does not

cost  much to the Government, because the squatters

are  resettled  in  alternative  accommodation   in

Housing and Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



Board flats and a meagre sum is paid to  them

as  disturbance allowance. This cannot be  compared

with  the  price at which the Government sells  the

land  by tender. Sometimes the tender price  is  10

times the amount it pays for acquiring the land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not quarrelling about land acquisition and

the sale of sites made ready for urban renewal, nor

about  the  moral behind it. What I want  to  speak

about is the compensation the Commissioner of Lands

pays to landowners when their property is acquired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many cases where the compensation

offered  by the Commissioner of Lands is far  below

the  market price. And when the appellant takes the

matter  to the Appeals Board, he has to pay  $5,000

deposit  in court and engage lawyers to  argue  the

case.  In many instances, the Commissioner of Lands

has settled cases with landowners at a higher price

just  before  the  hearing of the  appeal.  If  the

appellant is rich, he can afford to pay the deposit

and engage lawyers to argue the case. But if he  is

poor, he cannot afford to pay the deposit or engage

lawyers and he has to accept the unfair award  made

by the Commissioner of Lands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the valuers in the office of the

Commissioner of Lands are incompetent  or  fear  to

make  correct  valuations or  are  over-zealous  in

trying  to  save the Government as  much  money  as

possible  to  the  detriment of the property-owning

class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that in order to prevent

property  owners  from  submitting  their  valuer's

report  challenging  the  valuation  of  the   Land

Office,  the Land Office declares the  land  to  be

acquired as an open space or as a green belt.  When

this is done, the land has no commercial value  and

the private valuers refuse to value it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of an instance where, in spite of the

declaration of a piece of land as a green  belt,  a

reputable  firm was prepared to buy this  piece  of

land  at $10 per square foot and pay the Government

development  charges in order to convert  the  land

for other uses and remove the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



green  belt.  But what happened was that  the  Land

Office did not want to lift the green belt.  Is  it

fair?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister will explain this and also

explain the workings of the notice of intention  to

acquire land, issued under section 3 of the Act  in

relation to a subsequent acquisition under  section

5 of the Act.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, considerable

interest  inside and outside this  House  has  been

aroused  in  respect of my denial of the allegation

that  Government makes exorbitant profits  when  it

acquires  land and subsequently sells  it.  At  the

outset, I must point out that I did not say that we

do  not  make any profit. We do. But not  in  every

case  and the profits are certainly not exorbitant.

That  was the myth I was referring to - "exorbitant

profits".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last Tuesday I took pains to outline the

several  factors  why  land sold  under  the  urban

renewal  sales,  sells at higher  prices  than  the

actual price of acquisition. I need not repeat  all

these  factors again. But the major  ones  which  I

mentioned  are  the  generous instalment  terms  in

respect of the sale price -20 per cent down payment

and the rest over 10 to 20 years. Secondly, the  12

per cent property tax which is very attractive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I reiterate that the procedure for the

acquisition of land is set out clearly in the  Land

Acquisition Act, 1966, which obliges the Government

to  acquire land at market value. The Act  provides

for  an  appeal to the Appeals Board if  the  owner

feels  that  he has been inadequately  compensated.

There  have been grumblings about the valuation  of

our  valuers.  But on an appeal, the appellant  has

his  own  valuers to give their valuation.  So  the

judge hears both sides and he decides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to costs, I find it hard to believe that an

owner of land cannot raise $5,000 to pay costs.  If

he  is really broke, he can fight his own case.  If

he  is  not broke, he gets hold of a lawyer. But  I

repeat  I find it hard to believe that an owner  of

land  in Singapore cannot afford the services of  a

lawyer or a valuer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been asked by the Member for Potong

Pasir  to explain section 3 of the Act. Under  this

section,    a   notification   is   published    of

Government's intention to acquire a particular land

required for a public purpose. The section is  used

only  in  cases of real necessity and primarily  to

put  a  stop to unscrupulous speculative land deals

which often take place as soon as it is learnt that

a  property  is likely to be subject to  compulsory

acquisition.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to acquire the land, we send a team

down  to  survey it. The moment they see the  team,

some, I do not say all, arrange for a resale. Hence

section  3.  If we move under section  3,  we  must

acquire   the  land  within  six  months   of   the

notification.  If  we do, then  the  price  is  the

market  price  at the date of the notification.  If

the  land is not acquired within six months of  the

date  of  notification, any subsequent  acquisition

under  section 5 will have to be made at the market

price  on the date of acquisition under section  5.

The  only  advantage is the six months'  period  to

prevent  speculative dealings once the owners  hear

that acquisition may take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a further mischievous impression has been

created   by   the   allegation   that   Government

indiscriminately  re-zones private  lands  as  open

spaces  so  that they can be acquired  cheaply  and

resold  at  much higher prices. This is  completely

misleading.  There are only two cases of  re-zoning

initiated  by  Government prior to acquisition,  as

against  the  hundreds of cases of acquisition  and

the hundreds of cases where private landowners have

obtained an alteration of the zoning in respect  of

their own lands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir complained about the

Government not allowing someone to re-zone so  that

he  could  sell  the land at $10 a square  foot.  I

believe  the land is a "green belt" area. To  allow

him  to  re-zone would be all right if the planners

think there should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



be  re-zoning, but the action of re-zoning  is  not

just  to  allow him to make a huge profit. He  must

satisfy  the planners that re-zoning is  justified,

in  which case he must set out his grounds. If they

agree,  he gets it. But to grumble and say, "I  can

sell  my land at $10 a square foot if you allow  me

to re-zone", is, I think, a weak argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not denied that the Government can acquire

rent-controlled  properties at  a  low  price.  But

Government properties are not bound by the  Control

of  Rent  Ordinance,  and  the  argument  is  quite

irrelevant.  May I put it this way? If Government's

intention   is  to  make  profits   out   of   land

transactions,  it  would simply acquire  all  rent-controlled  properties, say, in the  "Golden  Shoe"

area and resell them to private developers who  are

hungry   for   land  for  redevelopment.   Instead,

Government has introduced new legislation to enable

private  landowners to obtain vacant  possession  of

their properties upon payment of compensation to be

awarded by the Tenants Compensation Board. We would

like   to  invite  private  participation  in   the

redevelopment of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned just now two cases in which we

re-zoned  before  we  acquired  the  land.  If  the

objective  was  to resell the land  for  money,  we

would  resell  both properties. You cannot  make  a

profit  until you resell. In neither of  these  two

cases has the land been resold. One recent case  is

still the subject of an appeal. Since the matter is

sub  judice, Mr Speaker, Sir, and as I am reminded

of your warning earlier on this afternoon, I am not

free  to  comment on it. But in another  case,  the

property was re-zoned precinctal open space so that

a  garden  for  the benefit of the  general  public

could be developed. The Government did not sell the

land.  In order to create this garden, we  did  not

think  we should pay the price of the land  at  the

commercial  rate. Hence the re-zoning to precinctal

open  space, and there is your garden.  The  owners

had   their  remedies.  They  objected.  When   the

rezoning took place, there was a hearing. They were

heard and the re-zoning was upheld. They had legal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



advice. They could have taken the matter further to

the High Court if they had felt that the principles

of  natural justice had not been complied  with  by

us.  Perhaps  it  is either because  of  the  legal

advice  or  their public spirit that they  did  not

take the matter further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not denied that in the few cases where

acquired  properties were resold  under  the  Urban

Renewal  Redevelopment Scheme, Government  obtained

higher  prices than the prices paid  for  them.  In

addition  to  the  reasons I  have  already  given,

another reason for the higher prices is that  there

is  usually a lapse of time between acquisition and

resale of the same properties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the first sale of urban renewal sites, we

offered  several sites along the "Golden Mile"  for

public tender. No one tendered for any site. Anyone

who had tendered at $5 a square foot would have got

the   land.  But  no  one  tendered;  no  one   was

interested.  That  was several years  ago.  In  the

subsequent  second  and  third  sales,  the  prices

jumped up. Today they are rushing to get land along

the  "Golden Mile" at $60 to $70 a square foot. But

do  not  blame us for that. The price of  land  has

gone up since. Let us put it the other way. Let  us

say that the price of land has gone down. Who bears

the  loss?  We bear the loss! Perhaps we  can  take

some of the credit. The place is booming, money  is

rushing  in, and the recent increases in the  price

of  land  have  been  quite fantastic.  Because  of

stability, everyone in Singapore benefits; so  does

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise that of the three sales

of urban land undertaken by the Government, only  a

very small percentage of the land sold was acquired

land. I will give you the figures. Most of the land

was always Government land which we offered to them

three  years ago and which no one wanted. Now  they

are all rushing in. The details are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first sale, about 33 acres of land were

sold  by  tender. Ninety-two per cent of  this  was

state land and was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



always state land. Some 8 per cent was private land

which was acquired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second sale, 13 acres were sold - 75 per

cent  was  state land and 25 per cent private  land

acquired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third sale, 14 acres were sold - 78 per

cent  was  state land and 22 per cent private  land

acquired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Members are interested in the land along

the "Golden Mile". Of the roughly 23 acres sold  in

what we call "the Golden Mile" area, 96 per cent of

the land sold was always Government land and a mere

4  per  cent (about 25,000 square feet) was private

land acquired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may also be interested in the state land

at  Shenton Way which is selling today  at  $90  to

$100  a  square  foot. People are rushing  to  buy.

Please do not think that we acquired this land. All

the   state  land  along  Shenton  Way  always  was

Government land. We have acquired not one per  cent

of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I say that without urban renewal,

this   town  cannot  develop.  With  rent  control,

private  owners find it hard to evict  tenants  and

redevelop  sites. Government owns large  tracts  of

land  and  has acquired some pieces. There  was  an

allegation  before that the Housing and Development

Board wanted to develop the whole of Singapore  and

hence  we  invited  private participation.  But  we

cannot  just  give the land to the buyer  and  say,

"Pay $5 for it." Then there will be allegations  of

bribery  and corruption. One has to have  a  public

tender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first public sale was not successful. Only

seven  sites  were taken up, and  there  were  only

about  13  or  14 tenderers. In the  second  public

sale, people became wiser, and about a little  more

than  50  tenders were received in  respect  of  14

sites,  and  13  were sold. In the last  and  third

sale, more than a hundred tenders were received for

14 sites, all of which were sold. If we do not have

a  public tender, then there will be the allegation

that  Government  wants to redevelop  the  land  by

itself.  This is not true. We are happy  to  invite

private participation. As far as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



the   "Golden  Shoe"  is  concerned,  rent  control

legislation  was  amended  in  order  to  encourage

private participation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I say that whatever profit the

Government  makes  goes into the  treasury  and  is

ploughed  back by way of social services  to  build

roads and schools, supply water, lights and gas.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my grouses are

about  the  acquisition of land by the Commissioner

of  Lands  and  the awards made  by  him,  but  the

Minister's  reply has been mostly directed  to  the

allegations made in the press.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> And the Member repeats them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> My speech has been on a different

point,  on the awards made by the Land Commissioner

and which have been challenged. Why not make a fair

award? That was my main grouse.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I do not make awards, but it starts

off  by  the Government Valuer making an award.  If

the  landowner is not satisfied, there is a process

by  which he can fight that award, and that  is  to

bring  his own valuer and have it out. Finally,  it

is  a judge of the High Court sitting on a tribunal

who decides how much to give.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one last word

before  I  beg leave to withdraw. The Minister  did

not answer the other half of my question. Anyway, I

will bring it up tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I have the

particulars, but time prevented me from giving  the

Member the answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Then I will wait till tomorrow.

I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $12,269,510 for Head 71 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to report

that  the Committee of Supply has made progress  on

the  Development Estimates of Expenditure  for  the

financial  year  1st April, 1971,  to  31st  March,

1972, and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.

to  eventually extend modern sanitation  facilities

to  every  home  in  the Republic.  This  ambitious

programme  is being carried out systematically  and

can  only  be implemented subject to practical  and

financial limitations. For the present, priority is

being  given to new and extensive projects  in  the

Urban  Renewal  areas in the Kallang Basin,  Jurong

and Upper Changi.
