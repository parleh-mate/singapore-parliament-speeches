His Excellency the Governor in connection with

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>FLOOD-PREVENTION MEASURES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(LOW-LYING AREAS)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Works, in view of the  approach

of  the rainy season, whether all flood-prevention

measures  in  the low-lying areas  have  now  been

completed;  and whether he can give  an  assurance

that  experience in the past, particularly in  the

Bedok  Resettlement area and in  the  Kampong  Tai

Seng area near the Paya Lebar Airport, will not be

repeated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I regret that I have to give

a  negative reply to both parts of the question. I

expect  that  the  hon. Member and  the  House  in

general  would  like  to have  more  than  a  bare

negative on this matter. I will therefore go  into

some detail so that the hon. Member can understand

the  scientific  complexities of the  problem  of

flood prevention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my reply to a similar question last July, I

indicated  that  there  were  two  factors  which

prevent   rapid   and  immediate  action   against

flooding.  First,  it  is necessary  to  undertake

lengthy hydrological and topographical surveys



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>

to  ascertain  the  exact  causes  and  nature  of

flooding  in each area where it occurs. Since  all

subsequent flood prevention measures must be based

on these preliminary surveys, it is necessary that

the  survey should be completely accurate in order

that  mistakes  can be avoided  and  public  money

should not be wasted. There is thus a considerable

time  factor involved between the occurrence of  a

flood  and  the taking of measures to prevent  its

recurrence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a cost factor which is very

serious. Preliminary investigations indicate  that

for  the  city area alone, flood prevention  works

might cost as much as $60 million. Expenditure  of

that  nature  must  obviously be balanced  against

other necessary public expenditure, and if it were

to  be  undertaken,  it  would  deserve  the  most

serious  and careful study by all Members  of  the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member may better understand the nature

of   the  problem  if  I  tell  him  that  it   is

essentially  one  of scientific  control  of  vast

natural  forces.  In  this  particular  island  of

Singapore, it is complicated by the fact that  the

natural  forces were not sufficiently  taken  into

account in the earlier development of the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to assure the hon. Member that the

Government  is acutely aware of the suffering  and

the waste which result from recurrent flooding. I

personally  had experience of this in past  years;

it is a problem that frequently recurs to my mind.

Any attempt, however, to deal with the problem of

flooding  on  a vote-catching basis  of  temporary

measures, stop-gap measures, would do little  good

and  almost certainly involve a considerable waste

of public money. We must proceed scientifically in

this matter if we are to get any useful result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the hon. Member's question is

partly  answered  already, but I  will  give  some

further    details.   He   mentions   the    Bedok

Resettlement area. I shall make a statement  later

in  connection with a Report that has been tabled.

It  is  enough to say now that the bund  has  been

strengthened  and  the drainage channel  has  been

straightened and deepened.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may also mention that the City Council has

undertaken  a  number  of minor  flood  prevention

works  at the Stamford/Orchard Canal, Bukit Timah/

Rochore  Canal,  Sungei Whampoa,  Sungei  Kallang,

Geylang  Serai and Geylang River, and in  the  Ulu

Pandan area. At Kampong Tai Seng to which the hon.

Member  refers, the flood problem arises from  the

low-lying nature of the land, and the problem  may

have been increased to some extent by agricultural

development. The Chief Drainage Engineer  will  be

recommending measures for Kampong Tai Seng as soon

as his investigations have been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member will see, therefore, that though

it  is  scientifically impossible to give him  the

assurance he asks for, hard work has been done  to

assess  the  need  and to recommend  measures  for

flood  control. I may add a final word of comfort.

Meteorologically  speaking,  the  probability   of

flooding  on  last year's scale is  rather  small.

Records show that the daily rainfall at Kallang on

the  9th  and 10th December, 1954, has  only  been

exceeded  once in the last 72 years; and similarly

the   total  monthly  rainfall  at  Kallang   last

December was the highest for 86 years. We can hope

that  we  shall  not  have  two  record  years  of

flooding in immediate succession.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Minister  for  Communications and  Works  give  an

assurance that requests for deepening of  channels

be  taken in hand as soon as possible, in view  of

possible flooding due to the monsoon that is about

to break in a month's time?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I have already dealt with this, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in my answer to the first question.

Whatever  can be done will be done. It is  no  use

going   ahead  until  you  are  able  to  have   a

scientific  assessment of  the  problem.  You  can

transfer  the  water  from  one  area  to  another

without getting it off the land and into the sea.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE TRACTION COMPANY STRIKE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for

Labour and Welfare whether he will give a detailed

report on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



the  present  strike  of  the  Singapore  Traction

Company employees; and state what steps have  been

taken by the Government to settle this dispute and

relieve the public from this inconvenience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in July this

year  the  Singapore  Traction  Company  Employees

Union  submitted demands relating to  increase  in

wages  and improved conditions of service for  all

employees  in the Company. The management  replied

that  they were unable to entertain these  demands

from  the Union, as they were in violation  of  an

agreement  signed between the management  and  the

Union in February 1954. This agreement was binding

on  both  parties and precluded either party  from

submitting or entertaining fresh demands  relating

to terms and conditions of employment for a period

of two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12th September a 14-day strike notice was

submitted  by the Union to the management.  During

this  period the Labour Department contacted both

parties,  who agreed to a joint meeting.  At  this

meeting the management stated that they would  be

prepared within a week to begin negotiations on  a

new  agreement  to be effective from  1st  January,

1956. The Union, however, stated that negotiations

should  commence immediately and that any  revised

wage rates should become effective from 14th July,

1955, the date on which the original demands  were

submitted.  The management offered  to  refer  the

question of the validity of the agreement  to  the

Attorney-General. This was rejected by the Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 26th September the 14-day strike notice

expired  and  resulted in a complete  stoppage  of

buses run by the Singapore Traction Company. Since

that  date Government has maintained contact with

both  parties with a view to seeking  a  means  of

resuming negotiations on an effective basis so  as

to bring the dispute to an early settlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the arrival of the Chairman of the

Singapore  Traction Company, Sir Thomas Strangman,

the  parties  met again yesterday  in  the  Labour

Ministry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



The   Union  urged  that  the  management  should

reconsider their stand on the previous  agreement

in view of the recent wage increases in other bus

companies.  The  Union also  contended  that  the

Singapore  Traction Company's wage policy  tended

to  encourage  corruption among  conductors.  The

management, however, were not prepared to  modify

their  stand  on  the sanctity of  the  agreement

previously entered into by the Committee  of  the

Union  and  endorsed  by  a  general  meeting  of

members.  The meeting, Sir, therefore ended  in  a

deadlock.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the

Government approve of agreements -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the hon. Member address

his supplementary question to the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As you please, Mr Speaker.

Does   the   Minister  for  Labour   approve   of

agreements  in  which unions  are  bound  for  an

indefinite  period regardless of drastic  changes

in surrounding circumstances?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is a question of

freedom  of  contract. It was not the Government

which  advised the Union to enter  into  such  an

agreement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> But do you approve it?



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Minister  say whether there is any truth  in  the

the agreement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to

there has been that claim that they have violated

the agreement themselves.

<div align="center"><b>PAN-MALAYAN ECONOMIC WORKING PARTY VISIT TO INDONESIA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I wish to inform hon. Members that,

as  a  follow up of the goodwill mission  and  in

furtherance  of  this  Government's   policy   of

promoting   good   neighbourly   relations and

stimulating  the  flow  of trade,  a  Pan-Malayan

Economic Working Party, under the leadership of my

friend  and colleague the Assistant Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry,  the  Hon.  Mr  J.   M.

Jumabhoy,  was in Indonesia from the 3rd  to  the 10th of October.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to announce that it received from the

Indonesian  Government a courteous  and  friendly

reception, and negotiations indicated an  equally

sincere  desire  on  the part of  the  Indonesian

Government for friendly understanding and healthy

trade relationship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of the Working Party is now under

consideration by the respective Governments.  One

of  the  principal  items  is  an  offer  by  the

Indonesian  Government  to  release  immediately

12,000  tons  of  slab rubber as  an  exceptional

measure to aid our unemployment problem. There is

also  a possibility of further limited quantities

of  slab rubber being exported until such time as

the  Indonesian Government is able completely  to

implement its policy of inducing the producers to

manufacture sheet rubber instead of the far  less

economical slab rubber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to say that I appreciate this

friendly and neighbourly gesture on the  part  of

the  Indonesian Government. I would add  that  we

have   offered  our  services  to  Indonesia   in

carrying  out its policy of helping producers  to

manufacture  sheet  rubber  by  facilitating  the

purchase    from   this   territory   of    their

requirements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian Government has requested that we

should  consider  taking action to  check  trade

which  is  illicit under their laws.  Within  the

framework  of  our  free port  policy  which  is

essential  to our very existence, this Government

considers  that there is a neighbourly obligation

to  assist  along these lines, and  this  request

will be sympathetically considered in all its  implications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further request for extension of payment in

United  States  dollars  in  respect  of  produce

imported  for  re-export to hard  currency  areas

will be pursued. It is one of the subjects which

I  shall discuss with the Colonial Office  on  my

projected visit next December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian authorities reaffirm that, under

the  new Indonesian import policy, there  are  no

discriminatory  restrictions  on   imports   from

Malaya,   and   that  Singapore  and   Federation

merchants  will  be  able  freely  to  quote  for

regular Indonesian requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of return goods permitted to be carried

by fish carriers returning to Rhio and Lingga was

received. This list has been a matter of  lengthy

correspondence and I am happy that agreement  has

at last been reached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been clarified that Malayan/

Indonesian films will in future be exchanged on a

basis  of equal reciprocity of showing, over  and

above a quota of seven Malayan films allowed  per

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also received an assurance that there

will  be no restrictions on imports of salt  fish

from  us,  provided the salt fish is  of  Malayan

origin  and  subject to the pattern of Indonesian

trade. This is particularly helpful, Sir, to  the

fishing  industry of Malaya and, to some  extent,

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of facilitating the issue of visas

for  businessmen is being actively  pursued,  and

other   matters   are   being   investigated   in

anticipation  of the discussions of the  Economic

Mission. An Indonesian fact-finding mission  will

be  coming  to  Singapore shortly  to  study  our

procedure about the end of this month.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All items discussed have been set out in the

form of an agreed record signed by the leaders of

the   Working   Parties   of   both   sides   for

confirmation by their respective Governments, and

a  possible  agenda for the Economic Mission  has

been drawn up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have extended to Indonesia an invitation for

its  Economic  Mission to come to  Singapore,  at

least for the first part of the meeting projected

for  early January, and are awaiting a  reply  to

this invitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Local Government, Lands and

Housing,  my friend and colleague the Hon.  Inche

Abdul  Hamid Bin Haji Jumat, and Sir Sydney Caine

pursued  enquiries with a view to closer cultural

relations, and tentative arrangements  have  been

arrived at as a first step in what is hoped  will

be ever closer cultural relations with Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to inform hon. Members that in the

Working  Party  there prevailed complete  harmony

between  the Federation representatives  and  our

own,  and  I  desire to thank the Federation  for

this brotherly co-operation. I also wish to thank

the  leader and members of the Working Party  for

their   efforts  on  our  behalf,  and  I   would

particularly mention Sir Sydney Caine, Mr J.  A.

D.  Morrison,  Mr  Yap Pheng  Geck,  Mr  D.  T.

Assomull, Mr L. L. Best, Mr Tan Hock Seng,  Mr

Kwek  Soh  Loh, and Mr W. H. McNeil,  for  their

public spirit in giving generously of their  time

and advice during the negotiations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it right, Sir, to add a tribute to the

spirit   in   which  the  Indonesian   Government

approached  the solution of the trading  problems

between  us, and it is my sincere hope that  that

spirit,   which   we   fully  reciprocate,   will

culminate next January in an agreement that  will

be   the   framework  for  healthy  and  friendly

relations with our neighbours.

<div align="center"><b>REPORT ON THE DRAINAGE OF THE BEDOK AND KETAPANG CATCHMENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by Mr Francis Thomas)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already

referred  to  the Report on the drainage  of  the

Bedok  and  Ketapang Catchments  which  has  been

tabled.  I  think the House may be glad  to  hear

what  action  is being taken. The recommendations

of  this Report have been accepted by Government,

and we are getting on with the necessary work  as

fast as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will observe, from the last paragraph in

the  Report, that the first work to be undertaken

is  the construction of the dam and spillways for

the  impounding reservoir. Action to acquire  the

necessary  land  for  this  project  is  now   in

progress, and work on the reservoir will start as

soon  as  we are entitled to enter on  the  land.

Thereafter  the construction of the dam  and  the

erection of the spillways should be completed  in

about two months, if the weather is not too  bad.

This  means that if we can get possession of  the

land  before the end of this month, a very  large

measure  of protection to the Bedok and  Ketapang

areas  may have been afforded by the end  of  the

year.  We can only hope and pray that there  will

be no abnormally heavy rains before that time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I mentioned earlier, the bund below the

Changi   Road   has  already  been   raised   and

strengthened, and the main drainage  channel  has

been  straightened and deepened.  These  measures

should  give  some  degree of protection  against

flooding.  The  real  protection  will  only   be

assured   when  the  flood  reservoir  has   been

completed. It is unfortunate that large works  of

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



nature  cannot be planned and executed in  a  few

weeks  or  a few months. It was just not possible

to start earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will see from the Report what careful

investigation and surveying has to be done before

a  workable  scheme  can be formulated.  This  is

particularly the case when there are complicating

factors  like the coral reef out at sea  off  the

Bedok  River  outlet which necessitates  special

measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have noticed that the Report

envisages   that  the  area  of  the   impounding

reservoir should be used as an open space  during

the  period  when it is not holding  floodwaters.

The  City  Council  has now  suggested  that  the

reservoir should be used as a reservoir the whole

year  round.  The  City  Council  Water  Engineer

believes  that it should be possible  to  get  an

average of almost two million gallons of water  a

day  from  the water impounded in the  reservoir.

This will be a very useful addition to the water

which  the City Council expects to get  from  the

wells  which are being sunk in the Bedok plain,

and  this  additional water supply  is  an  added

justification for spending a considerable sum  of

money on the drainage scheme and on the necessary

land acquisition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must apologise, Sir, to hon. Members of this

House that I was not able to introduce this  Bill

at  our  sitting last month and thereby give  the

House    longer   time   to   study   the   Bill.

Unfortunately  I  was not able to  get  the  Bill

ready in time before this morning's sitting,  and

it  has therefore been necessary, Sir, for me  to

ask  the House to proceed with all the stages  of

the Bill this morning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is short and seeks merely to provide

for  the  continuation of the system of  national

registration which, as hon. Members  will  know,

is   at   present  governed  by  some   Emergency

Regulations,  which Regulations will  lapse  when

the  period  of  the  Emergency  ceases  on  21st

October.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that this Bill, which is short,

will not prove controversial and that Members  of

this House will agree that the system of identity

cards  has proved of very real use and assistance

to  the  people of this Colony on  all  sorts  of

occasions  when  they  seek  an  easy  means   of

establishing their identity. I also hope that the

House  will  agree to put this Bill  through  its

stages this morning to enable that system  to  be

continued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations will be made to provide for the

details,   and   those   Regulations   will    be

substantially  the same as the  existing  system,

and  I  very  much  doubt  whether  the  ordinary

citizen  of Singapore will, in fact, notice  this

formal  change which I ask the House to  make.  I

beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> I beg to second.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there

are  only two points I wish to make. If you  look

at  your  identity card, you will find  that  not

only  the  nationality but also the race  of  the

person has to be filled in. If we are to overcome

racial consciousness and racial antagonisms,  and

if  we  are to build up a nation, it seems to  me

that there should be no reference to race on  our

national  registration  card.  I  hope  that  the

Government will look into this matter and see  if

an early change can be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, now that it has been decided to

continue  the identity card system, and this  has

our full support, I hope that the Government will

introduce  appropriate  rules  to  see  that  the

Singapore  citizens get their identity  cards  in

proper  order and their addresses up to date.  If

we  are to have accurate electoral rolls, this is

essential.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  how very true what the Chief Secretary (Mr

Goode)  has  said,  that the average  citizen  of

Singapore would not know that there has been  any

change! But for us, who are conscious that  there

has  been  a  change, I think  it  would  not  be

without  value to weigh the significance of  that

change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identity card was a product of the war,

imported  from Britain into Singapore at  a  time

when  the Government felt that it was in a  state

of  war.  It was part and parcel of the Emergency

Regulations; one of those irritating restrictions

on  personal liberties which we hoped would  be

got  rid  of as we get rid of the Emergency.  But

now  it  is  proposed to make it a  part  of  our

normal  lives.  There is not even a  pretence  of

making  it last for only a matter of three years.

It  is an attempt, without too much publicity, to

make  the  identity card part and parcel  of  our

lives. I am not going into the merits of having a

national  registration  system  by  which  social

security can be equitably apportioned and all the

other   useful  by-products  of  having  national

registration.  I  do  not wish  to  debate  these

points.  But  I wish to point out,  as  one  who,

perhaps  unrealistically, believes in  a  liberal

way  of life, that it is a marked departure  from

the  normal  traditions of  a  liberal  civilised

society.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You are wrong!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am wrong? May I tell the

Chief Minister, Mr Speaker, Sir, that one of the

first  things they were pleased to do in England,

some  years  after the war - because they  had  got

tied up with the identity card system by tying it

up  with  rationing and all the  other  necessary

regulations in a Socialist state - was  to  abolish

the  identity card system? A state of affairs was

reached  where judges refused to convict citizens

when they refused to produce their identity cards

on the demand of a police officer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the evil by-products of this

identity   card  system  is  that  everytime   a

policeman sees you, he asks, `Teng-kee'? Where is

your   identity  card? " 'Teng-kee  manah'?"   The

unfortunate  hawker or pedestrian or  cyclist  or

motorist or lorry-driver begins to look upon this

scrap of paper as something which, somehow or the

other, gets him down every time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been spirited citizens in

Singapore - and I had the privilege of fighting for

some of them - who, for traffic offences, have been

asked  to produce their identity card. It becomes

a  habit - a policeman asking you, "I want  to  see

who  you  are, and I want to 'fix' you! Where  is

your   identity  card?"  It  is  not  an  offence

connected  with  the  Emergency.  It  is  not  an

offence connected with the security of the State.

It  is  just a bad habit. These traffic offenders

then  have  to go to court. The police  prosecute

and say, "Emergency Regulation so and so, on such

a day, so and so demanded the identity card." But

the citizen who is keenly aware of his democratic

rights  refused to produce his identity  card.  I

know  of a case in England where a British judge,

well-known  for  his  asperity,  had  refused  to

convict and had castigated the Police for  having

abused  the  identity  card  system.  Sir,   this

identity card system has got nothing to  do  with

motoring offences and all the other minor  things

in life. But it has become a habit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, when I tried to put forward this

liberal  point of view, I was smacked  down  very

vigorously  and told, "This is quite a  different

world  and,  therefore, we have  quite  different

standards. Any citizen, even though he  has  done

nothing  to  warrant a policeman asking  for  his

identity card, must produce it in conformity with

the law, and there must be proper respect for the

law."  So, the spirited citizen, because  he  was

conscious of his fundamental rights, was properly

smacked  for $25 and asked to behave  himself  in

the future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope we are aware that what we are doing

today  is  to  accept a system which  cannot  be

defended as democratic. It is not that  I  am  in

favour  of people going off on lost weekends  and

not wishing to sign their identity cards on hotel

registers; though I think that even such  persons

should be entitled to certain human liberties and

they should not have to put their mark everywhere

they  go  to  show  that they  have  been  there.

"Identity card? - I know mine by heart, because  I

have  signed it so often as 'Four E, 00635'."  It

is  part of the regimentation of a police  state,

and one of the things we accuse the Communists of

doing,  that they document people; they  regiment

them;  they  get everybody docketed in  dossiers.

We,  in  a liberal democracy, believe in  liberal

conditions.  We  value  human  freedom  and   the

liberty of the individual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not heard sufficient argument debated as

to  why  the social schemes which the Government

proposes to introduce could not be done in  some

way  other than by the identity card. It is quite

possible  that it is a convenient  way,  but  the

difference  is  this:  we  are  now  making  this

identity  card part and parcel not  only  of  our

lives  for the period of the Emergency in Malaya,

but part and parcel of our normal lives. This,  I

am  sure the Chief Minister will agree, will  not

be  one  of  those legislative acts of  which  he

could  be  proud as a democratic  and  a  liberal

humanitarian.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr

Lee  Kuan Yew), Mr Speaker, Sir, referred to the

identity  card  as an irritating  restriction  on

personal  liberty. I rather agree that all  these

things are irritating restrictions. They have  to

be very often, but they have positive advantages.

Traffic  lights are often exceedingly irritating,

as are restrictions about where you can park your

car. They are irritating, but, nevertheless, they

are   necessary  for  the  general  flow  of  the

traffic.   Identity  cards  may  very   well   be

necessary for the general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



running  of  Singapore. Although the hon.  Member

says he does not wish to debate the usefulness of

the  identity card system, I think it is fair  to

point  out,  from  my  personal  experience,  its

usefulness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the floods which took place last year - I

have  already  mentioned them this morning - I  was

concerned  with  organising a  relief  centre  at

which  we  had  some hundreds of  people  passing

through. The maximum was 900 refugees sleeping in

the  centre in a single night. We organised large

distributions of food, clothing, money,  chickens

and  all sorts of things. All passed through  the

centre,  and  for  that work  (which  had  to  be

improvised  among largely illiterate people)  the

identity  card was absolutely essential.  It  was

the  only possible way of seeing that people pass

through the queue once, and not two, three,  four

or five times. It was also essential for a house-to-house  survey. Our survey teams went  out  and

some went through about a thousand households and

recorded  details; and in order to be  sure  that

there  was no confusion of any kind, the identity

card  was  solid  documentary evidence;  where  a

Chinese name, spoken by a Hokkien, recorded by  a

Cantonese,  is  written down in English,  it  may

become an exceedingly different name and may lead

to  confusion. Therefore, especially in times  of

emergency,   in   my  personal  experience,   the

identity card is a most valuable and useful piece

of social mechanism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substance of the hon. Member's argument

against identity cards was the occasional  abuses

that  occur, that they are troublesome  and  that

sort of thing. Well, the answer to that, I think,

is  that  if abuses occur, they can be  remedied,

and  this Assembly, as I have pointed out before,

is the place to remedy them. It is the fashion at

the  moment  in  Singapore to run around  talking

very  vigorously  in  public assemblies - not  this

Assembly - but  in Kampong Tai Seng  or  in  Farrer

Park, or wherever it may be, and to put out a lot

of  highly contentious propaganda which has  very

little  basis in fact, if there is any. In  fact,

it is sometimes completely contrary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



to  the facts. That is a way of winning a certain

measure  of  popular support,  but  it  does  not

affect the law. The place to deal with the law is

in  the Assembly. The way to deal with any  abuse

of  the  law is to bring it to the notice of  the

Assembly for its joint consideration and  action.

The  fact  that abuses may have occurred  in  the

past  is  an  argument for the Assembly  to  take

action  to ensure that they do not occur  in  the

future.  It  is not an argument to throw  away  a

useful part of the social mechanism.

'Race'  on  them.  As regards his  second  point,

which  was to ask that a rule should be  made  to

ensure that holders of identity cards keep  their

addresses  up to date, may I remind him  and  the

public  of  Singapore  that  that  is  already  a

requirement of the system of registration?  I  do

ask  all Members of this House, and everybody who

great number of persons in this territory do keep

their  addresses up to date, because, of  course,

one  of  the,  I  hope, merits of our  system  of

national  registration is that it has enabled  us

to prepare our electoral roll.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar managed to walk his

tight  rope without making it clear to me whether

he   was   prepared  to  say   he   was   against

registration  or  he  was for  it.  He  contented

himself  largely  with  suggesting  that  it  was

undemocratic. He is entitled to that  opinion.  I

would  merely point out that there  are  a  great

number of democratic countries where a system  of

identity  cards has been in force for  very  many

years.  He,  I suppose, is in a somewhat  awkward

position.  He probably felt that it was necessary

to  concentrate  on  what  he  thought  were  the

undesirable by-products, and I agree  that  there

are some undesirable by-products, but I feel that

he tended to ignore the good by-products -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leave be granted to introduce a Bill

governing the conditions of employment, and the

rights and privileges of clerical and shop

assistants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this Bill, Sir, we have always known

that  Singapore  is a commercial  city  and  that

since days immemorial it has been the clerks  and

the  shop  assistants  who  have  played  a  very

important  part  in this life in Singapore.  They

are  the people, Sir, that contribute largely  to

the  smooth  working of commerce,  and  they  are

necessary in every department of trade or labour.

We  have  not  in  the  past witnessed  too  many

strikes, and we believe that this has been due to

the  good  sense of responsibility of the  clerks

and  shop  assistants. Perhaps, Sir, it might  be

that they have not been well organised; but it is

the  duty  of this Assembly to protect all  those

who are not organised as well as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



all  those who are organised. It is also the duty

of  this  Assembly  to enact, wherever  possible,

fair legislation for all concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to dwell shortly on the

difficulties of the clerical workers as  well  as

the shop assistants. Today we do find that clerks

and  shop  assistants have no  regular  hours  of

work.  It is a fact that is known to all  that  a

large  number  of  them work  overtime;  a  large

number work 12 hours or even 14 hours a day;  and

also  that their work includes not only  clerical

work  or work appertaining to the terms of  their

employment, but sometimes they do have to perform

work  just  like  manual labourers.  It  is  also

within  the knowledge of all the Members of  this

Assembly,  and everybody in Singapore, that  shop

assistants  do  have no leave. Clerical  workers,

too, may not be able to utilise their leave or to

get  their  leave because there  is  always  that

pressure of work as stated by the employers. I am

sure that even City Council employees as well  as

Government    employees   do   experience    such

difficulties.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Including the Ministers!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> It is therefore, Sir, my

view  that  legislation be enacted  so  that  the

hours  of  work  for clerical  workers  and  shop

assistants be regulated. There should be  medical

leave, free medical attention, annual leave,  and

more  important still, they should  get  overtime

pay.  The last important point, Sir, is that  the

present  wave of strikes is probably due  to  the

fact that no legislation has been enacted to give

them  a  fair  wage. If we can  legislate  for  a

minimum  wage for this class of workers here  who

do  a  set  of  duties  not dissimilar  to  their

colleagues - and   I  think  it  is   possible   to

legislate  for  such  a  minimum  wage - we   would

probably   have   removed  discontent   in   this

direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that all those who are interested in

this Bill - if leave were granted and the Bill were

introduced -  will come forward and work  with  us

for  the benefit of all concerned. Sir, I beg  to

move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members

will remember that in moving the First Reading of

the  Labour Bill, I did make mention that  it  is

the  proposal  of  the  Government  to  introduce

further  legislation to protect the interests  of

clerks  and shop assistants. The fact that  there

has  been  a delay in tabling these two Bills  is

because  I am awaiting the passage of the  Labour

Bill,  which has gone to a Select Committee,  and

the  Report has now been tabled. I will move  the

adoption  of  the Report at the next  sitting  in

November.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Ministry have found difficulty in

regard  to interpretation. That is why there  has

been some delay. To find out when a clerk is  not

a  clerk - that is a question that has occupied us

for  some  time.  Regarding shop assistants  too,

what kind of shop assistants should be protected?

As   to   shop   assistants,  what  should   they

cover? - people  working  in  restaurants,   people

working  in dispensaries, people working in  food

shops, and all sorts of other things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy, Sir, to introduce legislation to

protect  the interests of workmen, but  it  must,

first   of  all,  be  necessary  for  the  Labour

Ministry  to have an adequate staff to  supervise

and  to see that legislation is not abused.  Take

the  Weekly Holidays Ordinance introduced by  the

Progressive    Party    during    the    previous

administration. There have been so  many  abuses.

So there is that worry that, unless we strengthen

the  staff  in  the  Labour Ministry  and  unless

workers get more united and form unions of  their

own, whatever legislation we provide can and will

be abused by unscrupulous employers.

happy  to see hon. Members opposite taking  their

responsibilities  seriously that  the  Government

will  support  this motion and will  permit  this

Bill  to be placed before the House; and I  trust

that  when we produce our own, we will co-operate

on  the  ultimate  Bill to be discussed  by  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are

constantly being amused in this Assembly  by  the

inconsistent  ways  in  which  the  Labour  Front

manifests  itself. The Minister for Labour  is  a

much more experienced politician and, as such, he

does  not  take off his hat indiscriminately.  He

very  wisely  pointed out that if  any  political

kudos  were to be made out of the Shop and Office

Employees  Bill, then it should go to the  Labour

Front because they were the first to mention  it.

But  the  Chief  Minister is  quite  a  different

person. He is a man singularly generous by nature

and  he wants to compliment his colleagues on the

other side of the House -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Not colleagues!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Your colleagues!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> My colleagues? Indeed, Sir, I

have much better colleagues than these! Now, Sir,

you get this curious spectacle of the Progressive

Party  that,  for three and a half  years,  could

have  moved and passed such a Bill and yet  doing

nothing about it -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Not too late to repent!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Let us get on with

the debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I fear it is a little bit

too  late  to repent. I knew a union  called  the

Shop Assistants Union.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



As  a matter of fact, I assisted them in drafting

a  memorandum which was presented to  Progressive

Party  Councillors. The then  Progressive  Party

considered  the matter for some time.  There  was

some caustic correspondence in the English Press

pointing out the delay, and it was even suggested

that they were against it. Then came a firm Party

denial  and  after  that  it  just  subsided  and

nothing further was done. Now the lesson has been

sharply administered on the Councillors - I do  not

know  how  many deposits they lost  in  the  last

election,  but  I  am  told  that  it   was   not

inconsiderable. The Chief Minister is hoping that

it  is  not too late for them to repent. I  think

that they have missed the bus. If this is the way

they want to convince the people of Singapore and

of Malaya that the Progressive Party is a virile,

vigorous, and vehement group of people determined

to  see that justice is done to the workers, then

I say there is very little future indeed for that

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the motion itself, it has been

suggested - I  will not say it is  more  than  just

suggested - that we in the People's Action Party do

not  shoulder our responsibilities, and  that  we

should  undertake legislation on  behalf  of  the

Government. Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Do your job!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed, we are! That is what we

are  here  for!  We defined our job  specifically

before we came here, and are here to fulfil  that job!

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some of the

difficulties that will arise in this Bill will be

difficulties  of draftsmanship, as the  Hon. the

Minister  for  Labour has pointed  out,  because,

much  as  I have a high regard for the linguistic

abilities  of the hon. Members in the Progressive

Party,  I  very  seriously doubt  if  they  could

produce  a  piece of legislation which could  not

but lead to a spate of litigation as to what they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



might have meant, what they could have meant, and

what  they, in fact, must be construed as  having

intended  the thing to mean. But I am  sure,  now

that the Hon. the Chief Minister has joined hands

with  his  "not"  colleagues on my  side  of  the

House,  the services of the Government  draftsmen

will  be  put  at the disposal of the Progressive

Party,  and  in  some  way  they  will  also   be

associated with the process of government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe

that  in all legislation there must be difficulty

about  terms of definition and other things;  but

we believe that with goodwill and co-operation we

will  be  able to overcome such difficulties.  We

would  like  to say that if leave is  granted  to

introduce this Bill, we will definitely take into

consideration all suggestions and incorporate the

good ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect co-operation from the Government side,

and they have freely given it to us. I think this

is  one way whereby the Government has shown that

it  is  capable of acknowledging things that  are

good, and I think that is in the right direction.

The   situation  is  contrary  and  diametrically

opposite  when Members, I regret to  say,  on  my

side  of  the  House have nothing  to  offer  but

unjust  criticism.  They have  nothing  to  offer

except to hope that something that might be  good

will  not  come  true. Such a  negative  attitude

should never have been adopted. I have heard some

time ago that it is the P.A.P. that comes to  the

rescue of this and of that! We have never  had  a

friendly hand offered to us, who are trying to do

something  that is for the good of the people.  I

regret   that   this  attitude  is   adopted   by

responsible  Members  of this  Assembly.  I  only

hope, Sir, that all of us here will adopt a  more

co-operative spirit in bringing anything that  is

good to the people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure has been taken because, as Members

are  aware, a Local Government Committee  is  now

sitting to re-examine and make recommendations on

the  future  organisation of local government  in

Singapore,  and it is hoped that  the  new  local

government  legislation to introduce  changes  in

the local government set-up would be in force  by

July   next  year.  It  is  therefore  considered

unnecessary  to have new Councillors  elected  or

appointed who would hold office for less  than  a

year,  and, as the intention is to dispense  with

elections  this  year,  the  completion  of   the

revision of the electoral register by the end  of

1955 can also be dispensed with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Merchandise Marks Ordinance provides

statutory  definitions for trade marks  and  trade

descriptions and has, as its aim, the avoidance of

the  use of forgery of marks or trade descriptions

for  merchandise. This Ordinance is  based,  to  a

large  extent, upon the United Kingdom Merchandise

Mark  Act,  1887. It was recently decided  in  the

United  Kingdom to amend this Ordinance so  as  to

define  more  closely  trade description,  and  in

particular to include under the heading of  "Trade

description" the words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"as to the standard of quality of any goods

according  to  a classification commonly  used  or

recognised in the trade";



<br><br>and also again to include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"as to the fitness for purpose, strength,

performance or behaviour of any goods".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of these additions is to make it an

offence  to  apply  a false description  of  these

characteristics  to  goods. In future,  misleading

trade  descriptions, as distinct from false  trade

descriptions,  will become an offence  under  this

Ordinance.   These  amendments   are   a   further

safeguard  for the public against the exploitation

by unscrupulous traders or manufacturers who apply

false or misleading descriptions to their goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Bar Committee and the Singapore

Trade  Advisory  Council have been consulted,  and

are  of the opinion that similar amendments should

be  made  in  the local legislation.  The  Central

Advisory  Committee on Trade and Supplies  in  the

Federation   of   Malaya,   which   is   a    body

corresponding to our

uniform policy in both the territories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the provisions of

section  5 of the Civil Law Ordinance by restoring

the  provisions of the repealed section 4  of  the

English Sale of Goods Act. Section 5 of the  Civil

Law  Ordinance provides that in all  issues  which

arise in Singapore with respect to mercantile  law

and  regarding which there are no local laws,  the

law  to be administered shall be the same as would

be  administered in England. Under  this  section,

the  English Sale of Goods Act, 1893,  is  law  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act in

England  was  repealed by the English  Law  Reform (Enforcement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



of Contracts) Act, 1954, so that contracts for the

sale of goods of the value of �10 and upwards need

no  longer be evidenced in writing by the party to

be  charged,  nor  need  there  be  acceptance  of

something  given in earnest or in part payment  to

make the contract enforceable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business transactions in Singapore differ from

those in England in that more often than not  they

are  carried out through the medium of  a  broker.

The  broker, working on a commission, is therefore

an  interested party and he would now be  able  to

give evidence on oral contracts as a corroborative

witness. Litigation could thus take place, heavily

weighted on one side, which would be impossible if

the  requirements of the repealed section 4 of the

Sale  of  Goods Act were in force. Representations

have   been  received,  including  those  of   the

Singapore  Bar  Committee that, the  provisions  of

section  4 of the Sale of Goods Act should  be  in

force  in Singapore. The Government has considered

these   representations  and  agree   that   these

provisions should be restored in the form of  this

amendment to the Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very short and simple Bill. The

effect  of it is to amend section 44 of the Police

Force  Ordinance which at present  provides  that

gratuities  and  pensions may  be  prescribed  for

special  police  officers who  are  mobilised  for

active  service.  That  does  not  enable  us   to

prescribe   pensions   and  gratuities   for   the

Volunteer  Special Constabulary who  are  not,  in

fact,  mobilised  for active service.  Appropriate

pensions and gratuities for those members of  that

force who suffer injuries or death in carrying out

their  duties have been provided for in a  set  of

regulations made as Emergency Regulations in 1948.

I am sure the House will agree that it is right in

principle   that   provision  for   pensions   and

gratuities for these men should be made under  the

substantive law and not be dependent on  Emergency

Regulations,  and,  in any  event,  as  the  House

knows, the Emergency Regulations will lapse  later

this  month.  It is for this reason, Sir,  that  I

seek  this  House's  approval for  the  amendments

contained in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this motion, I should like to take up

a  minute  or  two  of  the House's  time  to  say

something  of  the Volunteer Special  Constabulary

who are the people most affected by this piece  of

legislation.  They consist of some 1,200  citizens

of Singapore who voluntarily, in their spare time,

give  assistance  to  our  regular  police  force.

Members  of this House will well recall  the  part

that those men played in the riots that we had  in

May  and we paid tribute to them on that occasion.

Members  may  not appreciate that  every  day  and

every night there are members of Volunteer Special

Constabulary who turn out on ordinary police  duty

with the regular members of the police force,  and

I   am  sure  the  House  will  join  with  me  in

expressing our appreciation of the public  service

that these men give.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already in the few years that the force has been

in  existence,  it  has won  formal  recognition.

Three  members  of  the force have  been  awarded

Colonial  Police medals for meritorious  service.

One  member has received a Colonial Police  medal

for  gallantry, and one a King's Commendation for

brave  conduct. A number of others have  received

commendations  from the Commissioner  of  Police.

Five  of  them  have  given their  lives  in  the

service of Singapore. So it is, Sir, with a sense

of   high  appreciation  of  these  men  and   in

gratitude for what they do that I ask this  House

to approve the Second Reading of this Bill.

Second   Reading  of  this  Bill  last  month   I

maintained that such laws should be in force  for

a period of three months only, so that after that

period Members of the Legislative Assembly  would

have  the  right  to say whether these  Emergency

laws should be continued or not. As the Assembly,

however,  has approved the Bill in principle  and

it  will  become  part of our  laws,  subject  to

amendment this morning, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



now  move an amendment that the duration of  this

Bill be for one year instead of three years. I do

not  wish  to  repeat what I  said  at  the  last

sitting  of this Assembly, but I must  point  out

that  our  job is not only to pass new  laws  but

also  to  see that the existing laws are properly

enforced by the Executive without favour  or  ill-will.  The fact that each year Government has  to

come  to  us and give an account of these special

powers entrusted to them before they are extended

for  another year will act as a safeguard for the

public against possible misuse of these powers by

over-zealous officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this Bill vitally affects the man-in-the-street, I consulted many members of the public

and  they all agreed with me that it is necessary

to  have  such  laws at the present moment,  when

there  are not only subversive activities against

law  and  order,  but there is  also  a  definite

increase  in assault by gangsters, extortion  and

even kidnapping.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in rising to support

the amendment moved by my hon. Friend, I wish  to

make it quite clear, beyond any reasonable doubt,

that we of the Progressive Party reluctantly  but

firmly  agree with the main principles  contained

in  the  seven  Bills before us in the  Committee

stage  today, subject to the amendments  we  have

tabled.  I  say "reluctantly", because  it  is  a

tragedy  that such legislation should be required

at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust that I am not being irrelevant in saying

once  again that we would have preferred  to  see

the   Emergency  Regulations  retained  and   not

embodied  in  the ordinary laws of this  country,

for  one  salient reason: that Regulations  which

are  extraordinary, and which are  repugnant  for

the  very  reason  that they  are  extraordinary,

should  come  up  for periodical review  by  this

Assembly, for the Government to render an account

of  its  stewardship in respect of them, and  for

the  elected  representatives of  the  people  to

decide  whether or not the Government  have  made

out  a case for their continuation. However,  the

hon.  Members  opposite have  decided  otherwise.

Their majority have carried the day, and our task

as   a   responsible  Opposition  Party,   having

accepted  the  principle  of  this  Bill  as   an

unpleasant necessity, is to seek ways  and  means

to improve it by amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be willing to agree that my hon. Friends

opposite have been at pains



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>

to  present a Bill which, in some respects, is an

improvement on the previous Regulations,  and  to

point out that it is fair and less stringent than

those in force in India, Pakistan and Burma;  but

these arguments are, to a large extent, nullified

if  a  Bill, which it is agreed is of a temporary

nature required for emergency reasons, is  to  be

given   a   life  of  three  years  without   any

opportunity  for  periodical  review  as  to  its

continued  necessity.  Let  me  remind  the  hon.

Gentlemen opposite of one thing. They were,  Sir,

of   the  opinion - to  use  the  Hon. the   Chief

Minister's own words - that they could "sweep away

the    entire   structure   of   the    Emergency

Regulations",  although for years  the  permanent

Executive  had  been giving good  and  convincing

reasons   every  three  months  why   they   were

essential  to  the peace and good order  of  this

country. They have had the candour to admit  that

they  were  wrong,  and,  in  fairness,  we  must

commend that candour; but in view of this, is  it

reasonable for a popularly-elected Government  to

swing  almost to the other extreme  and  ask  for

debate  on  their  operation  of  these  two  new

Ordinances  to be put in cold storage  for  three

years?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangers of such a length of time should be

obvious. We of the Progressive Party are  anxious

to  ensure that the people of this country - and by

that  I  mean  the  95 per cent law-abiding  good

citizens of this country - are reminded at  regular

intervals that these laws have been enacted for a

particular purpose to fight a particular  battle.

We cannot say too firmly and too often that these

Emergency  Regulations, or rather laws,  as  they

will  now  be, are intended to protect  all  law-abiding  citizens  who have nothing  whatever  to

fear from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the people are not regularly reminded of this

truth, many will, through ignorance and inability

to think clearly for themselves, become a prey to

the insidious propaganda of the Malayan Communist

Party,  or  of  the  travelling  circus  of  tub-thumpers of the People's Action Party who try  to

hoodwink  the unwary into thinking that they  are

being oppressed. On this ground alone, therefore,

I think that the Government will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>

be  making  a  grave  mistake if  they  reject  our

amendment and refuse to have their actions  weighed

and  examined  at the end of a year,  so  that  the

ordinary man-in-the-street can be reminded  of  the

dangers which surround him, if these dangers  still

exist, as I fear they may well be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to another point. Nobody on the

Government Benches will disagree with  me  when  I

say  that these Bills before us are no better than

limited  preventive measures - not measures designed

to  remove  the evil influences that  are  in  our

midst - but only to hold them in check. To revert to

an  old saying - Cure is better than prevention  in

the grave problems which face the Government. And

we  are  entitled  to ask this:  If  we  give  the

Government  carte blanche for three years  to  use

these preventive measures, what guarantee have  we

that curative measures will not be neglected? What

better  guarantee  could we  have  but  that  this

House,  and through this House the people,  should

be  informed at least once a year of what positive

curative  measures the Government is  adopting  to

cleanse  the body politic? By demanding,  Sir,  an

annual review of this Bill, we want to ensure  not

merely  that the Government is operating it fairly

and  justifiably,  but we also want  to  ask  what

positive  measures they have taken to  render  its

continuation unnecessary at the earliest  possible

moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Secretary has said that it is

hoped  that  the  measures would  only  be  for  a

limited  period  during  which  the  citizens   of

Singapore  may "learn by experience to distinguish

between  liberty and licence, between good leaders

and  bad  leaders".  This is just  the  point.  An

annual  review of this Bill will make it necessary

for  Government  to  render  an  account  of  what

positive  steps  they have taken  to  educate  the

people  of Singapore into making this distinction.

This  is something which an Opposition Party  has

every   right  to  demand  of  the  hon.   Members

opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate this point. Of the famous Four

Freedoms which form perhaps the best definition of

a  free  world  and a free democratic  country,  I

believe that Singapore is most sorely in need



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



of freedom from fear, freedom from intimidation by

gangsters,  thugs and their agents,  freedom  from

the  threat  of the consequence of speaking  one's

own mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if the men and women of this

country had the confidence to speak out what  they

know  and  what  they  feel,  without  threat   of

reprisals, this island would be turned in  a  very

short time into the sunny happy country which most

of us wish it to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because intimidation makes this impossible,

unfortunately  a  large  percentage  of  the  law-abiding people have an ingrained distrust  of  all

set  in authority over them - whether it is the  unlicensed threatening authority of the gangster, or

the  licensed  protective sheltering authority  of

the  police  force - here again it is necessary  to

educate the people to learn to distinguish, and  a

heavy responsibility lies with the first popularly-elected Government to tackle this problem with the

utmost    resolution.   Equally,   it    is    the

responsibility   of  an  Opposition   Party   like

ourselves to keep the Government on their toes  in

this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not expect this fundamental Singapore

problem  to  be solved in a year or  even  in  the

lifetime of one government; but we do ask that  we

should be given an annual account of what is being

done - not in the form of social services or  social

legislation which is one aspect of it - but  in  the

context of the Emergency Bill, and that we  should

have  the right to criticism if we feel that  more

effort is needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister, during his

speech  on  this Bill in this House,  in  inviting

amendments for its improvement, stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We would be glad to consider each and every

suggestion,   and   would   gladly   accept    any

improvements  which  do  not  destroy  the   basic

needs."



<br><br>In  the  light of this statement, I do not believe

that  the  Government  can  fail  to  accept  this

amendment.  Many  of  the hon. Gentlemen  opposite

have  had  the courage to swallow a part of  their

election    platforms - a   not   too   indigestible

operation, I hope - and I trust that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



will  now  have  the  courage and  the  wisdom  to

subject their handling of the considerable  powers

asked for in this Bill to the closest scrutiny  of

this  House in a year's time. I trust that, if  by

any  mischance this amendment is rejected, it will

not  be  because  of the threats of  the  People's

Action  Party. I hope, Sir, that the hon.  Members

opposite will not seek refuge in the argument that

the anti-social demonstrations of this group prove

only too clearly that this Bill is necessary - every

sensible  citizen knows that - and  that  we  should

therefore not quibble about a little matter of two

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, we wish to support - indeed it is our

duty  in the interests of Singapore to support - the

main  principles of this Bill, but we regret  that

we  cannot  go all the way with the Government  on

this  particular  measure, because  we  feel  very

strongly of the correctness of our stand.  Let  it

also be noted that we do not ask for a three-month

period but a halfway house of one year, because we

consider  that the Ordinance must have  that  much

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents in the rural area in the Tanglin

Division - and  they by far outnumber those  in  the

residential  area - are in favour of  this  Bill  so

long  as there are safeguards and so long  as,  in

other  words, it protects them and can be seen  to

protect them. I understand this to be true  of  my

colleagues in their constituencies, as I  have  no

doubt   it  is  true  of  the  majority   of   the

constituencies, though I have also no  doubt  that

the  constituencies  of Tanjong  Pagar  and  Bukit

Timah  must  be entirely different. It so  happens

that  the  Tanglin Division borders that of  Bukit

Timah  for a considerable distance along the Bukit

Timah/Clementi  Roads, and if the people  on  each

side  of  the border think so differently,  I  can

only  suppose - though I have not seen it - that there

must  be a fence along it, or perhaps one of those

nice  new  non-anti-Communist curtains! No  doubt,

the  hon.  Member will enlighten us. But,  because

the  kampong dwellers in Tanglin think as they do,

I want them to continue to be convinced and not to

be misled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember not only that the price of peace

is  eternal vigilance, but also that the  test  of

just   and   democratic  government   is   eternal

vigilance.  Without vigilance  there  can  be  no

peace and no democratic government. Not only, Sir,

must  the  Government  opposite  watch  their  own

handling  of  the  considerable powers  this  Bill

gives them, but they must give the Opposition  the

fullest  opportunity to share their  watchfulness.

Only  in this manner can the rights of the  people

and the way of democracy be served.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,   by   their  admission,  the  Labour   Front

Coalition  Government,  in presenting  this  Bill,

accepts the fact that this is a temporary measure.

One   fails  to  understand,  however,  why   this

Government  considers  a  three-year   period   as

temporary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give wide powers of detention and search to

the  Police  is against all democratic ideals  and

principles.  With  the advent of  self-government,

the  people  were  led  to  believe  that  a  more

democratic form of government would eventually  be

with us. The Public Security Bill seeks to curtail

individual   freedom  of  speech   and   movement.

Admittedly, there are certain features  introduced

in  this  Bill  which  are improvements  over  the

Emergency Regulations, such as the right of appeal

and  the  chance  of review after detention;  this

Bill,  nevertheless, imposes restrictions  on  the

people and as such it is repugnant to our concepts

of  freedom  and the principle of  the  rights  of

individual to due process of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party and I stand solidly against any

infringement  and curtailment of the  sanctity  of

the  individual, but, we are ready to  admit  that

the present days are difficult days, and it may be

necessary   to   introduce  urgent  and   adequate

measures  to take care of the present unrest,  and

that  opportunities  for  nefarious  elements   to

jeopardise public security be nipped in  the  bud.

My  Party and I are not convinced that this  state

of  affairs  would  last three years;  and  if  it

should   last   three  years,  then  the   present

Government could not be said to have done  a  good

job on behalf of the people. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



therefore strongly support the amendment moved  by

the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck).



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Chief Minister must always have the last word!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> This is my Bill!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, my Party

does  not  quibble and wobble and compromise.  The

Progressive   Party  speaks  of   the   "repugnant

provisions  of  this Bill". The  Democratic  Party

says  it is "undemocratic". Then, from that stand,

they  qualify  and qualify, retreat  and  retreat,

until they say, "If you make it one year, then  we

agree."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we in the People's Action

Party believe that it is no use saying that if  we

remove these Regulations, then we shall have chaos

and destruction and that we shall have the Malayan

Communist Party ruling Singapore. They are not  in

a position, nor are we in a position, to judge how

events will ultimately unfold themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It needs only a little

intelligent anticipation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> "A little intelligent

anticipation" would indicate to the Chief Minister

that    a   volte-face   could   only   lead    to

disillusionment  and  defeat.  If  we  believe  in

freedom,  then we must concede that  same  freedom

even  to those who do not honour it in the way  we

do. Further, if we want freedom to survive in this

part  of  the world, then we must live it and  not

just  talk it. If you want the people of Singapore

to  fight for democracy and freedom, it is no  use

telling them, "Ah! but one day we shall have  this

freedom, when we have destroyed Communism, when we

have  destroyed  the  P.A.P.,  and  when  we  have

destroyed any force which threatens to bring about

a social revolution."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can well imagine the Member for Tanglin (Mr

Ede)  hoping that there is a belt between him  and

Bukit  Timah, because I can well imagine  that  he

and  his Party are not capable of standing up  and

fighting for freedom. They only stand up and fight

for their own vested



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



interests, to preserve a Singapore in which  they,

the  fortunate few, have a comfortable niche.  Any

change which threatens to dislodge them from that

niche must be fought. I may be wrong in believing

that  if  you  fight  for freedom,  and  you  live

freedom,  you will not be destroyed. But  I  would

say  that  those who have given a pledge to  bring

freedom  to  us  have no right to  come  here  and

quibble between three years and one year, or three

months  and one month. If what is wrong for  three

years  can  be made right because it is one  year,

then  I say there is something gravely wrong  with

the  logical faculties of those in the Progressive

and  the  Democratic Parties. We are against  this

Bill in toto. We are not here seeking amendments to

mitigate  the  harshness of this Bill.  A  lot  of

words have been said -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order, Mr Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of order, Mr

Chairman,  Sir. If  he is  not  speaking  to  the

amendment, would he let others who wish  to,  have their say?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your point of order being?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> My point of order being that

he is certainly not speaking to the amendment, and

in those circumstances I respectfully suggest that

he  should not be permitted to continue to take up

the time of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has vaguely entered my mind

that  possibly the hon. Member is making a  Second

Reading speech. Perhaps he will come to the  point

now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, if one comes

to  the  point too soon, one destroys the pleasant

prospect  of holding the Labour Front in suspense.

The  Labour Front, of course, would like  to  rush

through  this  Bill  with  the  greatest  possible

speed.  My  point  as regards  this  amendment  is

this - that it is hypocritical -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. The word "hypocritical" is not parliamentary. Will you

withdraw it, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I must bow

to your ruling, and I therefore withdraw it. May

I say that if it is not hypocritical, then it is

something very akin to it!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we must make our stands

clear.  As even the Member for Tanglin has  said,

we must educate the people. If we want to educate

the  people,  we  must  have decisive,  clear-cut

stands, which the people can understand. I  would

like  to  remind  him that quibbles  and  wobbles

between three years and one year will never  help

to educate anyone except those with sophisticated

minds  like the members of the Progressive Party,

their friends and fellow travellers.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am

considerably attracted by the arguments in favour

of  this amendment. I will say quite frankly that

from     the     first,    when    I     received

it - representations   from   the   Trades    Union

Congress,   the  Chinese  Chamber  of   Commerce,

private representations from the hon. Members  of

the   Progressive   Party - it   seemed   to   have

considerable  validity, and in  truth  it  still

has.  There is good sense in saying that  a  law,

which, though immeasurably improving the existing

laws, is, nevertheless, one that is of preventive

arrest   and  detention,  should  be  under   the

constant  and  watchful eye of this  Assembly.  I

would  say this to hon. Members: that if it  were

only  a question of a review by this Assembly,  I

would  never  place  any  obstacle  in  its   way

whatsoever, any obstacle in the exercise  of  its

complete  powers of control over the  Government.

But  that is not what is really in issue, because

whether  the  Bill is for one year or  for  three

years,  this  House has at all  times  powers  to

question  at every sitting; powers of motions  on

adjournment;  powers of motion  for  repeal;  and

even  powers  of  compelling repeal  by  Members'

Bills.  So  its powers of control are completely

unrestricted, and at any time that hon.  Members

may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



require the Chief Secretary, or any other  Member

of  the  Government, to answer for  his  conduct,

they have only to table a motion and to call  for

a  debate.  We have never in the past obstructed,

and  certainly never will in the future, Sir - this

is   not  a  matter  in  our  hands,  it  is   in

yours - obstruct  hon. Members in the  exercise  of

their legitimate powers of control of Government.

Although desirous of meeting a valued request for

periodical  review,  I would suggest  to  Members

that  perhaps  a  periodical review  is  not  the

answer;  they should retain rather in mind  their

powers to call for a review in the normal course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recent weeks have brought to light somewhat

forcibly  the  extent  to  which  the  worker  of

Singapore  and others can be duped by the  forces

of  destruction. It must be remembered  that  the

common man of Singapore has, in the past, had but

little  opportunity for education;  has,  in  the

past,  had genuine grounds for grievances against

the  Government; has, in the past, learnt  to  be

embittered  towards Government. In the  words  of

the  Member  for  Tanglin they are  traditionally

"agin the Government". Therefore, Sir, the common

man   of  Singapore  is  easy  prey  to  cleverly

manipulated, dishonest political propaganda aimed

at destroying democratic government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have read, Sir, reports in the Press of

meetings held condemning this Bill - meetings  held

by   P.A.P. unions.  Gullible  reporters   have

exaggerated the attendances at these meetings, no

doubt   receiving  the  figures  from  thoroughly

dishonest organisers -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Radio Malaya included?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Radio Malaya can be

gullible, just as you can and I. But some of  the

statements,   Sir,   are   significant   of   the

receptivity  of  the common man in  Singapore  to

Hitlerian  falsehoods. It was, I believe,  Hitler

who  laid down the principle that the bigger  the

lie,  and the more often you repeat it, the  more

certain you are that it will be believed. Some of

these  lies, Sir, say that this Bill is aimed  at

wrecking  the trade union movement and  murdering

trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



unionists.  These are the people who were  on  the

same platform as the Member for Tanjong Pagar. The

trade  union  movement, Sir, has never  flourished

more  than  it has flourished under my Government.

It has never had more power; it has never had more

freedom;  it  has never had more protection,  even

for  the  dishonest.  The  only  danger  to  trade

unionism  comes  from  the dishonest  professional

agitators who have never been labourers  in  their

lives,  but take paid posts as agitators in P.A.P.

trade  unions.  As for murdering trade  unionists,

Sir,  I  will just draw your attention  to  it  to

indicate the extent to which these plague-carrying

rats can carry their falsehoods. They do not wince

from  lies,  Sir.  Lies are part  of  their  daily

bread.  They will tell you that they are not  pro-Communists; they are not anti-Communists; they are

not Communists; whatever lies best suit them - lies

every one! By lies they live, and lies have ridden

the streets these past weeks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of their lies from public platforms, on

which the hon. Member sat - two hon. Members sitting

opposite - is that any detective can arrest anyone

and   detain  him  for  two  years.  I  repeat - any

detective can arrest anyone and detain him for two

years. Nothing about the fact that he can only  be

detained  by  order of the Council  of  Ministers;

that  he can only continue to be detained by order

of  the Tribunal of Judges; that you have to  have

that  detention  reviewed every  six  months.  The

Council of Ministers has to look at the case every

six  months.  This, it seems, is  worse  than  the

Emergency  Regulations! They are  welcome  to  the

Emergency   Regulations,  if   they   want   them.

"Singapore  is  a jail with no difference  whether

you  are  in  or out." Some of those  persons  who

spoke  have experience, and I trust they will  one

day give me an opportunity for giving them further

experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent of the falsehoods in public, without

shame,  no mincing of these foul lies - that is  the

technique employed on platforms on which the  hon.

Members  opposite have stood. The attack has  been

concentrated  on the Labour Front  Government.  It

seems these men are too



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



great   cowards   to  attack  the   U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.

Alliance which is part of our coalition. It is the

Coalition  Government that is solidly behind  this

Bill.  It  was seconded by a member of  the  Malay

Union,  and I shall call for a division  to  prove

that  it is no Labour Front measure, but an honest

measure of an honest government seeking to protect

the  honest  citizen, seeking even to protect  the

scum  that organised the meetings of which we have

heard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have challenged - and the Press has carried

the  challenge - that they would ask me to a meeting

in  Cairnhill, and then they discovered that there

was no place in Cairnhill -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, Mr Chief Minister. Your

speech  seems  also to be bordering  on  a  Second

Reading speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr

Chairman, Sir, I regret that you should have  that

impression.  I think I am entitled  to  point  out

that  the  conduct of recent weeks has  shown  the

danger  of  an annual recurrence of such dishonest

conduct.  If you permit me, Sir, and if it  please

you - no  place  in Cairnhill, Sir, to  meet  me - no

place  at  all -  a division where I had  campaigned

day  in and day out for more than two months. They

could  not find a place. They could not invite  me

to any other meetings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you had that dangerous farce of the woman

and  child - a woman screaming that she had not been

allowed to see her detainee husband; that he  went

and  she was left all alone. "And here is my child

who  has never seen him!" And she sat on the  same

platform as these hon. Gentlemen! "We shall  fight

to  the death to the last man, till the child sees

its  father!"  So  that  is  what  they  want  for

Singapore - death to the last man! That is the  sort

of  dishonesty, Sir, which can work up  uneducated

and  simple workers into a state, which, with just

a  word,  can create worse violence than  even  we

have seen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thousands of men in jails all over the

world,  Sir, who have children under  the  age  of

two.  Does  that mean that we should  abolish  the

prison system? There are thousands of women



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



whose  husbands  are in jail. Does  that  mean  we

should  abolish jails? The Member for Bukit  Timah

(Mr Lim Ching Siong) proudly carrying a baby  and

saying, "Look! He has never seen his father!"  Who

prevented him from seeing his father? It  is  this

dishonest   conduct,  Sir,  which  Government   is

disturbed  to  note.  We are  disturbed  by  these

activities  of  dishonest agitators  who  seek  to

organise unrest, which can at the appropriate time

break out in violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true we have had - and let us make a note

and be grateful for - a large group of labour in the

organisation  of the Trades Union Congress  which

has reacted with responsibility. They do not, like

the  P.A.P. trade unions, ask the  world  to  put

black bands on to mourn the death of truth - for  it

is  the  death of truth that they seek,  and  that

they  perpetrate. Though the Trades Union Congress

has  shown  itself  responsible,  there  are  many

responsible persons, Sir, even in this very House,

who  have  been  enmeshed by  Communist  and  pro-Communist propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have read in the Press, Sir, that the Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar  has  suggested  that  half  a

million people should shout so that my hair should

fall out. I have a lot of hair. If the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar and every one of his supporters were

to  pluck a souvenir for himself, I trust  that  I

will  still  have the decency and the  courage  to

seek honestly the welfare of this country, without

fear  of  the intimidation of the streets that  he

seeks to bring into this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Members opposite, Sir, said not one

word  about  our  duty  to  our  brothers  in  the

Federation - not  one word as to how  we  can  throw

open  Singapore - the backdoor of the Federation - and

let  in  people  who would be a  threat  to  their

security. Even if we ourselves were to go down, to

them  it  does not matter. If our brother says  to

you,  "Do  not leave open the door for  burglars",

the  answer  of the P.A.P. is to kick him  in  the

belly.

closely  associated with the P.A.P.;  and  I  say,

Sir,  that to have this annual review at  a  fixed

anniversaries.  I  say, Sir, that  much  as  I  am

attracted - and though frankly in the normal  course

I would have been too happy to accede to what is a

legitimate request - it is a danger to the health of

the  people if we ourselves were to encourage  and

give  an opportunity to these plague-carrying rats

to infect the people of the Colony every year. Let

them create their own opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with reluctance that I brought in this

Bill. I take pleasure in the improvements it has

made in the existing laws. But I take no pleasure

in perpetuating a law that is, however improved,

still a breach in the rule of law. I take no

pleasure in refusing hon. Members opposite this

request for an annual review, but I say that it is

not really a refusal of an annual review - they can

have their annual review by tabling a motion at

any time. I only say: we must not ourselves

consciously place the people, whose welfare is in

our hands, in our hands, in annual jeopardy, as

would happen if we were to accept the amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman, Sir, I move the amendment that stands

in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 2, lines 4 to 12, to leave out sub-clause (1) and insert the following: -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) If the Governor in Council is satisfied with

respect  to  any  person that,  with  a  view  to

preventing that person from acting in any  manner

that  such person be detained for any period  not

exceeding two years."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, as there are several

amendments to this clause, I should like your

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Take the one you have just proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir, the

amendment I have just proposed, as you are  aware,

in  view  of the reference to it in the debate  on

the   Second   Reading,  was  brought   about   by

representations  I  have  received  from   several

quarters - the Chinese Press, the English Press, the

Chinese  Chamber  of Commerce,  the  Trades  Union

Congress,  and hon. Members opposite. Although  it

seems  a little illogical and undignified  that  a

decision  of  the Council of Ministers  should  be

subjected to an Appeal Tribunal, nevertheless,  in

view  of the fact that it does seem to be the wish

of the people of the country, Sir, Government very

gladly  accedes,  and the amendment  is  therefore

brought to meet that request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That sub-clause (1) proposed to be left out, be left out," put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be inserted, be there inserted."

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Chief Minister now wishes to insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the Governor in Council is satisfied with

respect  to  any  person  that,  with  a  view  to

preventing  that person from acting in any  manner

prejudicial  to  the security  of  Malaya  or  the

maintenance  of  public  order  therein   or   the

maintenance therein of essential services,  it  is

necessary so to do, the Chief Secretary  shall  by

order under his hand make an order directing  that

such  person  be  detained  for  any  period   not

exceeding two years."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we have heard a great deal of

play  being  made  of  the  fact  that  the  Chief

Minister  and  his  Government are  improving  the

Emergency   Regulations.  May  I   read   to   him

Regulation 20 of the Emergency Regulations:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In any case where it appears to him to be

necessary  or  expedient for securing  the  public

safety or for the maintenance of public order  the

Colonial Secretary may make an order...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I do not think it takes anyone with

more  than  just  an elementary knowledge  of  the

English  language to see that in  this  amendment,

which  the Chief Minister seeks to substitute  for

the  one he has just deleted, he has extended  the

whole  scope  of  Regulation  20.  Regulation  20,

stringent  and harsh as it is, confines itself  to

cases  where the Chief Secretary considers it  "to

be  necessary or expedient for securing the public

safety  or  for the maintenance of public  order".

The   amendment  the  Chief  Minister   seeks   to

introduce reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...that, with a view to preventing that person

from  acting  in  any manner prejudicial  to  the

security of Malaya...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may say that it is the same as what was said

before,  except that he has extended it  from  the

Colony  to  this  undefined term called  "Malaya".

There  is  no  way  to find out  either  in  these

Regulations or in any other -



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> It is defined in the Interpretation Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> "Defined in the Interpretation

Ordinance",  says the Attorney-General.  "Security

of  Malaya"  is an extension from "public  safety" and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



there  is  a further extension to "maintenance  of

public order therein or the maintenance therein of

essential services".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to General Bourne and his

predecessors - Briggs,  Templer  and   a   host   of

illustrious    Generals    and    sub-Generals - the

Emergency has been improving day by day,  week  by

week,  and  month  by month,  and  this  has  been

achieved without unnecessary interference with the

legitimate  activities  of  people  in   essential

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not feel, Mr Chairman, Sir, that the Chief

Minister  has given us any reason at  all  why  he

should  now seek to bring into the purview of  the

powers  of  the  Government  those  people   whose

activities, whether connected with trade unions or

otherwise, might be construed as endangering  "the

maintenance therein of essential services".  I  do

not  feel that there is any reason, nor indeed has

any  reason been advanced, why the Regulations now

embodied  in  the Public Security Bill  should  be

further enlarged.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar suggested that no reason  had  been

given  for  the  extension of the  scope  of  this

clause.  Unfortunately, he did not  listen  to  my

hon. Friend the Chief Minister who, in speaking on

the Second Reading, took some pains to explain why

it  was that, in our opinion, on this side of  the

House,  it  was necessary to extend the  scope  of

this  clause  to  cover subversive  activities  in

essential services. There will, of course,  as  we

have  given  many  assurances,  be  no  deliberate

interference  with legitimate trade unionism,  but

we  are  concerned with having adequate powers  in

our  possession  to deal with a  recurrence  of  a

situation which was developing here in June.

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 6, line 3, to leave out the full stop and

insert a colon, and thereafter insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and provided further that without prejudice to

the  provisions  of  section 3 of  this  Ordinance

where  any person arrested and detained under  the

provisions   of  this  subsection  satisfies   the

Governor   in  Council  that  he  was   ordinarily

resident  in the Colony for a period of  not  less

than three years immediately preceding the date on

which  such  warrant or order  was  made  and  was

actually  in  the  Colony on the  said  date  such

person shall be forthwith released."



<br><br>This   amendment  arises  out  of  representations

received  from  the Chinese Chamber  of  Commerce,

Sir,  in which it was pointed out that, under  the

provisions   of   this  clause,   the   Federation

Government could order the arrest of a person  who

might normally be a resi-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



dent  in  the  Colony  and  that  a  Machiavellian

government  might  seek  the  assistance  of   the

Federation Government in order to arrest a  person

it  does  not wish to see arrested. Well, Sir,  to

meet  that extremely remote probability,  we  have

introduced  this provision that a person  normally

resident in Singapore cannot be detained by  order

of the Federation Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have had notice of two

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>

proposed  by Mr Lim Choon Mong. I will  therefore

call the Chief Minister's amendment first.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr

Chairman, Sir, many representations have been made

on  this  particular clause, and very considerable

study  has  been given by us in order to  make  it

acceptable  within the framework of the  practical

aspects. In the circumstances, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 7, lines 13 to 19, to leave out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any police officer not below the rank of

assistance-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) enter and search any premises;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) board and search any vessel, not being or

having the status of a ship of war;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) stop and search any vehicle or individual,

whether in a public place or not,",



<br><br>and insert:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if not below the rank of Assistant

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) stop and search any vehicle or individual,

whether in a public place or not,".



<br><br>Sir, it will be noticed there that, in respect  of

the  search  of  premises,  the  presence  of   an

Assistant   Superintendent  of   Police   is   now

necessary;  but  in  respect  of  the  search   of

vessels, we have found that impracticable, because

it  is  not  always possible to send out Assistant

Superintendents of Police in Marine  launches  for

the  purposes of stopping a tongkang and searching

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of stopping and

searching  an  individual in  a  public  place  or

otherwise, there may arise occasions of  emergency

when  it  is  not  possible to have  an  Assistant

Superintendent  of Police. In those circumstances,

Sir,  we  are  now improving that  clause  to  the

extent of requiring an Assistant Superintendent of

Police  before  the police can  enter  and  search

premises.

disturbed  on  insignificant occasions,  and  also

that we do not have so many subversive elements as

to  warrant  Inspectors going into  and  searching

every house. However, the Chief Minister has taken

up  our suggestion and has amended it accordingly,

quibbling over these things - whether the  right  of

privacy  should not be invaded by an Inspector  of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 20 to 23 inclusive ordered to stand part

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move the

deletion of the proviso within the proviso in

clause 24 (1) (b) of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our law, which follows the Indian Penal

Code, no statement made to a police officer  by  a

person under arrest can be used against him. There

must  have  been  very good  reasons  for  such  a

provision. I think it was because some officers in

the  past  were not too scrupulous as to how  they

obtained  their  statements,  and,  therefore,  no

statements,  unless they amounted to a  confession

taken before a magistrate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



with  due warning, could be used in court  against

an    accused   person.   Under   the    Emergency

Regulations,  which follow the English  law,  this

long-standing practice has been changed so that  a

statement by a person in custody to or within  the

hearing  of a Police Inspector can be used against

him in his trial in court provided:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that he has not been induced or threatened to

make a statement, and,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that he has been cautioned to the effect that

he  is  not obliged to say anything, but  what  he

says may be used as evidence against him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have accepted this principle that

extraordinary    times    require    extraordinary

measures, and I, for one, do not quarrel with  the

provisions  so  far. But there is another  proviso

within  this  proviso  to the  effect  that  if  a

statement is made before there is time to  caution

him,  it  shall  not be rendered  inadmissible  in

evidence  merely  by  reason of  no  such  caution

having been given if it has been given as soon  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause is a fairly lengthy one. It takes up

the  whole of page 11 in the Bill, and I  am  sure

those  Members of the Assembly who are not legally

trained  will  have  to read this  clause  several

times  before they can understand it. I am  afraid

the  poor  police officer who has  to  learn  this

clause  and use it three months or a year  or  two

years after he has read it, or has been taught it,

will not be able to remember all the provisions in

their  true perspective, and, like most of us,  he

will  probably take the easiest course  and  think

that  so long as there is no time to question  the

suspect, it is not necessary to caution him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of good law is that it should be

simple,  clear, and unequivocal. I will  read  the

clause:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) Where any person is charged with any offence

against this Ordinance or with any offence arising

out  of  or  in  connection with  an  occasion  of

emergency or public danger ... any statement,  whether

such  statement  amounts to a confession  or  not...;

made  at  any time, whether before or  after  such

person is charged and whether in the course  of  a

police investigation or not, by such person to  or

in the hearing of any police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



officer  of or above the rank of Inspector  shall,

notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

in any written law, be admissible at his trial and

can  be  used  to cross-examine him,  if  he  puts

himself out as a witness



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that no such statement shall be

admissible or used as aforesaid -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if the making of the statement appears to

the   Court  to  have  been  caused  by  any

inducement,   threat   or   promise   having

reference to the charge against such person,

proceeding  from a person in  authority  and

sufficient in the opinion of the  Court,  to

give  such person grounds which would appear

to  him  reasonable  for supposing  that  by

making  it  he  would gain any advantage  or

avoid  any  evil  of  a temporal  nature  in

reference to the proceeding against him; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in the case of a statement made by such

person after his arrest unless the Court  is

satisfied that a caution was administered to

him  in the following words or words to  the

like  effect - "Do you wish to  say  anything?

You  are not obliged to say anything  unless

you  wish to do so but whatever you say will

be taken down in writing and may be given in

evidence.":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that a statement made by any

person  before there is time to caution  him

shall   not  be  rendered  inadmissible   in

evidence merely by reason of no such caution

having  been given if it has been  given  as

soon as possible."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I maintain that this clause, as it

stands,  is  anything but clear  and  unequivocal.

What  is  the test as to whether there is time  to

caution  the  accused? What is the test  that  the

caution has been given as soon as possible? It  is

a  human failing amongst us to justify our acts of

omission.  How  easy it is to justify  oneself  by

saying, "I had no time to do such a thing,  but  I

did  it  as soon as possible." Sir, I submit  that

this  proviso within the proviso tends to negative

the  provisions of clause 24 (1) (b) which is  one

of  the  vital elements for allowing such a clause

to  be  used  against the trend  of  our  Evidence

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore move, Sir, that the proviso within the

proviso  on page 11, lines 35 to 39, be  left  out

from clause 24 (1).

<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Sir, I must confess that I do

not share the difficulty experienced by the Member

who has moved this amendment, particularly when he

read  out the clause, save where he departed  from

the  words of the clause at the end of subclause

(1).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I think it is important, when considering

this  amendment, that the Assembly should not lose

sight  of  the fact that it is of the  essence  of

this  clause that only statements which have  been

voluntarily made should be admissible and that  no

advantage should be taken of a prisoner who is  in

custody. Sir, the proviso is expressly designed to

avoid rendering inadmissible a statement which is,

in  all  respects,  a  statement  which  has  been

voluntarily made, merely because - and I stress this

as  it  is  a  word which appears in the  proviso - merely because no caution has been given in  cases

where there was no time in which to administer the

caution  before the statement was made, and  where

the  caution  has been given as soon as  possible.

Now,  on this basis, Sir, the scope of the  clause

would be unduly limited if voluntary statements of

a  certain class were to be rendered inadmissible,

and  that  is  precisely  the  effect  which  this

ask the Assembly to resist this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, the Member moving this amendment

stated  that  some police officers  were  not  too

scrupulous  and he also said that police  officers

would have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



difficulty in learning the meaning of this  clause

in  the Bill. I should like to suggest, Sir,  that

the  Member underrates both the integrity and the

intelligence of Police Inspectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had hoped, possibly, that when he opened his

remarks  he  had  not  noticed  that  this  clause

referred  only  to Inspectors. It  does  refer  to

Inspectors  and I can assure this  House  that  we

have  every confidence in the integrity with which

our Inspectors discharge their duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards difficulty in mastering this clause,

I do not share the Member's fears at all. There is

nothing  unusual  about  this  clause.  It  is   a

standard form of clause which has, in fact,  been

in operation here for many years and it is indeed

the  standard practice in many countries where  it

is  applied to all ranks in the Police Force,  as,

for  example, the United Kingdom. I see no  reason

at  all  why Inspectors and above in the Singapore

Police  Force  should not be able  to  apply  this

clause   with  complete  intelligence   and   with

complete integrity.

excluded  the use of such statements  obtained  by

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to

move the following amendment standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 1, line 9 to leave out "three years from

the  date  of commencement" and insert  "one  year

from  the date of commencement and for any further

period  of  one year for which it may be continued

by resolution of the Legislative Assembly".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the fact that the Government has

not  accepted a similar amendment to the  previous

Bill,  I  am  afraid that we are fighting  a  lost

cause. Nevertheless, I must emphasise again that I

think  the  Government will be making  an  equally

grave mistake if they reject the amendment to this

Bill. Having built up a case for the retention  of

the     Emergency     Regulations     which     is

unassailable - and their retention has  never  been

disputed  by the Progressive Party even though  we

may  not like their translation into law - it  seems

to  us  the height of folly for the Government  to

destroy  a  good deal of that case,  even  to  the

extent   of  making  their  motives  suspect,   by

sticking to the period of three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to make only one point. Certain

irresponsible   groups - I  need   not   name   them

again - have tried to make out that Part V,  dealing

with  illegal strikes in essential services, is  a

blow aimed at destroying the trade union movement.

This,  of  course, is nonsense. These  Regulations

have been in force for several years and I see  no

signs  of  the  trade union movement  having  been

destroyed. Nevertheless, Sir, colour can  be  lent

to  that  argument  if the hon.  Members  opposite

remain  adamant.  Let us be quite  clear  that  to

delay  the  right of striking is a curtailment  of

liberties for emergency purposes only, and  should

therefore  be the subject of regular review.  That

is  the  very  least that the honest  and  sincere

trade  unionist has a right to expect. Sir, I  beg

to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to

be left out, be left out."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, as the mover of this amendment

foresaw,  we have already made our position  clear

in  principle on this matter in the previous  Bill

which  we considered this morning, and I will  not

detain the House longer than to say again that we,

on  this  side of the House, are always  ready  to

face our responsibility to this House at any time;

and  it is open to Members opposite to ensure that

we  discharge that duty by means of questions  and

other  procedures in this House. But we also  take

the  view  that  it  would not be  right,  in  the

present circumstances, for us to subject Singapore

annually to the kind of agitation which  we  have

had during the last fortnight. So, we on this side

will  not accept this amendment any more  than  we

were  able  to  accept  a similar  amendment  this

morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out," put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I have an amendment in my name

or   with   imprisonment  which  may   extend   to

imprisonment  for  life or with whipping  or  with

both  such  imprisonment and whipping" and  insert

"imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to

whipping".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on further consideration, we have come to

the  conclusion  that  it  is  not  necessary   to

prescribe the death penalty in this clause,  which

deals  with  persons who are in possession  of  or

carrying explosives. On further consideration,  we

did  not consider it is necessary to insist on the

death  penalty there. Moreover, there is, to  some

extent, a breach of principle in imposing upon the

courts  the  task of deciding in  any  given  case

whether  the  penalty  of  death  or  penalty   of

imprisonment should be imposed in accordance  with

the facts before the court at that time. So it is

that I now move to delete the death penalty but to

substitute  therefor a penalty which we  consider

is a necessary deterrent,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



namely,  life  imprisonment,  and  to  add  to  it

liability  for whipping, so that if this amendment

be   life  imprisonment  and  also  liability   to

whipping.

agree to arbitration, and finding suitable persons

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My purpose in asking to delete the word "oil",

Sir, is that the juxtaposition of the words "fuel"

and "oil" could be taken to mean "fuel oil", which

I  am  advised is the technical description  of  a

certain type of fuel; whereas, in fact, I wish the

word  "fuel"  in its widest sense to include  both

what  is  known  as fuel oil and diesel  oil,  and

other   forms  of  fuel.  So  as  to   avoid   any

misunderstanding,   it   will   read   "fuel   and

lubricants".

"oil" deleted will read "Bulk distribution of fuel

and  lubricants". I think it is an arguable  point

whether, if you put "fuel and lubricants"  without

"oil", the thing becomes clearer, since fuel  will

be  classified  as a lubricant.  There  are  other

kinds of fuel besides oil,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



and, quite unwittingly, I think the Government may

be  extending the whole scope of item  11  in  the

Mr  Chairman, Sir, if the Chief Secretary has any

doubt  as  to  the  meaning  of  the  item  as  it

stands - "Bulk   distribution  of   fuel   oil   and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, this clause

was   discussed  at  the  last  sitting  of   this

Assembly,   and  I  had  then  pointed   out   the

incongruity  of  putting  it  in  that  particular

section  of  the Penal Code. However,  I  see  the

draftsmen chose to leave it where they had put it.

I  wish  now to point out that the clause,  as  it

stands,  combines weighty and trivial matters.  It

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whoever makes, prints, possesses, posts,

distributes or has under his control any  document

containing   any   incitement   to   violence   or

counselling  disobedience to the  law  or  to  any

lawful order of a public servant or likely to lead

to any breach of the peace



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



shall  be  punished with imprisonment  for  a  term

which  may extend to three years, or with fine,  or

with both."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we have there "incitement to

violence  or counselling disobedience to  the  law

or  to  any lawful order", and something which  is

"likely  to  lead  to  a  breach  of  the  peace",

usually   dealt  with  under  the  Minor  Offences

Ordinance - I   think  one  should  not   put   them

together  in  one clause with the same punishment.

I  am  sure  the  Hon. the Chief  Minister,  as  a

criminal lawyer, would find a lot to say  about  a

clause  which combines the serious and the trivial

in this way, and I move -

to  my attention. What I have been referred to is

an  amendment, which should be made to line 9, on

page  2  of  clause 5. That amendment, Sir,  will

depend on some later amendments - amendments to  be

made  to this clause at a later stage - and I would

therefore  ask  that  it  be  postponed.  I   now

proceed,  Sir,  to  the first of  the  amendments

which I have to move, and that is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 4, line 27, after "Immigration

Department to Insert "Chinese Secretariat".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment, Sir, is to

include  a department of the Government  on  which

reliance  is  placed  for  the  administration  of

powers of this kind.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You do require a comma, do you not,

<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> I have just lost my copy of the

Bill,  Mr  Chairman. I am very much  indebted  to

you,  Sir. I now move that there should be a comma

inserted  after the words "Immigration Department"

and thereafter the words "Chinese Secretariat".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That a comma and the words proposed

to  be  inserted,  be  there inserted,"  put,  and

agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> There is a further amendment,

Sir,  of which I have given notice. It is  a  more

substantial  matter  than that  to  which  I  have

referred just now. First of all, however, I should

like to move, Sir, on page 4, line 36 of clause 5,

that  there should be left out the inverted commas

and  the  second  full stop, that depends  on  the

addition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>

of  a proposed new section to be numbered 14, with

the marginal note "Appeals":



<pre>

"Appeals.         14 (1)-Any person aggrieved by  the

             detention of any article under the provisions

             of  section 10 of this Ordinance  or  of  any

             Provided that no such appeal shall be allowed

             unless  notice of appeal in writing  together

             with  the reasons for appeal is given to  the

             has  been  posted would be delivered  in  the

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given notice of this amendment, Sir, and,

no  doubt, Members will have taken the opportunity

of reading the proposed addition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I wish to say now is that it does spring, to

some  extent, from the observations  made  by  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) on the

Second Reading. If my recollection is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>

right,  his observations were to the effect  that,

in  the  exercise  of  wide  powers  of  the  kind

conferred by the Bill, it was desirable that there

should  be  some check at one time or  another  in

respect  of  the exercise of those  powers.  Those

comments have been given consideration, and, as  a

result  of  that consideration, this amendment  is

now proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will see that what it is designed to

achieve is that persons who are aggrieved  by  any

action  taken under either of the proposed section

10  or  11 to detain matter that is objectionable,

if  I may so describe it, with a view possibly  to

its destruction, should be given an opportunity to

appeal;  and  this proposed section provides  them

with  an opportunity to appeal to the Governor  in

Council within a period of fourteen days. It  also

places upon the Controllers or authorised officers

an  obligation to notify the persons  affected  of

their right to appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the inverted commas and the

second full stop proposed to be left out, be  left

out," put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion standing in

my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the improvement rate

of 2 per centum on the annual value of all houses,

buildings, lands and tenements within the City  of

Singapore,  fixed  by  the  Singapore  Improvement

Trust  under  section  22  (1)  of  the  Singapore

Improvement  Ordinance (Cap.  134)  for  the  year

1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approval of this Assembly is required under

the Singapore Improvement Ordinance for this rate.

This rate cannot, by law, exceed five per cent  on

property within the City area. Hitherto, the  rate

has  always  been  two per cent and  the  Trustees

recommend no change in the rate for 1956.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rate, which is in lieu of the improvement

rates  referred to in section 59 of the  Municipal

Ordinance  (Cap.133),  is collected  by  the  City

Council  and paid over half-yearly to the Trustees

of  the  Singapore Improvement Trust.  The  monies

from  this  rate,  together  with  the  equivalent

Government contribution under section  23  of  the

Singapore  Improvement Ordinance (Cap.  134),  are

estimated at $2,475,000 and form one of the  major

items  of  revenue of the Trust and are paid  into

the   Improvement   funds.  This   is   spent   on

improvement schemes, the rehousing of persons dehoused under the schemes, the opening of backlanes,

provision  of open spaces in congested areas,  and

generally  in  the  maintenance  of  the   general

improvement  plan. The proportion  of  expenditure

for  the  improvement functions of  the  Trust  is

distinct  from  its  housing  functions,  and   is

estimated to be round about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



$2.743 million, so that the improvement rate  of

two per cent in 1956 is reasonable. Sir, I beg  to

move.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> I second it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the improvement rate

of 2 per centum on the annual value of all houses,

buildings, lands and tenements within the City  of

<div align="center"><b>LOCAL INDUSTRIES (DEVELOPMENT): GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE AND ASSISTANCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and Industry whether he is aware of the urgent need for promoting and fostering local industries; and whether he will make a detailed statement of all the steps taken, or to be taken, in granting guidance and assistance, including the grant of loans, for the welfare and development of small operators in (a) the fishing; (b) the farming; and (c) the light (cottage) industries.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall:</b> I am fully aware of the need for promoting and fostering local industries. Reference is invited to my reply to a question on this subject on Wednesday, 29th June, 1955 (Legislative Assembly Debates, Official Report Vol. I No. 6, Col. 331).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary discussions have taken place with Ministers in the Federation on proposals for promoting industrial development. It is intended to seek further discussions at an early date with a view to the creation of an Industrial Development Board which I am anxious to establish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present trade discussions with Indonesia are also of considerable importance to our local industries. It is hoped that as a result of these talks local industries will once more be able to export to the Indonesian market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government Departments and public bodies have been instructed to give preference in all cases to local manufactures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following steps have been or will shortly be taken for providing guidance and assistance including the grant of loans for the welfare and development of small operators in -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Fishing Industry: -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fisheries Loans Board provides financial assistance to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>

offshore fishermen and the Fisheries Division purchases equipment for sale cheaply to fishing boats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Division also assists fishermen in obtaining land for their houses and generally looks after their welfare and that of their families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspectors of the Fisheries Division visit fishing villages to license boats so that fishermen can obtain licences locally. There is a Central Control point at Telok Ayer which provides a 24-hour service to assist the arrival and departure of fishing boats, facilities for water supply, the discharge of fish and the loading of stores.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mobile unit tours fishing villages giving instruction in the care and maintenance of outboard engines and sells stocks of spare parts at cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The M.V. "Dunvegan" has acted as a mother ship for drift netters and continues to search for new fishing grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long term research is also undertaken by the Regional Fisheries Research Station. A specially equipped vessel, the "Manihine", arrived in Singapore on 12th August, 1955, to assist in this research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Farming Industry: -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of Government's plans for the provision of veterinary and animal husbandry services were given in a written answer to Mr. M. P. D. Nair on Tuesday, 26th July, 1955 (Refer Legislative Assembly Debates, Official Report Vol. I No. 9, Cols. 31/32). Urgent consideration is being given to a major proposal for financial assistance to farmers through co-operative societies and approved farmers organisations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the Light (cottage) Industries: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of Government to foster all types of industry provided they are economic. Proposals are under consideration to expand the activities of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on the industrial side. The new services will be of particular assistance to our smaller industry which will also be able to take advantage of the wider services which will be available when the major Industrial Development programme is finalised.

<div align="center"><b>KATHIS IN RURAL DISTRICTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Secretary whether he is aware that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



there is an urgent need for more Kathis to be stationed in the rural areas; and whether one stationed in the Changi and Bedok Districts, where hardship is being caused, will be appointed as early as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> The Government is not aware of any shortage of Kathis in the rural areas in general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Bedok-Changi districts are concerned, a Kathi was temporarily transferred to that area on 1st September, 1955, but a permanent appointment is likely to be made in the near future to fill the vacancy caused by the death of the substantive Kathi.
