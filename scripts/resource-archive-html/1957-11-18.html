<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) what has the Singapore Government benefited by

representation at such conferences.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the answer to



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is four.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to (b) is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Singapore Constitutional Conference from 7th

March to 14th April, attended by the Hon. Dr Lim Yew

Hock,  the Hon. Inche Abdul Hamid bin Haji Jumat  and

the Hon. Mr Chew Swee Kee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The 40th session of the International Labour

Organisation (ILO) Conference from 25th May, 1957, to

30th  June,  1957, attended by the Hon. Dr  Lim  Yew

Hock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Colombo Plan Consultative Committee

Conference from 21st October, 1957, to 25th  October,

1957, attended by the Hon. Mr J. M. Jumabhoy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Asian Regional Conference of the ILO in New

Delhi  from  13th November, 1957, to  26th  November,

1957, attended by the Hon. Dr Lim Yew Hock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to (c), on cost: Under (b) (1) the total

cost  is  $64,773.  This is the  cost  of  the  whole

mission. Separate figures of the cost of sending  the

three Ministers are not available. Under (b) (2)  the

cost  is $6,754; (b) (3) - $825 estimated, final amount

not yet available; (b) (4) - $ 1,750 estimated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to (d) is the benefits derived from

ministerial    representation   at   the    Singapore

Constitutional Conference are many. To  mention  only

two,  they  include the new Constitution  which  will

come  into  force  next year and the  creation  of  a

separate    Singapore    citizenship    within    the

Commonwealth. With regard to the ILO and Colombo Plan

Conferences  attended  by  Ministers,  the   benefits

derived  cannot be expressed in precise  quantitative

and  monetary terms. I would emphasise, however,  the

considerable  material  benefits  given   under   the

Colombo Plan and the technical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2735</b></font><br><br>



training and service advice given both under the Plan

and  under  ILO  auspices. Almost  all  participating

countries  send  a minister to these conferences  and

Singapore   cannot   accept   a   lower   level    of

representation for itself, either to  say  thank  you

for  the  benefits received or successfully to  press

its  case for continued assistance or to explain,  in

the  case  of  the ILO Conference, labour  or  social

policies of this country.

Chief  Minister state if his visits and those of  the

were  on  their own or at the expense of  the  public

revenue?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, ministers of some other

countries   do  not  of  course  have  constitutional

problems, so therefore in regard to the first part of

the question, I do not think so. But in regard to the

ILO  and  the  Colombo Plan, when  Ministers  are  on

official  visits they are in receipt of an  allowance

from the Government.

public expense beyond what is mentioned here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) how many Inspectors who have not qualified

under  the  Part I Higher Services Scheme  have

been promoted to the rank of A.S.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. Hoffman (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr R. C. Hoffman):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the number of vacancies in the  Police

Force for Assistant Superintendents of Police is  24.

There  are  eight Inspectors of Police  eligible  for

promotion  to  this rank. None has yet been  promoted

but  their  cases  are now being  considered  by  the

Public  Service Commission. Over recent  years,  five

Inspectors of Police have been promoted to  the  rank

of  A.S.P. although  they have not  passed  all  the

examinations required under Part I of the  Scheme  of

Service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Can the Hon. the Chief Secretary

tell  us  whether these promotions were made  by  the

Commissioner   of  Police  or  the   Public   Service

Commission,  and why those five who were  unqualified

were  promoted to become A.S.P's, while none  of  the

qualified were promoted?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hoffman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hoffman:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the promotions were

made  by the Public Service Commission, that is based

on   the   recommendations  of  the  Public   Service

Commission. The reason why no promotion has yet  been

made  in  regard to the Inspectors of Police who  are

already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2737</b></font><br><br>



qualified  for  consideration for promotion  is  that

their cases are now under consideration by the P.S.C.

I  should  explain  that  these  officers  have  only

recently qualified for consideration for promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other part of the question, the five

Inspectors of Police who have already been  promoted,

these  promotions have been over recent years.  There

is  provision for the promotion of such officers  who

have passed the majority of the examinations required

to  qualify for promotion but not all. They have been

promoted  on  the  grounds of  outstanding  work  and

qualities of leadership and courage normally expected

of more senior officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, can the Hon. the Chief

Secretary tell us whether these promotions are acting

appointments or substantive Ones?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hoffman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hoffman:</b> They are substantive appointments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, are we to

understand from the Hon. the Chief Secretary's  reply

that  the  higher a position a person  holds  in  the

Police Force, the more courageous he is?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hoffman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hoffman:</b> I merely suggested that there are other

considerations   apart   from   that    of    passing

exanimations written and otherwise.

two  centres  only, namely, the Central  Registration

The  system  is  working well and  ensures  a  speedy

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this question

involves  a  problem which cannot be  solved  by  the

Ministry  of Education alone. It is an accepted  fact

that  not  every  person can benefit  from  secondary

education,   and  even  of  those  who  qualify   for

admission into secondary schools after passing a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem involving the future of teenagers cannot

be   solved   by  absorbing  them  into   educational

institutions. For those who are not likely to benefit

from  secondary  education, Government  has  provided

trade schools and apprenticeship schemes. It will  be

addition  direction indicators to the  various  wards

and units in each block. The hon. Member will realise

that  the  General  Hospital  is  a  very  spread-out

structure  and  in  consequence  any  plan,   however

simplified, would be somewhat difficult  to  read  by

persons unaccustomed to reading plans.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Will the Hon. The Minister for

Health  consider  putting up  plans  in  the  Chinese

language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, at present the plans are

only in the English language. This is of course of an

experimental  nature in order to see whether  persons

normally educated in English at least would  be  able

to  follow  directions  of  the  plans.  The  general

observations we have indicate that even such  persons

find   it  difficult  to  read  the  plans  and,   in

consequence,  seek  assistance from  members  of  the

staff  for directions to various points. Under  these

circumstances,  it  is  doubtful  whether  displaying

further  plans  in Malay, Chinese,  Tamil  and  other

languages  would  be  of any useful  assistance.  The

matter,   however,  will  be  reviewed   when   found

necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr William Tan</b> asked the Minister for

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, the question of arranging

for  announcements to be made in Mandarin  and  Tamil

over  the  public  address system  at  the  Singapore

Airport  of  the arrivals and departures of  aircraft

has  been under consideration for a number of months.

The  hon. Member for Tiong Bahru was invited as  long

ago as April this year to let me have details of what

he   had  described  as  "many  instances  in   which

passengers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2741</b></font><br><br>



missed  their planes or went to the wrong plane  just

because  they did not know English". I have  received

no  such evidence either from the hon. Member or from

any   other   source   that  passengers   have   been

inconvenienced  by  the fact that announcements  over

the  public  address system are not made in  Mandarin

and  Tamil. Until I do get such evidence,  I  am  not

prepared to direct that such announcements should  be

made.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Why does the Hon. Minister for

Communications   and  Works  not   check   with   the

Whenever announcements are made in English or  Malay,

we  find passengers rushing to the Information Bureau

to  ask  whoever is in charge what the  announcements

say.

circulated  to  the  officials to get  full  official

accounts  for  reply;  and  of  course  the   Airport

authorities have been very fully questioned  on  this

matter  and  the  reply is based on  the  information

given  by  them  and  by the airline  operators,  who

naturally  would  themselves be  concerned  if  their

passengers  failed to arrive at the  aircraft.  I  am

sure  that  the airline operators are fully satisfied

at    present   that   their   passengers   are   not

inconvenienced and do in fact arrive at the  aircraft

at the times and places that they should.

by  the  fact  that there is no representation  of  a

Malay   or   a   Chinese, is   that   Board   fully

representative?

the  interests of seamen as a whole rather  than  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill proposes amendments to the Singapore

Legislative  Assembly Elections Ordinance  which  are

rendered  necessary by the enactment of the Singapore

Citizenship    Ordinance,    1957.    The     present

qualifications of electors are laid down in section 5

of   the  Singapore  Legislative  Assembly  Elections

Ordinance, part of which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...any person who-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies

by   virtue   of  the  provisions  of  the   British

Nationality  Act, 1948, or was born in  any  of  the

States or territories now included in the Federation

of  Malaya o the Colony of Sarawak or the Colony  of

North Borneo or the State of Brunei; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) was ordinarily resident in the Colony on the 1st

day of April in any year; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) was not less than twenty-one years of age on the

1st day of July in that year, shall be entitled to

have his name entered or retained in a register of

electors in that year."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is to attain the status of the State of

Singapore  as  a  self-governing territory,  and  the

Assembly  will  be  a  fully elected  body  when  the

Legislative   Assembly  elections   under   the   new

Constitution are held. They are expected to  be  held

next  year.  Hon.  Members will recall  that  at  the

sitting in October this Assembly approved the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2746</b></font><br><br>



Singapore Citizenship Ordinance, a charter  by  which

we   have  achieved  what  we  longed  for  years - the

creation of a status recognisable in all parts of the

Commonwealth  for all those who regard  Singapore  as

their home and the object of their undivided loyalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are citizens by birth and descent have the

right to vote. The proposed amendment to section 5 is

very  significant. Thousands of our adult  population

who,  although  not  born  in  Singapore,  have  been

resident  here for long periods and have  contributed

to    the   prosperity   of   Singapore,   and    are

enthusiastically  becoming  Singapore  citizens   and

declaring  their  allegiance  to  Singapore.  It   is

important   that   the   new  status   of   Singapore

citizenship should carry with it the right to  assist

in  the procedure of democratic government, and  this

Bill  seeks  to  grant our new citizens  their  first

democratic  right-the right to vote for  election  of

the people's representatives to sit in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to

provide  that  the right to vote in  the  Legislative

Assembly  elections shall be granted to  citizens  of

Singapore and to Singapore citizens only, in a  self-governing  Singapore, it is no  longer  desirable  to

offer  voting  rights to those whose  bodies  are  in

Singapore  but whose hearts and minds are  elsewhere.

If  the newly won Constitution for self-government is

to  be  implemented in the spirit  in  which  it  was

framed, it is essential that the hearts and minds  of

all   people  participating  in  the  government   of

Singapore  should  be in Singapore itself,  and  that

their outlook and undivided loyalty should be centred

here.  Therefore,  voting rights should  be  accorded

only to citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 (ii) of the amending Bill proposes that the

relevant residential date shall be the first  day  of

February instead of the first day of April.  This  is

necessary   in  order  that  the  work  of  preparing

registers  in 1958 should be commenced  as  early  as

possible. Paragraphs (iii) and (iv) are consequential

to the previous amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 proposes that only persons who are or who

become citizens of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2747</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  on  or  before the first day  of  February

1958,  and who are resident in an electoral  division

on  that day, shall have their names included in  the

first  register. The existing subsections (2) to  (4)

of  section 10 of the Ordinance are deleted in  order

to   avoid  any  delay  in  the  completion  of   the

registers. This simplified procedure is in conformity

with that laid down in the Local Government Elections

Ordinance, 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides for the revision of the registers

in each year following the year 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 repeals the Singapore Legislative Assembly

(Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1957.

<br><br>10.35 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of

course  we  agree to this Bill to give the rights  to

the citizens but I think the more important thing  is

after  the  passing of this Bill we should  see  that

citizens  should  be  accorded  their  rights.  I  am

talking  about the executive acts of the  Government.

We  have  noted  that  with all the  good  intentions

Government  has,  there are still  many  waiting  for

their  turn  to  swear allegiance to Singapore.  They

wait  in  long queues; they wait for days. They  wait

for  teams  to  go for them to swear allegiance,  but

they have to wait for a very long time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want forms to sign up but there are not enough

forms.  Forms are taken out one by one by people  who

would want to fill up for them, but none is available

for  the public. Forms are sometimes sold, as alleged

in the newspapers, at 50 cents or a dollar each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is most unsatisfactory. Government must wake up

to  the  need  of  the  people.  Everybody  wants  to

register before 1st February. They must be given that

opportunity. They want to exercise their vote. Let us

give them that vote. They have shown their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2748</b></font><br><br>



loyalty. It is up to Government after the passage  of

this Bill to see to it that every person who wants to

be  a  Singapore citizen is accorded his full  rights

and not made to wait.

February,  1958,  I cannot help but  join  our  Party

leader  in  stating that by publishing this  date  we

shall increase the fears of the people who wish to be

registered, fear from thinking that they may  not  be

able  to get themselves registered. I have asked  for

registration  teams  from  the  Central  Registration

Office  to  go out to some of the outlying areas  and

only  last week when I asked for a date, I  was  told

that  the  dates available are 24th. 25th,  26th  and

28th January. That is a rather disturbing feature, if

at  the  present moment I ask for teams to go out  to

take  the oaths of people who have signed their forms

in  certain areas, I am told that the only dates that

are  available are those nearing the end of the  last

date for registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge Government to take steps immediately to

see  that  more teams are available so that  when  we

apply  for dates for the oath to be taken, we can  be

given them instead of being told that we can only get

dates  just  a  few  days before  the  close  of  the

made so far and aim at registering 300,000 persons by

the  target date if there are that many who will come

forward.  I can assure the House that this matter  is

very much in the minds of the Government and we shall

have  been  away for three out of the last  10  years

preceding  the elections, although he allowed  those,

who  were  in  no way connected with Singapore  other

than  the fact that they had dwelt here for the  last

seven out of the last 10 years and made money out  of

it,   to  contest  such  elections.  And  the  unholy

spectacle  of  so  many  prominent  Members  of  this

Assembly taking their oaths of allegiance so late  in

the  day is, I think, a salutary reminder to them and

to  the  founder-members of the people of  Singapore,

namely,  those born and bred here, that  unless  they

rise  up  to their responsibilities then they deserve

to perish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced that those born and bred here like

myself  do not intend to perish. We intend  to  fight

and  found this healthy and vigorous state  which  we

hope  one  day  will  be part of  the  Federation  of

Malaya. And I would also like to remind all those who

are  enthusiastically applying for membership of this

nation  that it is not just a matter of going through

the drill which the Registrar of Citizens assured  me

would not take more than eight minutes if efficiently

done.  He  demonstrated it to me. I had the privilege

of  an  actual demonstration of how a team of  clerks

could  put  a  person through the mill in  less  than

eight  minutes,  and I shudder to  think  what  would

happen   if  those  eight  minutes  were   the   only

impression  which remained on the minds  of  the  new

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the duty not only of the Government but of

every  political Party and every political leader  to

bring  home  the responsibilities and the meaning  of

citizenship, of  what  has  so  glibly  been  called

"undivided loyalty". The test,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2750</b></font><br><br>



very plainly and simply, is this: are you taking  out

citizenship  because you think it is  temporarily  to

your  advantage, or are you swearing, now and forever

more, that this is your home, that you will stand  by

it  and  fight for it? When we bring that fact  home,

then  I say we have made the first step in our  march

to greater nationhood.

<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I do not think I have very much to

answer to the hon. Members. My hon. Friend the  Chief

Secretary  has  already made his reply.  But  I  must

point  out one factor in this, Sir, and that is  that

ever  since registration came into force,  there  has

been  a terrific and spontaneous response to the call

to  be registered as citizens, and it was because  of

this  spontaneous response that in the  beginning  we

found  that  there was an enormous number  of  people

asking for forms. The distribution of forms was  very

uneven. Those organisations and Parties which came up

and  demanded 2,000, 5,000 and 6,000 forms  were  all

given  forms  in the complete faith that  they  would

fill   up  those  forms  and  help  the  registration

officers to register the people as citizens. To  date

we  have  issued 320,000 forms and it  is  surprising

that  our  forms have gone out of stock. It is  hoped

that  these  forms are not put into  any  waste-paper

basket but all those organisations have been able  to

fill  them  up  and  keep ready for the  registration

officers to come and take the oaths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to appeal is this. Sir, that all

Parties and organisations should have a little bit of

patience  so that the Registrar of Citizens  will  be

able    to   organise   the   teams   properly    and

systematically and without any confusion. That is the

appeal  I  want to make to all those people  who  are

helping in the voluntary registration of citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second tune and committed to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be all kinds of interpretation

difficulties over this word "resident". What  happens?

I  have not had the time to look up the matter but  it

might be arguable that if somebody were not physically

residing at a particular electoral division he is  not

resident  there on that particular day.  Were  I,  for

instance, to be away from Singapore on that day, am  I

resident  in  Singapore  on that  particular  day?  To

obviate  such difficulties, would he not consider  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk and

distributed to hon. Members..



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker. Sirs as you are

aware,  the elections to the new City Council  are  to

take place on 21st December, at which time the greater

part of the Local Government Ordinance, 1957, will  be

brought  into operation. It is necessary to  make  the

amendments contained in this amending Bill before  the

new  City  Council is established, for  the  following

reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the present definition of "City Council" in

section 3 of the Local Government Ordinance, 1957,  is

inaccurate  as  the Royal Charter did not  incorporate

the  City  Council.  This  is  corrected  by  the  new

definition at clause 2 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 7 of the Bill amending section 320

of  the  Local  Government Ordinance, 1957,  makes  it

possible to repeal the City Council Elections



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2753</b></font><br><br>



(Temporary Provisions No. 2) Ordinance, 1956,  without

at  the  same time repealing the Municipal  Ordinance.

The former will have to be repealed in December before

the  elections  but  the Municipal Ordinance,  on  the

other  hand, will not be repealed at the same time  as

some of its provisions have not been reproduced in the

Local Government Ordinance. The provisions which  have

not  been  reproduced will be dealt  with  by  by-laws

issued  by  the  City  Council as provided  for  under

Schedule  VI  of  the Local Government Ordinance,  but

until  such  by-laws  are in force  it  is  considered

necessary  to  keep  the Municipal Ordinance  and  the

Singapore  City (Consequential Provisions)  Ordinance,

1951, in force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, doubts have been expressed as to

whether the Minister can authorise the Rural Board  to

carry  out  its  functions after  the  repeal  of  the

Municipal  Ordinance  in view  of  the  provisions  of

section  16  of  the Local Government Ordinance  which

provide  that  the local government of  each  district

shall  be  the  responsibility of a district  council.

This doubt is removed in the amendment to section  321

of the Local Government Ordinance, set out in clause 8

of  the  Bill. Also, local authority officers exercise

powers  under  Ordinances  other  than  the  Municipal

Ordinance, as for example the Sale of Food  and  Drugs

Ordinance,  and  to remove all doubts it  is  proposed

that  power be given to the Minister to authorise  the

Rural  Board  and  the  City Council  to  continue  to

exercise these powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to make

amendments to section 151 and section 169 of the Local

Government Ordinance. The amendment to section 151  at

clause  5 of the Bill is to enable the local authority

to  take action against persons who fix number  plates

to   unauthorised   huts  thus  misleading   potential

purchasers as well as officers of the local authority.

The  amendment to section 169 at clause 6 of the  Bill

gives  additional powers to the Court  to  remove  any

erections  made in altering a building  without  the

licence of the local



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2754</b></font><br><br>



authority, and also to impose a daily fine of $50  for

the  use  of the upper floor of a dwelling  house  for

other  purposes  without  the  licence  of  the  local

authority. Under the existing section 169 there is  no

provision for the removal of any unauthorised erection

or  for imposing a fine on continuance of the offence.

The  definition of "Former City Council" at  clause  2

and  in  the amendment at clause 8 of the Bill  is  to

make  plain  references to such City  Council  in  the

Local Government Ordinance, 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br><!--Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid(Assistant Minister for Education)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Assistant Minister for Education (Inche  Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid):</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there may have

been  some excuse for the two other Bills this morning

going  through  on a Certificate of  Urgency,  but  if

there is to be a sitting of this House before the 21st

of  December, which is the day of the elections to the

new City Council, I see no reason why this Bill should

be  rushed  through  all  its three  stages  today.  I

understand  the  arguments of the Minister  for  Local

Government, Lands and Housing and his desire to tie up

all  the  loose  ends to make sure that  there  is  no

ambiguity   of  any  kind  in  the  Local   Government

Ordinance   where  it  overlaps  the   old   Municipal

Ordinance.  But  I  strongly  deplore  this  habit  of

putting Bills before this House under Certificates  of

Urgency  when there is no urgency about  them,  as  we

will  meet  at  least  once more before  the  21st  of

December,  and  I therefore object to  the  manner  in

which this Bill is being rushed through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Are typed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk and

distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

very  short  amending  Bill.  It  proposes  that   the

definition  of "City Council" for the purpose  of  the

Local Government Elections Ordinance, 1957, be amended

to relate it to the definition in the Local Government

Ordinance,  1957, that that definition  in  the  Local

Government  Ordinance, 1957, will be  amended  by  the

Local  Government (Amendment) Ordinance,  1957,  which

has just been approved by this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One advantage of the amendment that is now proposed

is  that,  if in future it becomes necessary to  amend

the  definition  of "City Council", it  will  only  be

necessary  to do so in the Local Government Ordinance.

Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid): I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the corporate body of Tan Tock Seng's

Hospital  and  the  committee  of  management  of  the

hospital include ex-officio the Deputy Chief Secretary

and  the  Secretary  for Chinese Affairs.  The  Deputy

Chief   Secretary  is  not  directly  concerned   with

hospitals and it is thought that it would be useful to

replace  him  by  the  Assistant Director  of  Medical

Services,  Tuberculosis, who is of  course  intimately

concerned  with the administration of this  particular

hospital.  The  post of Secretary for Chinese  Affairs

will,  it  is expected, be abolished in the very  near

future and it is thought that that officer could  most

usefully  be  replaced  by  a  representative  of  the

Treasury. This Bill is designed to effect the  changes

I have referred to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>11.23 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I beg

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Customs Ordinance which was introduced in

April   1956,  consolidated  the  law  of  the  colony

regarding  dutiable goods and also introduced  certain

new  provisions. It was to be expected that  it  would

require certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2759</b></font><br><br>



amendments  after it had been in operation  for  some

time.  This  Bill seeks to make the amendments  which

experience has proved necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Objects and Reasons for the amendments are

explained  in considerable detail in the  Explanatory

Note which appears at the back of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends the definition of

"intoxicating  liquor" in section 3 of  the  original

Ordinance  so  that it will include  "fermented  rice

mash"  which  is used in the illicit distillation  of

samsu. This amendment is necessary in order to enable

the Customs Department to bring illicit distillers to

book.  Hitherto,  it  has been  difficult  to  obtain

conviction  in court because the existing  definition

has been held not to embrace "fermented rice mash".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15 of the Ordinance permits the Comptroller

to remit duty in respect of dutiable goods which have

been  lost  or damaged before removal from bond.  The

second  part of the section states that no  remission

will be allowed in respect of damage or in respect of

a  claim to pay duty at preferential rates unless the

claim is made before the goods are removed from bond.

The  amendment  in clause 4 extends  the  section  to

cover  claims for remission of duty arising from  the

fact  that the Customs officer responsible  may  have

misdirected himself in determining the amount of duty

to  be  paid. Once goods have been removed from bond,

it  is  difficult to identify them and  to  make  re-calculations of duty payable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 20 of the Ordinance stipulates the

conditions under which dutiable goods may be  removed

from   Customs  control.  Duty  must  be   paid   and

conditions   governing  deposits  in   a   Government

licensed  warehouse must be observed. Any  conditions

prescribed  by  the  Customs  about  export  must  be

complied  with and so on. The proviso to the  section

states however that goods can only be removed from  a

licensed warehouse before payment of duty if adequate

security  has  been lodged in advance.  It  has  been

found  that  the application of this section,  as  it

stands,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2760</b></font><br><br>



would   cause  embarrassment  and  give   cause   for

considerable  dissatisfaction.  Clause  6   therefore

seeks  to  amend  it  so  as to  give  power  to  the

Comptroller  to allow goods to be removed  from  bond

without  provision  of security if  he  considers  it

desirable  to  do so in any particular  case.  It  is

considered  that  the  powers already  given  to  the

Comptroller under Regulations 15 and 21 are  adequate

without any additional powers under section 20.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 introduces a new section to provide for

the  import  of trade samples. No duty is charged  on

such  samples  but  if they are of  more  than  token

value, a deposit in lieu of duty has to be made. This

will be recoverable when the samples are removed from

the colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 40 of the Ordinance prescribes that a

warehouse  deposit receipt will be issued in  respect

of  all goods deposited in a Government warehouse and

further  states  that the holder or endorsee  in  due

course  of such a receipt shall be deemed to  be  the

owner of the goods to which it refers and delivery to

such  holder or endorsee shall be a good  and  lawful

delivery: in other words, that the goods will only be

delivered  on  production of a deposit receipt.  This

section  was  introduced for the first  time  in  the

Customs   Ordinance,  having  been  taken  from   the

Federation  of Malaya Customs Ordinance. It  has  not

previously  been  incorporated  in  the  law  of  the

colony.  It  has  been found to be  impracticable  in

operation. In many cases, consignments are  split  up

and sales made while the goods are still in bond.  It

is  impossible  in  every case for the  purchaser  to

present   a   deposit  receipt.   To   overcome   the

difficulty,  it is proposed to amend  section  40  to

permit the use of an authenticated delivery order  in

lieu of a deposit receipt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 seeks to amend section 56 of the

Ordinance which permits the sale of beer for "off the

premises"  consumption without a licence between  six

in the morning and ten at night. Beer is in fact sold

at all hours of the day and night in Singapore and it

is quite impossible to stop the practice. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2761</b></font><br><br>



the circumstances, it is desired to amend the law  to

take account of the facts of the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 also deals with the sale of beer and aims

at   freeing  licensed  liquor  retailers  from   the

obligation to keep elaborate records of beer  stocks.

Practically every sundry goods shop keeps  and  sells

beer in much larger total quantity without having  to

keep any records at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 90 of the Ordinance lays the burden of

proof on the defendant in any case arising out of the

provisions  of the Ordinance. Clause 16 of  the  Bill

extends  the  scope  of the section  to  cover  cases

arising out of section 13 which empowers the Governor

in   Council  to  exempt  goods  from  duty  at   his

discretion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 96 of the Ordinance makes all goods liable

to  seizure under the Ordinance liable to forfeiture.

Goods for the purpose of this section are defined  as

including  receptacles, packages, vehicles,  aircraft

and  vessels  not exceeding 200 tons. The  object  of

clause  17  is  to  exempt large  aircraft  from  the

operation  of  the section in the same way  as  large

ships are exempted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 is important. It amends the law relating

to  the  forfeiture  of goods. At  present,  where  a

prosecution has been brought for an offence under the

Ordinance  in  respect of goods and the  Court  finds

that an offence has been committed in respect of  the

goods,  the Court may order the goods to be forfeited

even  if no person has been convicted of the offence.

It  is however open to the owner of the goods, it  he

has  not  been  charged  with an  offence  under  the

Ordinance or any regulation made hereunder in respect

of  the goods, to show that the offence was committed

without  his  knowledge, consent  or  connivance,  or

otherwise that the goods should not be forfeited. The

Court  may  then, after examination into the  matter,

make  any order it deems fit and may order the return

of  the goods to the owner. Where no prosecution  has

been brought but goods have been seized under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2762</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance,  the owner may send a notice stating  that

the  offence  was  committed without  his  knowledge,

consent  or connivance, or otherwise that  the  goods

should  not  be forfeited. The Comptroller  may  then

order the goods to be released but if he decides  not

to  do  so,  he refers the matter to the  Court.  The

Court  will then examine the matter and if the  Court

is  satisfied  that an offence against the  Ordinance

has  been committed in respect of the goods, it  will

order  the goods to be forfeited but if it is not  so

satisfied,  it will order the goods to  be  released.

The position is un-satisfactory because the Ordinance

appears  to  give the owner of goods  a  better  case

where  there has been a prosecution than where  there

has been no prosecution. The law in the Federation of

Malaya  is that once the Court is satisfied  that  an

offence  has been committed against the Ordinance  in

respect  of  the  goods, then the  Court  must  order

forfeiture of the goods. It is proposed to bring  the

law  in  the  Colony into line with the  law  in  the

Federation. Clause 18 of the Bill proposes amendments

to  section  97 of the Customs Ordinance  which  will

make  it  mandatory for the Court to order forfeiture

when  it  is  proved  that  an  offence  against  the

Ordinance has been committed in respect of the goods.

It  is also provided that things forfeited are to  be

delivered  to  Customs  for  disposal.  This  is  the

present practice and the clause clarifies this is the

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses in the Bill have been explained

in  the  Explanatory Note and do not require  further

explanation.

<div align="center"><b>MENTAL DISORDERS AND TREATMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>11.36 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of the amendments proposed in this

Bill is to facilitate the admission and treatment  of

patients  and to avoid non-essential formalities  and

publicity  which  often tend to  deter  patients  and

their   relatives  from  seeking  help  from   mental

hospitals.   Modern   opinion,  expressed   by   such

authorities as the World Health Organisation, is that

in  the past legislation has laid too much importance

on  putting restraint or a check on the mentally  ill

and   the  doctors  who  look  after  them  and   has

emphasised  too little the realisation  of  the  fact

that  there  is no essential difference  between  the

majority  of  mental patients and the ordinary  sick.

They  are  the same as, arid should be treated  in  a

manner   comparable  with,  those  who  suffer   from

injuries or other illnesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law provides proper safeguards for the

treatment  without their consent of persons  who  are

dangerous but the primary aim should be to make it as

easy  as  possible  for ordinary mental  patients  to

receive  treatment. The need for amending legislation

is  perhaps  most  clearly seen  in  respect  of  the

procedure for admission to and discharge from  mental

hospitals. It is proposed by this Bill that admission

should  be  made very much easier. In practice,  this

will mean that the documentation and formalities will

be  cut to a minimum and brought into line with those

required  for  admission to any other  hospital.  The

discharge  of  patients will similarly be  made  very

much  easier and, if this Bill is brought into force,

the  Medical  Superintendent  will  be  empowered  to

discharge any patient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, with very few exceptions, patients have

to  be  examined  as to their normality  by  a  Board

consisting   largely  of  laymen.  This  examination,

coming



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2764</b></font><br><br>



just before discharge when the patient is well again,

is   embarrassing   and  discourages   patients   and

relatives  of  people who ought to be  patients  from

seeking treatment when their symptoms are still  only

mild.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken of making it easier

for  persons who have attempted to commit suicide  to

be  given  treatment. Such persons are very often  in

need of mental care, perhaps more than of punishment,

and  it  is thought right that the courts and medical

officers  in ordinary hospitals should be  given  the

opportunity  of  ensuring that these people  can  get

proper treatment with a very minimum of formality and

administrative procedure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed by the Bill are all, I

think, fully explained in the Explanatory Note and  I

do  not  think that hon. Members will want me  to  go

through them in detail again at this stage. The  Bill

will,  I  think,  be welcomed by  all  who  have  the

interests of the mentally diseased at heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.41 am.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I do indeed welcome this

Bill  in  its  present form, particularly  as  it  is

stated in the Explanatory Note that this Bill is  "to

bring  the  provision of the Ordinance more  in  line

with modern conceptions relating to the treatment  of

persons suffering from mental disorder".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far, persons suffering from mental

disorders have been regarded with a certain amount of

abhorrence  and fear but in the modern  world  living

under  the  stresses which we do with  all  the  more

problems  that  we  have  to face,  mental  unbalance

occurs  more frequently and it is only right that  it

should be approached in a different light. It is true

that   we   should   make  it  very  difficult - almost

impossible - for persons who out of spite or hate would

want to commit their relatives into a mental hospital

but  by  making  it simple, as this  Bill  tends  to,

persons  suffering from mild symptoms can be accepted

quickly and with understanding be helped to be cured.

Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2765</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Sir, on clause 2, may I under the

proviso to Standing Order 51 (2) move an amendment of

a minor and drafting character?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Attorney-General indicate

the nature of the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Sir, at present, section 31 of the

Ordinance provides that "no person shall be  received

into  a  mental hospital except" in certain specified

circumstances. Clause 2 of the Bill,  as  at  present

drafted,  would  remove only a reference  to  34.  It

would  not  alter  the restrictions  which  apply  to

section  32, which require that the order  should  be

signed  by  two  registered medical practitioners  of

whom  one shall be a medical officer. By clause 3  of

this Bill, it is proposed that under section 32, only

the  certificate of one medical officer at  a  mental

hospital  shall  be required and not  two  registered

medical practitioners. That fact was overlooked  when

various other alterations were made to the Bill after

it had been first drafted.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What would be the hon. Member's

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> May I mention one other minor matter?

In  the  present  section 31, there is  reference  to

reception of patients under the provisions of section

37. It is proposed to repeal the existing section  37

by  clause  7 of this Bill but by clause  4  of  this

Bill-I   apologise  for  making   this   sound   very

complicated- there is another means of reception  now

to  be given for those persons who are either charged

with  attempted  suicide  or  are  believed  to  have

attempted  to  commit suicide, so that  reference  to

section



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2766</b></font><br><br>



37 could very usefully be altered to read section 34.

I  have  here, Sir, a written amendment that I  would

propose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do I understand, Mr Attorney-General, that these amendments are necessitated by

reason  of  the  amendments proposed in  the  present

Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Therefore, the Attorney-General

considers   that  they  are  of  a  purely   drafting

character?

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not know whether hon. Members

have followed that. The Standing Order reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any proposed amendments of which notice has not

been given shall be handed to the Chairman in writing

if  the  Chairman so requires. Except in the case  of

urgent  Bills, no amendment shall be proposed  unless

two clear days' notice thereof has been given:

whom  shall be a medical officer. By clause 3 of  the

Bill, it is proposed to amend section 32 so that  the

certificate  of only one doctor will be required.  It

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, under this

head provision of $91,000 is asked for the extra cost

of  building  two boys' hostels. The estimated  cost,

when  this scheme was proposed in 1951, was  $360,000

and  now the revised cost is $451,000, $91,000 extra.

To  my knowledge, I would concede ten per cent in the

increased  cost  of construction, and  I  would  like

particulars as to why this $91,000 is required.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> I might be able to help the hon.

got  into  the  estimates until 1955. My  friend  and

colleague the Financial Secretary can advise on that.

At  that stage there was only one hostel and  it  was

not  until 1957 that they got down to two.  The  site

has  been  changed from the Geylang Town  Centre,  of

which  they have still not finalised the planning.  I

think the concern is mainly with the Bukit Batoh site

at  present  in this provision. The accommodation  is

two  Division II quarters, dormitories for  50  boys,

classrooms,   workshops,  dining-room  and   kitchen,

playing  fields,  an  office,  septic  tanks  and,  I

suppose, some road-works. The other site, I think, is

in Dunman Road and it is not finalised yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position at present is that under the

Merchant  Shipping  (Passenger  Certificate   Partial

Survey  Fees)  Rules, 1955, the Government  can  only

charge  shipowners partial survey fees, that is  fees

for surveys of parts of a ship, when the ship holds a

full    certificate   which   is   issued   by    the

administration   of  a  territory  other   than   the

Government   of  Singapore.  The  Merchant   Shipping

(Passenger Certificate Partial Survey Fees)

(Amendment)  Rules, 1957, are therefore  designed  to

permit Government to charge such partial survey  fees

in  all  cases including those in which  the  current

full  Passenger Certificate is issued by  the  Colony

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, opportunity has also been taken to include fees

for the four items listed in the Rules. Sir, I beg to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is rather a formidable sounding motion,

but  it is really a formality. Since the Departmental

Titles (Alteration) Ordinance was enacted in 1950, it

has  from  time to time been necessary to  bring  the

Schedule  included  in it up to  date,  so  that  the

powers  and  duties  of  the  authorities  named   in

legislation,  contracts and such like documents,  but

which  authorities have been abolished or renamed  in

quite   understand  it.  It  says   there   in   Part

Secretary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As I understand the Chief

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Secretary for Internal Affairs;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Secretary for Chinese Affairs (also concerned with internal

affairs); and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Principal Assistant Secretary, Internal Security

(also internal affairs). How are these three

officers, who have been bracketed into one officer,

going to look after home and external affairs? Is

there a change in the nature or the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2776</b></font><br><br>



jurisdiction of the office, or is this only a  change

<br><br><!-- Mr Hoffman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hoffman:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is essentially a

change  in  name.  The duties are  still  within  the

portfolio of the Chief Secretary and external affairs

remain, as heretofore, within his jurisdiction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Further elucidation, Sir. Did any

of these three officers have jurisdiction in external

affairs  as distinct from the Chief Secretary?  There

are three officers, designated by three high-sounding

titles - Secretary for Internal Affairs, Secretary for

Chinese  Affairs, and Principal Assistant  Secretary,

Internal Security. Did they have anything to do  with

external  affairs? If not, how does external  affairs

become combined in one?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hoffman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hoffman:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the duties coming

under  external affairs were always performed in  the

Ministry of the Chief Secretary and will continue  to

be so. The change merely means that these duties will

now  be  performed  by  the Secretary  for  Home  and

External Affairs rather than by any other officer  of

the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> My last point of elucidation, Sir.

May  I  put  it as simply and as plainly as possible?

Did  any  of  these  three  officers  who  are  being

abolished  have anything to do with external  affairs

before?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hoffman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hoffman:</b> It is correct to say that the Secretary

for  Internal Affairs formerly performed duties which

can  be  described as external affairs in  the  sense

that  the  officers  serving under  him  carried  out

duties in regard to external affairs, and the present

title  reflects  far  better than  those  before  the

duties  now performed by the Secretary for  Home  and

External Affairs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the

Education  Bill, as contained in Sessional Paper  No.

L.A.   19  of  1957,  be  adopted,  subject  to   the

recommittal of the Bill in respect of Clauses  2,  5,

8, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 31, 33, 34, 37,

38, 39, 42, 44, 46, 48, 49,

53, 62  and 66  to  a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope hon. Members of this House will not feel

overwhelmed  by the number of amendments that  appear

in  the  motion. We must all agree that the Education

Bill   has  been  one  of  the  most  difficult   and

controversial Bills in this Assembly. That the Select

Committee  has been able to present its Report  is  a

sure  indication  that all Members of  the  Committee

have  co-operated fully in coming to a happy solution

to  most of the difficult problems presented by

this Bill. In this respect, Sir, I must thank



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2780</b></font><br><br>



you, as Chairman of the Select Committee, for helping

all  of  us to come to the present position.  I  must

also  say that the Members of the Opposition  in  the

Select Committee have co-operated with the Members on

the  Government  Benches in making most  constructive

and  helpful suggestions during the meetings  of  the

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some points which were not entirely

agreeable to all Members of the Committee and I  have

given  an  undertaking to consider them and  make  my

recommendations  at this sitting.  In  going  through

these  points I have also gone through the Bill quite

thoroughly and have come to the conclusion  that  the

amendments  contained in my motion are necessary  not

only to improve the language of the Bill but also  to

put  things  right, and generally to  make  the  Bill

workable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not take more time than is necessary in

moving my motion by going into the various amendments

in  detail. I will deal with these amendments as each

of  them  comes up and I will explain  the  need  for

them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2781</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is able to come to the decisions for

the  amendments today because there have been  useful

suggestions and criticisms from members of the public

and   organisations  which  have   either   submitted

memoranda   to  the  Select  Committee  or   appeared

personally  before  the  Committee.  Education  is  a

matter that should concern everybody in this country,

both  young and old, and it is only right that people

should  have  taken  an  interest  in  the  Bill.  In

introducing  this  Bill,  Government  is  laying  the

foundation stone for the education of children of all

communities   in   Singapore  without  discrimination

whatsoever.  The job facing Government  in  educating

the  children  of Singapore is enormous,  and  unless

there  is  goodwill all-round, all the  efforts  that

have been put into this Bill will be in vain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been criticisms levelled at certain

discretionary powers to be given to the  Director  of

Education.  I  want to stress that we have  tried  to

meet  these criticisms as best we could, but  I  must

remind  the  House that unless officials who  are  to

administer  the law for the good of the country  have

certain  powers, we might as well have  no  laws.  We

must  accept  in good faith the fact that responsible

officers will exercise their powers judiciously,  and

as  far as my Ministry is concerned, I can assure the

House  that I will see that the powers are not abused

by  any of my officers. I would like to reiterate the

assurance I gave to this House at one of the previous

sittings  of the Assembly that, wherever the Director

of  Education  has  discretionary  powers  under  the

Education   Bill,   I   will   take   the   necessary

administrative action in my Ministry to see  that  he

does not exercise these powers to the disadvantage of

anyone,  without  prior  reference  to  my  Permanent

Secretary or to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point which I wish to touch on,

and  that  is in regard to clause 24 (e).  There  was

some argument as to whether that provision should  be

taken out of the Bill, and I also gave an undertaking

in the Select Committee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2782</b></font><br><br>



to  reconsider  whether  or not  this  paragraph  (e)

should be deleted. Although it is a fact that land is

hard  to  come by in Singapore, particularly  in  the

city area, I feel that the deletion of this paragraph

will encourage the management of proposed schools  in

rural areas, or in places where land is not difficult

to  come by, to shirk its responsibility in providing

adequate open air recreation for the pupils. We  must

also  plan  for  the day when it may be  possible  to

provide  well-built school buildings in  areas  where

large  areas of land are not available. When we reach

that  stage, we may wish to consider taking over  the

pupils  from  schools that are unhealthy  because  of

inadequate or unsatisfactory provision for  open  air

recreation. Certain Members fear that this  provision

might be made use of rather indiscriminately for  the

cancellation of existing schools which cannot provide

adequate or satisfactory open air recreation;  but  I

must remind Members that no one will be so mad as  to

do  this  at  a  time  when the problem  involved  of

providing accommodation for children of school  going

age  is  already enormous. To cancel existing schools

at  such  a  juncture will worsen the problem  rather

than  improve  it,  but this does not  mean  that  my

Ministry  will not insist on certain improvements  to

schools which have inadequate or unsatisfactory  open

air  recreation.  In view of all  the  reasons  given

above,  I  have  decided that  paragraph  (e)  should

remain if my Ministry is to function properly. Sir, I

beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid): Sir, I second the

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly recommitted to a Committee of the

whole Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is considered that the definition of "higher

education" as contained in the Bill is unsatisfactory

because of the vagueness of the term "Chinese  Higher

Middle  three". We have also left out the  Malay  and

Tamil  languages  the  proposed  amendment  therefore

makes it clearer.

authority" means the City Council, the Rural

Board or a District Council;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendment to the definition is

necessary as a result of a reference to "local

-'"public security" means the security of Malaya

and the maintenance of public order therein;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendment to the definition of

"public  security" is more satisfactory  in  that  it

makes  a  specific reference rather than by inference

to the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is necessary as a result of the

amendments  which have been made to clause  28  under

which  the  supervisor of a school is registered  and

not approved by the Director.

<br><br>I  gave  an  undertaking in the Select  Committee  to

reconsider  the  amendment to clause  5  (2)  at  the

recommittal  stage. I have now given further  thought

to  clause  5 (2) and decided to amend it as  in  the

proposed  amendment. This amendment will  allow  such

educational     institutions,    organizations     or

associations  to  nominate persons to  serve  on  the

Finance Board. This is in line with the provisions of

clause 8.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 28, line 36, to leave out "giving reasons".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on further consideration of the proviso to

clause  5 (5), I have come to the conclusion that  it

is  quite  inappropriate to require the  Minister  to

give   reasons   when  he  revokes   an   appointment

originally  made  by  him. Under  the  Interpretation

Ordinance   it   is  provided  that  the   appointing

authority  is  also  the revoking authority,  and  no

reasons  are necessary. I should also like  to  point

out  that when the Minister makes an appointment,  he

is  not required to give reasons. It must be accepted

in  good faith that responsible persons will exercise

their  powers judiciously, and it is no use requiring

a  person  to  give reasons if he is bent  on  acting

injudiciously. However, as I have pointed out,  under

the Interpretation Ordinance the appointing authority

is also the revoking authority.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

if  I  remember correctly, the words "giving reasons"

were  accepted  by the Minister in Select  Committee.

Now the reason for not giving reasons when exercising

the  powers  under  this clause 5  (5)  seems  to  be

contrary  to what he had reasoned out to be right.  I

will  say  that  appointments of this nature  to  the

Finance  Board  are important and the  revocation  of

appointments is also as important. It may be the  law

of  the Colony that the appointing authority is  also

the  revoking authority, but it will definitely  help

to  satisfy the public if the Minister agrees to  his

original  idea  of  giving reasons for  revoking  any

appointment,   as   had   been   requested   by   the

representors   who   appeared   before   the   Select

Committee. Whether it is on the statute book or  not,

I believe it would be best to explain the reasons for

taking  such  an  important  action  as  revoking  an

appointment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, as I have pointed out, the

Interpretation  Ordinance states that the  appointing

authority  is  also  the revoking  authority  and  it

appears  then that having the words "giving  reasons"

in  this Bill would actually be ultra vires.  I  have

already  given  the reason for moving  to  leave  out

"giving  reasons". I should also like to  point  out,

Sir, that at the time of revoking an appointment, the

Minister   surely   must  have   reasons   for   such

revocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I move,



in  page  37,  lines 4 to 6, to leave out  paragraph

(j).



<br><br>Sir,  the  paragraph as it stands is  quite  useless

because   it  is  not  possible  to  say  under   any

circumstances that "the proposed school  premises  or

equipment cannot be raised to a standard to allow  of

efficient tuition in the subjects to be taught in the

school". Even a shack can be raised to a standard  to

allow of efficient tuition if it were pulled down and

a  skyscraper erected in its place. I have  therefore

considered this paragraph useless and it is better to

delete it. It will do no harm to the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, we welcome the

decision   of  the  Government  to  leave  out   this

and unsatisfactory and it is better deleted..

two hundred pupils in any one session;".



<br><br>Sir,  this  is  merely a rewording to  make  it  more

logical.  This  paragraph deals with  the  Director's

refusal to register a school in regard to its student

population,  and  a  proposed school  cannot  have  a

student  population before it is  registered.  It  is

therefore  quite wrong and illogical to  say  that  a

proposed school has a student population.

<br><br>Sir,  the  word  "undesirable" in this  paragraph  is

obviously  not the right word to use with  the  words

"in  the  interests of the Colony". The  proper  word

seems to me to be "against" and not "undesirable".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 24, as amended,

stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I have never been happy

about  this  clause 24 right from the  beginning  and

this  will probably be noticed in the Report  of  the

Select  Committee. Up to now, Sir,  I  am  still  not

happy with many paragraphs of this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 24 (a) -"the Director may refuse to

register  a school if adequate educational facilities

already  exist  in the area . . ."-I personally  feel

that  this  is  not necessary, because if  there  are

already  sufficient  educational  facilities  in  the

area,  then nobody will want to build a school there.

I  argued that out in the Select Committee and I will

not waste the time of Members here to proceed further

with it. But I should like to voice my non-conviction

of the necessity for this paragraph.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 24 (e) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may refuse to register a school if

the area provided for the open air recreation of

pupils is inadequate or unsatisfactory;"-



<br><br>that is practically an impossibility in the town.

Business people in town may not find the cost of land

excessive, but people living in the rural areas may

find it formidable. To provide ideal conditions to

run a school in any area which has limited land is, I

think, too much to hope for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 24 (g) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may refuse to register a school if

the proposed fees are excessive, having regard to the

cost of maintaining and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2790</b></font><br><br>



conducting the proposed school and the standard of

education to be provided;"-



<br><br>no  one would send their children to a school that is

demanding  excessive  fees, but because  they  cannot

send  their  children to a school  that  is  charging

reasonable  fees, that is the reason why  the  pupils

have  to  go to schools which are charging  excessive

fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 24 (h) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Director may refuse to register a school if

the qualifications and experience of the proposed

teachers are not adequate to ensure the efficient

conduct of the proposed school;"-



<br><br>I would say that no sane parents will send their

children to a school with under-qualified teachers

unless they are forced to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these points indicate that educational

facilities in this colony are still inadequate and it

is up to the Government to try and solve the problem.

If  they do not solve it, such conditions will  still

exist and such schools will still spring up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, more concerned especially when clause

24  is  going  to be related to clause 25  where  the

Director  may,  under  clause  25  (1)  (a),   cancel

existing  schools  on all these  grounds.  All  these

schools  are  serving  a  useful  purpose;  they  are

helping  in the education of our children. They  must

be  given all the regard and respect because of their

good  work, and the powers in clause 24 (a)  and  (e)

should  never be exercised under clause 25  (1)  (a),

because  it  will be impossible for schools  to  make

available playing fields when there are none. I  want

an  assurance  from the Minister for  Education  that

clause  25 (1) (a), which touches on clause 24,  will

be  exercised with the greatest of care and  that  no

existing school should be punished.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I cannot help feeling, Mr Chairman,

that  the hon. Member has in mind the exciting debate

we  had  in this House when our former Chief Minister

proved  that "may" means "shall". I would remind  him

that  the  word  is  "may" here - a  permissive  clause

enabling the Director, in his discretion, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2791</b></font><br><br>



exercise  a  measure  of control over  these  various

aspects  of  school buildings. I  am  sure  the  hon.

Member will agree that we should secure the very best

we  can for our students in schools. If we can get  a

committee to provide playing fields, they should have

them.  Some  schools do not provide very big  playing

fields,  others do; but if we can get them to provide

them, they should provide them. And so with the other

things mentioned in this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member raised the point about paragraph

(a),  that  "adequate educational facilities  already

exist in the area in which it is proposed . . .". and

I  think he said that no sane person would attempt to

provide   facilities  in  an  area   where   adequate

facilities  already were proposed would exist.  Well,

again I cannot help remembering the debate which took

place  in  another democratic body, the City Council,

when there was already one cinema in an area and  two

more  were  proposed, and more time and trouble  were

spent on those three cinemas than on almost any other

matter which has come before the public of Singapore.

The  presumption  is that somebody must,  I  suppose,

have  been  insane because they were  all  trying  to

provide  facilities where adequate facilities already

existed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view is that his arguments in general are

insufficient. The point is that the clause is not  to

close  schools, or to be repressive or  unnecessarily

restrictive;  the  point is that  the  clause  is  to

enable  the authorities to put some pressure  on  any

slack or negligent committee, to make sure that  they

do  move forward and give the very best that  can  be

given for our students, who are so important to us in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, in reply to the hon. Member

for Serangoon, I will give this undertaking as I have

given  just now, that no action will be taken to  de-register any existing schools just because they  lack

recreational  facilities. As I have  pointed  out  in

Select  Committee, such a clause is merely to provide

a  guard  against any unscrupulous person wanting  to

take advantage of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2792</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a slight alteration to the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I draw the attention of the Minister to the

"Appointment  and  cancellation  of  appointment   of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1)The Committee of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the marginal title should not in

fact be, "Registration and withdrawal of registration

of supervisor."?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words "of a school" are in the wrong place. The

amendment is therefore to put the phraseology right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this clause the Director may cancel the

registration of any manager of a school, that  is  to

say,  the  Director will be considering managers  who

the  date of his registration" in paragraph  (g)  are

redundant  because  it  must be  after  the  date  of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a re-arrangement to make the clause more

readable and to prevent any ambiguity. Paragraph  (c)

has been slightly re-worded to make it more specific,

that the officers are the officers empowered under

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) what is the total

number  of  attap  and-plank  dwelling-houses  on Singapore Island built on-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Crown land

occupied under Temporary Occupation Licences;

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) private land; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) whether any measures are being taken by the

Government  to  assist  the  occupiers  of   such

dwelling-houses, when demolished by the owners of

the land, to find alternative accommodation or to

obtain compensation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) There are no

comprehensive  records  from  which  the   exact

number   of  attap  and  plank  dwelling  houses

whether on Crown or on private land in Singapore

can  be ascertained: the existing records of the

City Council, Rural Board and Land Office do not

provide  this detailed information. A survey  of

attap  areas  carried out in July 1953  for  the

purpose of assisting in the preparation  of  the

Master   Plan   estimated,  however,   that   of

temporary housing in the form of plank and attap

huts, some 246,000 people were living within the

area  shown in the Town Map, and it was possible

that  a  further 150,000 lived in attap huts  in

the rural area, including the Islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In so far as Crown Land or land acquired for

public purposes is concerned, the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2800</b></font><br><br>



for   Changi   is   probably   aware   that    a

comprehensive re-housing and resettlement scheme

has  been  in operation for some time  by  which

alternative  accommodation  and!  or   ex-gratia

compensation is provided to bona fide  occupants

who  are  required to move from their houses  on

land  required  by Government  or  other  public

bodies  for development. With regard to  private

land, Government cannot compel owners to pay any

ex-gratia  compensation but it is believed  that

Government's example has had a persuasive effect

on  many  owners  who  have  paid  occupants  in

accordance with Government's own rates.

encouraging joint Singapore/Japanese fishing projects

which  include the training of local personnel as  an

which licences will be issued for such projects  were

publicised  in  the local papers on  18th  September,

1957,   and   applications  have  been  invited.   An
