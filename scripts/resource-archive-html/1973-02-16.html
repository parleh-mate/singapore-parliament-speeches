<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj</b> asked the

Minister  for  Communications  what  measures  the

Government is taking against old buses with  smoky

exhausts and noisy engines which are still on  the

roads.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng) (for the Minister for Communications):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the problem o  old  buses  with

smoky  exhausts and noisy engines is being tackled

in several ways.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective is the replacement programme

as set out in the White Paper on Reorganisation of

the  Motor Transport Service of Singapore (Command

Paper   21   of   1970).  Under  this  replacement

programme the numbers to be replaced are:



<pre>

     Year       1970/71  1971/72   1972/73   Total

(July to June)

 Replacement      50       100       150      300

</pre>



<br><br>Buses are recommended for replacement on attaining

the age of 17 years. Since the reorganisation, 231

buses  have been replaced, of which 64 were  under

17 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, all buses are subject to half

yearly   inspections   at   the   ROV   Mechanical

Inspection Centre. Those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



found  to  emit  excessive  smoke  and  noise  are

required to have these faults rectified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spot checks on the road are also made on buses

for excessive smoke or noise. In addition, actions

are  taken  based  on complaints from  the  public

against specific buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures have resulted in a total of 3,018

buses  being  "booked" for smoky  exhausts  during

1971.  During  1972 (Jan-Dec),  2,955  buses  were

"booked" for the same offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for buses with noisy engines, some discretion

has  to be exercised in dealing with this problem.

Most  of the noisy buses come from the lot of 400-odd  former STC buses taken over by the three  bus

companies  following the collapse of the Singapore

Traction Company. These are being phased out in  a

manner  that  will not cause a sudden shortage  of

buses  or impose a sudden financial burden on  the

bus companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai may wish to note

that,  in  the  White Paper tabled on  21st  July,

1970,  the  total number of public  buses  on  the

roads  as  at 30th April, 1970 is given as  1,390.

However,  as at 31st January, 1973, we have  2,079

public buses. In time, all the former STC buses as

well  as the other old buses would be phased  out.

The  bus companies are themselves aware that  many

of  their  old  buses are costly  to  operate  and

maintain.

<div align="center"><b>PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA BY AIR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Improvement of flight system)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the

Minister  for  Communications,  in  view  of   the

increased number of persons going on pilgrimage to

Mecca  by  special chartered flights, if  he  will

consider  improving the system for  departure  and

arrival of such flights.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, prior to 1971,

there  were  very few special pilgrimage  flights.

Most pilgrims went and returned by ship. With  the

advent of cheap charter flights, special



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



pilgrimage flights have increased. There  were  12

such  flights from Singapore in 1971,  and  13  in

1972. During 1971, there were 1,103 passengers  by

special   pilgrimage  flights  arriving  and   827

departing.  For  1972,  there  were  939  of  such

arriving passengers and 492 departing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of passengers by special

pilgrimage flights arriving and departing is  only

about 2 per cent of the total number of passengers

passing through the Singapore Airport on a  single

day.  For  a  normal  day  in  1972,  about  9,000

passengers would be passing through the  Singapore

Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pilgrimage flights, Singapore Airlines has

made  special  provisions  to  begin  checking  in

passengers as early as three to four hours  before

each flight, compared to some one to two hours for

other   flights.  Other  departure   and   arrival

procedures at the Singapore International  Airport

have  also  been  improved for  all  incoming  and

outgoing  flights,  including  pilgrimage  charter

flights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some congestion at the Airport terminal

building  before  the departure or  arrival  of  a

special  pilgrimage flight. But this is caused  by

the many well-wishers of the pilgrims. These well-wishers begin to assemble at the terminal building

from  as  early  as five to six hours  before  the

departure  or  arrival  of  a  special  pilgrimage

flight.  The  present terminal  building  was  not

designed  to cater for such large crowds of  well-wishers  over such long periods of time.  However,

when  the  present  plans  for  expansion  of  the

Airport   are  completed,  the  Airport   terminal

buildings  should be well able to cope  with  such

capacity crowds.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, can the Minister of

completed?

do our best to expedite it. But I do not think the

time  I gave can be shortened, as it will take  at

least  six months to a year for the completion  of

the job.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, if my

this question sometime last year. But this portion

of  the road does not go through Kampong Kembangan

and, in fact, one of them asked me to go slow.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, can the

of Parliament, but the fact is that one did.

which  spill sand, stones, earth, etc.  On  public

roads are ticketted under the Environmental Public

Health Act. Further, if the spillage is on a small

scale,  it  is  cleaned up  by  labourers  of  the

Environmental Health Division. However, if  it  is

extensive, the contractor is required to clean  it

up,  or the Environmental Health Division will  do

so and bill him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, water-waggons are also deployed

for  emergency  flushing  of  spillage  on  public

roads.  Where  the  littering is  expected  to  be

protracted, the contractor is required to  provide

his own flushing facilities to the satisfaction of

the Environmental Health Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the spillage damages the road, the haulage

contractor is required to repair the road  to  the

satisfaction of the PWD or the PWD will do so  and

bill him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police takes a serious view of such

lorries  violating traffic rules. Those who  drive

the  lorries  in  excess of the  prescribed  speed

limits   are  fined  or  prosecuted.  A  Selective

Enforcement Squad has also been formed within  the

Mobile  Squad  of the Traffic Police  Division  to

deal with such offenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period 1-1-72 to 31-12-72, 502 cases of

spillage  by lorries on roads and 3,167  cases  of

speeding  by lorries were reported to  the  Police

and appropriate action taken against them.

<div align="center"><b>REVISION OF SALARIES AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE FOR GOVERNMENT SENIOR OFFICERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>



<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Treasury has

for  some time been reviewing the various  schemes

of  Government  service and making changes,  where

desirable,  to  them.  Members  may  recall,   for

example,  the  restructuring of  Teachers'  salary

scales,  and the revision of salaries  for  Junior

Police  Officers, Technical Officers,  Nurses  and

Midwives  and  daily-rated  employees.   In   this

Statement, however, my purpose is to consider  the

terms  and  conditions of service of  Division  I,

especially    Administrative   and   Professional,

Officers  constituting the  top  echelons  of  the

civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These officers form about 2 per cent only of the

Government  Service but make the  most  vital  and

important contribution as they give administrative

and  professional leadership and direction to  the

whole    service.    Their   administrative    and

professional  skills, so valuable  to  Government,

would  be  equally useful to the  private  sector,

which  can, and often do attract them by the offer

of  rewards  well  in excess of  what  the  public

sector at present pays. It is not expected that we

can  completely  prevent  losses  to  the  private

sector,  even with the revisions we are proposing.

But it is essential, if we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



not   to  strain  unduly  the  great  loyalty  and

dedication  to the Service which most of  our  top

civil servants have shown, that their salaries and

conditions of service should he roughly equated to

those in the private sector. The Government should

seek  to  be  regarded, taking the  monetary  with

other non-financial rewards which are offered,  as

equally good or even better employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I propose to confine my remarks in this

Statement to revisions proposed for the Government

sector,  I  recognise that they  will  be  equally

pertinent  to some employers in the public  sector

who  also  employ administrative and  professional

officers.  Where  their  qualifications  and   the

nature of their work are comparable, the terms and

conditions   of   service  of   their   Government

counterparts are relevant. To the extent that such

Statutory  Boards  and  Universities  depend  upon

Government  financing, my Budget and Establishment

Division, in consultation with these public sector

bodies,  will examine any necessary revisions  for

such  professional and administrative officers  so

that  they  may be correlated with  those  of  the

Government. But it is necessary to emphasise  that

the  Government revisions may not be  relevant  or

appropriate to all administrative and professional

officers  in the public sector as the  nature  and

responsibilities  of  such  officers   and   their

conditions of service may be quite different  from

those of the Government officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revisions of salaries have obvious financial

implications  which  have  had  to  be   carefully

considered  in  relation to  Singapore's  economic

situation and its ability to pay enhanced salaries

not  only to officers in Superscale posts but also

to  officers  in  the whole of the public  sector.

Pending such consideration, the payment of a  non-pensionable  annual allowance  equivalent  to  one

month's salary (a sort of 13th month payment) as a

regular  annual  feature was  an  interim  measure

which  has  not, however, rendered the problem  of

restructuring  the  top  civil  service  any  less

urgent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of Singapore's continuing economic

growth, it is now proposed to make revisions  with

effect  from  1st March, 1973 as in the  Table* (*See Appendix, cols 435-6.)  I have distributed.



<br>

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1973/19730216/19730216-HA-0320435.pdf"">Appendix to Statement on Revision of Salaries of Senior Appointments in the Public Service (Cols. 392-401) (0435-0436)</a><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following remarks may be of value in

considering  the changes proposed  in  the  Table.

First,  with  regard to the Timescale  Division  I

Administrative  and Professional Officers,  it  is

generally recognised that the first three years of

the  salary  scale  for Division  I  Officers  are

adequate for the period during which officers  are

still   learning  and  undergoing  training.   The

inadequacy often arises after three to five  years

when there may be difficulty in retaining some  of

the  more promising officers who are attracted  to

seemingly greener pastures in the private  sector.

We have tried to find an answer to this problem in

more  rapid and more frequent promotions to higher

segments  of the salary scale based on  merit  and

not  necessarily on vacancies and  these  are  now

regularly   being  done  by  the  Public   Service

Commission.   For  example,  the  Public   Service

Commission   has  only  this  week   concluded   a

promotion  exercise in the administrative  service

in which 11 Assistant Secretaries were promoted to

the grade of Principal Assistant Secretary and  16

Administrative  Assistants were  promoted  to  the

grade  of  Assistant Secretary with an  additional

three promoted to Principal Assistant Secretary on

trial and seven promoted to Assistant Secretary on

trial  for  one  year. In addition to  these  more

frequent  promotions for the Division I  Officers,

it   is   proposed  to  introduce  a   scheme   of

accelerated increments for merit. This will enable

us to reward by more than the normal one increment

annually,  but  subject  to  a  maximum  of   four

increments, deserving officers who either are  not

yet  ready to be promoted to the next grade or for

other   organisational  reasons   cannot   be   so

promoted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Merit Increment Scheme has been accepted by

the   Public  Service  Commission  and  the  Legal

Service Commission, and will be implemented



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



this year. The Scheme will then apply not only  to

Timescale  officers in the Administrative  Service

but  also  to professional officers like  doctors,

lawyers,  architects and engineers. The assessment

of  the  merit  of individual officers  under  the

Scheme  will  be  carried out by  a  Committee  of

relevant   Permanent  Secretaries  who   will   be

appointed  by, and will make their recommendations

to  the  Public Service Commission (or  the  Legal

Service   Commission,  as  the   case   may   be).

Admittedly, such assessment of merit will  not  be

an  easy  task  but  the  Committee  of  Permanent

Secretaries   will   have  access   to   all   the

confidential  dossiers  of  the  officers  and   a

specially   prepared  report  by   the   Head   of

Department of the officers concerned. This  Scheme

is  not  a novel one as it has been tried  out  in

other public services and it has also been adopted

by some companies in the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Upper Timescale Officers, that

is,  officers on the salary scale $1,700x50-1,850,

it  is  proposed to revise their salary  scale  to

$1,700x 100-2,000. There are really two changes to

this scale:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) it extends the upper limit from $1,850 to $2,000 and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) it increases the yearly increment from the existing $50 per annum to $100 per annum.



<br><br>The  Upper Timescale grade is a stepping stone  to

the  Superscale  grades and the  present  revision

bringing  the maximum to $2,000 will  ensure  that

the  Upper Timescale Officers will reach a  higher

maximum than the Timescale Officers on the  salary

scale  $900x50-l,000/1,050x50-l,400/1,450x50-1,850.  A Timescale Officer through the passage  of

time only will no longer reach the same salary  as

an Upper Timescale Officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to the first of the Superscale

grades,   that   is,  Superscale  G.   There   are

Superscale  G  officers in the Government  service

ranging from Assistant Directors of Education  and

Deputy  Chief  Planner,  Planning  Department,  to

Radiologists. The salary of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



Superscale G Officers is to be revised from $l,920

to $2,500, an increase of $580 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next in the Superscale structure is Superscale

Grade F which at present is at a salary of $2,020.

Comparatively,  there are only a small  number  of

Superscale  F  Officers in the Government  service

and    these   comprise   the   Senior   Assistant

Commissioner  of Police, the Director  of  Prisons

and  the  Director  of  National  Library  amongst

others.  The  responsibility of these officers  is

generally  a  shade higher than the  Superscale  G

Officers. It is proposed to revise their salary to

$2,750,  an  increase of $730 per month  over  the

present salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further up the ladder is Superscale Grade E which

includes officers like the Assistant Directors  of

Public Works, the Commissioner of Lands and Deputy

Secretaries  of  Ministries. The salary  of  these

Superscale  Grade E Officers will be revised  from

$2,070 to $3,000, an increase of $930 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next are Superscale D Officers. There are only a

small  number  of officers in this  grade  amongst

whom  are  the  Accountant-General,  the  Auditor-General, Deputy Directors of Medical Services, the

Deputy  Director of Public Works, the Director  of

Civil  Aviation, the Registrar of the  High  Court

and  the Senior District Judge. At present,  these

officers are drawing a salary of $2,170 and it  is

proposed  to revise their salaries to  $3,500  per

month.  In addition, it is also proposed to  bring

this  grade of officers within the scheme  whereby

they will be entitled to the use of a car paid for

by  the  Government but maintained by the officers

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to the Superscale C grade. This is

the  grade  for most of the Permanent  Secretaries

and   for  four  other  officers,  the  Solicitor-General,  the Commissioner of Police, the Director

of  Public  Works and the Commissioner  of  Inland

Revenue.    In    recognition   of    the    heavy

responsibilities that these officers  shoulder  as

administrative   Heads  of  the  Ministries,   the

present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



salary  of  $2,350 per month will  be  revised  to

$4,500.  In  addition, they will  continue  to  be

entitled  to  the  use  of  a  car  paid  for   by

Government.  Special arrangements of  an  official

car  with driver maintained by Government are made

for  the  Commissioner of Police  because  of  his

position as head of a disciplined force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next higher in grade is Superscale B, which

includes   other  Permanent  Secretaries,   Puisne

Judges   and   the  President  of  the  Industrial

Arbitration Court. In view of the nature of  their

duties  and the positions they occupy, the  salary

of this grade of officers presently at $2,700 will

be  revised  to  $5,500 per month.  They  are,  of

course,  also  entitled to the use of  a  car.  In

addition  to  the car that would  be  provided  by

Government,  the  Judges will  continue  to  enjoy

perquisites  such  as a Government  house  at  the

usual   Government  subsidised  rental  but  fully

maintained by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to create an additional grade

called  Superscale B1 to be attached to  the  most

senior of the Puisne Judges in recognition of  his

special  position. This salary will he revised  to

$6,000 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the hierarchy is Super-scale A.

There  are only three full-time civil servants  on

this  grade  - two Permanent Secretaries  and  the

Attorney-General,  in addition  to  the  Chairman.

Public Service Commission, and for the purposes of

grading  only,  the Honour-able  Speaker  of  this

House.  It  is  indeed  difficult  to  assess,  in

monetary terms, the value of these officers but it

is now proposed that the salary of these officers,

who  are presently at $3,000 per month, be revised

to  $6,500  per  month. Special  arrangements  are

intended for the Speaker since he officiates part-time,  but he will continue to be entitled to  the

official residence (with servants) and an official

car, as at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, we have to consider the position of the

Chief Justice. He will be graded as Superscale Al,

with  a salary of $7,500. The Chief Justice  will,

in addition, continue to enjoy all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



other  terms of office which he presently  enjoys,

including  an  official car  with  driver  and  an

official   residence  maintained   at   Government

expense,  together  with  a  number  of  household

servants to help to upkeep the residence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having dealt generally with the various

Superscale  gradings and the  salaries  and  other

terms appropriate to each, I should like to say  a

word about cur medical services officers. Many  of

them are in specialist grades, either in the G  or

E  Superscales. At one time, it was  the  practice

for    these   specialists   (both   medical   and

professional) to be allowed to retain part of  the

consultation  fees from private patients  or  from

undertaking   outside   consultancy   work.   This

practice,  however,  resulted in  malpractices  or

conduct   unbecoming  to  the   specialist   whose

attitude towards patients tended to be related  to

their ability to pay fees. Also, essential medical

specialities,  such  as pathology  and  radiology,

where  the  possibilities  of  fees  earning  were

greatly  inferior, tended to be increasingly  less

favoured  for  specialisation by the bright  young

medical  officer.  In  1958,  this  practice   was

abolished   and   replaced  by  fixed   Specialist

Allowances  for  Superscale  Medical  Officers  at

varying rates. These rates were revised in 1969 to

$100  per  month,  $150 and  $500  per  month  for

Medical Officer, Senior Registrar and Superscale G

respectively, and $750 per month for Superscale  E

and above. However, over the last two years, there

has   been   increasing  pressure  for   the   re-introduction  of  some scheme in which  consultant

fees would be shared by the consultant specialist.

My colleagues in the Cabinet and I do not favour a

system which experience has so clearly shown to be

readily  subject to abuses. At the  same  time,  I

realise  that  if  we  are  to  retain  our   best

specialists, we must recognise the value of  their

contributions  in  some  tangible  way.  For  this

purpose,   we  should  promote  a   few   of   our

outstanding specialists to Superscale D. This will

not  only mean an immediate increase in salary  of

$1,430  per month for promotion from the E  salary

to  the  proposed  Superscale D salary,  but  also

carry the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



perquisite I have already mentioned of a  Mercedes

Benz  car  provided  as to  its  capital  cost  at

Government expense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, if need be, I am prepared to agree

that  the  fixed Specialist Allowance for  doctors

should  be increased beyond the present  limit  of

$750   up   to  $1,250  per  month  for  specified

individual outstanding officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, because of the great interest which has

been  generated,  it would seem  especially  among

doctors, it may be appropriate if I refer at  this

stage  to  the  scheme  for reduced  vacation  and

medical  leave  which  has  been  introduced  with

effect  from  1-1-73  for all Government  Officers

other than those in the teaching service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil servants under the previous leave scheme

were  eligible for the following rates of vacation

leave:-

<br><br>Because of the generous leave scheme, coupled with

the general shortage of staff over the years, many

officers  had  not been able to  take  their  full

leave,   and   as   a  result,  have   accumulated

considerable leave to their credit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to vacation leave, civil servants

under  the previous regulations were eligible  for

sick  leave  on  full pay up to 90 days  per  year

whether they are hospitalised or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the leave usually allowed by the

private  sector, leave eligibility for all  public

officers,  regardless  of divisional  status,  has

been revised as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than 10 years' service - 14 working days a

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 years' service or more - 21 working days a

year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



All   provisions  for  deferred  leave  would   be

abolished.  However, accumulation of leave  up  to

one  year's  eligibility  may  be  allowed  to  be

carried forward to the following year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical leave on full pay has been revised to 30

days  per  year if no hospitalisation is necessary

but  may be extended to 60 days if hospitalisation

is  recommended  by the medical authorities.  This

revised   leave  scheme  has  been   accepted   in

principle  by  the  staff unions representing  the

public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To compensate for the reduction in vacation and

medical   leave,   the  difference   between   the

employee's previous and new leave eligibility will

be  commuted  into  pay. The mode  and  the  exact

formula   of  such  compensation  is   now   under

examination with the staff unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should, however, be pointed out that all

serving  officers  on the permanent  establishment

have  an  option to either accept  the  new  leave

scheme  with  compensatory payment or  retain  the

previous leave scheme. Furthermore, this principle

of  option  will also be extended to new  recruits

into the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those officers who consider the reduced

vacation leave insufficient, I should like to  add

that  in future, no-pay leave to make up leave  to

their previous leave eligibility will be liberally

granted.  Officers  who feel the  need  for  extra

leave  will therefore be able to use the  monetary

compensation paid in lieu of leave to  offset  the

loss of pay during such leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to inform members that

apart  from  these salary revisions the Government

will  adopt the agreed general guidelines  of  the

National Wages Council for salary increases  every

year.   For  administrative  convenience,  it   is

Government's  intention to pay these increases  in

the  form of supplementary allowances at the  rate

recommended by the National Wages Council. At  the

end  of  every  four to five years the  Government

will  undertake  a full scale revision  of  salary

scales,   consolidating  in   the   process   such

supplementary allowances into the basic salaries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a revision of salary scales after four to

five  years will enable Government to review wages

and   salaries  in  the  public  sector  and  make

adjustments to keep broadly in parity with private

sector wages and salaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, our promising young officers can be

certain  when  electing for a  Government  career,

that in the medium and longer run, they will never

lose  out  to their contemporaries in the  private

sector. Competent and effective administration can

be assured only if the civil service maintains its

quality and integrity, with an able leadership  at

the  top  of the administrative pyramid, supported

by  a constant intake of young officers of promise

and  some of the ablest of whom will stay and grow

in  the  service in the full knowledge that  their

climb  to  the  top  will be more  satisfying  and

equally  rewarding as if they had  opted  for  the

private sector.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for

Finance   two  questions  regarding   the   salary

increases for senior officers. In this Chinese New

Year   season,  this  is  good  news.  These   are

substantial   increases   for   senior   officers,

particularly  the Superscale officers.  It  is  my

hope,  however,  that with these  increases  their

efficiency  will also increase for the  betterment

of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to ask the

Minister   whether  he  is  prepared  to  consider

raising the salaries of Divisions II, III  and  IV

employees,  or whether there will be any  kind  of

adjustment in their salaries so as to ensure  that

their  livelihood will be improved accordingly.  I

would also like to know how much expenditure  will

be   incurred  for  these  proposed  increases  in

salaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  I  put  my questions to the  Minister  for

Finance,  I would like to refer him to  one  point

that   he   has   mentioned  in  his   Ministerial

Statement. He has made reference to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



recent revision of the teachers' salaries, thereby

giving the impression that the teachers had a wage

increase  recently. I wish to correct  that  wrong

impression  because in the recent  revision  there

was   no   immediate  increase  in  salaries   for

teachers.  There  is  no  comparison  between  the

salary  revision for the teachers and this current

salary revision for the upper echelon of the civil

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is similar to that of the Member for

Sembawang, and that is, whether the Government  is

contemplating an immediate salary revision for the

other  echelons  of  the civil service.  With  the

booming   economy  and  an  accelerated  rate   of

industrial expansion, attractive job opportunities

are  thus  increased considerably with the  result

that there is a strong competition to attract both

the  brains as well as brawns not only within  the

private sector itself but also between the private

sector  and  the  public sector. This  problem  of

retaining  and attracting the best in  the  public

service is not only confined to the upper echelons

of  the public service but is also felt throughout

the other rungs of the public service hierarchy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is whether consideration will be

given  to  the need for a revision of salaries  of

the  other  echelons  of the  public  service  not

mentioned in today's Ministerial Statement, with a

view  to  ensuring an efficient  and  able  public

service  in  the best interests of  the  efficient

Government of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

booming  economy  and the affluence  that  we  are

experiencing  now,  we are faced  with  a  certain

degree   of  inflation  at  the  present   moment.

Therefore, I would suggest that rather than go  on

increasing  the workers' salary, the Minister  for

Finance should look into ways and means to  reduce

the cost of living.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I

should  like to make it clear that this particular

revision  of  salaries for the top  echelon  is  a

revision  which is intended to maintain the  rapid

rate  of growth of the Singapore economy.  I  have

suggested that these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



officers  are valuable not only to Government  but

to the private sector, and that there is some fear

that they may be lost to the private sector unless

the  salaries  of  these  top  administrative  and

professional  officers are raised sufficiently  to

be  regarded  as on a parity with  what  they  can

obtain  in  the private sector. The cost  of  this

particular  revision would be of the order  of  $4

million  a  year. I have not worked out the  exact

figures because some of the officers are Timescale

officers  and the merit allowances which might  be

given  under  this  scheme  cannot  obviously   be

anticipated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point whether I am proposing

to  review Divisions II, III and IV salary scales,

my  Statement  says  that we  have  been  doing  a

restructuring of salary scales for those  sectors.

The question of wage increases had not really been

considered  in  relation to the  restructuring  of

salary scales. I think that would be a matter  for

consideration  in relation to the  wage  increases

proposed by the National Wages Council which will,

as I have mentioned in my Statement, apply equally

to  all Government officers. I have stated that we

are  prepared  to  adopt the  recommendations  and

guidelines of the National Wages Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as cost of living is concerned, I have

made  it  quite  clear that this  revision  is  to

promote the very rapid rate of economic growth.  I

would  also  say that these are minimal  increases

costing  about $4 million a year, which  will  not

affect our cost of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the purpose of this Bill to make the

necessary   amendments  to   Part   IVA   of   the

Constitution  of  Singapore so as  to  enable  the

Presidential  Council hereafter  to  be  concerned

only with minority rights and not with fundamental

liberties.  The  Council will accordingly  be  re-styled  the  "Presidential  Council  for  Minority

Rights".  Although Part IVA as a  whole  has  been

repealed   and  re-enacted  to  make  for   easier

reading,  it  is  substantially the  same  as  the

existing Part IVA except for the changes  which  I

shall now mention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 81J under clause 2 of the Bill now reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It shall be the particular function of the

Council  to draw attention to any Bill or  to  any

subsidiary  legislation if that Bill or subsidiary

legislation  is in the opinion of  the  Council  a

differentiating measure.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



This Article differs from the present Article  8li

in  that the words "or otherwise inconsistent with

the  fundamental liberties of the subject" at  the

end of that Article have been omitted. This phrase

has,  in  fact, been deleted throughout Part  JVA,

while   at   Article   81A   the   definition   of

"inconsistent  with the fundamental  liberties  of

the  subject" has also been excised. The  omission

of  this  phrase  from  the Bill  means  that  the

Presidential Council for Minority Rights  will  be

concerned   only   with   drawing   attention   to

"differentiating  measures"  in  any  legislation,

principal  or subsidiary, that is, measures  which

are  disadvantageous to persons of any  racial  or

religious   community.  Upon   the   coming   into

operation  of the Act, therefore, it will  not  be

part  of the Council's functions to draw attention

to  inconsistencies with the fundamental liberties

of  the  subject  as set out in  Part  II  of  the

Constitution   of   Malaysia  which   applies   to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments are being made as the

Presidential  Council itself  over  the  last  two

years  has  indicated that it wishes its principal

function to be the examination of legislation with

a  view  to  ascertaining whether  any  provisions

therein  may be discriminatory against  racial  or

religious communities. In the annual report of the

Presidential Council for the twelve months  ending

on   30th  April,  1971,  the  Council  urges   at

paragraph 9 thereof, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the light of the topics that have been raised

by  members and discussed during our meetings,  we

are  of  the view that the Council can best  serve

the   multi-racial  multi-religious   peoples   of

Singapore  if  the Council is required  under  the

Constitution to devote its principal attention  to

considering   whether   or   not   any    proposed

legislation, including subsidiary legislation,  in

its  opinion  "is, or is likely in  its  practical

application to be, disadvantageous to  persons  of

any  racial or religious community and not equally

disadvantageous   to   persons   of   other   such

communities,   either  directly   by   prejudicing

persons of that community or indirectly by  giving

advantage  to  persons of another  community".  In

other  words, [the report continues] we  recommend

that  this Council's principal function should  be

to examine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



legislation with a view to "preventing" Parliament

inadvertently  passing  laws  which   discriminate

against   racial   or  religious   minorities   in

Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in the Presidential Council's annual

report  for  the  following  year,  1971-72,   the

Council, after stating that it had in its previous

annual  report suggested the modification  of  its

functions,  which  I  have just  quoted,  observed

that, in the absence of any statutory amendment to

the Council's functions, the Council continued  to

exercise the functions originally entrusted to  it

under the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will therefore he seen, Sir, that it is in

accordance  with  the wishes of  the  Presidential

Council  itself  that these amendments  are  being

made today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr E. W. Barker].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In page 3, line 15, after "(c)" to insert

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In page 9, line 6, to leave out "ten" and

insert "eight".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first and second amendments relate to

the  composition of the Presidential  Council  for

Minority  Rights  which, as in  the  case  of  the

present Presidential Council, consists of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



Chairman, 10 permanent members appointed for  life

and  10  other members appointed for a  period  of

three  years. However, the quota for the permanent

and the temporary members has never been filled in

full.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the permanent members, as was

pointed  out by the then President in a speech  at

the time of the presentation of the instrument  of

appointment  on the 2nd of May, 1970,  it  is  the

intention of Government to leave at least three of

the  permanent seats vacant so that any  successor

government   can  include  some  of   the   senior

Ministers  in the Council. At the present  moment,

there  are only five permanent members, one having

resigned,  and eight temporary members. It  would,

therefore,  be more appropriate for the expression

"not  more than" to be inserted at paragraphs  (b)

and  (c)  of  Article 81(B).-(1),  so  that  these

provisions now read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) not more than ten permanent members appointed

for life; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the third amendment of Article

81(P).-(1)  whereby  it is  sought  to  lower  the

quorum  of the Council from ten to eight  members,

the Council is of the opinion that eight would  he

a more realistic figure, having regard to the fact

that the full membership of 21 has not been filled

and  is not likely to be completely filled in  the

near  future. And there being at present  only  14

members including the Chairman, it would therefore

be  proper  to accede to the Council's  wishes  in

this regard.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, section 47 of the Trade Unions Act currently

limits the land which a registered trade union may

purchase  or  take  upon  lease  to  an  area  not

exceeding  one  acre  in  extent.  This  piece  of

legislation was made about 32 years ago. There are

at present 28 trade unions comprising 16 unions of

employers  and  12 unions of employees  which  own

office   buildings  on  land  either   leased   or

purchased by them. None of the land area  held  by

them exceeds one acre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with enlarged membership and growing

affluence,  it is anticipated that more  and  more

trade  unions  will be able to purchase  or  lease

land  to  build  their own offices. Moreover,  the

larger  trade unions may wish to purchase land  to

build their branch offices as well. At the moment,

they  are  prevented by law from doing so  if  the

aggregate area of land to he owned by them exceeds

one acre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, unless section 47 of the Trade Unions Act

is  amended as proposed, the trade unions will  he

restricted  in their efforts to build  offices  or

branch offices for their members. Such restriction

could retard the healthy growth and development of

the  trade union movement in Singapore, especially

from  the  administrative and financial  point  of

view. It is, therefore, necessary to introduce the

Bill now before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend section 47 of the Trade

Unions  Act with a view to empowering the Minister

to  approve in any particular case the purchase or

taking  upon lease by a trade union of  land  that

exceeds one acre in extent.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill he now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main object or this Bill is to provide for a

motor  insurance policy to cover the  full  period

for  which  a licence (road tax) is granted  to  a

vehicle. At present a vehicle owner needs only  to

possess a valid insurance policy on the date  when

the  licence comes into operation. This can result

in   the  insurance  policy  expiring  before  the

vehicle   licence,  giving  rise  to  a  situation

whereby  a  vehicle  though properly  licensed  is

without  a  valid  insurance cover.  This  can  go

undetected during the period of the licence unless

the  vehicle is involved in an accident.  The  new

requirement  would therefore remove  the  existing

anomaly  in  respect  of the insurance  cover  for

motor vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another object of the Bill is to give the

Registrar of Vehicles additional powers to  cancel

the  registration of motor vehicles whose licences

have  not been renewed for more than three  years,

or   when   the  vehicles  have  been   destroyed,

permanently  exported,  or  have  become   totally

unfit,  or  have exceeded the age limit prescribed

for  that  class  or description of  vehicle.  The

present Act has no provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



empowering  the ROV to de-register vehicles  whose

owners  have failed to renew the licences  over  a

long  period of time. As a result there  are  many

"dead"  vehicles  on  the register.  The  proposed

amendment  will  minimise  the  number  of  "dead"

vehicles that are maintained on the register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to increase the late

payment fees for renewals made after expiry of the

vehicle  licence  (road tax). At  present  a  late

payment  notice  fee of 50 cents  is  charged  for

renewals  made  after 10 days  of  expiry  of  the

licence.  A  further fee of $5, known  as  warrant

fee, is levied for renewals made after 20 days  of

expiry  of the vehicle licence. This is  far  from

satisfactory and has not been effective in getting

vehicle  owners to renew their licences  promptly.

In  conjunction with the new scale of road  taxes,

it  is proposed to raise the late payment fee. The

new  rate  for late payment fees would  take  into

account  the  graduated scale of  road  taxes  and

would range from 510 to $50 depending on the class

and description of vehicles. For private vehicles,

the  rate of late payment fees would be determined

by  the  engine capacity. These late payment  fees

would he levied for renewals made after 14 days to

a  month of expiry of licence. Renewals made after

one  month of expiry of licence may be compounded,

provided  the  late  payment  fees  are  paid   in

addition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new

category  of  public service buses  to  be  called

Private  Hire  Buses.  This  is  to  augment   the

existing public transport service to help meet the

demands  of office and factory workers, especially

those  on night shifts. Such buses will be allowed

to be hired out on charter or on contract.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

remember  that during the last Parliament  sitting

the plight of some road accident victims who were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



not  able to recover compensation, because of  the

absence  of insurance or defective insurance,  was

brought  to  the  attention of the  House  by  the

Member  for  Tiong Bahru. I must  say,  therefore,

that the proposed amendment Bill is welcomed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am just wondering whether the Minister

considers  it  time now to go a  step  further  by

setting up a central fund contributed by all motor

insurers,  so that any claims not paid because  of

technical reasons can be covered by that fund.  It

will not cost the Government anything, because the

insurers will have to cough out the money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Arms and Explosives

Act  (Chapter  238  of  the  Revised  Edition)  to

empower the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



licensing  authority  to  forfeit  any   arms   or

explosives  deposited with him in accordance  with

the  provisions  of  the Act  or  any  rules  made

thereunder or any other written law for  the  time

being   in  force,  if  such  deposited  arms   or

explosives are not claimed by its owner or  owners

within six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following arms are deposited with the Arms

and  Explosives  Branch of  the  Singapore  Police

Force:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Arms belonging to the person whose

possession  of such arms becomes  unlawful  in

consequence of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) expiry of his licence;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) suspension of his licence;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) cancellation of his licence;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Arms belonging to transit passengers which

are   handed  over  to  the  police  for  safe

custody; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Arms brought into Singapore and waiting for

licences to possess.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no difficulty in dealing with arms

falling under category (a) aforementioned, as  the

law  on this is clear. Any arms deposited with the

police in consequence of the expiry, suspension or

cancellation  of  licences become  forfeit  if  no

licence  to  possess is taken within  six  months.

Arms   falling  under  categories  (b)   and   (c)

aforementioned,  however,  pose  a  problem,   for

currently there is no provision in any written law

for  the  disposal of arms not claimed by  transit

passengers  or for which a licence to  possess  in

Singapore   is  not  approved.  Such   arms   have

accumulated  in  the  armoury  of  the  Arms   and

Explosives  Branch of the Singapore  Police  Force

over  the years and are occupying valuable storage

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a consolidation of the Dangerous

Drugs   Act   enacted  in  1951  and   the   Drugs

(Prevention  of  Misuse)  Act  of  1969.  It  also

incorporates additional provisions to provide  for

a  firm and extensive control on certain dangerous

and  harmful drugs of addiction as well as heavier

penalties.  These  drugs, defined  as  "controlled

drugs"   in   this   Bill,  are   known   to   the

pharmacologist    as    hallucinogens,    narcotic

analgesics, central nervous system stimulants  and

tranquillisers.  The  Dangerous  Drugs   Act   was

enacted  about  21  years  ago  and  the  controls

provided therein are grossly inadequate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



for  the 70's, with the introduction of a host  of

new drugs of medical value if properly used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control has been brought in line with those in

force  in  other countries closely concerned  with

the  spread  of  the addictive use of  such  drugs

within  their  own  countries  and  the  increased

international traffic which supplies such demands.

The different categories of control as recommended

by  the United Nations have been incorporated into

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will provide adequate powers for law

enforcement  officers in the Customs,  Police  and

narcotics officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau

to  exercise  close vigilance on all movements  of

controlled  drugs and to seek out the  addicts  to

such drugs. The Central Narcotics Bureau, under  a

Director, has been recently created to enforce the

provisions  of the Bill especially  in  regard  to

illicit use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, by its geographical position and

development,   is  now  a  strategic   centre   of

communication  and  international  trade.   Whilst

welcoming trade, visitors and tourists, we must at

the  same time be constantly on the alert for  the

trafficker,  the addict and the hidden consignment

of controlled drugs. Law enforcement officers must

be  adequately empowered to stop, search any ship,

aircraft,  train  or vehicles whenever  there  are

reasonable  grounds  to  suspect  that  controlled

drugs  are  hidden and, if found,  to  seize  such

drugs and to detain any person found therein. Such

vehicle  will  he liable to seizure under  certain

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ill-gotten gains of the drug traffic are

huge.  The key men operating behind the scene  are

ruthless and cunning and possess ample funds. They

do  their  utmost  to  push their  drugs  through.

Though  we may not have drug-trafficking and  drug

addiction to the same degree as, for instance,  in

the  United  States, we have here some quite  big-time  traffickers and their pedlars moving  around

the Republic selling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



their  evil goods and corrupting the lives of  all

those who succumb to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They and their trade must be stopped. To do this

effectively, heavy penalties have to  be  provided

for   trafficking.   Clause   15   specifies   the

quantities of controlled drugs which, it found  in

the possession of a person unless the contrary  is

proved,  will be presumed to be in his  possession

for the purposes of trafficking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Schedule to the Bill shows the various

penalties  for offences committed under the  Bill.

For  unauthorised traffic in a Class A  controlled

drug,  for  example, morphine, opium, heroin,  the

maximum  sentence is 20 years or $40,000 or  both,

and ten strokes of the rotan. The heaviest penalty

will  apply  to  those convicted  of  unauthorised

trafficking  in  a  Class  A  controlled  drug  to

persons  under  the  age of  18  years.  For  this

offence  a maximum penalty of 30 years or $50,000

or  both,  and  15  strokes of the  rotan,  and  a

minimum penalty of five years or $10,000 or  both,

and three strokes of the rotan have been provided.

The  existing law on dangerous drugs provides  for

the  offence  of  trafficking,  but  there  is  no

distinction  as regards the age of the  person  to

whom  the  drugs are sold. The penalties  for  the

offence  of  trafficking in the existing  law  are

$10,000  or  five years, or both. These  penalties

are obviously totally inadequate as deterrents,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government views the present situation with deep

concern.  To  act as an effective  deterrent,  the

punishment provided for an offence of this  nature

must  be  decidedly  heavy.  We  have,  therefore,

expressly provided minimum penalties and the rotan

for  trafficking. However, we have not gone as far

as  some  countries which impose the death penalty

for drug trafficking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug addiction is a problem increasing in size

daily.  What was once smoking opium and  marijuana

(the  dried plant which is known locally as ganja)

or  the  consumption  of  opium  pills  amongst  a

comparatively   small  group  of  middle-aged   or

elderly people has developed into the taking of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



methaqualone (known popularly as MX pills) or  the

smoking of marijuana amongst the younger age group

in  their teens or early 20's who can be found not

only in the street or coffee-shop but also in  the

school and the university.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young person falls under the influence of

such a drug in a variety of ways. It might be  the

result of boredom, sense of adventure to know  how

it  feels by taking it or he might be inducted  to

it  before being accepted as one of the circle  of

so-called  "friends". The danger is that  when  he

finds that the effects of such a drug are not  too

upsetting  but  rather pleasant in  the  transient

light-headed  feeling it induces, he continues  to

take it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, he so very easily progresses to more

potent  drugs that will give him that same feeling

of  euphoria  after failing to get it  with  those

drugs  which  he  first used, even  in  increasing

quantities.  Once he becomes "hooked"  On  a  hard

drug,  e.g, morphine  or  heroin,  his  path   to

ruination and disaster is certain. He will not  be

able  to  stop taking such a drug as the  physical

and mental symptoms known as "withdrawal symptoms"

following  will be unbearable. It  is  known  that

once  a  person is hooked to a hard drug, he  will

lie,  cheat, steal or even kill just  to  get  the

drugs.  Thus,  a  drug  trafficker  is  the   most

abominable  of  human beings if he can  be  deemed

"human". He is a merchant of "living death"  which

he  brings to a fellow human being. He, therefore,

deserves the maximum punishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will, however, note that it

is  not  all punishment written into this Bill.  A

clear  distinction has been made between the  drug

addict  and the trafficker and pedlar. I am moving

an  amendment at the Committee Stage to remove the

provision of a minimum sentence of two years for a

second  or  subsequent offence for smoking,  self-administering  or consuming a controlled  drug  as

provided  in  the Second Schedule  to  clause  29,

which  was  inserted as a result of an  oversight.

For  those  addicts who wish to stop this  vicious

habit,  there are provisions under clause  33  (3)

for them to volunteer for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



treatment   at   an   approved  institution.   Any

statement  given  for  the purpose  of  undergoing

treatment  will  not  be  admissible  as  evidence

against him in any subsequent prosecution.  Anyone

who  has  been  addicted to any of the  controlled

drugs  and  especially those who  have  had  their

first  acquaintance  with such  a  drug  can  take

advantage  of  this  provision  to  have   himself

rehabilitated. Powers have also been provided  for

the  Director,  Central  Narcotics  Bureau,  under

clause  33,  to require any person,  whom  he  has

reasonable grounds to suspect to he an addict,  to

be   medically  examined  and,  it  necessary,  to

undergo treatment at an approved institution.  All

outpatient clinics and centres have been organised

to  provide  for  treatment  of  drug  addicts.  A

referral clinic has been established at the Outram

Road  Hospital.  A  second  one  is  planned   for

Alexandra  Hospital.  A  special  ward   for   the

hospital care of addicts will be opened within the

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the drug trafficker there is also another

danger,  though on a lesser scale,  that  is,  the

tourist   drug  addict,  particularly  among   the

hippies. To seek out such drug addicts amongst the

huge  and  increasing number of tourists  entering

Singapore, powers have been provided in clause  28

of  the Bill for an immigration officer, where  he

has reasonable grounds to suspect any person to be

a drug addict, to request that person to provide a

specimen  of  urine  for  testing.  Entry  of  any

person,  other  than  a  Singapore  citizen  or  a

permanent resident here, will be prohibited if  he

refuses  to submit to such a test or if  the  test

shows  the  presence of a controlled drug.  It  is

Government's  firm intention to exclude  entry  of

such   tourist  addicts  for  their   habits   are

imitative  and the youth of our Republic  must  be

protected from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Schedule also lists the penalties

provided  for other offences under this Bill.  For

instance,  any  person being  the  owner,  tenant,

occupier  or person in charge of any premises  who

permits  the use of such premises for the purposes

of  smoking,  administering or  consumption  of  a

Class A or B



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



drug   will,  if  found  guilty,  be   liable   to

imprisonment  of up to ten years  or  a  fine  not

exceeding $40,000 or both the minimum penalty  for

this  offence is two years or $4,000 or both.  The

current penalty is three years or $10,000 or both.

Unauthorised possession on conviction will draw  a

maximum sentence of ten years or $20,000 or  both,

with   a  minimum  punishment  for  a  second   or

subsequent offence of two years or $3,000 or both.

The current penalty for possession of raw opium is

five years or $10,000 or both, and for a dangerous

drug  prepared  for medical use,  three  years  or

$10,000 or both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A District or Magistrate's Court is empowered to

hear and determine all proceedings under this Bill

and to impose the full penalties provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 provides for the making of regulations

especially  for  the trade and use  of  controlled

drugs  for  licit  purposes. Certain  professional

persons-doctors, dentists, pharmacists, veterinary

surgeons and others - who use or handle such drugs

in  the  course of their professions or businesses

will  be  authorised to possess controlled  drugs,

and  in certain cases, where applicable, to supply

such  controlled drugs. Doctors and dentists  will

be  required  to  report any person  suspected  of

being  a  drug  addict. The new  regulations  will

provide  for the keeping of more detailed  records

of  import,  sale,  supply and use  of  controlled

drugs  so  as to provide better means of  checking

the   movement  of  controlled  drugs  within  the

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Association of Social Workers have

submitted  a memorandum on the Bill. In  it,  they

have recommended that clause 27 (c) of the Bill be

amended  so  that professional social  workers  be

exempted  from  the  law  of  having  to   divulge

confidential information gained from drug  addicts

in  the course of their work in rehabilitating the

addict.  This suggestion cannot be accepted  since

even  doctors  are not exempt from revealing  such

confidences  if  this is required by  the  Courts.

However, clause 32 gives protection to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



persons  acting under authority from any civil  or

criminal  liability. This should be  adequate  for

the  protection of the social worker who  acts  in

good faith.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have also suggested the listing of approved

institutions     to    include    non-governmental

institutions for the treatment of drug addicts. It

is  not necessary to do this in the main Act. This

can be done under regulations to be made under the

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have also suggested the setting up of an

advisory  panel of persons to determine  the  drug

pushers from the drug addicts. This recommendation

has  been  made  on  the  assumption  that  it  is

difficult  to differentiate between the two.  Such

arm  assumption  is, of course, not  correct.  The

Central   Narcotics  Bureau,  together  with   the

doctors involved in the rehabilitation of addicts,

will  certainly  know how to make the  distinction

and act accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have also suggested that the Bill be

referred  to a Select Committee to consider  their

aforementioned proposals. In view of what  I  have

stated    in    reply    to   the    Association's

recommendations,  reference to a Select  Committee

is clearly unnecessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to state quite categorically here

that  whatever  heavy  penalties  that  are  being

provided in this Bill, they by themselves are  not

sufficient to solve the drug problem in Singapore.

We   shall  require  all  the  co-operation   from

parents, teachers, doctors, social workers and, in

fact,  the  whole public if we are to successfully

meet  that  problem. It is going to be  an  uphill

task all the way. Of course, highly deterrent laws

against drug traffickers will help us tremendously

in   our   fight  against  drug  trafficking   and

addiction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to  say

a  few words in support of this Bill, particularly

on the problem of drug abuse which this Bill seeks

to resolve.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time now the mass media have

periodically focused attention on the problems  of

drug  abuse and have thereby aroused in the public

an awareness of its dangers. Be that as it may,  I

am  not convinced that this awareness alone is  an

adequate defence against drug abuse. Hence, it  is

my  view  that  the  enhanced  punishment  in  the

penalty clauses of this Bill is beneficial to  our

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am prepared to grant that the enlightened

parent in control of the family is a deterrent  to

drug abuse. The question which then arises is just

how many parents are sufficiently enlightened and,

more   significant  still,  how  many   of   these

enlightened parents have control of their children

who  are  prone to the attractions  of  drugs  and

their abuses?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public knowledge of the dangers of drug abuse is

an  important  step in the effort to construct  an

effective  social defence against drug abuse.  The

public  should  be  given  ample  opportunity   to

acquire  this knowledge through the mass media.  I

do  not  think we need worry about over-acting  to

the  fears of drug abuse. If we are not  alert  we

may suddenly find the disease firmly rooted in our

society.  By  that  time  we  would  he  extremely

knowledgeable  about drugs  for  we  would  be  in

direct  touch with the ghastly realities  of  drug

addiction of all kinds. To know of the dangers  of

drug  abuse  when the decrepit human  remnants  of

drug addiction surface onto our streets is to know

of  the  dangers too late. I say that the time  to

worry is now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tri-Border Area of Thailand, Burma and Laos,

sometimes  known  as  the `Golden  Triangle",  has

probably  become  the main source  of  heroin  and

other  opiates,  after Turkey  decided  to  outlaw

opium production in its highlands. This change has

brought  the  world's principal  narcotics  source

close  to us. Meanwhile, the Vietnam conflict  has

had  the  effect  of dramatically  increasing  the

demand for narcotics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August, 1971, a sub-committee on Public Health

and Environment of the House of Representatives in

the U.S.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



conducted  investigations into the production  and

abuse  of opiates in the Far East. Members of  the

sub-committee  visited  Thailand,  South  Vietnam,

Hongkong  and  Japan.  In that  report,  the  sub-committee  estimated that the amount of opium  and

its derivatives that would be produced for 1971 in

the  Tri-Border  Area would be as  high  as  1,000

tons.  The large bulk of heroin and opiates, which

leave  Mae  Sai  in  the Thai-Burma  border,  pass

through  Bangkok  to Hongkong and  then  to  South

Vietnam, Okinawa, the U.S, and other countries. It

seems to me that with the cessation of the Vietnam

conflict and the withdrawal of foreign forces from

Indo-China, a large quantity of surplus  narcotics

in  South-east Asia would be seeking new  markets.

We  join  other quarters in hoping that  the  Thai

Authorities will record greater success  in  their

effort  to  contain  opium  production  with   the

support of the U.N, programme of crop substitution

among the tribesmen in the highlands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there is no indication that heroin is

presently a much used drug in the country, let  us

not  beguile  ourselves with the notion  that  our

society is safe from it. In our society today, the

industries  are  manned  by  new  generations   of

youthful workers in whom we hope the work ethic of

their     fathers    and    forefathers    remains

unadulterated. This work ethic has  accounted  for

our  national  growth hitherto, and  we  naturally

hope  that our young will retain it to stand  them

in  good  stead  in  the  future.  However,  young

generations tend to colour the moral, cultural and

social values of their times with their own  sense

of  worth  and  their  own  understanding  of  the

rational.  Sometimes they even abandon established

values altogether.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two facts may be stressed. First, youth

predominate in our society. Secondly, our  society

is very much exposed to foreign values which, more

often  than not, are inconsonant with our own  way

of life. The degree and extent of erosion upon the

work  ethic  of our youthful national  work  force

will be determined by the degree and extent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



of  their response to these foreign values  which,

unfortunately,  reach  our  youth  in   a   highly

attractive and heavily publicised fashion in which

drugs  feature as the sole instrument of communion

with narcotic bliss.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With affluence spreading through the social

fabric,   work   as   an  ethic   may   lose   its

meaningfulness   as   opportunity   for    leisure

increases   and  the  quest  for  excitement   and

euphoria   becomes   more  deliberate.   In   this

situation,  drug offers an irresistible invitation

to  such  excitement and euphoria.  And  to  those

seeking  a momentary escape from the stresses  and

strains  of  a successful industrial society,  the

narcotics   dimension  offers  much   solace   and

recuperation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When narcotics, other opium derivatives,

amphetamines and barbiturates become plentiful  in

a  country, there will manifest the inclination to

experiment  with drugs. In 1972,  for  the  period

January-March,  the  quantity  of  various   drugs

seized by the Customs and Central Narcotics Bureau

are as follows:-

<pre>

  Ganja a total of about 68 kg.



  Morphine a total of about 29 kg.



  Heroin a total of less than 1 kg.



  Opium a total of about 615 kg.



  Hashish  a  total of about 1 kg, and

      24,650 MX tablets.

</pre>



<br><br>What  quantity has passed undetected  is  left  to

inference.  The  larger quantity  of  drugs  being

detected may be due to the efficiency of  the  CNB

and/or  it may simply be the fact that more  drugs

are  flowing into the country. Whatever the  case,

it  is  time  for us to sit up and appreciate  the

potential gravity of the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drug commonly abused by some sections of our

youth  is ganja. They do not regard this  drug  as

harmful   and   sometimes  equate  it   with   the

permissible  intoxicates,  such  as   brandy   and

whisky.  `This, I think, is due to the  fact  that

the dangers of ganja abuse is not common knowledge

among  our  youth, which should not be  the  case.

There is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



sufficient  material by the experts  which  assert

that  ganja or marijuana is an "initiation  drug."

While it does not develop in the person a physical

dependence    on   the   drug,    it    does    so

psychologically.  It initiates the  consumer  into

the  narcotics experience and to a life  of  warp,

irrelevant,  wasteful and anti-social  values.  He

may   not  he  drug-dependent;  but  he  is  drug-oriented.  Whether he subsequently degenerates  to

addiction  to hard drugs will, I think, depend  on

whether  there  is  in him a moral,  cultural  and

social ballast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which brings me to what I believe is the second

requisite  to an effective social defence  against

drug abuse, that is, parental control of children.

By  control,  I  mean  that kind  of  relationship

between  parents  and their children  which  stems

from  an  enlightened authority that is vested  in

the  parents  through common love and respect,  on

which  authority members of the family depend  and

to  which  they respond. It is authority which  is

the  result  of close and concerned management  of

sons   and   daughters   through   childhood   and

adolescence undertaken within the cohesion of  the

family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In present times a number of social trends and

actions    militate   against   family   cohesion.

Pressured  by  the  demands of daily  living,  the

family  is  in  a  state of constant  motion.  The

motion  is  centrifugal in relation to  the  home,

tearing  members of the family away from the  home

and each other disintegrating the family unit.  If

this,  development  is not checked  somewhat,  our

society  is  going to be that much  weakened;  for

moral,  cultural and social values can only inhere

in  members of the family which live in harmonious

and  intelligent cohesion. I believe that, in  the

last  analysis,  the  moral, cultural  and  social

ballast   in   the  individuals  of  our   society

constitute  in  its  totality our  most  effective

social defence against drug abuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I have on a number of

occasions urged parents to retain or recover  this

family  cohesion by insisting upon all members  of

the family to daily-gather around for dinner



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



This  will, at least in my view, ensure that  once

in  every  day, the family will assemble  and  the

unit  becomes  intact. This  moment  will  provide

opportunity  for communication, understanding  and

inspiration,   all  of  which  make   for   family

cohesion.  The family that eats together,  I  say,

stays together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the law is finding it necessary to

severely  punish with imprisonment up to 10  years

persons who consume or have in their possession  a

controlled  drug may be regarded as an  indictment

against   parents.   If  this  realisation   jolts

complacent  parents  to a more responsible  action

and  supervision of their children's affairs, this

Bill will succeed in launching a drug alert in our

country, and in co-operation with the law we  will

effectively combat drug abuse in our society.



<br><br>4.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I support this Bill. The introduction of this

Bill, I believe, will be supported by people  from

all  walks of life. It cannot be denied  that  our

society  is  facing the problem of drug addiction.

There is a small number of people who indulges  in

this  drug  abuse.  These  drug  addicts  live  an

unrealistic life and do not engage in any form  of

production.  They  day-dream  all  day  long,  and

become   useless.  This  will   not   only   incur

displeasure  and cause worry to their parents  but

will also pose a serious problem to our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for drug addiction are many and

varied.   Some  drug  addicts  have  been   easily

influenced by their social environment  and  their

friends.  Some  of  them have been  influenced  by

tourists from abroad, who have brought these drugs

with  them.  For example, some hippies  have  been

known  to  have done this. We must therefore  take

steps to prevent them from entering our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister emphasised just now that the

Government is taking a serious view of this matter

and   is   empowering  Immigration  officials   to

prohibit the entry of any person whom they suspect

to be drug traffickers. If hippies from abroad are

allowed to come in to spread



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



the use of drugs, it will have serious effects  on

our society or will cause serious repercussions in

our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to eliminate this problem, I think it

is  necessary  not only to introduce  the  various

measures as provided in this Bill but also to deal

with  it  in a two-fold manner. Firstly,  I  would

suggest to the Minister that every year we  should

hold an anti-drug campaign on a big scale, similar

to  what  he has done for the Ministry of  Health,

i.e, the Keep Singapore Clean campaign. This anti-drug  campaign should be conducted in the  various

constituencies in order to bring home the  lessons

of  the harm and ill-effects of drugs. In this way

parents will be more aware of the dangers and they

will   be  able  to  face  the  problem  properly.

Secondly,  I  would  like  to  suggest  that   the

Minister should pay special attention to the youth

in  our  country. The Ministry of Health  and  the

relevant  departments,  for  example,  the  Police

Force,  should  establish more contacts  with  the

people in our society. Contacts between the Police

and  the  people on a wider scale  will  help  the

Police  to be "in the society", so that they  will

know  where  the drug addicts are  and  where  the

drugs  are to be found. This will help reduce  the

phenomenon of drug addiction. This, I think, is  a

better and a more positive measure of dealing with

the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are a young nation. Sixty

per  cent of our population are below the  age  of

21. We should therefore take special steps and pay

more  attention to the problems of  youth  in  our

society.  We  should protect them  from  all  evil

influences.  If  we  are  concerned   with   their

problems,  we  can  help them  to  become  a  more

rugged,  strong and firm generation, so that  they

can contribute towards our nation building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with

section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter  270),

approves the reclamation by Government of those

portions of the foreshore and seabed off Sungei

Sembawang   containing   a   total   area    of

approximately  4.71  acres  as  shown  coloured

yellow, red and green respectively on the  plan

marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 7/72",

which   is   deposited  in  the  Land   Office,

Singapore,  and  the dredging of  approximately

3.16  acres of the seabed off Sungei  Sembawang

shown coloured and hatched in blue on the  same

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Sembawang Shipyard (Private) Limited, a

corporation set up by Government to run the former

Naval  Dockyards at Sembawang as a  ship-repairing

centre,  is  presently  occupying  the  land   and

buildings within the area shown edged red  on  the

plan  marked  "LAND  OFFICE RECLAMATION  PLAN  NO.

7/72" (a copy of which is displayed in the Library

of   this  House  for  the  information  of   hon.

Members), on a 60-year lease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of its expansion scheme, the Shipyard

proposes  to  construct a new dry dock  at  Sungei

Sembawang parallel to the existing King George  VI

Dock at an estimated cost of $31.64 million to  be

completed  by the end of 1974. The floor  area  of

the  proposed  drydock will be about  6.15  acres,

comprising nearly three acres of the existing land

to  be  excavated (coloured blue on the plan)  and

another  3.16  acres of the seabed to  be  dredged

(coloured  and  hatched blue). The  foreshore  and

seabed   near  the  proposed  drydock,  i.e, the

portions shown coloured yellow (about 2.36 acres),

coloured  pink  (about 1.59  acres)  and  coloured

green  about 0.76 acre), will be reclaimed.  Earth

obtained  from  the excavation of the  area  shown

coloured blue on the plan will be used as fill for

the proposed reclamations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dredging and reclamation works will be

undertaken by the Sembawang Shipyard as  agent  of

the Government. On completion, the drydock and the

adjoining  reclaimed area will  be  proclaimed  as

State  land and alienated to the Shipyard on terms

and conditions to be agreed with the Land Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the total area of the foreshore and

seabed   to  be  reclaimed  is  only  4.71  acres,

approval  of  this House under section  4  of  the

Foreshores Act is necessary since the project also

involves  the dredging of some 3.16 acres  of  the

seabed.

the plan marked as "LAND OFFICE PLAN No. 1/73",  a

Corporation as agent of the Government, is now  in

progress.  On completion, the whole of Pulau  Ayer

Merlimau, comprising about 150 acres of  dry  land

(shown  edged  red on the plan) and the  reclaimed

area, will be alienated to the Corporation for  99

years  to enable the Corporation in turn  to  sub-lease   the  island  to  the  Singapore  Petroleum

Company  (Private) Limited for the development  of

an oil refinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation has now applied on behalf of the
