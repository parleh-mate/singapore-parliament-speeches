<div align="center"><b>FORTHCOMING OVERSEA VISIT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> If it

please  you,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I should  like  to

make a statement on my forthcoming visit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received an invitation from the

Government of Ceylon to visit Ceylon, and I  shall

be  their guest on the 2nd and 3rd of December.  I

have   also  received  an  invitation   from   the

Government  of  India, and with my  colleague  the

Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry  (Mr

J. M. Jumabhoy), will be their guests in Bombay on

the  5th, and we will be in New Delhi between  the

6th and the 9th of December. I am scheduled to  be

in London with the Minister for Labour and Welfare

(Mr  Lim  Yew  Hock) and the Minister  for  Local

Government,  Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul  Hamid

Bin  Haji Jumat) between the 9th and the  16th  of

December. Although the suggestion, Sir, originally

came from the Secretary of State that it would  be

helpful  if  we were to visit England towards  the

end  of  this year, there is no indication as  yet

that  we  will be the guests of the United Kingdom

during  our  seven-day stay in  London.  We  will,

however,  be the guests of the Prime Minister  and

the  Secretary of State at official functions.  On

our  return  journey we have been invited  by  the

Pakistan Government to be their guests, and it  is

probable  that  all  three Ministers  will  be  in

Karachi for one or two days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to indicate briefly the reasons for

these courtesy visits and the London visit. During

the  many functions that attended the Colombo Plan

conference,  Sir, here in Singapore,  I  became

conscious  of feelings of friendship for Singapore

and  strong sympathy for its political aspirations

from  many countries, both inside and outside  the

Commonwealth.  The  visits to  Ceylon,  India  and

Pakistan  are intended to strengthen this friendly

feeling  and  this sympathy. I would  add  that  I

expect  to learn a great deal from the leaders  of

these  countries  who  have arduously  blazed  the

trail  to independence, a trail which we  are  now

following. All Singapore, I am sure, is  proud  of

the  honour India, Pakistan and Ceylon do  us  in

extending these official invitations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the visit to London, I wish to reiterate that,

apart from seeking to obtain clarification of  the

British Government's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



attitude   to   the  Labour  Front's   citizenship

proposals, we shall seek officially only to fix  a

date  for a constitutional conference and to agree

on  an  agenda.  For the rest, Sir,  during  those

seven  days my colleagues and I will be addressing

a large number of gatherings. We will seek to make

England conscious of the fact that in this  lovely

island of ours there are more than 1,200,000 human

beings  with a human being's primordial  urge  and

moral right to be free from subjugation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other matter that I would like to

touch  on. The Government of Thailand has extended

an  invitation  to  us to visit  Thailand  on  our

return  journey.  It is our view  that  the  first

visit to a close trading neighbour should be of  a

fuller  character than would be possible  in  this

hurried  visit.  Many of us are conscious  of  the

impetus  of the goodwill mission to Indonesia  not

only  in  the realm of commerce but especially  in

the  realm of friendly relations which will be  an

important  factor in our future. I have  therefore

indicated to the Thai Government, Sir, that we are

grateful for the honour they do us, but are unable

to  accept  the  invitation at  present.  We  look

forward  with  pleasurable  anticipation  to   the

possibility  of an invitation for a  full  mission

from Singapore to visit Thailand in the new year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $18,240 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 1 (8), Senior Executive

Engineers, Grade G, on page 244 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, in the Remarks column it is

indicated "Increase one to include the appointment

of  Senior  Executive Engineer (Defence  Services)

now   abolished."  At  sub-head   1   (15),   this

particular appointment which is being abolished is

put   as   "Senior  Executive  Engineer   (Defence

Service), Grade G - Abolished."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard the Minister for Communications and

Works  yesterday  trying to impress  us  with  his

Ministry's  efficient pruning by the reduction  of

redundant  superscales. We want an explanation  of

why  it  is  found  necessary,  when  a  post   is

abolished,  to  create a new  one  to  absorb  the

person whose post has been abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir,

during  the last few days we have listened to  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar speaking on motions  to

remove new posts from the Estimates. These motions

have  covered a wide field - in fact, all the posts

which an expatriate might conceivably be appointed

to,  or  required for, or promoted to. The  reason

generally given for the motion was that  the  post

was  unnecessary  and that it should  be  removed.

Latterly, however, he came out into the  open  and

suggested that the posts were deliberately created

for  the benefit of the expatriates now envisaging

abolition  and  that  the elected  Ministers  had,

shall  we  say, been hoodwinked into  agreeing  to

their  inclusion. I had intended  to  answer  that

suggestion yesterday, Sir, but I thought perhaps I

might speak in heat and it would be better that  I

deferred  the matter until today. That suggestion,

Sir,  is a base and dishonourable suggestion which

can only stem from ignoble and dishonest minds. It

impugns  the intelligence of the elected Ministers

and  the  integrity  of the  civil  service,  both

expatriate and locally domiciled, which  over  the

past 80 years, by its unswerving devotion to duty,

its  conscientiousness, its  incorruptibility  and

its sense of justice and fair play, has built up a

reputation  second to none. The suggestion  is  so

ridiculous that no one will believe it, apart from

a handful of unhappy bigots who conceived it and a

measure   of   whose  judgment  and  ability   the

suggestion is. Even the hon. mover of the  motion,

being  a  man  of great intellectual  ability  and

integrity,  knows in his heart that it  is  false,

absolutely false.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if I explain the procedure in dealing

with  applications for new posts, it will put  the

suggestion in its true perspective. Proposals  for

new posts must be in the hands of the Treasury  by

the 15th of April. The great majority are received

in February and March. The proposals put up by the

heads  of  departments are considered  with  great

care  in the Treasury. Many factors, such  as  the

planned  expansion  of a department  to  meet  the

growing  needs  of the public, the  duties  to  be

performed,   the  qualifications  and   experience

required,   the  responsibilities  to  be   borne,

staffing requirements generally - all these matters

are considered in the Treasury. Other branches  of

Government are consulted. The head of a department

himself  is called up to amplify and explain  his

proposals.  In  the  end  all  the  proposals  are

considered against the background of the financial

position  of  the  Colony,  and  only  those   are

approved  for  entry in the Draft Estimates  which

are  absolutely imperative for the successful  and

efficient  conduct of the business of  government.

In  this  connection over the years, the  Treasury

has  built up perhaps an unenviable reputation for

being difficult in respect of new appointments.  I

should  also like to make it quite clear  that  in

deciding whether an appointment should be  entered

or  not,  the  only criterion - I repeat,  the  only

criterion - is  need,  the need of  Government,  the

need of the public. The question whom the post  is

to be filled by is completely irrelevant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all the posts entered this year have

satisfied this criterion and need. They have  been

proposed   by   officers  of  long  administrative

experience  who  have  only  the  efficiency   and

successful operation of their departments in mind,

men  who, as a result of that experience, can look

ahead  and see the needs of the future. They  have

been  vetted by a succession of officers  of  wide

administrative  and  financial  experience,  whose

duty  it  is - and  they have never failed  in  that

duty - to  eliminate  any  proposal  which  is   not

justified.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has now happened, Sir, is that the judgment

of  these acknowledged experts has been challenged

and  called in question by a small band  of  civil

servants who, to the best of my knowledge, are not

qualified  to  say  whether  posts  in,  say,  the

Medical  Department, or the Audit  Department,  or

the Accountant-General's Department, are necessary

or   not  in  the  public  interests  or  for  the

efficient  discharge  of government  business.  In

expressing  these opinions, they  appear  to  have

been actuated by motives which reasonable men  and

women would spurn with contempt. What they say  in

effect  is  this: that it is better  that  a  post

should  remain uncreated or unfilled  rather  than

that  they should run the risk of having it filled

by an expatriate. All I can say is this, Sir, that

this bigoted judgment will be small comfort to the

parents  of  a  child whose life is  perhaps  lost

because   specialised   knowledge   which    might

otherwise have been available is lacking. That,  I

think, Sir, sums up the matter. The honest opinion

of disinterested civil servants of long experience

is called in question by a small band of bigots of

little or no experience. I think judgment in  this

matter  can  safely  be left  to  the  intelligent

members of the public and to the large body of the

civil  service  with whom I have worked  for  many

years and for whom I have the highest respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I should like to touch on the

suggestion that elected Ministers were,  shall  we

say,  hoodwinked. This is a dishonest,  scurrilous

and disreputable suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member is, of

course, aware that he must not use unparliamentary

words  in  this Assembly, no matter  how  much  he

feels   like   using  those  words.   "Dishonest",

"scurrilous"   and  "disreputable"  are   possibly

unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> In the circumstances, Sir, I beg leave

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, since we had some prior warning

through  the  Press  that certain  new  superscale

posts  might be the subject of attack by  a  small

unhappy group



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>



of  the  civil  service, it  was  decided  by  the

Council  of Ministers that all proposals would  be

examined  by its Finance Committee. This has  been

done. The need for each post was examined in great

detail.  Heads of departments were called  up  for

discussion in most cases. Some posts were deleted.

Those  which remain are those which satisfied  the

elected Ministers that they were essential for the

efficient discharge of government business.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> I think I have only got a minute

or  two  left,  Mr Chairman, to  deal  with  this

matter. I find it difficult to express my sense of

disgust   at  the  profound  absurdity  of   these

amendments  which  the Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar

continues to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His objection here is simply to the removal of

two brackets and two or three words. The title  of

the  post has been abolished, but the works still

remain. What is going to happen in the future will

be  that  the  Executive Engineer  concerned  with

defence works will still continue to do it, but if

the defence work is slack for a period, he can  do

other  work. If there is a lot of defence work  to

be  done, then another engineer can help him  with

it;  that is the simple effect of this change.  I

think, in fact, I could have had this  shut  out

under   Standing  Order  33  (1)  (b).  If   this

amendment were accepted, Mr Chairman, there would

be  no money to pay the officer concerned in  this

post,  and  consequently he would  have  to  live

rather  meagrely on his expatriate  allowance  and

his  variable allowance which would  not  get  him

very far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to make it quite clear that this is a

preposterous  objection to a mere  change  in  the

designation  of  the  work  for  the  purposes  of

greater administrative flexibility.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am glad, Mr Chairman, Sir,

that it is an expatriate who finally has to answer

for  these things. He has alleged that  it  is  an

unhappy band of bigots, unbalanced men



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



with  scurrilous minds and scurrilous hearts,  who

have   made  these  allegations,  and  the   Chief

Minister    yesterday    was    astonished    that

representations were not, in fact, made to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made enquiries yesterday to find out the

reason  for this. As early as the 17th of  October

this  year,  the  Federation of  Government  Union

Employees,    the   Singapore   Senior    Officers

Association, the Graduate Teachers Association and

the Singapore Teachers Union wrote to the Chairman

of  the  Malayanisation Commission and sent copies

of  the  letter to the Chief Secretary and to  the

Chief   Minister.  They  were  dealing  with   the

creation  of superscale posts to which  they  took

the  strongest possible exception. I do  not  know

how  much  time I have, Mr Chairman, Sir,  and  I

wish  to  read  only  the relevant  passages.  The

penultimate  paragraph of that  letter,  to  which

they have had no acknowledgment or reply from  the

Chief Minister or the Chief Secretary, -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The letter was not addressed to us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We do urge the Commission to make an interim

recommendation  to Government that  the  Singapore

Establishment should be fixed as from the date  of

the appointment of the Commission, and that no new

Division I posts, whether timescale or superscale,

should  be  created  by Government  without  prior

reference  to the Commission. We also request  the

Commission  to  make an interim recommendation  to

Government that no superscale posts in Division  I

should  be  filled substantively on the advice  of

the present Public Services Commission until after

the    recommendations   of   the   Malayanisation

Commission are known. We are sending copies of the

letter  to  the  Chief  Secretary  and  the  Chief

Minister - "



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I have to interrupt

the  hon.  Member because it seems to me that  the

Malayanisation Commission is a quasi-judicial body

and  this  document was sent to them  and  perhaps

ought   not  to  have  been  referred  to,  except

possibly in passing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, this is not

a confidential communication to the Malayanisation

Commission.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



This  was  a  point of view publicly declared  and

proclaimed  by the Federation of Government  Union

Employees,    the   Singapore   Senior    Officers

Association,  the  Graduate Teachers  Association,

and  the Singapore Teachers Union. They proclaimed

it   publicly.  They  sent  copies  to  the  Chief

Minister  and the Chief Secretary. They stated  in

clear categorical terms that they were against the

creation  of any new Division I posts.  The  Chief

Minister  will have to answer to the  people.  The

Financial Secretary does not have to answer to the

people.  He does not have to answer to the bigots.

If he does not like them, he can call them bigots.

But  the Chief Minister will have to answer to the

people  whether he likes them or not, and  whether

they are bigots or not, because they represent the

will of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. The time has elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $4,669,470 for Head 61 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 62 -

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 4 (1), Upkeep of Government

Roads, on page 251 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, my attention was drawn

to  the  fact  that an allocation of $130,000  has

been  made  under  this head  as  against  one  of

$10,000 in 1955. I would have no objection to this

increase  if provision is being made for at  least

one item, or rather group of items. I refer to the

approach  roads to schools. All three of the  main

Government  schools in the Tanglin  Division  have

approach  roads which are in appalling  condition,

and  I  know that these are by no means  the  only

schools  which  are  suffering.  This  matter  has

already been brought to the notice of the Minister

for Education, and I hope that this increase means

that  the  information has been passed on  to  his

colleague  at  the Ministry of Communications  and

Works.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the argument which might be used is that

roads    leading   to   schools   are   not    the

responsibility of the Government because they  are

frequently  private  roads  to  be  made   up   by

frontagers,  but in the three cases I have  quoted

the  schools are the very first buildings situated

on  the roads in question, and it seems to me that

it  is  part  of  the  duty  of  Government,  when

building  and  maintaining schools, to  build  and

maintain  serviceable approach roads  to  them.  I

hope that the Minister will give an assurance that

the  increase under this head is intended at least

in part for this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This vote is in respect of some 120

miles  of Government roads which include car parks

and  access  roads,  roads to hospitals,  prisons,

Mount  Pleasant Road, Haig Road and so  on.  I  am

afraid,  Mr Chairman, Sir, I cannot  give  you  a

clear  picture of what will be done  about  school

approach roads in particular. I am very well aware

of  the situation, Sir. When I was a teacher,  the

approach  road  to my own school  was  exceedingly

bad. I very warmly sympathise with the hon. Member

for his efforts to get the roads improved.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is not clear to

me  from the remarks of the Minister whether these

roads will be attended to or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

252 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Estimates it is shown that $150,000 is

required  this year for minor works. The  approved

estimate last year was only $60,000. I now seek information as to the necessity for the increase  of

this vote by 250 per cent and the work to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This is a simple little grant of

proving Crown land when you anticipate building or

other  work of that kind; for example, the  filing

up  of  the  swamp land at Kolam  Ayer  for  civil

defence  purposes; the taking up now of some  bits

of  concrete  flooring at Shenton Way  which  will

have  to  go  at  some time. That is  the  general

purpose - where  Crown land needs to be  cleaned  up

and  put  into good order, perhaps with a view  to

building,  then the work is put in  hand  and  the

work is done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> That is not very much

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the total came to $500,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided this year that we would cut all these

special  departmental minor works  votes  out  and

increase this General Minor Works vote by  a  very

much smaller sum than the sum which we cut out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $6,549,400 for Head 62 stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I should like to

refer  for a few moments to the question of  flood

alleviation. I am glad that the Bedok  scheme  has

now been started and will be completed, I hope, to

the  satisfaction of the residents there in a  few

months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would ask the Minister now to turn his

attention  to the Ulu Pandan area. He  stated,  in

reply  to  the Member for Tanjong Pagar the  other

day,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>



that plans must be formulated before money can  be

spent.  But I would remind him that a plan already

exists  in the Ulu Pandan area. It was formulated

two  years ago, published in fact in July 1953  by

the Flood Alleviation Joint Committee, composed of

representatives  of the Government  and  the  City

Council, which recommended a scheme to take  water

away  from  Alexandra and Bukit Timah through  Ulu

Pandan to the sea. The Alexandra canal scheme  was

originally  estimated to cost about  $4  millions,

and this was subsequently reduced to a one million

dollar  scheme. Finally, however, it  was  decided

first  to go forward with a pilot scheme to  make

sure  that the waters of Alexandra would run away

in  a westerly direction and the reverse direction

from  what  it  does  at  present  at  a  cost  of

$120,000,  of  which  Government  agreed  to   pay

$60,000.  Eventually this scheme was completed,  I

think,  about  nine  months  ago  at  a  cost   of

$200,000, the extra cost being due largely to  the

need  to purchase land from the War Department.  I

say  this scheme was successfully completed in the

neighbourhood  of nine months ago and  I  think  I

stated  in this House in April that the water  was

running  away in the right direction, that  is  to

say, in a westerly direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what has happened since then? A lot of the

canal has silted up. Enterprising farmers are  now

growing  water-hyacinth in ponds for  their  pigs,

and  the water at the top end of the canal is  now

running  in  the opposite direction  back  towards

Alexandra  and the city. It seems  to  me  that  a

scheme which has cost the public $200,000 and  was

successful  should be followed up immediately  and

that  money should have been granted in  the  1956

Estimates to see that what has been done  already

is not wasted but is being carried on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I have only got

at  present  the  preliminary very  brief  mention

about Ulu Pandan. The Member for Tanglin's remarks

do seem to me to indicate that if the work done is

silting  up  and  if farmers are interfering  with

it, - do I understand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



that  properly? - it does seem to indicate the  need

for  proper planning before we put these works  in

hand and for a really comprehensive overall scheme

before we undertake those relatively minor works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot give a figure for this area. It is one

on  which  we  have not got a report yet,  but  it

might be in the nature of $1½ millions. I think that

could be considerably reduced. I cannot anticipate

the  expert  report which we  shall  get  in  the

course  of  the next few weeks. I hope early  next

year  it will be available for discussion  by  the

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman,

lack of interest rather than anything else.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  thank  the  Member for Tanglin  very  much  for

giving  me  this opportunity to speak.  With  your

permission, Mr Chairman, Sir, before I  touch  on

this subject, I wish to remind all Members in this

House that, despite so many Party differences, yet

we  have  at least one common aim, that  is,  this

country  is  going  to  get  rid  of  colonialism.

Therefore,  we must also get rid of  the  colonial

educational policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we have had a chance to

glance  at  the development estimate on education.

One  glance  and we can see that this  is  another

colonial  educational  policy.  We  cannot   trace

anything at all that shows that the Government has

kept   its  word  when  it  promised  during   the

elections,  "Equality of education for all  races!

Preservation  and promotion of all cultures!"  Our

Chief  Minister even went to the extent of talking

during  the  elections about lifting the  language

barrier in this country, and I am sure, Sir,  that

all  this is connected with education. We  believe

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>



the educational policy of any country in the world

is  always of prime importance. Whoever can  carry

out  a  healthy and constructive policy  will  not

only  bring about immediate benefit to the country

but benefit for a long, long time to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we look at the Estimates, we see a

number  of new secondary schools scheduled  to  be

built.  I  wish  the Minister for Education  would

clearly  indicate to us how many of these will  be

Malay  secondary schools; how many will be Chinese

secondary  schools; and also whether  any  primary

school is to be built during the coming year. Sir,

we   cannot  understand  Government's  policy   on

education. On the one hand, it promises the people

that  their  cultural position would  be  secured.

They   say,  "We  are  going  to  give  you   fair

treatment."  Yet,  on  the other  hand,  they  are

promoting only English education. Although we  are

very  happy to note that more money is voted  this

year,   we  must  not  forget  that  the  previous

Legislative  Council - we very often called  them  a

colonial Legislative Council - unhesitatingly  gave

$12 millions to improve Chinese education. Whether

this   grant  met  with  welcome  or   just   only

resentment  or  even  fear and  suspicion  is  not

known.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is now high time for the

Minister for Education to have the courage to make

a  start  to  get rid of the colonial  educational

policy in this country. My sympathies quite  often

go to many Ministries which have been attacked by

the  forceful and learned Member for Tanjong Pagar

who  accuses the Ministers of being influenced too

much by their expatriate assistants. But, Sir,  my

sympathies  do  not,  in  the  least,  go  to  the

Minister for Education. I believe the Minister for

Education has betrayed Chinese education. He, more

than  anybody else, should understand the  Chinese

school   tradition  in  this  country.  He  should

himself  deal with the policy on Chinese education

or even vernacular education and should not depend

solely  upon the expatriate officers.  Sir,

if  I have  your  permission, I can  give  a  particular

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. I just want to

understand what the hon. Member is getting at. The

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, everything has

been  so  frankly  debated  that  I  am  going  to

emphasise   that  this  Budget  has  been   framed

entirely  by  the Colonial Office,  including  its

policy on primary schools. I remember not long ago

we  invited  a  so-called  education  expert  from

Hongkong to give us advice on bilingual education,

to   give  us  advice  on  Chinese  education   in

particular. Sir, let me speak as a former  Chinese

school teacher. We always regard Chinese education

in   Hongkong  as  peculiar  and  unpopular.   Mr

Chairman,  Sir, it will surprise you to know  that

Chinese education in Hongkong is -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, the Member is referring

to  evidence given before the All-Party  Committee

on  Chinese Education, which evidence is  not  yet

allowed  to  be brought up before this  House  for

discussion.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Arising from that point, if the

hon.  Member,  in fact, is referring to  evidence

which   has   been  given  before  the   All-Party

Committee  on Chinese Education, then, of  course,

he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, I think our

Minister has jumped too quickly to conclusions!  I

just  say  according to what has appeared  in  the

papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this so-called bilingual expert was going

to  give us advice on Chinese education, and I  am

going  to say that that is wrong, and the decision

to invite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



this  Hongkong expert was, I am sure, not made  by

our  Minister. Sir, it may surprise  you  to  know

that  Chinese education in Hongkong is taught  not

in  Kuo-yu but in Cantonese, with profit-making as

the  motive.  It  is  not  only  colonialised  but

commercialised. Yet we are going  to  accept  such

advice  from  this colonialised and commercialised

expert!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The hon. Member is not

talking  on the Development Estimates. He  is  now

talking on the educational policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I had better refer hon. Members to

the relevant Standing Order 69 (7), which says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any Member may move an amendment to the

schedule  to reduce by $ ... the sum to be allotted

for any head of expenditure ..".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, paragraph (11):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the question, "That the sum of $ ... for head ...

stand  part  of  the schedule",  debate  shall  be

confined  to the policy of the service  for  which

the money is to be provided ...";



<br><br>so  that  I  must  rule that the hon.  Member  is

probably making a speech on the main Question. The

Question  that is before the House is the question

proposed by the Member for Tanglin, and it  is  an

amendment  to  reduce by $500,000 the  sum  to  be

allotted  in  respect of sub-head 4  (2),  Primary

Schools. If, therefore, the hon. Member wishes  to

speak further on the question of policy, he should

wait until the main Question has been proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I

think our Minister is getting very impatient!  The

whole  reason  is that the Minister for  Education

has  been  greatly influenced by the  expatriates,

and  I  doubt  very much whether the Minister  has

framed  the educational aspect of this Budget,  or

has he only just been consulted?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. From what I can gather, the

Member  for Changi is, in fact, talking about  the

policy on education. That is correct?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please wait until I propose the

main Question before the hon. Member speaks on it.

This is an amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, then I

simply  have to ask the Minister for Education  to

indicate clearly whether this $500,000 for all the

primary schools is intended to be allocated  among

Malay  schools, Tamil schools and Chinese schools,

or merely to English schools alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many a time the Government Ministers accuse

Members   of  the  Opposition  of  reading   their

speeches.  This  proves  to  us  that   there   is

prejudice  against one's mother tongue  which  one

wants  to use because one cannot speak English  as

fluently as our Hon. Ministers can. But that  does

not  entitle them to say, "Well, I am an  educated

man."  We  cannot, on the one hand,  give  fervent

support to Government's policy in building so many

English schools to promote English education, and,

on  the other hand, stop vernacular education from

progressing.  So I want to repeat that  I  am  not

clear whether our Minister himself has framed  the

development aspect of education in this Budget  or

whether  he has only been consulted. Have  I  your

permission to point out how much our Ministers are

influenced by the expatriate officers? Can I?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member might or

might  not  be in order if he carries on  in  that

theme  when  I  propose the main Question.  If  he

wants  to  speak on the main Question, he  can  do

so, but whether he will or will not be in order

I will have to decide as the occasion arises.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, some

Members  come here just for the sake of  criticism

and   nothing   else.  They  just  know   how   to

criticise - destructive criticism, not  constructive

criticism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I had better confine myself to Standing

Orders  and  reply  to  the amendment  before  the

House, and that is the reduction of $500,000  from

the  Development Estimates. I gave that  reply  on

Monday and I would advise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>



Members  to  read that reply. The hon. Member  the

mover  of  this  amendment had indicated  that  he

would withdraw his question today, but he moved it

again  in  order that an opportunity be  given  to

others to speak on it. I repeat: the Government is

all the time carrying out investigations into ways

and  means of reducing the cost of buildings,  but

it  must  be borne in mind that economy on capital

expenditure  must  not be offset  by  increase  in

maintenance  costs.  It  is  also  important  that

schools  should be built, but we do not want  them

to have a quality, which is so inferior as to be a

reproach to our legislators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, sitting on a Committee in the P.W.D.,

expert  educationists who can  advise  how  class-rooms  could  be reduced in size, how the  ceiling

could be reduced in height, and we are working out

a  scheme  whereby the cost of buildings  will  be

reduced considerably.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think

the  Minister  for Education has not  answered  my

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order, Mr Lim Cher Kheng.

The   Minister  has  not  answered  your  question

because  you  have been out of order. Please  wait

until the main Question is proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I do take

objection to Ministers repeating all the time that

our   criticisms  are  all  destructive  and   not

constructive.  Actually,  it  is   only   out   of

destruction  sometimes that construction  emerges.

We have to do a certain amount of destruction here

in  order  to take away the ideas of standards  of

building which were set at a time when we were  in

affluent  circumstances  and  when  we   had   not

undertaken  such extensive social  programmes  for

the under-privileged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I put it this way, Sir, and ask a question:

whether  savings  could be effected  out  of  this

enormous  amount  of, say, a few hundred  thousand

dollars  during the next year or two  and  whether

the    savings,   say   about   half   a   million

dollars - being about ten per cent estimated  to  be

spent - could  be  diverted to  vernacular  schools,

Chinese, Malay and Indian?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Perhaps I might be able to help the

hon.  Member on this one. The situation, I  think,

is over these 18 schools in Group B, and I wish to

inform hon. Members that one will be ready by  the

end of this year and tenders will be called for 13

more  before the end of this year. That means,  of

course,  that  the very lengthy  planning  and  so

on - site  investigation and all that - is  now  ready

and  we  are  in a position to call  for  tenders.

Consequently, if you want to stop that in order to

readjust your plans, you will have to go back  one

year and stop 13 schools from being built, which I

am  sure is not the intention of the mover of  the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There remain four other schools for which site

difficulties  have not yet been  cleared,  but  as

soon  as  sites are available, we shall  go  ahead

with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see from my constructional

angle,  it would be extremely difficult in respect

of  this vote to divert the money from the schools

since  a  large part of the preliminary  work  has

already  been done, and if that work  is  stopped,

then you will stop the whole building programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $11,542,020 for Head D 48 stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, looking

through  this estimate on development, I  do  find

the  item  "School Playing Fields" coming  up  and

$100,000 allocated for developing playing  fields.

We  all  realise that playing fields in  Singapore

are scarce and few and far between, and indeed you

do  find  that  there  are  many  schools  without

playing fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also inform this House that although some

schools  are  fortunate  enough  to  have  playing

fields, yet these are not put to maximum use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just a suggestion, Sir, that it is a good

thing to put in probably two or three more playing

fields out of this allocation of $100,000, but  I

think it would be a better thing that the existing

playing fields of some schools -

Government  departments in the purchase  of  land.

For  instance, the Education Department would want

of Government funds in land. Perhaps he might care

to elaborate further?

have  bought a pencil. This is an investment  and

<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

under this head $5,500,000 has been allocated  for

"Acquisition   and  Development   of   Sites   for

Resettlement". I have one resettlement in my area,

Sir. It  was  created nearly 18 months  ago.  The

condition  of  the roads and surroundings  is  far

from  satisfactory. I am told, Sir,  on  a  recent

visit   by   the  Hon. the  Minister  for   Local

Government,  Lands and Housing that the  money  is

already there in the Estimates, but the difficulty

is  to get surveyors to survey road-works and then

implement them, the reason being that there are no

surveyors  available in the Department.  It  is  a

very  unsatisfactory state of affairs,  Sir,  when

one  thinks  of  the  fact  that  there  is  money

available but the work is not done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These resettlements have very little amenities,

and  the more we can provide for them, the  better

would  life  be  for the people  living  in  these

resettlements.  I would suggest to  the  Hon. the

Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing - I

have already mentioned it to him during his visit,

but  I would like to put it on record as something

that   I  have  said  in  this  Chamber - that   the

Government  should resort to finding some  private

surveyor to do this type of work, so that the work

would not only be speeded up, but the fact that it

is being put in hand would give some confidence to

the people living there.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, the question which the Member for Seletar has

in mind is receiving my immediate consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am one

of  the people coming from outside the city  area,

and  I  am  coming  again  to  this  question   of

contribution  to  the Rural Board.  The  Hon. the

Financial  Secretary  has complimented  the  Rural

Board on collecting a lot of revenue. I think that

compliment  must be qualified. Here  in  Singapore

you  do  find  that many people live in  congested

surroundings  right in the heart of this  city.  I

think  it  should be the policy of  Government  to

encourage  people to live in the rural areas,  and

if  you  are  going to encourage them to  live  in

healthier  rural areas, you should bring  to  them

more  amenities of life. As a person who has  been

living  in the rural area for a very long time,  I

can safely say that the amenities there are not up

to  standard. The roads must be greatly  improved.

Playing  fields must be provided in  almost  every

district.  I will just give one aspect  of  living

conditions - the night-soil system. It is  not  good

in the rural areas and needs looking into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these things need money, and yet we have

four  million odd dollars for an area which is,  I

think, ten times greater than the city area.  Sir,

I  think  this  sum is inadequate  and  should  be

increased so that there will be more encouragement

for   people  to  live  outside  the  city   area.

Furthermore,  if  this sum were  increased,  there

would not be the necessity of increasing rates.  I

have   heard  the  Hon. the  Minister  for  Local

Government,  Lands  and  Housing  state  that   $2

increase   a  month  for  all  the  amenities   in

Serangoon  Garden is justifiable. There should  be

no  complaint about it. But I would like to inform

him  that  when a person buys a house in Serangoon

Garden,  he buys it with a promise that all  these

amenities  will be part of the price he  pays  for

it.  But  after a year you say, "No, the value  is

greater.  All that we have promised to install  is

not going to be installed unless



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



we put an added value on the house."  That, I

think, Sir, is not justified.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, may I remind the Member

for  Serangoon that the promise made  was  not  by

Government  or the Rural Board, but by the  owners

of  the estate themselves; and that, in fact,  the

Rural  Board  house owners have  had  considerable

encouragement?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also remind him that they pay 60 per

cent of the assessment that the city dweller pays.

The assessment on the annual value of their houses

is  20 per cent. The city dweller pays 32 per cent

in respect of the annual value of his premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure the Member for Serangoon is

conscious of the fact that he cannot get  services

without payment, and payment ultimately comes from

the public. The system of assessment is considered

a  fair one and has so far worked reasonably  well

in that the persons who have the amenities and are

in  a  position to pay, do pay. A man who  owns  a

house  has his premises assessed, and I understand

it  is  very conservatively assessed at an  annual

value  of, say, $100 and he pays per year on  that

in the rural area only $20. If he gets $100 rent a

month  he  pays on that rate for all the amenities

that  make possible the occupation of the premises

in question, $20 a month to the authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add this, that there is no

question whatsoever but that the amenities in  the

rural  areas should be improved. On this I  am  in

complete  agreement with the Member for Serangoon,

and  it  is  certainly our hope, Sir, to  continue

what  has  already been done in the way of  giving

greater  amenities  to  the  areas  outside   city

limits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $16,239,780 for Head D 45 ordered to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, Sir, I wish to express

objection  to the erecting of another  $2  millions

building  in the vicinity of the General Hospital.

I  understand  that it is to be a teaching  centre

and  not for treatment, but why should it cost the

equivalent  of  something  like  three   secondary

schools?  Is the Minister entirely satisfied  that

such  a centre must cost as much as $2 millions?  I

realise that three-quarters of the amount is  from

the  Colonial  and Welfare Development  Fund,  but

could  not  part of this generous grant have  been

promised to further new industries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I think perhaps I should answer these

questions  since  the Development  Estimates  were

really my child, a thriving child, I hope!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Tanglin has said, this is a

project  which involves not only Colony funds  but

C.D.  & W. funds. It goes a bit beyond that in  so

far  as  it  is  what you might call a  tripartite

effort   on  the  part  of  the  Government,   the

University of Malaya and the City Council. It  is,

as  he says, a training establishment - training  of

nurses  in  rural health; training of  doctors  in

public  health; and the City Council are going  to

use it as a child health clinic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Tanglin knows, before we can

get  any grants from the Colonial Development  and

Welfare  Fund,  we have to put up  a  particularly

strong  case  to justify expenditure,  and  it  is

subject  to  most careful scrutiny and pruning  by

the  authorities  at home before authority  for  a

grant  is  given. I think I can say  in  all  good

faith  that this represents the minimum amount  of

expenditure  which  is  required  to  provide  the

services which we envisage. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



a  training establishment of the highest order. As

I  say,  $500,000 is coming from Colony funds  and

$1,500,000 from C.D. & W. funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 4, District Hospital, on  page

16 of the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Minister for Health (Mr A. J.

Braga)  in his speech on Monday went some  way  to

clarify  Government policy as far as his  Ministry

is  concerned but not, in our opinion, far enough.

One  question he has not yet answered is this: Why

give  priority  to  improvements  in  the  General

Hospital  over  the  building of  a  new  district

hospital?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decentralisation is admitted to be essential,

and  admitted to be part of Government policy, and

yet  this  is to be delayed for the best  part  of

another  year  because money has to  be  spent  on

reconditioning the General Hospital  wards  first.

Is  this  absolutely necessary, and is it  in  the

best public interests?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me pose another question. Even if more beds

will  be  available than before in  these  General

Hospital wards, what will the cost be per bed, and

how  does this compare with the proposed cost  per

bed at the new district hospital? I hope very much

to  hear that neither the reconditioned wards nor

the  new district hospital will be built of a very

high  standard,  nor  money lavished  on  the  new

Mistri  wing of the General Hospital but that  the

public is going to get very much better value  for

its   money.   Nevertheless,  at   the   cost   of

$3,200,000, I have my misgivings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, needs explanation because

the   Minister   for  Health  and  the   Financial

Secretary  on Monday seemed at variance with  each

other.  The former explained to us that the  first

site  for  the district hospital selected  was  in

Katong  and was abandoned because piling would  be

too costly. The latter stated that work on the new

site at Kallang would be slow because the land was

reclaimed land and much piling would be needed and

would take time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



Now  I  can readily believe that most of  the  old

airfield  area is not suitable for heavy buildings

because  of piling problems on reclaimed land  and

there  seems  to be a contradiction.  Is  the  new

district hospital then to cost more than  it  need

because  it  is going to be built on an unsuitable

site?  Is a great deal of piling going to  put  up

the cost per bed of this hospital? Is the Minister

satisfied  that  this is not only  the  best  site

geographically  but  also the  cheapest  from  the

taxpayers' point of view? I hope that hon. Members

opposite will not feel that these are destructive,

sterile questions. What we want is to be convinced

that  the  right decisions have been made  in  the

public  interests. If money continues to be poured

into  the General Hospital area at the expense  of

decentralisation, it is our duty to probe into the

reasons for it until we get a satisfactory answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point I would like to mention is that

under  Head 3 this Assembly approves, among  other

items, a sum of $300,000 for a 250-bed hospital to

be  built  by  S.A.T.A. Plans for this  have  been

drawn  up by a private architect, and a charitable

organisation   has   to  be  careful   of   money,

especially when it is Government money and  public

money. Now, if a private organisation can build  a

250-bed  hospital  for $300,000,  why  cannot  the

Government  approach these figures? I realise,  of

course, that a T.B. hospital is a hospital limited

to  a  single disease. It is a curative  hospital,

but  there  seems  to  me a very  great  disparity

between  a  250-bed hospital at  $300,000  and,  I

think, a 400-bed hospital at $3,200,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think the Member for Tanglin

touched at one point on the Kallang site?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Perhaps I can help him out on some

technical  details about that one. The first  non-technical  detail, of course,  is  that  the  site

there is already Government property. We have  not

got to pay very high prices for it. In that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



respect, of course, the site is eminently eligible

because  it  is  free. Secondly,  it  is  eligible

because   it   is  very  well  situated   from   a

demographic  point of view because the  population

around  is both heavy and poor and it is therefore

a  very suitable place for a hospital to be  where

the poor people can get into it easily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of piling, it is extremely hard

to find any site in Singapore now where you do not

have  to put piles down and there will undoubtedly

have  to be piling, but no more than there  is  in

the   ordinary  way  with  the  majority  of   the

buildings that have to go up nowadays.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> On the question of delay in

construction of the district hospital, I  think  I

am  right  in saying that it will take a  year  to

prepare  the  plans  finally before  work  can  be

started.  In  the  meantime,  we  are  spending  a

certain amount of money on the General Hospital. I

will   deal  with  that  point  under   the   item

"Alterations to Ward, etc." which is going  to  be

raised, I think, by the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr

Lim Koon Teck) very shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I cannot give the Member for Tanglin

(Mr  Ede) any details about the cost per bed.  He

knows much more about the S.A.T.A. Hospital than I

do  myself,  but  I think it is of rather  simpler

construction   generally  than   a   fully-fledged

district hospital with operating theatres and  all

the  other things like staff quarters that  go  to

make  up  a  fully-fledged district hospital.  The

estimated  cost, of course, will be most carefully

drawn up. It may be that we will be able to reduce

the estimates as a result of the activities of the

Sub-Committee on Medical Building Costs  which  is

now  sitting. That is a matter which we will  deal

with in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the site, I think my hon. Friend the

Minister   for   Communications  and   Works   has

explained  that.  The first site mentioned  by  my

hon.  Friend  the  Minister  for  Health  was   at

Katong - a private site close to the Sea View Hotel.

That  project  was abandoned when  we  decided  to

build  a  hospital on the eastern portion  of  the

Kallang  Airport site. I think these are  all  the

points which have been raised by the hon. Member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I should

like to add just a small point for the information

of  the  Member for Tanglin, which he  might  find

helpful in the matter of comparison. I did enquire

as  to the position in England and I was told that

for a modern hospital that is fully equipped, with

operating theatres, it is assessed that  the  cost

is  in the region of £2,500 per bed. I think  that

is   a  point  which  he  might  find  useful  for

comparison.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, the Financial Secretary

has  just told us that for this hospital one  year

will  be required for planning, and I take it that

about two to three years will be required for  its

construction and equipment to enable it to be  run

as  a  hospital. In the meantime, I am  very  much

concerned  about what is going to be  done  during

the  next four years to alleviate the position  of

the  sick people in this area who have to go  down

to  town  through very congested traffic. I  think

during  rush  hours  it would  take  an  ambulance

coming  down  from the Katong area to the  General

Hospital well over half an hour, if not more. Are

we  now going to adopt a defeatist attitude and do

nothing about it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been assured that the beautiful

building - the terminal airport - is not going  to  be

used  for the Malayan Auxiliary Air Force.  May  I

humbly  suggest that this building should  in  the

meantime  be  pressed into service as  a  district

hospital until such time as a new one is ready? It

has   all  the  facilities  there.  You  have  the

administration  rooms, telephones, services  which

can  be used for surgical wards, offices, etc. You

have  on the first floor rooms ready to be  turned

into  wards.  There is a very large area  of  open

space on the first floor which has been used as  a

restaurant and as a look-out chamber and which can

be  converted into extra wards, if necessary at  a

very cheap cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now offering this suggestion to the

Minister  for  Health whether, in all seriousness,

something  cannot be done for the people  in  this

district,  because  it will  not  only  serve  the

people living in this area but also all the people

living in the Serangoon and Paya Lebar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>



area - a very congested area - and enable them to  by-pass the town by using the excellent roads of Paya

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the idea

of  having a hospital at the airport terminal  has

been  considered  by  the  experts  whom  we  must

consult  and  whose views we must accept,  and  we

have  been  assured that that building  is  wholly

inappropriate and inadequate for the purposes of a

district hospital. But the suggestion just made by

the  Member  for  Paya  Lebar  that  it  might  be

utilised  as a sort of temporary cottage  hospital

seems  to  have potentialities, Sir, and  I  would

like  to  assure  him  that  that  question  would

certainly be investigated from the point  of  view

of a purely temporary cottage hospital rather than

a  fully-equipped hospital. I think there might be

something in it. It might well be feasible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, sometime in 1954/55, if I

remember  it correctly, Thomson Road was suggested

as a site for a district hospital. As far as I can

remember,  there  are  two  sites - both  Government

property - which are available for public  purposes.

One of them is an elevated site and I am wondering

whether   the   Government  has   considered   the

possibility of erecting a district hospital on it.

I think it is a very ideal site.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr

Chairman, Sir, with due respect to the experts,  I

cannot  see why the old Kallang Airport cannot  be

turned  into a hospital. Just before the  fall  of

Singapore,  all the hospitals were  in  the  open,

under tents, and the terminal airport building  is

a  very  good  building compared to  tents  for  a

hospital!



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> I

think  it  was the Member for Tanglin who enquired

what  the average cost of a bed would be.  Working

it  out  on a $3,200,000 hospital, I have  already

intimated to the Members of the House that in  the

first phase, it is anticipated that with the staff

available and by the time that it is erected,  the

hospital  can accommodate 250 beds.  This  is,  of

course, anticipation, and we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



hope  to  enlarge on that. There will be provision

for  enlargement  to a 400-bed  hospital.  Working

that out, the cost would be about $7,100 per bed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am not quite clear

what the Minister intended to convey. Does he mean

that  a district hospital at $3,200,000 will  only

have 250 beds?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> No, 400. 250 beds in the first phase.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> At $3,200,000 not 400 beds?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $200,000 the sum to be allotted in

respect of item 10 (3), Alterations to ward,  etc.

on page 16 of the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see here that the estimated cost is $2,820,000

and   this  will  include  an  extension  to   the

Orthopaedic Unit. This amount is to be  spent  for

alterations to wards at the General Hospital. This

amount  seems  to  be a terrific  one.  To  me  it

visualises a building - two buildings, in fact. I am

reliably  informed  that the  new  Chartered  Bank

premises,  Crosby House, at Anson Road costs  just

over $3 millions, and if you take away the cost of

the  foundations, I think it should  be  somewhere

about what is going to be spent on the alterations

to  the General Hospital, with an extension to the

Orthopaedic  Unit - $2,820,000. Here is  a  complete

and  concrete  building before us. For  that  same

amount  of money you have Crosby House - a beautiful

huge six-storey building with equipment furnished.

I  am not an engineer, but I can see facts. For $3

millions,  they  have  built  the  Bank  of  China

building.  The  cost  of  Asia  Building   is   $6

millions.  It will need a lot of explanation  from

the Government to justify this amount voted in the

Estimates     for    "Alterations     to     Ward,

etc." - $2,820,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask what extra

accommodation  we  would  get  for  this  enormous

expenditure, and how many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



beds  we  are going to get for spending nearly  $3

millions  of  public money. We could have  put  up

another skyscraper in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I should point out to the Member

for Paya Lebar that under this sub-head 10 (3) the

total  estimated cost of the whole scheme is $2.82

millions.  That  is an estimate  of  the  cost  of

alterations which the Minister for Health  has  in

mind for implementation over a number of years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I can tell him what has been spent so far

and what we propose to spend this year against the

provision  of $400,000 which has been  entered  in

the  Estimates, part of it being a revote and part

of  it  being  new money. The revised estimate  of

cost of work done so far is $365,000. I think  the

hon.  Member is familiar with the General Hospital

to know what I mean when I refer to Wards 1, 2, 3,

4  and 5. This money has been spent on remodelling

of  Wards  1,  2,  3,  4 and  5  to  take  in  the

verandahs, thus adding bed accommodation space  to

the  wards.  At  the  same  time,  new  bathrooms,

lavatories  and other accommodation of  a  similar

nature  have been added to make allowance for  the

increased  capacity of these wards.  At  the  same

time  also, what is called a follow-up clinic  has

been  made  for  Professor  Monteiro's  Unit.  The

object of this follow-up clinic is to get patients

on  to  their  feet as soon as they can  walk  and

therefore  free beds for the occupation  of  other

patients.  But  at the same time,  as  they  still

require  treatment, facilities have to be provided

for them under the care of the same physicians who

have  been treating them before and not  to  force

them  to go to the General Outpatients Department.

That  is the object of the follow-up clinic  which

has  been provided along with the alterations  and

remodelling  of  these  wards  for  the   sum   of

$365,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, with the money provided, we hope to

supply  a new Ear, Nose and Throat Unit.  I  think

those  who  have had to attend the Ear,  Nose  and

Throat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



Unit  of the Hospital for treatment will  realise

that  it is not very adequate. They have  to  use

the general operating theatres in the vicinity  of

the  consulting  room. Waiting  accommodation  for

outpatients  is  not  particularly  good.  It   is

proposed  to take the ward which has been  vacated

by  the children who have been transferred to  the

Mistri  wing  and turn that into a  complete  Ear,

Nose  and  Throat clinic, with operating  theatres

and  a  proper Outpatients Department, and so  on

and  so forth. The net effect of that would be  to

provide  50  additional beds  for  Ear,  Nose  and

Throat patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also at the same time to add another

floor  to  the  existing block in the  Orthopaedic

section  of  the hospital. That will  provide  an

extra hundred beds. At the same time there will be

other  minor  alterations required to provide  the

facilities  for the increased number  of  beds  in

these wards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the future, I have here a long list

of  what is proposed to be done in the years from

1957  onwards. For example, modernise and increase

the  bed  accommodation in the Stanley Block  and

Norris  Block and so on and so forth, but  I  must

say  this, that it is not at all certain  that  we

will  proceed with this programme. The matter  is

now under consideration and it may well be that in

the course of the next two or three months we will

have a completely revised programme which may  cut

down future plans for alterations to wards in  the

General  Hospital and divert the funds which  have

been earmarked for that purpose to other purposes.

I think I can say that the remarks which have come

from the Progressive Party in this connection  are

very  constructive and helpful and they  will  be

borne in mind by the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Financial

Secretary  has dealt with the programme  regarding

the suggested alterations to the General Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a frown on the face of the Member for

Tanglin  (Mr Ede) on the question of the district

hospital with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



450   beds.  May  I  just  remind  him  that   the

$3,200,000 is not specifically for the  250  beds?

That  is particularly to cover a 450-bed hospital.

What  I  meant was that in the first phase we  can

only  accommodate 250 patients,  but  the  sum  of

$3,200,000 is for a 450-bed hospital with all  the

equipment  and conveniences. I would  also  remind

hon.  Members that it is very misleading  to  talk

about  hospitals in terms of the number  of  beds.

One  must  consider a hospital  in  terms  of  its

functions. A hospital has beds and those beds must

be  used to the best possible advantage. It is not

a  question  of beds but an increase of facilities

to the general public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary has told you about the

floor  that we intend to expand for the Ear,  Nose

and Throat Department and the Orthopaedic Unit and

so  forth; and also to provide a follow-up  clinic

for  those patients who have left their beds. This

will  enable  the  beds  vacated  by  them  to  be

utilised  by other patients. We must also  provide

facilities  for  out-patients  as  well   as   in-patients.  I  think  the Financial  Secretary  has

covered  all the various departments that we  have

in  mind when making alterations and additions  to

the General Hospital.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the

assurance  from  the Financial Secretary  has  cut

short  all  that I wanted to say!  We  are  indeed

happy to have his assurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that in all hospitals we want more

facilities, but I maintain that the most important

function  of a hospital is to cure as many  people

as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also I have faith in the predecessors of the

Medical  Department  in their early  planning,  so

that  if  it is said that they had not thought  of

knocking   out   verandahs   to   increase   space

accommodation  before, I think I would  differ  on

that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $200,000 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of item 10 (6), Quarters for 78  Sisters,

on page 16 of the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see here under this item the estimated cost

for  these  78 quarters is $1,250,000 which  works

out  at about $16,000 to $17,000 per unit. I  take

it that flats are intended for these 78 sisters? I

do not want to spend too much time on this item. I

mentioned  at  the previous sitting  that  it  was

possible  to reduce the cost of housing  the  rank

and  file  of  the  Police from about  $10,000  to

$5,000  per  unit, and I would urge  that  similar

consideration  be given so that the  accommodation

cost  here  can  be  reduced to somewhere  in  the

region of $12,000 per unit instead of $17,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> If I only knew, Sir, before the event,

I  would be able to give very full answers! As  my

hon.  Friend the Member for Paya Lebar  says,  the

cost  per  unit will work out at about $16,000  to

$17,000. I think I can say that this building  has

not  been started. I think hon. Members will  know

where  it  is being built. It will be  built  just

behind  Vickers  Block. Plans have been  prepared,

recently  signed, but they have been  prepared  in

the  light of the decision taken by the Government

to reduce the cost of medical buildings as much as

possible. They will be revised in the light of the

decision  of  the Sub-Committee  on  the  cost  of

medical  construction, and  it  is  possible  that

considerable savings will be achieved on the  cost

per unit of these buildings, principally, I think,

by   reducing   the  standard  of  equipment   and

fittings,  tiling and other things  of  a  similar

nature inside the block itself. As I mentioned,  I

think,  at an earlier sitting of this Assembly  in

connection with the sister quarters in the Vickers

Block,  we  have reduced the cost  per  unit  very

considerably,  and  the  same  economies  will  be

practised in respect of this block for 78 sisters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the principle underlying the

construction of this block, we have found - I  think

it  is generally accepted - that it is necessary to

have  a  quarter  of  the staff  of  the  hospital

actually  resident  on the  spot  in  case  of  an

emergency.  Provision of quarters for  78  sisters

will really work out at one sister for 45 beds  in

the hospital once it has been expanded to the full

capacity. I think in these circumstances  it  will

be agreed that provision of a block of quarters of

this  size  for  sisters is  not  an  unreasonable

project.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I would like to ask

whether  this  work,  or, for that  matter,  other

works  or buildings or alterations, is being  done

by  the  P.W.D., or do you give it to any  private

architect  or private contractors? When discussing

this item with the Member for Paya Lebar, who  has

some   experience  of  construction   of   cheaper

buildings and cheaper flats, I have been told that

the work can be done by private architects through

private   contractors,  under,  of   course,   the

supervision of a Government architect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to enquire whether Government

would be prepared to utilise private architects if

their own costs are much higher than the others.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> We do utilise private architects from

time  to  time, Sir, if we find that the  projects

which  we  have in hand and which are regarded  as

essential  are beyond the capacity of  the  Public

Works  Department, but the Public Works Department

is our department. It consists of highly qualified

architects, quantity surveyors and all  the  other

people   who   are  required  to   supervise   the

construction of buildings, and where  possible  we

always employ the Public Works Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of cost, it is a difficult

problem  and  I  would  not  like  to  discuss  it

here - whether   the  cost  of  construction   under

private architects is cheaper or dearer than  that

of the P.W.D. There is, of course, the question of

paying architects' fees which have to be paid when

we employ private architects but which, of course,

do not have to be paid when we employ the P.W.D.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy in general is that where possible we

employ  our  own people, but if their  capacity  is

over-taxed, then we have no hesitation in going  to

private architects.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I wish to assure the Member for Paya

Lebar that the question of costs is continually  in

my  mind, because the more money I have to use, the

more  benefits I can bring to the people - build more

clinics and district hospitals. I have spent  hours

and  hours  with  the Financial Secretary  and  the

P.W.D. in trying my best to reduce costs, but  for

his  information I would like to say, in connection

with these quarters for 78 sisters, that there  are

only  three flats there for the matrons,  and  each

sister will have a bed-sitting room and a bathroom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I would just like to make a point

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. Sir, there was no

accusation made by me at all, and the Minister  for

Communications and Works should not bring  in  this

at  all.  I  have  never levelled  any  accusations

against the Public Works Department for anything. I

only wanted to enquire -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Neither did I level any accusation

against  the  Member for Telok Ayer. I  was  saying

"people". I wish to have an opportunity of replying

to  things that are said by people around this town

and  which are in the same general form as what the

hon. Member said, only more emphatic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is, of course, that the P.W.D. builds

the  buildings  which they are told to  build.  The

architect  is told what he has got to produce,  and

he   produces  the  best  he  can  with  the  money

allotted.  As  regards the cost of  the  buildings,

whether  they  are  extravagant, whether  they  are

luxurious,  or  whether  they  are  economical  and

austere is a matter of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



general   Government  policy;  and   we   are   now

instituting,  as I have already explained  in  this

Assembly,  policies of economy  and  austerity.  We

have  set  up machinery which I have described  for

that  purpose,  and  I hope that  the  economy  and

austerity will successfully follow. As I have said,

they  cannot be expected to appear until  you  have

got  new  works in hand which will start  with  the

plans  made  now. They cannot appear in respect  of

works  which  have been planned in the past  unless

you  are going to tear up your plans and make a new

start with consequent delay of a year or so.

Sisters  and Almoner, on page 16 of the Development

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, I have studied the figures with

great  alarm  and I shall indeed be really  alarmed

unless  some explanation is given as to  why  there

should be an increase of nearly 25 per cent in  the

estimated  cost. Under the Remarks column  we  have

"Estimated cost revised from $450,000",  and  under

the  Estimated cost it is now $720,000. Well, I  am

mistaken,  it is nearly a 60 per cent increase.  If

the  same  amount  of accommodation  is  envisaged,

something  must  have  gone  very  wrong.  I   will

therefore  seek information before I speak  further

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The answer to that question, of course,

is  that  another  floor  has  been  added  to  the

building  which  was  envisaged  for  the  $450,000

entered  in  the Estimates last year. I think  hon.

Members will remember, possibly about three  months

ago  now, that I came asking for an application for

supplementary  vote  for  $270,000  to  this  vote - Quarters  for  Matrons,  Sisters  and  Almoner   at

Kandang  Kerbau. That was approved by the Assembly.

As  I  say, the object of the exercise was  to  add

another  floor to the building - it is  a  two-storey

building - making it a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



three-storey  building, and adding one-third  more

to  the accommodation. As I say, Sir, the increase

understand  how an additional floor  can  make  an

increase of nearly 60 per cent to the total  cost.

There is very little information before us, and  I

shall  just  merely express my very  sincere  hope

that  the new Building Committee will go into this

figure  very thoroughly. As it stands at  present,

it looks as if we are spending $37,000 per flat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I think there must be some mistake,

Sir. The original estimate, if I remember rightly,

was  $450,000, and we have added $270,000, I think

an  increase  of  about 33 per cent,  for  another

floor.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of item 11 (4), Additions and Alterations

to  existing Hospital Buildings, on page 16 of the

Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see here an item for $2 millions, and

many  of the remarks that I have made before apply

in  this  case.  From the rough figures  mentioned

this  morning, it appears to me that the  proposed

cost  per  bed of this new S.A.T.A. wing  will  be

around  $3,000 each. That in the district hospital

will  cost  about $8,000. The Chief  Minister  has

mentioned  a fantastic figure of somewhere  around

£2,500  per bed in a London hospital. I  think  we

can  get  a very good idea if comparative  figures

are  given to us showing the various costs of  the

S.A.T.A.  Hospital  and the General  Hospital.  Of

course,  we must make allowance for administrative

offices and other equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think hon.

Members  are aware that a new block was opened  at

the Kandang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



Kerbau  Hospital - I  think some  Progressive  Party

members  were  present at the opening ceremony - but

now  that that block has been opened, and  it  can

accommodate 116 beds, it is necessary to modernise

and  renovate the old building and to provide  the

additional  hospital beds as such renovation  will

permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the block facing Bukit Timah Road, for

example,  the ground floor and part of  the  first

floor have now been vacated by the Administrative,

Outpatient,  X-Ray and Dispensary Departments  and

this  accommodation  will be converted  into  ward

accommodation of 128 beds as compared with  75  in

the old building. The pressure on this hospital is

such that additional theatre accommodation also is

essential,  and  it is proposed to  provide  under

this  item gynaecological operating theatres apart

from  the  obstetrical theatres  provided  in  the

block lately completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members must also remember that the Kandang

Kerbau  Hospital, as has been told, is one of  the

finest in the world. It is a teaching hospital and

adequate provision must be made for that purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in the

case  of  alterations  to buildings,  I  am  still

putting  up  the  old argument that  whatever  old

buildings we have, they are still useful  and  can

still be used even without alterations, and if the

cost  is going to be very large, you could  easily

put up another new building which will incorporate

all  the  modern conveniences that  you  can  ever

think of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to

respect of item 12 (2), Ward Blocks, four, on page

17 of the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do so advisedly because I see here in the

Remarks  column that the estimated cost  has  been

revised  from  $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.  On  that

alone,  I  submit that I am entitled  to  ask  for

quite a lot of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I think the question was why had the

cost  increased by $2 millions. I think the answer

is  that  four blocks are being built  instead  of

two.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of  item 12 (3), Conversion  of  Students

Hostel   for  150  Nurses,  on  page  17  of   the

Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now here we have a very clear case of what can be

over-spent  in  the  nature  of  alterations   and

conversion.  150 nurses are to be accommodated  in

this  Students Hostel which, I presume, must  have

been  built at quite a substantial price  pre-war.

Now  $300,000  is  required for conversion,  which

works out at $2,000 per unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have been informed this morning that sisters

only  get one bed, one sitting room and toilet,  I

presume  the  nurses will only get just  one  room

instead of two - one bed-sitting room instead  of  a

sitting and a bedroom. To my mind, to spend $2,000

for  converting an existing building into one-room

quarters   is  fantastic.  I  know  the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust  are  now  building  two-storey

flats - admittedly  they  are  small - in   Guillemard

Road.  They are units by themselves and can  house

at least four to five persons each. They each cost

$2,300 only, and with the services, sanitation and

all, I think it is $3,000, not more than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you can have a complete house for $3,000,

what justification is there for spending $2,000 to

alter  one  little room - $2,000 per unit? Something

has  gone wrong somewhere, and I think there is  a

lot  of  room,  as I say, for a change  of  heart,

according  to  our friend the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar. Sir, these are the things that make me  sit

up,  and  I  think that a complete  revolution  of

ideas  is  necessary in the case of our  admirable

P.W.D. architects - I am casting no  aspersions  on

them,  Sir,  they are friends of mine and  I  have

great   admiration  for  them.  They   have   done

excellent  work. I do not agree in those  respects

with the hon. Member who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



says  "Hear, hear!" and keeps on interrupting  me.

But  still,  in the interest of the  country,  and

because  of the financial stringency that  we  are

facing, I am determined to see that for every cent

we  spend,  we  shall  get  at  least  double  the

accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.

Surely, getting more for every cent we spend  than

what we ordinarily get depends also upon people in

the contracting business, does it not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I would like to remind the Member for

Paya Lebar that that building is now being used as

a  hostel for the students of the university. They

are  vacating it. There is accommodation there  at

present  for  90 students, and when  the  work  of

conversion   is   completed,   there    will    be

accommodation for 150 nurses. Now it  is  urgently

necessary to provide residential accommodation for

staff  nurses and the building is to be so altered

as  to  provide for dining rooms and so forth - they

are  not  there  now,  but they  all  have  to  be

provided for. I am not a financial expert  nor  an

architect  nor - in reply to the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar - am I a contractor, but it must be visualised

that  this  has to be properly built and  suitable

for the nurses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has paid his esteem and

regard  for  the  architects of the  Public  Works

Department,  and I am sure that,  since  he  knows

them  so  well,  they will not put a  much  higher

estimate  than  is necessary for the  purpose  for

which the building is now going to be renovated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, there is no question at

all about the over-estimating. The only thing is I

am  trying to make it clear that the whole  design

has  been done on a style which we cannot possibly

afford  today, and there must be a change  in  the

concept of building for our civil servants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, this matter of

building  costs is one which has been  thought  of

very  early in the life of this Government, and  I

have  indicated the date on which a file has  been

opened, and what action has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



taken  since. I will repeat the action,  which  is

that at the very highest level a body is being set

up   with   representatives  of   the   Government

architects,  the  City  Council  architects,   the

S.I.T., and people engaged in private practice. It

does  take a little time to get them all  together

because  they have bodies which have to  meet  and

elect  a  particular person to serve on that  body

and  that is not operating yet, but I hope it will

be operating very shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have in operation two working parties - one in

respect of costs for educational buildings and one

in respect of costs for medical buildings - and they

are   examining   in  detail  both   the   general

principles of building and also particular  points

such  as  the quality of finishes and so on  which

are  the  things  on which you can  probably  save

most.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we have also increased the powers of

the  Public  Works  Department Standing  Committee

under  which  it  can now refuse to  accept  items

which  it  considers extravagant.  If  a  Minister

thinks  he must have some item, then he will  have

to  bring it to me, and if I say "I am afraid  you

cannot  have it", then he will have to go  to  the

Council of Ministers and he will have to make  out

a  case  for the item which he considers necessary

but  which  the  Public Works Department  Standing

Committee considers excessive. However,  this  can

only operate with regard to the future unless  you

are  going to try and pull down the buildings  you

have  in the interests of economy, or tear up  the

plans  or  destroy the preparations already  made.

Therefore,  it  is not much use referring  to  the

past. You must look to the future, and I can  only

assure   hon.  Members  that  these   bodies   are

operating  and will operate. I do not think  there

is  much use going on about extravagance until you

see  whether their operations do, in fact, produce

the economy and austerity which we are seeking  to

establish   as   the  standard  for   all   public

buildings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, my complaint is that, on

the whole, the Ministers have not been able so far

to  bring their will to bear upon the officers who

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



been  carrying  on their work in  the  usual  pre-election days.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Hear, hear! Fortify the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. We have had order

up to now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, in the case of this

item  under discussion, provision for 150  nurses,

we will just make the case very simple so that the

man-in-the-street can understand  it.  Suppose  we

buy a three-bedroom house, and it is available  in

many  housing estates at about $12,000. So if  you

are  going to provide for 150 nurses, you will buy

25  such houses. You will have two persons to each

room,  with  a  dining room and a kitchen  all  of

their  own  and  a little lawn in front,  and  the

whole thing costs just $300,000. Thus you have new

buildings, and added on to that you will have free

land;  whereas here you are pulling down your  old

hostel,  probably tearing it to pieces,  and  then

reconstructing  it  at the same cost - old  building

and no increase of land. You are suffering a loss.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Much as one likes the idea of the

nurses  and  their dining rooms and  their  little

lawn so that they can play badminton or have a tea-party,  one  must  remember that  the  nurses  are

required  at the hospital and not on the  lawn  in

front  of their houses. They have to get from  the

little lawn to the hospital, which takes a certain

amount of time and is also going to cost money. If

the nurses are going to have their transport paid,

you  will find that you have put up your recurrent

expenditure  by a large sum. You can calculate  it

yourself - if  you  site your  nurses  in  Serangoon

Garden Estate or up in Thomson Road, you will  see

what  the cost would be, assuming, of course, that

by  that  time the transport strikes are over  and

the  nurses are able to get a bus. If not, you can

calculate  what  it would cost to come  by  pirate

taxi  or  what  it would cost you if you  provided

them  all with cars. I do not think, in fact,  you

can  arrive  at any permanent saving by dispersing

your  hospital staff all over the island in remote

little building estates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I think the Minister for

Communications and Works is confusing  the  issue.

He  is bringing his class-room theories into  this

debate. What my learned Friend here means is  that

he is comparing the costs, not the conveniences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am sorry to keep rising in these

matters!  Surely  the Member for Paya  Lebar  does

appreciate  that  if  you  are  going  to  have  a

hospital,  it  should be sited in  the  centre  of

population;  land in the centre of  population  is

scarce,  and you cannot therefore build a  lot  of

small  houses with vacant land around them.  In  a

site  where there is no land, you have to build  a

multi-storey  hospital of the type where  you  can

house  a  lot  of  people in  a  small  area.  The

alternative  is  to build your  hospital  in  some

place  where  there  is  no  population,  and,  of

course, you will still be unhappy because the sick

people  have to travel a long way to  get  to  the

hospital. There is really no simple answer to  it.

The  thing is that you must have your nurses  near

your  hospital as a practical necessity.  You  may

have some living out, of course, but you must have

your  hospital in a populated area where it serves

the  population and consequently you must build  a

multi-storey type of structure normally.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> The Minister for

Communications and Works is so concerned about his

nurses that he cannot think away from his hospital

and  his nurses. We are asking him to look  at  it

from  the  point of view of comparative  costs  of

building.  For  the  amount  of  money  spent   on

conversion here, he can buy 25 or even 30  houses.

We  are not, of course, saying that he must do it.

It  can  be done in another case. It just  happens

that the argument arises out of accommodation  for

nurses, and I must ask him to think of it from the

point of view of arithmetic and not nurses.

for  the  male  and female nurses  at  Woodbridge

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I did not take it in that

light,  but  as I have been speaking so forcefully

on  this point, I want to assure the House that  I

have  not  made  any  profit out  of  my  low-cost

housing ideas. I admit that I have built a hundred

odd houses in Singapore. They range from $6,000 to

$12,000 and they have been all sold. I have worked

on  a  return of 6 per cent, which is  the  actual

rate that we have to pay the bank for interest.  I

have  also designed low-cost housing which can  be

built  for  $3,000 on swamp land, which I  believe

the  Hon. the Chief Minister has seen and admired.

I  have  also during my election days - call  it  an

election stunt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



if  you  like - helped  to build  a  five  classroom

school for $15,000 on swampy land. I hesitated  to

tell that to any of the Ministers, but now that  I

have  my  position clear that I am not making  any

profit out of this, I can show it to them. Anybody

can have my plans and my ideas, but do not ask  me

to  build  them as I prefer not to do any low-cost

housing. I can now speak with a clear conscience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here we have an item of $4 millions for

quarters  for  Government officers.  It  has  been

revised  from  an estimate of $3 millions,  and  I

shall have to ask why this increase has been made.

I   admit  that  since  the  introduction  of  the

Provident Fund and the strikes, costs have gone up

about  5 per cent but not to the extent of 25  per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, another point I wish to make is that I do

not think it is necessary today to provide housing

for  Division I or Division II senior officers.  I

notice in the Estimates that the cost for each  of

these officers comes to about $45,000 for quarters

and  about  $35,000 for flats. It has come  to  my

knowledge   that  future  senior   officers,   who

undoubtedly due to the Malayanisation scheme  will

be  Malayan  officers and who will be using  these

quarters, would prefer, if possible, to buy  their

own  homes  on the hire-purchase system helped  by

the  allowance  which  they are  getting  for  not

having Government quarters, and I think this is  a

very  sensible plan. Why lock up all this  capital

on  something which the Government servants prefer

to  own  themselves? If he buys one house now  and

pays on instalments, the house will be his in  ten

years  time,  and when he retires he will  have  a

roof over his head. What I do maintain is that all

the  money that can be saved from the quarters for

this  class  of officers should be  spent  on  the

lower income group many of whom unfortunately will

not  be able to buy their own homes, no matter how

cheap  they are, unless Government is prepared  to

allow them to buy without payment of interest.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> In the 1955 Estimates, Sir, $3

millions  was  entered  as the  cost  of  building

quarters for Government officers, and I think  the

Estimates  of  that year said $1.55  millions  had

been spent, another $700,000 had been provided and

$500,000  was revoted. In 1956 the cost  has  been

increased  to  $4 millions and the figure  in  the

"Amount  estimated  to be spent"  column  is  $2.2

millions. The figure in the "New Provision" column

is  $1  million, and in the second last column  of

the  Estimates  you  have  $750,000  required   to

complete.  Since  the start  of  the  scheme,  the

following quarters have been built:

<pre>

  10 quarters have been built in Mount Pleasant:



  3 blocks  of  flats  have been built  in  Leonie

    Hill; that is 30 quarters altogether:



  2 more  blocks  of  flats, that is,  another  20

    quarters,   are  being  constructed   at   the

    moment.

</pre>

<br>Of  the  $1  million provided  this  year,  it  is

estimated  that  $750,000  will  be  required   to

complete  the two blocks of flats which  are  now

under  construction. That will leave  $250,000  to

make  a start, as was intended, on a further block

of  flats  for  senior officers,  there  being  at

present  approximately 30 officers on the  waiting

list  for houses. 23 officers are living in rented

quarters,  the  rents being paid from  the  Rental

Vote,   and   16   bachelors   are   without   any

accommodation  at all. Now, that waiting  list  is

the  justification  for this additional  block  of

flats,  which  we did envisage. If,  however,  the

result   of   the  Report  of  the  Malayanisation

Commission  necessitates a revision of our  plans,

then,  of  course,  we will undertake  a  revision

forthwith.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of the $1 million provision made this year,

$750,000,  as far as we can estimate, is  required

to  complete  work in hand at the moment  and  the

other $250,000 is a possible saving, having regard

to   the   result   of   the   findings   of   the

Malayanisation Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> There are one or two points that

might be usefully added to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>

the  excellent  summary  of  my  hon.  Friend  the

Financial Secretary. In view of the expectation of

Malayanisation, these new quarters are being built

with  provision for three bedrooms on the  grounds

that  when local officers inhabit them,  they  are

very  likely  to have more dependants because  the

senior  expatriate  officer  tends  to  have   his

children  overseas or his wife overseas  and  does

not  have the same need for bedrooms as a man  who

may  possibly  have his father and his  mother  or

other  relatives, or perhaps a larger family  than

expatriate officers manage to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised about people owning their own

quarters  or houses is an interesting one,  but  I

would   point  out  that  there  is  no   absolute

impossibility  for a man to own a flat.  In  fact,

this question is under consideration and if in the

future the officers say, "We would like to own our

accommodation  instead of just living  in  it,  so

that when we retire we can continue to live in the

same  flat",  I  have no doubt that this  Assembly

could  discuss it and make it possible for  people

to buy a flat in a block if they want to. There is

also  this point, that if you are going to scatter

your  Government servants all over the  island  in

privately-owned houses, you do by that reduce  the

amount  of  available sites for the non-Government

builders  and  the private citizen. It  is  highly

desirable  to  economise  on  space  as  much   as

possible  because  ordinary  citizens  cannot  get

together into a kongsi and build a block of flats.

When  one  man buys one house, the State buildings

will  cover lots of extra ground, for each  is  in

effect  one section of a flat building and  it  is

lying  on the ground instead of being on a  fourth

storey.  A  private citizen has to  work  on  that

basis.  The Government has the financial resources

and the planning ability to provide multi-storeyed

buildings  in  which  a  lot  of  people  can  get

accommodation,  and there is a  definite  economic

advantage to the territory as a whole if  you  can

reduce  the pressure on building sites  by  having

multi-storeyed accommodation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my real reason for having brought up this

motion is because there is one word at the head of

the  accounts  which I could not understand.  That

word   is   "Development".  I  take  it  that   by

"improvements", it means the making of an  already

good thing look better?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sixty years of my life, I have covered

almost  every piece of Crown land in  my  and  the

surrounding  districts. I have so far  never  come

across  any  work  done which  can  be  called  an

improvement  to any Crown land. I wonder  what  is

there  to be improved on any Crown land. If  I  am

not mistaken, I think every piece of Crown land is

being  rented out and if improvement is needed  on

the  Crown land, that should be the responsibility

of   the   tenant  or  the  licensee.  Why  should

Government "carry the baby"? So I would  like  the

rather  similar  to that by which the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) earlier yesterday

confused  an Executive Engineer with an Electrical

Engineer,  I  confused earlier today "Improvements

to Crown Lands" with "Minor Works Unforeseen" and I

am afraid I gave to the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr

Lim  Koon  Teck) the answer which should now  have

been given to the Member for Changi -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> You have not done your

homework!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It was purely a matter of

inattention.  I  was looking at a  different  item

under  that  Head  and I did  not  listen  to  his

opening remark. If he wants the information  which

I should have given him if I had been on the spot,

he  is  very  welcome to it. It was,  in  fact,  I

think,  given by my friend the Hon. the  Financial

Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This improvement to Crown lands - as I have

actually said before and I will repeat it again - is

preparation of Crown lands whether for building or

other purposes on swampy areas like Kolam Ayer.  I

have  mentioned this morning that we have there  a

large civil defence area and some of the ground is

still  swampy and not, in fact, serviceable  until

it has been filled up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this provision will enable us to fill it

up.  Also you have to fill up areas where you want

time  for  the earth to settle. You do  not  build

immediately  you  fill. You have  got  to  let  it

consolidate and then you will have another look at

it to see if you want to put in some more perhaps.

Before  the building programme can start, you  may

have  to fill up for a considerable period beforehand  in  order to make sure that your  earth  has

consolidated before you put in anything on top. It

is  not  for  large schemes but for  comparatively

small  works where there are no appropriate  funds

elsewhere.  I  can go on with more detail  if  you

like. In Bukit Panjang such a case has occurred. I

do not think I need expatiate on this.

particular areas that he has in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to spend $200,000 on repairs

to the Secretariat building. I quite agree that we

should  upkeep our public buildings  in  a  manner

that  would reflect the dignity of Singapore,  but

instead  of  spending such a huge sum  on  an  old

building just to give it a facelift, I think it is

better  that we spend this amount to build one  or

two schools. We are told that we are very short of

schools,  and  to  build  schools  we  must   have

sufficient funds. I understand that Government has

a  plan  to  build  a  new Secretariat  along  the

Esplanade.  If  that is so, I  think  it  is  very

unwise  to  spend $200,000 to repair  the  present

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, we now

come  to a very small item of $15,000 for lighting

and I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $15,000 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of  item  12, Street  Lighting,  Goodwood

Hill, on page 22 of the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier on during the Second Reading of

this   Bill,  the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary

indicated to us that this development is necessary

because we are now trying to change over from  gas

lighting  to  electric  lighting.  I  am  of   the

opinion,  Sir,  that  this area  is  one  occupied

mainly  by the upper bracket of the civil service.

I  am also of the opinion that the people involved

are not many. In fact, I think they are fewer than

in  other areas that have similar claims, so  that

if  we  think  that  we are  going  to  give  such

amenities to people in the higher bracket, then we

must  also  think of people who are in  the  lower

bracket. They are more numerous in number and such

sums  of money will be put to better use when many

people  share it. The operative word  now  is  not

just "services" but "service to the largest number

of people involved".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if the Government is informing the House

that  it  is because we are to change the lighting

from  gas  to electricity, then I think  that  can

wait because it is not necessary. In fact, if  you

take  away  one  service by turning  off  the  gas

supply,  then  must you immediately  turn  on  the

electrical  supply?  Any  improvement  to   street

lighting should be considered also in the light of

traffic accidents. That area, I believe, is not  a

main  thoroughfare.  You do  not  have  many  cars

getting  in  and out. Again, that area  is  not  a

place whereby people go on foot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



or  on  bicycle late at night, and, as  far  as  I

know, whatever transport they use would be cars of

their  own, and if not cars of their own, at least

taxis.  Now, I suggest you shift to another area - I

think  you  can find another area - where  you  will

probably  find more people on foot or  on  bicycle

late  at  night and where the traffic is  heavier.

Then,  in  that  case, that claim for  improvement

would  be  more justified. I would  like  to  hear

further  what the Government have to say  on  this

point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Government has an obligation to

provide   street  lighting  in  the  areas   where

Government quarters are. At present, Goodwood Hill

is  lit  by gas. We have received notice from  the

City  Council that the gas supply will be  removed

by  the end of this year. By arrangement with  the

City  Council, however, we have agreed  with  them

that  the  gas supply will remain in  being  until

such time as we can replace it and until such time

as we can put money in the Estimates to replace it

with  electricity.  That is the  reason  for  this

vote.  To  leave Goodwood Hill unlit, we would  be

failing  in responsibility in respect of areas  in

which Government quarters are situated.

is not torn up and electricity supplied.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,

respect  of  item 15, Electric Cookers  and  Water

Heaters  for  Quarters in Government Institutions,

on page 22 of the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the first instance, I do not see that

any  money was voted for this item for this year's

Estimates and I presume that this is a new  scheme

for  the  purchase  of electrical  appliances  for

quarters



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



in Government institutions. If that is so, I would

suggest that it would be far more to the advantage

of  the Government to have these appliances  hired

from  the  City  Council. From  my  own  practical

experience, I feel that it is far more  economical

to hire such appliances rather than purchase them,

and I will quote an example.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum price for an electric fan would cost

$120.   It   would  cost  another  $40   for   the

installation  of  this fan, which  makes  a  total

value of $160. The maximum life of this fan would,

I  presume, be ten years, which makes $160 divided

by  ten  which is $16 per year. Now, I have worked

it  out  on  this $16 that it would be cheaper  to

hire  a fan from the City Council because it would

cost  only $1, whereas it costs roughly $1.50  for

the  purchase  of this fan. Apart from  the  money

saved, I think it is a good gesture on the part of

the  Government to co-operate and  support  the

City Council to help them push their appliances so

that  more could be used by consumers. I must make

it  clear  that I am not speaking here as  a  City

Councillor, because I have no interest in the City

Council  at  all except as a Member  of  the  City

Council.  I  am speaking here in the interests  of

economy so that Government can save more money.

right  on  the beam, but unfortunately he  himself

and  the  other personalities of the City  Council

are the persons to blame.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that the Government buys electric

current  at bulk rates from the City Council.  The

rate,  I  think, is six cents per unit as  against

17½  cents that the public pay. Consequently,  the

City  Council says, "I am selling this in bulk  to

you  and  I  am not going to give you any  service

with it. If you want meters for individual houses,

you  have to buy your own meters. If you  want  to

have  fans,  you have to provide your  own  fans."

They  will  not, in fact, rent us  their  fans  or

their  cookers or their refrigerators or  whatever

it is that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



want to rent. They refuse to let us have them, and

I wish that the hon. Member could convince them - it

is  now rather too late, I am afraid. That is  the

situation,  that these appliances  are  not  being

bought to donate to Government quarters. They will

be  treated  in the same way as the  City  Council

appliances  are.  They will be hired  out  to  the

occupants  and  the  money,  in  fact,   will   be

recoverable.   It  is,  in  short,  a   commercial

transaction  which the Government is carrying  out

on  a small scale as compared to the big scale  in

which   the   City  Council  operates   the   same

provisions. I hope that adequately deals with  the

point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think

the  answer is satisfactory to me but I am  really

surprised  that the City Council has  ever  turned

down Government's application for the hire of fans

or  any other electrical appliances. As far  as  I

know,  the  City  Council is trying  to  encourage

people  to hire such appliances. As an example,  I

quote  the  recent Trade Fair in the  Happy  World

where  the  City Council demonstrated a number  of

electrical appliances. They even put on  staff  to

demonstrate, to encourage and to show people  that

it  is far more economical to hire appliances, and

it  is  therefore a real surprise not only  to  me

but, I am sure, to many other City Councillors who

are  sitting  in this House that the City  Council

have turned down Government's application for  the

hire of their appliances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $130,050 for Head D 56 stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, when I

look  at  development under Social Welfare,  I  am

always interested. Under that Head, I look at item

6 - Youth  Holiday Camps. The estimated cost  I  can

see  here  is $200,000 but the total allocated  is

$10.  I  would  like an assurance from  Government

that Youth Holiday Camps are important. So far  as

Singapore is concerned, we can only boast of:

<pre>

 1. The Tanah Merah Youth Camp.

 2. The Lim Chu Kang Boy Scouts Camp.

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, you consider the number of boys and

girls who would like to go out camping but who  do

not belong to any organised movement, then you can

see  that the need is very real. I consider  that,

for  the  health  of  the coming  generation,  for

developing  a  sense of co-operation amongst  them

and  developing  their ability to organise  things

themselves, youth camps should be dotted all  over

Singapore and where you can, by the sea,  so  that

it will serve as an added amenity to youth.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On item 2 - Community Centres - we are budgeting for

three  at $450,000 and a token vote of $10 is  put

down.  Community  centres,  I  believe,  would  be

helpful   to   a  community  that  is  well-welded

together,  but  from what I can  see  of  so  many

centres, a great deal more work has to be done.  A

start   must   be   made  to   develop   community

consciousness amongst groups of people staying  in

specified  areas.  Usually, the centres  built  by

Government are far away from such habitations  and

people  do not find it convenient to make  use  of

them.  I  would  like  the  Government  rather  to

consider  the feasibility not of building  centres

all on its own but of making small grants of, say,

between  $10,000 and $20,000 to assist communities

to build their own centres. In that manner, when a

community works for the building of that centre, I

believe they will be proud of it and they will run

it even more efficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the point raised by the hon. Member

<br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move

the motion which stands in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House considers it in the best

interests   of  the  country  that  all  political

parties  in  the Assembly should meet  the  M.C.P.

representatives  to discuss a peaceful  settlement

of  the  Emergency  in order to  bring  peace  and

constitutional progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no one, sitting in this

Assembly  for  the last five days, would  imagine

that  there is a revolution going on in Malaya  at

this  very  moment,  a revolution  which  has  had

violent ups and downs for the last eight years. At

no  time during these eight years, Sir, has a more

favourable  moment  been  reached  to  discuss   a

peaceful settlement of the Emergency than now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three strong forces today in

Malaya - Colonialism,  Communism,  and  Nationalism.

The  first two are supported by armed forces.  The

British  have  the  Army, the Navy,  and  the  Air

Force.  The  Communists have what they call  their

Malayan   People's  Liberation  Army.   Only   the

nationalists have no armies or other armed  might.

The  British are supported by all those  who  have

made comfortable niches for themselves within  the

existing colonial system - people who fear a  sudden

change  because  it might upset their  comfortable

homes,  their  comfortable  businesses  and  their

comfortable lives. The Communists have the support

of  a good number of squatters and labourers,  and

they  have working amongst these masses,  men  who

believe that Communism is the answer to the social

and economic ills of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the large mass of the people of this country

are  nationalists.  They have  learnt  to  hate  a

colonial  Malaya because it has degraded them  and

lost  them  their self-respect. It has  not  given

them  a  world  in which they can  live  as  self-respecting human beings in a peaceful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



and happy society, where the wealth of the country

is  developed for the benefit of the people of the

country and not for the benefit of those who,  for

reasons  of  military might, have taken  political

control  of this territory. Unlike the Communists,

this  large group has no fixed, definite ideas  of

what  they want to do with an independent  Malaya.

They are large amorphous forces. Some believe that

the  answer lies in a militant Malayan nationalism

around which they can rally all the forces in this

country -  the masses that we have heard spoken  of

so  often  even in this Assembly. Most respectable

and  conservative Members have, all of  a  sudden,

come  to  realise that it is the masses  who  will

decide  whether this country survives,  after  the

period   of   colonial  rule  is   over,   as   an

independent, democratic Malaya, or as a  Communist

Malaya.  Some  favour  a  broadly-based  Socialist

Malaya, democratic and tolerant of other political

ideals and political ideas, based somewhat on  the

Indian  Nationalist  movement  which  solved   the

colonial problems in India.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last eight years, the armed fight

against  colonialism has been led by  the  Malayan

Communist  Party. In that fight, the British  have

tried  to  rally the people on what they call  the

side  of  law and order. Successive Generals  have

always said that if only they could get the people

to  give  them  information and help,  they  could

squash this Emergency in a matter of months.  They

have  not  squashed this Emergency in a matter  of

eight years. So long as the people feel that  this

is  not  their war, that this is a fight, not  for

them  but  for colonialism, they will not  lift  a

finger.   Even  if  there  were  no   threat,   no

intimidation,  no reprisals from  the  Communists,

they  would  still not bestir themselves  for  one

side  or  the other, because most ordinary  people

like  to  play safe. Even in this little Assembly,

we  see  so very often, when decisions are  taken,

how  Members in this Assembly play safe, and  most

of the people in Malaya are that way inclined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have reached the crossroads. A phase

has passed or is passing. There is a stalemate  in

this war.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



The  Communists  cannot establish their  Communist

Malaya.  The  British have declared no  fixed  and

definite  policy.  They have vaguely  referred  to

their  intentions  of  self-government  ultimately

within  the  British  Commonwealth.  It  has   not

captured  anybody's imagination. Nobody  has  been

stirred  by  these  words.  The  position  in  the

constitutional field is very fluid, more fluid  in

Singapore  than  it  is  in  the  Federation.  The

difference, however, is not as great as one  would

imagine   if   one  just  compared  the   external

manifestations  in the last few months  after  the

elections. Singapore has gone through a period  of

stress, turmoil,  strikes  and   lockouts.   The

Federation has been relatively calm. This may lead

some  people  to  believe that conditions  in  the

Federation  are  completely different  from  those

existing  in  Singapore. I find  it  difficult  to

subscribe to this view, for the simple reason that

if  the  basic  discontents were  not  there,  the

Malayan  Communist Party could not have  survived.

The  basic  conditions  for  discontent  have  not

manifested  themselves openly in  civil  commotion

because  of  military  suppression  and   a   more

militant armed administration. But, I believe  the

Federation is by and large in the same position as

the Colony of Singapore, with this one difference.

The  ratio of population between the native  races

of  Singapore and the Federation perhaps makes the

balance  in the Federation more in favour of  slow

progress - not     revolutionary    progress     but

evolutionary - because, by and  large,  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman   and   large,   U.M.N.O. movement   have

inculcated,  or perhaps they have just  expressed,

the   innate   inclinations  of  the  Malays   for

evolutionary progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists, on the other hand, realise that

the  internal  and international position  of  the

country  has  changed since Geneva. The  theme  is

peaceful co-existence. Since Bandung, the emphasis

in South-East Asia has been peaceful co-existence.

No  one  wants to precipitate a third  world  war.

Everyone  wants time to consolidate, perhaps  for

peace, perhaps for some

eventual conflict which might burn up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



the  whole world. That is beyond us and we  cannot

worry  ourselves  with that. But  it  affects  the

policy  of the Malayan Communist Party in  Malaya.

They  cannot completely ignore the fact  that  the

line  today throughout the whole world is peaceful

co-existence,  not the existence  of  one  to  the

exclusion of the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaya, with the elections in April in

Singapore  and  in  July in  the  Federation,  the

constitutional field entered into a new  phase.  For

the  first time, there were wide popular elections

which  has  thrown up in its first flush  a  great

deal   of   wild,   irresponsible  talk - and   this

particularly  from  the business  communities - that

the country is going to pieces and that the people

are  not  ready for this independence even  in  an

attenuated  version and that, in  fact,  it  would

only  lead to chaos. But it has opened up a  phase

which the Communists cannot ignore. It means  that

the  constitutional  struggle  may  yield  further

results.  It  means that if an armed  conflict  is

persisted  in  willy-nilly,  regardless   of   the

constitutional position and the political  parties

representing the people constitutionally,  a  very

difficult position may arise for them at  a  later

stage.  Hence, at a dramatic moment  on  May  1st,

Labour Day, the first peace offer was made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to those of us who have not faced this

problem as closely and as acutely as I have  faced

it - and  I have faced it because I have not  wasted

my  time  talking about footling things and  doing

the  silly  things  which some  political  parties

which  existed in the period of the vacuum between

1948  and  1954  did - it is an  enormous  problem.

Enormous because in Malaya, Communism came  before

nationalism.  Enormous because  in  those  32  odd

years    since   the   Malayan   Communist   Party

established  itself  in Malaya,  it  has  actively

preached  its  philosophy  as  an  answer  to  the

political, economic and social injustices of which

there  were plenty, and of which there  are  still

plenty  in  Malaya. The large mass of the  people,

although  they hate the political injustices,  the

poverty, the social and economic injustices are ap-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



prehensive of the rigours and the discipline which

a  Communist Malaya would impose. But if they  are

faced  with  the alternative of a continuation  of

the  colonial system, however streamlined,  and  a

Communist  Malaya, which is going to be  effective

and honest even if it is rigid and disciplined and

illiberal, I fear that a large mass of the people,

who  have  not  the time to bother  about  liberal

concepts of the freedom of the individual - liberty,

freedom  from arrest without trial, the  right  of

free  speech - because they are too preoccupied with

making a living, would choose Communism. For them,

it   does   not  matter  what  it  is.  Communism,

Nationalism, and Fascism mean nothing to the  vast

masses  who  are in such a state of  poverty  that

nothing  makes any meaning except more food,  more

clothes, a house and a better life. It is in  that

perspective, that the problem of the Emergency  is

not  one  of  shooting and killing a few  thousand

Communists that I speak on my motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Chief Minister, despite his faults, is not an

unintelligent man. In fact, no less a person  than

the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Colonies  has

proclaimed  him  a highly intelligent  individual!

And  I  must  be careful not to differ  from  that

opinion.  I think he realises today, what  he  did

not  realise  at  the time when he  first  entered

politics,  and  when  he first  became  the  Chief

Minister, that the problem is not just a  question

of passing legislation - 44-hour working week to 42-hour  working week to 40-hour working week; fixing

a minimum wage; making speeches to trade unions at

trade  union  rallies.  The  problem  is  one   of

convincing  the  people that a particular  way  of

life  can not only bring economic relief  but  can

also introduce into the country a liberal form  of

human  society which we believe we should  try  to

establish in this country. But where I differ from

the  Hon. the Chief Minister is that he  believes

that Communism is absolutely evil - he hates it,  he

hates  every aspect of it, and he would fight  it.

He  would  support colonialism; he  would  support

capitalism;  he  would support anything  to  fight

Communism. I do not support that view because I do

not believe that it is a simple question of black



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



and  white.  I  have  been a  bit  longer  in  the

political milieu of the country than the Hon. the

Chief  Minister, and I can claim  to  be  able  to

understand,  perhaps more than he can,  the  other

point  of  view - the point of view of a  man  or  a

group  of  men in this society completely excluded

from   the  system - bitter  and  hostile,   feeling

emotionally  hostile enough to engage  in  violent

revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Hon. the Chief Minister spoke of this

lovely  island  of  ours and  when  the  hon.  Mr

Sutherland  was quick to interject and  remind  us

that  it is all man-made, I often wondered if they

would  say  it was a lovely island if they  had  a

little  shanty of a shack in Trafalgar Street,  to

which  the Hon. the Minister for Local Government,

Lands  and  Housing has often gone  with  me.  One

little  room  for bedroom, an outdoor  kitchen,  a

communal  bathroom. There one lives, eats,  sleeps

and dies - in filth and in squalor. They work in the

Singapore Harbour Board, which supplies them  with

electricity  at  night, and  sometimes  on  public

holidays  in  the  day-time.  When  there  is   no

electricity  on  a public holiday like  Deepavali,

they look for their elected representative to make

representations to get electricity for them. Those

are  the  small mercies they look for out of  this

constitution. The Minister for Housing and I  have

been  down  there together many a  time  and  have

looked   at  the  higgledy-piggledy  houses,   the

barracks, the squalor, the slum. We give them  our

sympathy, we make promises, but nothing  has  been

done  and  nothing is likely to  be  done  in  the

coming  year. There is no provision for it in  the

Estimates.  And we are asking them to  believe  in

democracy, to believe that the process of  putting

a  mark  on  a  piece of ballot paper  within  the

constitution of this Colony can bring  relief.  It

is  because I understand that side of the  problem

that  I  do  not  agree with the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister in his violently anti-Communist stand.  I

cannot  in  all  honesty say that Communism  is  a

diabolical  evil,  because I can  imagine  certain

human societies where it was a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>



great  relief  to have the Communists  displace  a

ruling   power.  That  is  another  of  the   very

difficult  problems we face in  this  country.  To

some 600 million Chinese, that philosophy was  the

answer  and is the answer to a decadent, a corrupt

and  an evil society which has become evil because

men  have  lost their self-respect and lost  their

values.  But  I do not believe however  that  they

want  to  see in Malaya a similar dictatorship  of

the  proletariat or dictatorship of the  Communist

Party. If I did believe that, then perhaps I would

retire  from politics and go and plant vegetables,

for that would be the most innocuous thing that  I

would  do  in a Communist Malaya. But at the  same

time,  as long as the fight in Malaya is a  three-cornered one between the British, the Nationalists

and  the  Communists, there is with every  passing

day, a drift away from an independent, democratic,

non-Communist  Malaya.  Sometimes  people  do  not

believe  what I say because they do  not  want  to

believe it, because they do not want to be  shaken

out  of  their  complacency  and  the  comfortable

little  niches  they have made for  themselves  in

this society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible at any peace talks to take

the  line  that  the Hon. the Chief  Minister  has

taken - that if we have Communism in Malaya, then we

shall die; that we live because we are part of the

free  world;  that  we live because  we  sell  our

service  to the free world; that if the Communists

take  over,  we  will  die  and  we  will  starve.

Therefore, he appeals to their sense of logic  and

decency,  that they should not take over and  that

they should all pack up and go back to China,  and

those  of them who do not wish to go back to China

can   be  detained  in  some  rehabilitation   and

corrective training camp. I do not think those who

have  spent  eight  years, nine  years,  sometimes

more,  as anonymous revolutionaries, giving  their

lives,  dedicating it to a revolution  which  they

believe is the answer to the evils of our society,

can  be  persuaded to believe that  it  will  kill

Singapore. I do not think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



one  could  reach  a settlement with  the  Malayan

Communist  Party if one postulates for  all  time,

"You can never take part in the political life  of

this country. You can never preach your creed. You

are  forever  proscribed." A  settlement  on  that

basis can never be reached. I may be wrong, but  I

do  believe that a settlement could be reached  in

which  the  immediate object  of  an  independent,

democratic,   non-Communist   Malaya   could    be

achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no one can say for all time

that Malaya is to be Communist, anti-Communist, or

non-Communist. No one would be foolish  enough  to

do  so.  The future is determined by many  factors

beyond  our  control. There are three  factors  in

this  political  set-up - political,  economic   and

social. The political urge in postwar Malaya is to

get  rid  of  the British; to get rid  of  foreign

rule, in any shape, in any form; to get rid of any

reminder, any of the trappings that remind us that

we  are  a  subject race, that remind us that  the

last  word is with the British Government, through

its  government, through its civil  servants,  not

through   the  people's  elected  representatives.

These  were  the  three urges in India,  Pakistan,

Ceylon,  Indonesia, and Burma. They have satisfied

the  first urge - the political urge. They have  got

rid  of  their foreign master and they are masters

in  their  own homes. They now face the other  two

urges - economic and social - poverty and  the  social

injustices of their own society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are Communist parties in every one of these

territories.  It  is  because  Communism  is   the

product  of social and economic circumstances.  It

is  a  solution which appeals to those who want  a

swift  and  radical  change  from  poverty,   from

misery, from social injustices. And it has worked.

It may yet work in South-East Asia - we do not know.

But it will definitely take over if India fails as

a  democracy,  if Burma fails as a  democracy,  if

Indonesia fails as a democracy. People lose  faith

in political movements and politi-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



cal philosophies  which

talk but do not produce results. Then nothing, not

S.E.A.T.O. nor the hydrogen bomb can prevent  the

Indian   people,  the  Indonesian  people,  freely

choosing - as  seven  odd million  Indonesians  have

already  freely  chosen - on the  ballot  paper  the

hammer  and  the sickle. For the vast majority  of

them, Communism does not mean concentration camps,

labour  camps  and  all  the  horrors  which   the

American, and lately the British, Press have  been

prone to publicize. They understand it through the

people  who work for Communism, generally  sincere

people who feel a deep and abiding compassion  for

their fellow human beings as much as the Hon. the

Chief Minister, but with this one difference: they

have  accepted a dogma. They have accepted  a  cut

and  dried solution, a discipline which says  that

that is the answer and it is the only answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not accepted that answer because I hope

that one could have not only all the economic  and

social  benefits  which  a Communist  society  can

produce,  but also the human benefits of spiritual

and  individual freedom - bourgeois ideas - but  ideas

and  concepts  in which I have been  indoctrinated

and in which I believe. I believe that whether  we

go   Communist  or  non-Communist  in  the  future

depends  on  whether  we can  build  up  a  clean,

healthy  political movement with clean and healthy

leaders,  men who believe in democracy and  social

justice  and who enter politics because they  want

to serve and not because they want to loot. If you

can  find  enough  such  men,  honest,  able,  and

prepared  to  work, you can fight  the  Communists

without  guns. If you cannot, then you  resort  to

S.E.A.T.O., to atom bombs and to hydrogen bombs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Britain, they do not need the hydrogen bomb,

nor  curfews,  nor  barbed  wires,  nor  detention

camps, because the three conditions for revolution

are not there. There is neither the political, the

economic,  nor the social urge. They do  not  hate

their rulers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



They do not feel an acute sense of injustice or of

poverty.  They  do  not feel that  the  system  is

unfair or unjust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister must realise that

anti-Communism  is  an entirely barren  philosophy

which can produce no results. I do not believe  in

it. If I have to choose between Communism and anti-Communism,  I  will choose Communism  because  the

other  is a barren, a negative philosophy. If  you

hate  something  because  you  do  not  like  some

aspects of it, you can work yourself into a  state

where anything said or done by the Communists must

be  wrong  and  evil.  I  have  taken  this  point

strongly because it is quite likely that my motion

may  not find favour with this House and only  the

Hon. the  Chief Minister may be present at  these

talks.  He  has told us that he is  going  as  the

Chief Minister. I had not meant to be facetious or

unkind  when I asked him what his mandate was.  We

have  a  right to know what he proposes to  do  at

these talks, for their outcome will affect us, not

just  him as the Chief Minister. He might have  to

resign  or  he  might have to  go  to  London  for

further consultation. But it will affect each  and

every  one  of  us in this Assembly  and  in  this

country.  The two other persons who are  going  to

these  miniature  summit talks have  got  definite

mandates.  Mr  Chin  Peng represents  a  definite

group.  He knows exactly what he is going  to  the

talks  for and he is going to bargain for as  good

conditions as he can possibly get, if he  can  get

them  from  the  Tunku in the Federation.  But  he

knows  exactly  what he is going  for.  He  is  no

amateur   politician.  He  is  no  lawyer   turned

politician.  He has become part of a revolutionary

movement - part  of a revolution. I  know  that  the

Hon. the  Minister for Communications  and  Works

wants to fight Communism. He does not bother about

understanding it. I am interested in understanding

it  because if you do not understand it, the  odds

are that you will never be able to fight it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tunku has also a definite mandate. He went

into the elections on it and won - 800,000 votes - his

platform  being that if he became Chief  Minister,

he was going to give an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



amnesty  and  settle the Emergency. He  has  since

said that he will go there and explain the amnesty

terms  and  he will also listen to what  Mr  Chin

Peng has to say on behalf of the Malayan Communist

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Chief Minister has said this morning

that  the  Chief Minister of the Federation  would

not  welcome my presence nor the presence of other

representatives from this Assembly. I have a great

regard,  Sir,  for  the  Chief  Minister  of   the

Federation. He is a modest, unassuming man who can

say, without  arrogance, that  he  represents  at

least some three million odd people of Malaya.  He

is  a  courteous man and I do not believe he would

have  used the words: "I would not welcome  either

Lee Kuan Yew or any Members of the Opposition."  I

should  hate to imagine that those were his  words

and  I  feel that the Hon. the Chief Minister  has

done him an injustice when he put that message  in

that particular form. He of all people understands

that this is not a question to be settled by Chief

Ministers.  This  is a question ultimately  to  be

resolved by the people of Malaya, which means,  in

effect,  by  those who have influence  over  large

masses  of the people of Malaya, by those who,  by

their  work  and their devotion to the welfare  of

the people, have that influence over the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore hope that before this debate is over,

the  Hon. the Chief Minister will tell us what  is

his  mandate for these talks. He has said that  he

is  going  there as Chief Minister at the  request

and  invitation  of  the  Chief  Minister  of  the

Federation. Surely he cannot expect us  to  accept

such   a   supercilious - perhaps  supercilious   is

unkind - but such a superficial reply? What  is  the

mandate?  What  are his terms of  reference?  What

does he propose to do?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have suggested in my

resolution  that all political Parties  should  be

represented  because  we in  Singapore  are  in  a

slightly  different position from the  Federation.

The  Tunku in the Federation can safely say to Mr

Chin  Peng,  "I  speak  for  the  people  of   the

Federation of Malaya." Fifty-one out of the fifty-two elected represent-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



tatives are members of the Alliance of which he is

the  titular and the real head. I do not mean this

as  a  slight to our Chief Minister, but the facts

of  the position in Singapore must be faced. I  do

not  think  the Hon. the Chief Minister  can  say,

from   a  position  of  strength  to  the  Malayan

Communist Party representative, that he speaks for

the  people of Singapore. He would be  in  a  much

better  position if he had with him  members  from

all  the political Parties. Then, we together  can

say,  "These are the terms which we feel are  fair

and just for the settlement of this country and we

speak for the people of Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister

took  pride  in  the  fact  that  it  was  he  who

suggested, when constitutional matters were to  be

settled  in  London, that "It is not a matter  for

the  Labour  Front.  The  Labour  Front  seeks  no

benefit from it, no kudos. It is not a matter  for

the  Alliance or the Coalition. It is  a  national

matter, one for all Parties, for all the people of

Singapore."  And it was he who told the  Secretary

of  State for the Colonies that he would  head  an

All-Party delegation to London to settle  an  all-Singapore  problem which he himself,  even  if  he

represents not only the Labour Front but also  the

Coalition, could not -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Would not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Would not. Mr Speaker, Sir, I

apologise  if  I  have given the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister any indication that I think he is  not  a

person  who  would respond to the House  with  the

highest  of  political  principles  and  political

motives. But I ask him seriously to consider  this

motion,  not  from  the point  of  view  of  Party

advantage - for I seek none in this motion - but  from

the   point  of  view  of  the  interests  of  his

Government and of the country, that he  should  go

with  representatives from the  other  Parties  so

that  he could then talk from a stronger position.

I  know there are other political Parties here who

are  alarmed at the prospect of having to  meet  a

Communist Secretary-General. They want to leave it

entirely  to Chief Ministers. In fact, I  remember

the nominal leader of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



Progressive Party saying in the Press that  if  we

all  went,  we  would increase  the  prestige  and

position  of  the representative from the  Malayan

Communist  Party.  I  do not  see  how  one  could

possibly  increase the prestige and reputation  of

the Malayan Communist Party representative. He  is

already   meeting  two  Chief  Ministers   as   an

equal - the Chief Minister of the Federation and the

Chief  Minister  of Singapore under  British  rule

meet  the  "Chief Minister" of both Singapore  and

the  Federation under Communist rule. I  think  we

would  do  much  better if we met  as  leaders  of

political   groups  in  the  Federation   and   in

Singapore, faced with a common problem. Let us not

suppose  that we can solve this thing by banishing

8,000 people to China. Let us not suppose that  we

can solve this thing by telling Mr Chin Peng, "If

you  bring  Communism  to Malaya,  then  we  shall

starve",  because he does not believe  it.  If  he

did,  he  would not have fought for  so  long.  He

believes that a Communist Malaya is going to be  a

prosperous and a happy Malaya where he is going to

solve  all  these economic injustices,  where  all

this nonsense of expatriate pay and upgrading  and

travelling allowances and entertainment allowances

will  be thrown into the limbo of the 'feudalistic

medieval past'. And by God I believe he would in a

very  short  time. And I would cheer him  when  he

does  that, because they are parts of the  present

which I hate, and I would like to see them part of

the forgotten past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore move that we record our belief that

it  is in the best interests of this country if we

meet  as  political leaders to settle a  political

problem  in Malaya. We cannot concede a  Communist

Malaya  at  these  talks, nor can  Mr  Chin  Peng

concede  an anti-Communist Malaya at these  talks.

Even so great and respectable a man as Mr Anthony

Eden,  Prime Minister of Britain, came on the  air

over  Radio Malaya and said, "We must find  a  way

out."  I  believe, if we are prepared to work,  to

remove the economic and social injustices in  this

country,  then we need not be afraid  that  Malaya

will  go under. But if we are not prepared to work

and if we want to preserve all the privileges and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



all  the  inequalities existing  today,  then,  of

course, we shall have to go back and put all kinds

of  prohibitions  which will cause  the  talks  to

fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all want peace in Malaya. We

are  sick  of  the Emergency. We are sick  of  the

enormous expense that this struggle has cost us in

schools and hospitals, in social services  and  in

development. For the fight to continue, if it  can

be  resolved, would be a folly. That is not to say

that  one should resolve the fight, in order  that

we  can  lose it in some other way. But  we  could

resolve  this Emergency and fight, not with  guns,

but  with ideas. It is a battle of convictions,  a

battle  for minds, a battle for a way of life.  If

you  can  find  the  people who  can  resolve  the

economic  and  social injustices of  this  country

better than the Malayan Communist Party can,  then

you need never be afraid that you cannot build  an

independent, democratic, non-Communist Malaya. And

it is with that uppermost in our minds that an All-Party  delegation should sit down  with  Mr  Chin

Peng and discuss the problems which confront us.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member has not

given way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am sorry, Sir.

that Members on the opposite Benches, particularly

those  holding  Ministerial  office,  should   not

indulge in the sort of ribaldry which will wind up

in  fisticuffs  in this House, like  the  Japanese

Diet?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not really a point of order.

It  is  a point of behaviour. Inche Ahmad,  please

continue.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I

have  said  just  now,  as an Independent  Member,

there can be no question of me or any of the other

Independents in this House being on the  All-Party

delegation to the peace talks or any other  talks.

But  it  seems  to  be one of the  most  important

things  on  which both sides of this House  should

act jointly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elections showed conclusively that the people

of  this  country  are fed up with  the  Emergency

rules.  They  are  fed  up with  the  restrictions

forced  on  them.  They want  peace  and  so  they

repudiated   the  Progressives  and   others   who

supported a war which can only benefit a  colonial

power. The first act to end colonialism is to make

the  peace offer succeed. Should it fail, we would

offer  the  British  a justification  to  continue

ruling us. All of us are agreed, and I should  say

all  the  Malayans in this House are agreed,  that

colonialism  must  be ended. The  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  has  a unanimous mandate  for  this.  In

carrying  out this mandate, the London  talks  are

only  part  of and not the whole thing. The  peace

talks are also an important part. If the Hon. the

Chief Minister thinks that it is important to have

an  All-Party delegation for the London  talks,  I

think that it is almost equally important to  have

an All-Party delegation to the peace talks too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Mr Speaker, Sir, the talks involve the

future  of  this  country. It is  too  much  of  a

responsibility  to be taken on by  the  Government

with its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



very  small  majority. On the issues involved  at

these peace talks, Sir, the people of this country

should talk with one voice. Therefore, it is  only

right  that the delegation to be led by  the  Hon.

the Chief Minister must compose of representatives

from  both sides of the House. The Government must

not forget that, should the talks fail, it will be

held  responsible by the people of  Singapore  for

having   sabotaged  the  anti-colonial   struggle.

Therefore, not only in the interest of the  people

but  in  the interest of the Labour Front,  it  is

advisable for the Hon. the Chief Minister to  lead

an All-Party delegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

that,  in the annals of this young Assembly,  this

is  a  day  which should be banded with  black  in

mourning - in  mourning for the fact  that  we  have

before us a motion which, if there were Communists

in  the  Assembly,  they would not  only  take  no

exception  to, but they could find not one  single

word  to  differ  from. It is a motion  which  you

would  expect  an able Communist  to  propose.  It

suggests that, but for a peaceful settlement  with

the  Malayan  Communist Party, there could  be  no

constitutional crisis, no constitutional  progress -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Progress, yes. We had the

crisis already.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Yes -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is what -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The hon. Member is so full of

himself, so fearful of what he might meet that one

can appreciate his anxiety to interrupt the speech

and  the  train of thought of those  who  seek  to

answer  this  motion  which exalts  the  Communist

Party and their comrade Chin Peng.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I took the opportunity yesterday to draw

attention  to the composition of this  group  that

calls  itself  the People's Action  Party.  I  did

point  out  that there was one person, the  Member

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



Tanjong  Pagar,  who  was giving  an  umbrella  of

respectability,   an   umbrella   of    democratic

reasonableness to an amorphous organisation  whose

outside  activities can rarely meet the  light  of

day.  It is an organisation we have had to mention

and  deal with in this Assembly in connection with

the riots of May last. It is an organisation which

produces,  apart  from  the  hon.  Member  who  is

unquestionably an able, adept political manoeuvrer -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. I cannot have the

word   "manoeuvrer"  used  of  a  Member  of   the

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

withdraw  it, but I meant no disrespect. Shall  we

say  an  able politician who is aware of  and  has

instinct for making a political point?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say with respect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

I  wish  I  had  to the same extent  that  quality

without   in   any   way   derogating   from   the

intellectual integrity that I seek to maintain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this hon. Member, Sir, has seen fit, when he

finds  himself  faced with a fact which  bars  his

way,  to  pretend that it does not  exist  and  to

impute  to me a lack of integrity in reporting  to

this  Assembly  my  conversation  with  the  Chief

Minister  of  the Federation, Tunku Abdul  Rahman.

Since  he  wants the exact words, I am quite  sure

the  Tunku has nothing to hide, and though I  have

not  had  the opportunity to consult him, I  shall

inform hon. Members, as far as I can, of the exact

phraseology in which he indicated his position.  I

informed  him of the motion before the  House  and

asked him whether he would wish the leaders of the

Parties  in the Assembly, including the leader  of

the People's Action Party, to attend this proposed

meeting, and his answer was, "I do not want them."

Of  course, you may doubt me if you wish. It is so

easy -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You said "welcome" in the

morning.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Well "welcome". He would not

welcome your presence. He does not want you. Maybe

there is a distinction? [Interruption.] I beg your

pardon, Mr Speaker, Sir. The hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



Member can make it in his reply, but I would point

out   something  that  the  hon.  Member,  in  his

glorified attempt to save the country, forgot. The

Federation  is  not  governed  by  Singapore.  The

Federation has its own Government, and much as the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar would like to  ride  the

white  horse  to  victory in the name  of  Malaya,

Malaya today is led by Tunku Abdul Rahman - not  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I never suggested I was!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Much as the hon. Member

would  like to attend the meeting, need  I  remind

those  who,  having  achieved the  distinction  of

being  Members  of this Assembly,  of  the  normal

courtesies  of human intercourse? This meeting  is

being  arranged  by  the  Chief  Minister  of  the

Federation. It is part of his platform. It is  his

desire  to  meet this leader of a small  group  of

terrorists  in order to explain the terms  of  the

amnesty.  Appreciating that what might take  place

could affect our own interests, the Chief Minister

of  the  Federation has had the courtesy to invite

me,  as Chief Minister of Singapore, to be present

at  these talks. That this Assembly or any  Member

thereof should at any time seriously consider  the

question of forcing himself on this meeting  as  a

gate-crasher  is,  to my mind, something  that  is

beneath  the  concepts of anyone  with  any  self-respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been asked what is my mandate and what I

am  to  do. Sir, it has been repeatedly stated  by

the  Chief Minister of the Federation that  he  is

going to explain the terms of the amnesty to  Chin

Peng  and  that he would be prepared to listen  to

anything  that Chin Peng has to say. It  would  be

informative and helpful that I, as Chief  Minister

of Singapore, should be present at these talks.  I

have made it sufficiently clear that I am a junior

partner  in  this  venture. I  do  not  anticipate

taking  either a major or any vital  part  in  the

talks between the Tunku and this man, Chin Peng. I

can  but  regret the effort made in this House  to

seek to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



impose  ourselves  upon  the  hospitality  of  the

Federation in a manner which must deeply embarrass

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar, in a speech whose

like  I  had never hoped to hear in this  Assembly

glorifying  these so-called anti-colonial  forces,

has  suggested  summit talks  between  equal  men.

There is no such thing, Sir. The leader of a  band

who has been terrorising the country in parts has

been  asked  to  meet the Chief  Minister  of  the

Federation at the Chief Minister's convenience. It

has been suggested by the Member for Tanjong Pagar

that  it is for us to go there and have terms that

are  fair and just for settlement. Sir, if  it  is

the   wish   of  this  House  to  negotiate   with

Communists  for terms that are fair and  just  for

settlement, this House has every right to take its

own  initiative  to make its own arrangements  for

its   own   meeting  for  negotiations  with   the

Communists, but when to every man who can read, to

every   man  who  can  hear,  it  has  been   made

abundantly  clear  by the Chief  Minister  of  the

Federation   that   there  is   no   question   of

negotiations and for responsible Members  of  this

Assembly to seek to suggest, through this Assembly

to  the  country,  that that is all  eye-wash  and

that,  in fact, the Chief Minister and I are going

to  discuss terms fair and just for settlement is,

to  say the least, to embarrass very seriously our

good  and  close neighbours who are the  main,  in

fact,  the  principal sufferers from the terrorism

of  which the Member for Tanjong Pagar calls anti-colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He speaks of the basic conditions of discontent

which exist in the Federation and which will  find

their  outlet  in the same way that they  have  in

Singapore. I will say this to you, Sir, that in so

far   as  I  appreciate  the  conditions  in   the

Federation,  the  entire country,  free  from  the

equal of people like the Member for Tanjong Pagar,

have  learnt  to  respect and revere  their  Chief

Minister, have complete faith in his integrity, in

his sincerity, and in his ability to bring to them

the  political independence which they crave;  and

there  can be no question whatsoever of the people

of the Federation seeking to find an outlet for so-called discontent by joining



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>



these  gentlemen whom the Member for Tanjong Pagar

has  glorified to the summit of equality with  the

Governments of the Federation and Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been suggested by the hon. Member that to

deny  a  fair  settlement to  these  anti-colonial

forces, as he terms them, is to be a colonial. The

Member for Tanjong Pagar is not unread. He is  not

without  knowledge of the fact  that  perhaps  the

most   vicious  colonial  power  of  today  is   a

Communist  power - Russia. There is no  power  which

has  as many colonies and which controls them more

stringently than the people of Moscow.  He  speaks

of  the  Communists as being anti-colonial forces.

They  have battled arduously, admittedly. Many  of

them  believe  with sincerity in  their  doctrine,

unquestionably. Many of them are dedicated to  the

cause  of  Communism. That is perfectly true.  But

let  us recognise this fact: They are not fighting

colonialism. They are fighting for Communism which

is   a   worse  form  of  colonialism   than   the

colonialism   we  have  here  today.   We   cannot

sufficiently, Sir, recognise that fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that we have reached a

stalemate in a war of equals. I would remind  hon.

Members  that  if they are equals,  then  why  the

amnesty?  If  there are true nationalists  in  the

Communist group, they must recognise the fact that

since  these first few months, there has been  set

in  motion machinery which can, in truth, and,  in

fact,   achieve  the  nationalism  that  we  all - I

believe,  the honest and the dishonest - seek;  that

these  Communists who have used the cover of anti-colonialism  and nationalism now  stand  naked  in

their  true colours to a greater extent than  even

the  hon.  Member has shown his own  colours  this

afternoon.  These  Communists recognise  the  fact

that  today they are not fighting a colonial power

and  cannot pretend to. They are not fighting  for

nationalism  because  all their  bullets  and  all

their  arson  have not achieved it and,  in  fact,

other   forces  working  peacefully  through   the

democratic process have every legitimate rea-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>



son  for  believing  that the  democratic  process

will,  within  a  matter of a  few  months,  bring

concrete  and  definite evidence  of  early  self-government   and  independence.  Those   Communist

forces  in  the jungle, Sir, must be conscious  of

the  fact that to the public, they stand stripped.

They  stand, Sir, as obviously as anything visible

to  the  human eye as being not anti-colonial  but

anti-national. These Communist forces are  seeking

their own form of government and they always will,

in  the  same  way  that foreign ideology  through

Communism  is seeking the overthrow of the  Indian

Government,  and has sought the overthrow  through

violent means of the Burmese Government even  when

Burma  was  independent. These are  not  basically

nationalist forces. These are the forces that seek

the maintenance of only one ideology, and in order

to  maintain their camouflage, they recognise  that

now   that   their  activity  is  being  obviously

directed  against  the people's governments,  they

must  come  out  and  cease  these  activities  of

violence  which have brought no benefit  to  them,

which give them no hope of success whatsoever. Not

even the flamboyant imagination of the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  could conceive  of  the  Communist

forces  in  the  Federation achieving  victory  by

violence against the Tunku and the people  of  the

Federation. That is the stalemate in the  language

of  the  P.A.P. - a  complete  and  utter  loss,   a

complete and utter failure. An absolute necessity,

if  they  are  to achieve anything for  their  own

ideology,  is  that they should now put  down  the

rifle   and   take  up  the  poison  of   internal

subversion of which the hon. Member has far closer

acquaintance  than even I. That is  the  position,

Sir,  the so-called stalemate - an absolute  failure

of  the war as it is termed by the hon. Member, an

absolute  failure of violence by  rebels  who  now

wish  to  come  out, allegedly to pursue  peaceful

vocations, and let us hope that many of  them  are

sincere about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this Government fell in with the views of the

Chief  Minister of the Federation in  the  amnesty

was  just  this  one argument that there  are  and

there have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



been   in  this  country  men  of  integrity   and

sincerity, nationals to the very core,  who,  sick

of  the  colonialism  which tethered  them,  which

degraded  them,  unable  to  find  an  outlet  for

attack, took to this form of violence as the  only

means  of achieving that end. I do not think  that

number  is  very great, unfortunately,  because  I

think  that, having gone that way, they  soon  get

caught  in the web and they find it too difficult - the  weakness  of the human spirit and  the  human

flesh - to retract from a position on a point of  no

return. But there may well be some - and the amnesty

is  intended  for  them - but  in  considering  this

motion,  let  us remember a few basic home  truths

which  I  shall repeat. Singapore does not  govern

the  Federation. The revolt is in the  Federation,

not  in Singapore. The meeting is arranged by  the

Chief  Minister of the Federation. It  is  not  my

meeting  or  your meeting, Sir, or the meeting  of

any Member of this Assembly. I may be permitted to

attend, and I certainly am, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tunku has been indicated as a man who is the

soul  of  courtesy,  and he is  happy  to  certain

suggestions  that I make. But I do appreciate  the

decisions  taken  about the venue  and  about  the

arrangements. What the Tunku says at  the  meeting

is  entirely the decision of the Chief Minister of

the  Federation at which I have the  privilege  of

being  present.  That is the true position.  Those

who vote in favour of this motion vote to be gate-crashers, vote to give honour and glory to a group

that has murdered and burnt and destroyed, a group

that  itself  recognises its inability  to  pursue

further  a  course of action which has brought  it

and  can bring it no victory, and which now  seeks

to  come out of the jungle. Once more, let  it  be

clear  that  there is no question of  negotiation,

and this is the Tunku's decision. He has indicated

quite  clearly  that  there  is  no  question   of

negotiation.  "I  am", he has said  repeatedly  in

public, "going to explain to him the terms of the

amnesty and I shall be quite happy to hear what he

has to say." Let us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



get  away from this rhetoric, from this effort  to

seek to control the destiny of the Federation by a

small group in Singapore whose sympathies seem  to

lie  elsewhere  than  in the  traditions  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  future  of this country  cannot  be  of

greater concern to the colonial officials than  to

the  people  of  this country.  That  is  why  the

respected Chief Minister of the Federation,  Tunku

Abdul  Rahman, said a few weeks ago that he  found

himself in a difficult position. The people wanted

peace  but  the Director of Operations  wanted  to

destroy the Communists by military force, a method

which  has continuously failed for the last  seven

years.    The   people   naturally   want   peace.

Continuation of the Emergency cannot be  in  their

interests,  for  it  is only under  conditions  of

peace  that democracy has a chance to flourish  in

Malaya. The people generally are sick and tired of

the  Emergency.  General Bourne and  the  colonial

officials may not be tired. As a matter  of  fact,

colonial   officials  have  come  to  regard   the

Emergency, together with all the Emergency  powers

in  their  hands,  as part of  the  life  in  this

country.  The  cry  of Communist  subversion,  the

libelling of individuals and Parties as Communists

or Communist-inspired, and the danger of detention

without trial - all these things help colonialism to

kill  the enthusiasm of those who hate colonialism

and  who would replace it with a free, independent

and democratic Malaya. In short, the Emergency has

acted  as a check on the growth and activities  of

all   progressive  nationalist  forces   in   this

country. As far as the majority of the people  are

concerned,  the  Emergency  has  meant   heartless

restrictions on basic democratic liberties. It has

also  meant the expenditure of large sums of money

on  military campaigns to exterminate the  Malayan

Communist  Party.  All these resources  and  money

could  have  been  more profitably  used  for  the

social  and economic development of this  country.

The  Emergency has wasted human lives and material

resources  without  achieving a single  beneficial

result.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven years of warfare with foreign troops

and  mercenaries of all kinds roaming the  country,

the  Malayan Communist Party still remains with us.

If  the  Emergency  in this country  was  merely  a

military  problem, the military method  would  have

succeeded long ago in exterminating Communism.  The

armed might of Communism is far less imposing  than

the  armed might of British imperialism.  Mr  Chin

Peng  does  not have helicopters. Neither  does  he

have security forces - an armed force of 300,000  men

with  all  the  weapons of modern warfare.  Neither

does  he have prisons and detention camps where  he

may  detain  without  trial  people  suspected   of

colonial  sympathies.  It  is  clear  that  if  the

Emergency   was  purely  a  military   problem   of

disposing of a few hundred troublemakers, it  would

have  been disposed of long ago by military forces,

but  unfortunately for General Templer and  General

Bourne, the Emergency is not a military problem. It

has   its  making  in  the  political,  social  and

economic  conditions  in  the  country,  conditions

which make thousands of people feel that they  have

no  place  in  a  colonial society, and  since  the

Emergency  is political in nature, it can  only  be

settled by political means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party holds the belief that the real solution

to the Emergency is to take a lesson from our great

neighbours - India, Burma, Ceylon and Indonesia -  who

do  not exclude their local Communist Parties  from

the  constitutional  processes which  govern  these

countries. If our Chief Minister were half as  wise

as  Nehru or Soekarno, there could be an end to the

Emergency in this country. My Party feels that  the

continuation  of  the Emergency  would  provide  an

excuse for the colonial powers to go on denying the

Malayan  people  their democratic  rights  and  the

freedom to run their own affairs as they choose. As

such, colonial officials are hardly to be entrusted

with the direction and control of negotiations with

the   Malayan  Communist  Party  for   a   peaceful

settlement of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under present arrangements, it must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



be  assumed  that  the Hon. the Chief  Minister  is

guided  solely  by  the colonial officials  in  the

matter  of  negotiations with the Malayan Communist

Party.  The chances are that the colonial officials

are  not  interested in the peaceful settlement  of

the  Emergency.  That is why  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister should take the people of the country into

his  confidence,  through their representatives  of

political parties. After all, it is our country and

we   have  a  bigger  stake  in  it  than  colonial

officials and colonial soldiers. The Hon. the Chief

Minister would, if he had a sense of responsibility

to  the people of this country, consult the elected

representatives of the people in this Assembly  and

then  seek  to  plan a peaceful settlement  of  the

Emergency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly warn the elected representatives of the

people  in this Assembly that if they do  not  take

the responsibility for a peaceful settlement of the

Emergency  into their own hands, there will  be  no

peaceful  settlement. The Malayan  people  will  be

condemned   to  further  years  of  bloodshed   and

suppressive  laws  and  hopes  of  democratic   and

peaceful   progress  in  this   country   will   be

destroyed.  I ask all self-respecting  Malayans  in

this House to vote for the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

rise  to move an amendment to this motion,  may  I,

with your permission, express my great appreciation

of  the  stands taken by the hon. Members  on  this

question and that my sympathies go to them on  this

account?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the Chief Minister and the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) give full and

clear  plans on how to end the Emergency. The  Hon.

the  Chief Minister, on the one hand, believes that

if  he  despises or is determined  to  get  rid  of

Communism, then he must use all his means, even  to

the extent of allying himself with colonialism,  to

achieve his aim.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I did not say that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry. On the other

hand,  we  can  understand the motive  of  and  the

determination shown by the Member for Tanjong Pagar

when he moved this motion. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



that if we want to get rid of colonialism, we must

use  all  means,  even to allying  ourselves  with

Communism, to attain this objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I came to touch on this subject, a

few  of my friends said, "Do not touch it!  It  is

high  politics!  It  is very  dangerous!"  Sir,  I

cannot  bear  to  think of the sufferings  brought

about  by  the  eight years of  Emergency  in  the

Federation. At least, we in Singapore have been in

a  better position. I have a strong belief that it

is  now high time clearly to admit that a military

policy  to solve a political problem is a  failure

and that we in this country should try our best to

find  any means, not merely by the use of military

power, to settle this vital issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it will be recalled that quite often

we  have heard that the Emergency is going to end,

and  that  the  bandits are not  more  than  5,000

strong. That has been repeated and repeated many a

time by generals and commanders and even, if I  am

not   mistaken,  by  the  Rt.  Hon.  Mr   Malcolm

MacDonald. But we are still faced with this threat

today,  and  the  Malayan  Communist  Party  still

remains  5,000 strong, and nobody in this  country

at this moment can tell us when and how we can end

this  Emergency. So, it is solely for this reason,

which  I  appreciate,  that our  courageous  Chief

Minister  is prepared to accept the invitation  by

the  Chief Minister of the Federation, Tunku Abdul

Rahman, to take part in the coming peace talks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since our Chief Minister has clearly stated

that he is only just an invited guest, and that he

is  a  junior partner, it is unjustified that this

motion  should  be introduced that  the  Hon. the

Chief Minister should lead an All-Party delegation

to  the talks with the Malayan Communist Party. My

reasons  for opposing the motion are two. Firstly,

we  already know that neither the Hon. the  Chief

Minister,  nor  anybody in this country,  has  any

right  to  interfere with the internal affairs  of

the  Federation Government. Secondly, I will quote

an old English proverb: "Too many cooks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



spoil  the broth." We have seen, especially during

these   five  days  of  debate,  how  much   party

differences or party politics have come into  play

in  this  Assembly, and we should not be surprised

if some enthusiastic Member, on meeting Chin Peng,

were to say, "Oh, my brother, my comrade, you  are

going to become the President of Malaya!" Or there

might  be someone who would say, "Look, Chin Peng,

I  am  going  to ask for more tanks and  bombs  to

drive   you   entirely  out  of   this   country!"

Therefore,  honestly  speaking,  I  think  it   is

possible  to  visualise such  a  situation  taking

place  and I do not think it is wise for the  Hon.

the  Chief Minister to lead a delegation  of  such

diametrically opposite views to meet Chin Peng.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the amendment that I propose to move reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House considers it in the best

interests   of  the  country  that  all  political

parties in the Assembly should be consulted before

the   Chief  Minister  goes  to  meet  the  M.C.P.

representatives  to discuss a peaceful  settlement

of  the  Emergency  in order to  bring  peace  and

constitutional progress."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my reason for moving this amendment is that

I   believe   that,   despite   the   many   Party

differences, -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I first have the hon.

Member's  amendment  in writing,  please?  He  can

carry on later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my reason

for moving this amendment is that I believe, since

the  Hon. the  Chief Minister is  only  a  junior

partner  in these talks, it is much wiser  for  us

that  we acquaint the Hon. the Chief Minister with

our  views  on  these talks.  We  can  expect  all

political  Parties  to express their  opinions  on

these  peace  talks  unless  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  has  his own decision  to  say  what  is

right,  not  only to Chin Peng but  also  even  to

Tunku  Abdul  Rahman. You know very well  that  my

English  is poor. I had better make it very  clear

by  saying that the reason why I press this  point

is  that  it is important that the Hon. the  Chief

Minister, before he goes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



to  see  Chin Peng, must have an All-Party mandate

on   this  one  question - the  recognition  of  the

Malayan Communist Party. I am sure many of us have

been  told,  "Please, for goodness  sake,  do  not

touch  this controversial issue." Yet,  I  am  the

naughtiest  boy and I am purposely  going  to  say

that  I  am  a  fervent  and  ardent  believer  in

democracy. I think it is an injustice to  let  any

political Party, if it is unarmed, go underground.

It  sometimes puzzles me, since it does  not  make

much  difference because if the Malayan  Communist

Party  put  down their arms, they can be  compared

with our People's Action Party, which is now here!

I  am  of  the view that if the Malayan  Communist

Party  can  accept  a conditional  recognition  of

their  Party,  why  not we try?  Of  course,  many

political  Parties  will have  different  opinions

about  that, but at least now the Hon. the  Chief

Minister  can have my view that I am supporting  a

conditional  recognition of the Malayan  Communist

Party  if it will stop its acts of arson,  killing

and murder.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have a seconder?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member seconding the

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, I stand

to  support the amendment just moved by the Member

for  Changi. I support this amendment on  the  same

principle  as it stands today. Sir, the  Hon. the

Chief  Minister must have received this invitation

to  meet Mr Chin Peng, or must have received some

other  invitations in India, Pakistan or  anywhere

else,  before  the 9th November  when  he  had  an

elected  majority on his side. Sir,  the  position

today  is quite different. It is eleven over there

and,  as  such,  he cannot talk on behalf  of  the

people of Singapore. Sir, because of this, I think

it  is  his  duty,  before he  does  anything,  to

consult  the Opposition who have got more  elected

Members.  I  thought  the  Government  would  have

resigned long ago when this situation arose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Keep hoping!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I request my friend on my side

to  allow  me  to talk! Members on the  Government

Benches are very nice! They do not disturb!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other hand, the Government is still

here,  even after what took place on 9th November.

And  how?  By the support of a colonial  power - the

United  Kingdom. Sir, in a true democracy anywhere

in  the  world,  it is the people who  govern  the

country.  Singapore is not in  that  state  today.

Sir,  the  Hon. the Chief Minister in his  address

mentioned Communist Russia and so on. I believe  I

am  right in saying, and anybody can correct me if

I  am  wrong,  that  England,  our  masters,  have

recognised Communist Russia. India has, Burma has,

and  Indonesia  has. I do not say that  we  should

recognise  Communist Russia. We are  not  a  self-governing  country yet. What we shall do  will  be

our business when we are free and self-governing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister also said that

we  are not going to sit down on equal terms  with

Mr   Chin  Peng  to  discuss  peace.  I  am   not

commenting  on  that but what I do  say  is  this.

There  are  strikes in Singapore and in  order  to

avoid  these strikes, do we not sit down with  the

strikers and discuss: "Why are you doing this? Why

cannot  you  call  off  the  strikes  for  the

betterment of the city and society?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember those days - I am not discussing

the  pre-war Singapore that has seen 123 years  of

British  rule - but I am just drawing  attention  to

the  reoccupation  of Singapore  in  1945  when  I

happened   to   be   in   the   British   Military

Administration  Council and I well remember,  Sir,

Mr  Wu  Tien Wang and many others who  made  very

good  speeches for the betterment of the city  and

they  were invited to the homes of the then  chief

of Singapore, Sir Ralph Hone, and others. I do not

know   what  happened  later  on.  Many  of   them

disappeared.  I am told that some  who  are  doing

this  fighting  are dissatisfied nationalists.  If

that  is so, would it not be advisable on our part

to  say,  "Look here, brother, why are  you  doing

this? Why are you causing this misery, looting and

killing? What is wrong?"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>



It is possible that, by sitting together, we might

convince  Mr Chin Peng to come over to our  side.

If he does not, well, the result is clear for both

the Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bandoeng Conference attended by the

Asian  powers  has accepted the  doctrine  or  the

ideal   of  Panchshila,  that  is,  peaceful   co-existence.   There  have  been  many   conferences

attended,  amongst others, by England and  France,

where  they  have sat down with Communist  Russia,

and talked in terms of world betterment. If we can

achieve something for the good of our own city  or

the  people  just by talking, why  not?  There  is

nothing wrong about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been told just now by the Hon. the

Chief  Minister  that he has been invited  by  the

Chief Minister of the Federation to be present  at

the talks. If he is going there just to attend  as

an  observer, that is his business. I am  sure  he

cannot commit us in whatever talks he has when  he

is  going  as  an observer or just to  be  present

there.  But  if  he wants to commit  Singapore  to

anything, then it is his duty to see that we,  the

Opposition, who command the majority of the  votes

and  represent Singapore on this side of the House

and not on the Government side, be consulted. Even

if  the  Hon. the Chief Minister goes,  though  he

does  not represent Singapore, we do not mind  his

going  provided he consults the Opposition Parties

on this side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there is one more thing which is

personal.  My  friend  the  Member  for  Sembawang

(Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim) mentioned that he is  an

Independent and there was some remark made by  the

Hon. the Chief Minister. Sir, I am an Independent

Member  myself. I join this one side or the  other

side  if  I  hold to certain convictions.  I  have

retired  from active business since four  to  five

years. The Communists would never accept me  if  I

wanted  to  be  a Communist. I do  not  think  the

People's Action Party would accept me in any part.

I do not know -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, possibly the Socialists

might accept me if I signed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



proper  terms  with them, but I do  believe  in  a

human  society which should remain  at  peace  for

their own good and for the good of their own city.

Sir,  I  have  great  pleasure  in  seconding  the

amendment just moved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and, negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question is now before

the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, no doubt there are Members of this House  who

will  regard my action in rising to take  part  in

this    debate   as   "intervention",   but    the

constitution being what it is, I have  the right

and they must hear me out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I should like to make it clear here that I

have been an opponent of immediate self-government

but not of eventual self-government, but I wish to

say that, to me, Sir, this is the most unfortunate

motion  ever  placed  before  this  Assembly,  not

excluding  that made by the Progressive  Party  on

25th July when they put forward a motion for a new

constitution providing for immediate independence.

"Unfortunate" is the word I use, Sir, but  nothing

that  emanates  from the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

surprises  me.  Of course, he has  never  lost  an

opportunity at any time to try to explain away the

Emergency - in speeches made on May 16th, I think it

was, and on dates around that time, he stated: the

Emergency, of course, in his opinion, arises  from

social   injustices   and  economic   ills,   mal-administration and failure to understand the  aims

and   aspirations  of  a  resurgent   nationalism,

blunders  of  stuffed-shirt colonial  officials - my

gosh,  do not let me hear that word! - over a period

of  eight  years, and all the clap-trap of  Marble

Arch  soapbox oratory ad nauseam on every possible

occasion, as if there were millions of disaffected

citizens in the Federation of Malaya instead of  a

few thousands. He said there are eight thousand. I

read  in  the  newspapers that it  is  only  three

thousand. Anyway, it cannot be very many. He says,

"Of course, the security forces



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>



cannot  get  on with the business of keeping  down

the    Emergency   because   they    cannot    get

information."   How   can   they   possibly    get

information  from  citizens who  will  have  their

throats cut immediately if they give it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the hon. and learned Member is a

politician. So normally one would discount what he

says.  I  have sometimes thought that his  baiting

the  Government  on the subject of  Malayanisation

was  no  more than the carrying out of a directive

from his principals, but it seemed to me yesterday

in   the  debate  on  one  of  the  Heads  in  the

Estimates - Immigration, I think it was Head 56 - that

what  he  is  really suffering from is xenophobia.

Sir,  even  this  aspect of the hon. and  learned

Gentleman's approach to the subject is not without

ironic  connotations in that  he  himself  has  an

extremely Westernised education and every thought-form  he has is Westernised, so that he has to  go

on  beating  the anti-colonial drum  in  order  to

rally  his  less  articulate  followers  and,   of

course,  to  maintain his leadership, perhaps  his

ephemeral leadership, of the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the audacity of this motion absolutely

astounds  me.  He is obviously assuming  that  the

Chief Ministers of the respective territories  are

to  meet those jungle heroes for talks - for  talks,

if  you please - to discuss a peaceful settlement of

the  Emergency. What! As equals! I trust that  the

Chief  Ministers of these territories  will  treat

these canaille like the beaten enemies they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the People's Action Party - the

"Action" part of it seems to me to be to drive the

country headlong to perdition - never miss a  chance

to  scream "Merdeka", which, of course,  does  not

mean  Merdeka but just plain anti-colonialism.  It

is  obvious.  I  mean,  if  every  time  they  say

"Merdeka" I say "Colonialism", I will be within my

rights - it will be a knight for their bishop!  Yet,

as  the  Hon. the Chief Minister has said, roughly

in  these  words, "They are playing straight  into

the hands of the most insidious form of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>



colonialism that the world has ever known and  far

outside  the reach of their philosophy." Does  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar really think  that  Mr

Chin  Peng  is  some species of a Robin  Hood?  To

speak  utterly plainly, they are no more than  the

tools  of  the  Moscow-Peking Axis  and  the  hon.

Member, when he assured the House - I think it  was

May  16th - that  in their struggle for  freedom  he

would fight anyone, even the Communists, was  just

deluding himself. In spite of his record, I  think

that  the little, slim Tarzans of the jungle would

give  him  pretty  short shrift. How  can  anyone,

Sir, - and  this  really has  not  been  touched  on

enough  in this debate - who claims to be civilised,

condone  the  bloody and horrible murders,  mayhem

and  foul,  masochistic acts by those  fiends  and

then try to excuse them by sophisticated arguments

on  doubtful  premises? No doubt, the proposer  of

this   motion   relishes  being  photographed   at

whatever will be the place in the ulu with all the

Party  Members  in  diminishing precedence  behind

him. I think this is a scandalous motion, Sir, and

I hope it will be heavily defeated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day may come, you know, when Members of this

House  will  look back nostalgically at  the  days

when they could get up in this Assembly and, under

the  Royal Coat of Arms, with its "Honi  soit  qui

mal  y  pense" and its "Dieu et mon droit",  twist

the  lion's tail with impunity and get  away  with

it.  I  hope, Sir, that the Asian Members of  this

House   know  that  I  do  not  really   represent

colonialism, taipans, stuffed shirts,  etc.,  etc.

They  may think so, but they would be wrong. I  am

much  more liberally-minded than many of them  may

think,  but  what  I have said this  afternoon,  I

would  not, in spite of all the sophistry and  the

wit of the Member for Tanjong Pagar, cancel half a

line.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not feel so

strongly,  as  some  other  Members  do, on   the

iniquity  of the speech by the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



were  points,  of course, with which I  profoundly

disagree    but   by   and   large   it   deserves

congratulation, I thought. He obviously is  a  man

who  reads  his Straits Times very thoroughly  and

carefully and he has a very good memory. As far as

I  can recollect, pretty well every point that  he

has  made  has  appeared in  the  columns  of  the

Straits Times in the last year or two, and he  has

given an adequate summary of what that respectable

newspaper's opinion on this matter is. Apart  from

those opinions, I do not think he deserves all the

reprobations that have been heaped on him,  but  I

would  like  to correct him before I come  to  the

main  body of his motion. I would like to  correct

him  on  one  or  two  small  points.  He  has   a

fascinated interest in me. He can never keep to  a

speech without some reference to the Minister  for

Telecommunications and Mines, or the Minister  for

Transport    and   Expectations,    or    whatever

extraordinary new variant in my title  he  manages

to  invent. But on this occasion, he got me right,

though he corrected himself and got wrong again as

soon  as  he  could. It was not a mistake  but  he

actually got it right this time and the reason  he

referred  to  me was to bring in a remark  to  the

effect,  I  think, that the Hon. the Minister  for

Communications  and Works neither seeks  to  fight

Communism nor even to understand it. I think  that

is about what he said -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Seeks to fight.

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> "Seeks to fight" comes from without

understanding. Very well then. The fact is -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I said -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I shall be quite happy to sit down

and  let  him  clarify, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  if  he

wishes  to do so. I will assume that what he  said

was   that  I  seek  to  fight  Communism  without

understanding it. Is that a reasonable summary?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know. The hon. Member is

addressing the Chair. I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do apologise, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Well,  be that as it may, I would like to make  my

position  about Communism clear. I  have,  in  the

course   of  a  not  inactive  life,  lived   with

Communists  at  one  time  or  another  on   quite

friendly terms. People who are quite good  friends

of  mine have been Communists or fellow-travellers

or  crypto-Communists and all the other variations

of  the  Communist organisation, and  I  have  no

exaggerated  horror  of the Communist  system.  It

seems  to me a very suitable system for a backward

country  which has got into a mess and for  people

who  are in a general collapse, as Russia was when

the Communists got hold of Russia, or as China was

when the Kuomintang gave way to the Communists.  I

do  not think that it is a nice system at all, but

when  people have got into a mess you have to have

drastic  remedies.  You certainly  get  them  with

Communism,  and  they  probably  will  succeed  in

lifting  up  the  economy of those two  countries.

They  have  in  Russia succeeded  in  making  very

considerable  economic progress.  They  have  gone

rather backward in agriculture but they have  made

enormous  progress  in heavy industry.  They  have

even  been  able to distribute consumer  goods  to

some  extent  in Russia and make the  standard  of

living go up a bit, so that I am not excited about

Communism. It is rather out of date, to  my  mind.

It  is  a  waning philosophy which  is  likely  to

vanish  from the world in the next ten or  fifteen

years -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They do not -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not say that the Communist

forces in Russia will vanish in ten or fifteen

years. I mean that what we might call the

apostolic impulse of Communism will vanish - it is

my guess, and I make no claims to be a prophet. I

do not claim to understand Communism perfectly but

I have made some study of it and I think I

probably know just as much as the Member for

Tanjong Pagar does about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



it, particularly when he asserts that if Chin Peng

got  control of Malaya, all these allowances,  all

this privileged housing, all the differentials  in

pay  would  instantly vanish and withal  the  poor

would  be lifted up. That just is not the fact,  I

am  afraid,  in  the history of  the  other  major

Communist countries. In Russia, when they came  in

with  Communism, they came in on  the  slogan  of:

"From  each  according  to his  ability,  to  each

according  to  his need." But they very  soon  saw

that  meant,  of  course, that you  got  what  you

needed and they very soon realised that that  cock

would not fight. They abandoned that for the other

version  which  is: "From each  according  to  his

ability,"  (which means you are going to  work  as

hard as I can make you) "and to each according  to

his  work." Thus, the man whose work is recognised

by  the Communist Party as being valuable receives

a  country  villa plus a town flat, extra  rations

and  coupons and all the comforts and luxuries  of

life.  But  the  chap whose work is recognised  as

being  not  very  valuable  gets  very  much  less

allotted to him; and anybody who does not work  at

all     gets    into    a    perfectly    horrible

situation - forced  labour in the corrective  labour

camps - and  I  am  afraid, if you had  a  Communist

regime here, you would necessarily follow the same

pattern.  The  idea  that you  would  abolish  all

inequalities   and  privileges   by   establishing

Communism  here  is  just most  absolute  nonsense

because  there  is no reason to suppose  that  the

situation  here  would  be  different   from   any

existing elsewhere. However, I only want  to  make

that  little point clear because there is so  much

misunderstanding  about the nature  of  Communism,

which is essentially a managerial system by which

you  take  control of the capital  assets  of  the

State  and develop the capital formation. That  is

the  essential  basis of Communism,  and  profound

compassion  and so on does not really  operate  at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I now want to come to the hon. Member's

very   interesting  motion  by  which   he   wants

representatives of all the Parties to go  to  meet

Chin Peng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>



I  am  not  going to talk about that  in  general,

because it has been quite sufficiently dealt  with

by the Hon. the Chief Minister, but there are just

one or two practical difficulties about it which I

would like to point out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one arises from a remark made by the

Member  for  Bukit  Timah (Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong)

earlier in this Budget sitting when he was talking

about  education. He then said very  energetically

and   with   great  conviction  that   anybody - any

Chinese, I think - any Malayan or Chinese who  had

received an English education was thereby cut  off

from  his own people. The Member for Tanjong Pagar

winced bitterly at this stab in the back from  one

of  his own back-benchers. He had to admit that he

himself  had  no  connection with  the  people  of

Malaya  and had no claim to represent them because

he  had  received  a  very lengthy  and  extremely

successful English education, but I do  feel  that

one  difficulty  is  that if  the  leader  of  the

People's  Action  Party were to go  to  meet  Chin

Peng, his own followers would disown him and  say,

"We  cannot  allow  this man  to  claim  to  be  a

representative  of  the  people  because   he   is

obviously disqualified by the fact that he has got

a  law  degree  or whatever degrees he  has  got."

However,  that is perhaps a minor point  which  he

can settle with his own internal management of the

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater difficulty comes from something which

he  himself  said when we were talking  about  the

Medical  Estimates and he described himself  as  a

mouthpiece.  I thought that was an extraordinarily

true  and accurate description of himself. It  was

very  frank of him to say quite boldly,  "I  am  a

mouthpiece." He claimed to be a mouthpiece putting

forward  the words which other people had prepared

for  him  and he was coming in here to  play  them

over, as it were, like a gramophone which could be

carried in here and would deliver the burden which

had been put into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in meeting Chin Peng, it seems to me clear

that you need to have leaders to meet a leader.  I

do  not know Chin Peng, unless he is one of my old

friends



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>



going by his Communist alias, but presumably he  is

a man of energy and leadership and he would require

to meet other people of energy and leadership or he

would feel that he is wasting his time. And in  the

Chief  Minister  of the Federation, we  undoubtedly

have   a  man  who  has  very  high  qualities   of

leadership, purpose and drive. I feel that we  also

have  a leader but of a different type, and a  very

able   one   indeed,  in  our  Chief  Minister   of

Singapore, a man who has dynamic drive. He  is  not

one  who  is  merely puffed along by the  words  of

others.  He  himself initiates things  and  secures

support for them because he is so obviously  right.

He  is  not just a mere trumpet through which other

people blow their hot air. Now, Chin Peng is  quite

clearly  a  busy  man  and  we  would  not  send  a

mouthpiece  to  talk  to him! I  must  remind  this

Assembly  that  the  Member for Tanjong  Pagar  has

demonstrated  his  qualities as a  mouthpiece  with

most  extraordinary success during this session.  I

would not like to estimate how long he has been  on

his  feet  and  how many words he has poured  forth

over us, but I do feel that if he did go to discuss

things with Chin Peng, the discussions would go  on

at least as long as Panmunjong, or possibly as long

as the Emergency, because the number of words which

he would find to use would, I am afraid, extend the

discussions beyond all bearable length.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last bit of objection - perhaps a very minor

one - is that probably Chin Peng would object to  one

of  the  inveterate  habits of the  leader  of  the

People's  Action Party of putting  words  into  his

opponent's mouth which his opponent has never said.

He  is  always doing it. He does it again and again

but  he  does not get away with it here because  we

shoot  him down and say: "Well, of course,  I  never

said  anything of that sort at all." He then  makes

his little joke from the front Bench and the matter

passes  over.  But  I think that  if  he  sat  down

seriously with Chin Peng and try to argue with him,

he  would do the same sort of thing and get into  a

frightful  state of confusion and Chin  Peng  would

not  have known what he had said at the end  of  it

all probably.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>



I  think he would be intolerably confused and again

an  awful  lot of time would be wasted.  These  are

very minor matters, Mr Speaker, Sir. I do not want

to  lengthen  this out at all, but I do  feel  that

they  are really practical little objections  which

should be taken into account when considering  this

motion.

that  most honest men in this Assembly are  getting

very  tired  of  the impression that  certain  hon.

which  they read irrespective of what has  occurred

in  this  Assembly.  I  do ask  you,  Sir,  in  all

earnestness  and  with respect, to  take  steps  to

prevent  the  recurrence of an extremely  unhealthy
