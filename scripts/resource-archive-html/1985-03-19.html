   <b>TRAINING OF NATIONAL SERVICEMEN</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Scarcity of land)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, as land grows increasingly scarce in Singapore so that the problem of training a large number of National Servicemen becomes more and more acute, how his Ministry proposes to solve this problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence): Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past 10 years, troop training strength of the SAF has increased fourfold, from 35,000 to 135,000. But military training areas in Singapore have steadily shrunk from a total of 206 sq km to 80 sq km today. In particular, the live firing area in Pasir Laba has diminished from 28 sq km to 21 sq km with the construction of the four new reservoirs of Tengeh, Poyan, Murai and Sarimbun.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 59 sq km are gazetted as "manoeuvring areas". No live firing is allowed. Only the 14 sq km on Pulau Tekong are exclusively reserved for military training. A large part of the other 45 sq km is used for housing, industry, agriculture, cemeteries and reservoirs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more training land will have to be released in the next few years. The efficient use of the remaining area is therefore a real challenge. Some of the measures Mindef has taken are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Conducting as much preparatory training as possible within SAF camps so that full benefit is derived when the troops are in the training areas. Training simulators have been installed for basic skills training at individual and crew level.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Installing training facilities which make more intensive use of time and land. An SAF Wargames Centre has been set up to supplement field training for commanders. A Basic Combat Training Centre for reservists will be ready in July 1985, consisting of training stations, each designed to refresh the reservist on a particular combat skill. In this way many
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> reservists can be trained simultaneously on the same plot of land.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Reducing the area "sterilized" by rifle ranges. Bullet stoppers known as baffles are being installed in all the ranges. This frees the surrounding land for training and other uses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training areas are crowded with troops from many units sharing the same training grounds. Training during week-ends has become a normal occurrence for national servicemen and reservists alike. In populated areas, troops have to keep to tracks and roads to avoid encroaching on farms and private properties. Inevitably, realism in training is lost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to raise an army without allocating a minimum acreage for training. Housing, industry, and other economic and social pursuits must leave enough land to assure SAF operational readiness. Overseas training, which the SAF does in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Philippines and Brunei, is not a solution. Whilst friendly countries may accommodate small contingents of SAF forces to practise specialized manoeuvres, no country, however well disposed towards Singapore, can afford to allow us to train our whole army there all the time. Besides, the cost to us of doing so would be exorbitant. Land is scarce in Singapore, but the SAF must always be allocated its fair share of the land.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less land will be required for SAF training if the land can be used as intensively as Pasir Laba and Pulau Tekong. The Government has therefore decided to set aside some plots of land exclusively for military training. These will be the training villages mentioned in the Addendum to the President's Address. Troops can manoeuvre freely without trampling on pig farms or orchid plantations. Units can practise their battle drills properly, and be systematically put through their paces. It will be a workable although not an ideal solution to our training problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Sir, could the Minister tell the House how much land is needed for these training villages, and where will these villages be?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are thinking of about eight training villages under SAF control, totalling 21 sq km. Despite having these training villages, the total amount of land which the SAF would have available will go down. Today we have 80 sq km. By 1988, even with the training villages, we will only have 66 sq km. Where will they be? They will be in places where the land use is compatible, places which have been reserved for long-term development but will be available for the next 10, 20 years, for example, Seletar, West Bukit Timah, and parts of Marsiling and Mandai.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Sir, can the Minister of State state whether land has been set aside by Mindef for other than non-military purposes, for example, growing of fruit trees and vegetables.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> All land set aside by Mindef is for military purposes. Where we have an air base, a certain amount of land around the air base is sterilized because there are ammunition dumps and fuel dumps. These areas have to be set aside for safety reasons and for security reasons. You cannot build tall buildings on these areas, because they would get in the way of our aircraft. But rather than leave the land totally fallow, we plant trees, and if we are going to plant trees, where it is feasible, we plant fruit trees.

   <b>SING-THAI FARM</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Supply of pigs)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the future of the Sing-Thai Farm; (b) whether the supply of pigs will be affected if the farm is closed; and (c) whether alternative sources of supply of pigs from other countries have been secured.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Sing-Thai Farms Co. Ltd was established in 1979 by the Thai Government and the Primary Industries Enterprise (Pte) Ltd to initiate the export of disease-free pigs from Thailand to Singapore. This role has been fulfilled and the farm has been able to show the way for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> other pig exporting farms in Thailand to export their pigs to Singapore. The farm has served its purpose. The management of Sing-Thai Farms is now reviewing the role and objective of the farm.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1984, the Sing-Thai Farms exported only 1,100 pigs to Singapore. This number of pigs is insignificant and will not affect the overall supply of pig% in Singapore, even if the farm is closed. The question of securing alternative sources of supply of pigs from other countries to replace those supplied by the Sing-Thai Farms therefore does not arise.

   <b>LITIGATIONS OVER MEDICAL INCOMPETENCE</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Particulars)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for Finance, Minister for Education and Minister for Health (a) how many doctors have been sued in the past 10 years for negligence or incompetence; (b) how many patients have died as a result of such negligence or incompetence; and (c) whether it is necessary to have a "sue the doctors and hospitals" campaign for the benefit of the general public.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Finance and Minister for Education and Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance and Minister for Education and Minister for Health (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answers are as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, during the past 10 years (from 1975 to 1984) four legal suits were lodged against Government doctors for negligence or incompetence, The Ministry does not have data on malpractice suits taken out against doctors in private practice. Of the four cases lodged against Government doctors, two resulted in the death of patients.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is of the view that a "sue the doctors and hospitals" campaign is not necessary. Such a campaign would indeed have undesirable repercussions. The constant threat of litigation will induce doctors to practise what is called "defensive medicine", ie, to subject their patients to wasteful and unnecessary investigations, treatment and medication. Doctors will have to pay high insurance premium to protect themselves against lawsuits. The result will be higher medical bills for the patients.

   <b>CRACKER FIRING OFFENCES</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Penalties)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law (a) if he will state the number of persons caught letting off fire crackers during the Chinese New Year season; (b) how many were fined and what was the fine; (c) in which areas did the cases occur; and (d) whether the Ministry of Home Affairs will consider (i) stiffer measures or penalties to deter the firing of crackers in the Housing and Development Board estates and other densely populated public places; and (ii) amending legislation to impose stiffer deterrent penalties on those selling fireworks or crackers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Home Affairs and Community Development (Mr Wong Kan Seng) (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law): Mr Speaker, Sir, may I reply on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of persons arrested by the Police for letting off fire-crackers or other fireworks during the Chinese New Year season was 15. The police also arrested 34 persons for possession of fire-crackers or fireworks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, seven persons have been charged in court for discharge and possession of fire-crackers or fireworks. They were fined between $100 and $800 each. In addition, five persons were caught for selling fire-crackers or fireworks. One was sentenced to three months imprisonment, two to one month imprisonment each, and another was fined $1,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the reported cases occurred in HDB estates. Ang Mo Kio recorded the most number of cases with 34 incidents, followed by Clementi with 17, MacPherson 15, Bukit Merah 15, Yishun 14. Bedok North, Toa Payoh, Whampoa, Ghim Moh and Chai Chee had an average of 10 incidents each. The remaining incidents were thinly spread amongst the smaller HDB estates and other locations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police have repeatedly warned the public against firing crackers. During the Chinese New Year period, police patrols were intensified to look out for persons discharging and possessing fire-crackers
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and fireworks. Further, all entry points int Singapore, especially at the Causeway, were closely watched by the Police, Immigration and Customs officers to pre vent as well as to detect smuggling of fire crackers and other fireworks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dangerous Fireworks Act, 1972, already provides for a fine of not exceeding $5,000 or two years imprisonment, or both fine and imprisonment, for all offences under the Act. There is no provision in the Act which specifically makes the sale of fire-crackers or fireworks an offence. Persons caught selling fire-crackers are charged with possession. If the situation requires, we will consider amending the law to include such a provision in the Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since it is apparent that the letting off of fire-crackers is widespread, particularly in all the housing estates, could the Hon. Minister in-charge assure this House that other measures besides police patrols are in hand to inform or educate the public that such behaviour is not only anti-social but will not do well for the country?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, I think the point is taken. And if school children, for example, are caught for firing crackers, the school authority will normally take action to counsel the children about the dangers of firing crackers.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law, since the implementation of the Civil Defence Scheme, (a) how many constituencies have responded and how many volunteers there are; (b) what training courses have been given to the volunteers; (c) whether he will consider improving and strengthening the civil defence units that have been set up in the constituencies; and (d) whether there are sufficient manpower and other resources to ensure that when their services are required there will be this back-up facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Civil
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Defence (CD) Scheme was launched in November 1982, a total of 62 Constituencies have joined the Scheme. 23,126 residents have been registered as volunteers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CD volunteers depending on the stage of their training can attend different levels of training. Newly recruited CD volunteers attend basic training in fire-fighting, first-aid, rescue and evacuation. Volunteers with leadership potential are selected for advanced training by attending the Volunteer Commanders' Course at the CD Training School, The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has, thus far, conducted three such courses. In addition, specialized courses to upgrade the knowledge of volunteers on subjects such as advanced first-aid have also been conducted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CD volunteers in Constituencies will be organized into Units with a formal command structure. Regular exercises will be conducted to improve their capability and enhance their effectiveness. These Volunteer Units will be supplemented and strengthened with Reservist Units. In each RC Zone, there will be one Volunteer Company working together with and supporting the Reservist Company to carry out CD operations. The reservists will come from ex-SAF and ex-Police officers. Because of their training in the SAF and Police, these reservists will bring with them experience in dealing with emergency situations. In addition, specialized CD Units trained to undertake complex CD tasks using specialized equipment and heavy plants will be formed to strengthen our CD capability at the Constituencies. The SCDF will continually upgrade the skills of volunteers and reservists through frequent training and exercises to keep them prepared for any emergency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SCDF has drawn up an overall build-up plan to establish CD Units in all Constituencies. The manpower and resources required have also been worked out. When the Force is fully built up, there should be 65,000 reservists and 30,000 volunteers. The reservists would come from ex-SAF, ex-Police and CD reservists. These sources
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are adequate for the full build-up of the Force. The equipment for the Units to carry out their missions in an emergency are being purchased in stages as the Units are established. Some of the equipment like heavy plant and transport vehicles will not be purchased. Instead, they will be mobilized from the civil resources. The SCDF will constantly review its manpower and resources to ensure that they are adequate to meet any situation.

   <b>NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICE POSTS</b>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law (a) whether he will state how many Neighbourhood Police Posts have been set up and in which estates; (b) whether the implementation of the NPP scheme is on schedule; (c) what are the shortcomings encountered, if any; and (d) what plans are in hand to ensure the full cooperation of the residents participating in the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 20 Neighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs) have been set up in Toa Payoh, Paya Lebar and Jurong Police Divisions. The main public housing estates covered by these NPPs in the Toa Payoh Police Division are Toa Payoh, Sin Ming, Potong Pasir and Upper Aljunied. The NPPs in the Paya Lebar Police Division are all located in the Ang Mo Kio housing estate. The remaining five NPPs, which are in Jurong Police Division, cover the Jurong East, Jurong West, Boon Lay and Marsiling housing estates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation programme has been brought forward by two years. The original programme was to have a total of 91 NPPs to cover the whole island by 1991. The revised plan is to set up the 91 NPPs by 1989 at the rate of 14-15 NPPs every year. This decision follows evaluations by my Ministry as well as by Japanese experts of the NPP system in Toa Payoh Police Division in June 1984 which concluded that the Toa Payoh NPP System was an overwhelming success. The Japanese experts accordingly recommended that the implementation programme should be brought forward by two years.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are no major shortcomings, there have been minor teething problems. A Steering Committee comprising senior police officers closely monitors the implementation of the system. The concept has been well accepted by the community. The NPP System has built up close police-public rapport. In the Toa Payoh Police Division, this close rapport is evident from, among other things, a 45% increase in the number of police reports. This compares with a moderate increase of 14% for the nation as a whole. The public is now more willing to come forward and make reports resulting in the Police apprehending more criminals. Between June 1983 and May 1984, there were 2,839 arrests in the Toa Payoh Police Division as against 1,599 and 1,252 arrests in the two years preceding it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public acceptance of the NPP Scheme is important and efforts are made to obtain the residents' cooperation through wide publicity and explanations about the scheme. Booklets explaining the NPP concept are distributed to the residents. It includes profiles of NPP officers serving the community so that residents can get acquainted with them. NPP officers visit the residents twice a year and this has helped in ensuring understanding of, and support from, the residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Hon. Minister of State for Home Affairs and Community Development enlighten this House as to whether the crime situation has somewhat improved since the introduction of the NPP into the housing estates or areas as mentioned by him in his reply?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, since the implementation of the NPP system in the Toa Payoh Police Division, ie 'B' Division, we note that there is an improvement in the crime position in the Division. Compared with the nation-wide figure of a 7% increase, the Toa Payoh Police Division had only a 5.5% increase. And in percentage terms, this is about 20% less than the nation-wide figure.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to ask the Minister of State a question. Since the implementation of the programme has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> been brought forward, will the authorities face a shortage of manpower?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> There is no shortage of manpower. We have adequate Police manpower to cope with the programme. When I explained that we will build up the NPP System by 1989, it will be done over a period of time - 14 NPPs a year. So we are able to phase in the manpower required.

  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let me have your supplementary question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Is the Minister of State aware that the whole of Ang Mo Kio is not covered by NPP? There are two parts of Ang Mo Kio - one part in my constituency, Jalan Kayu, there are 26 blocks, and another part in Nee Soon Constituency - which are not covered by NPPs?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Firstly, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not true that the whole of Ang Mo Kio is not covered. I mentioned earlier on that Ang Mo Kio is covered. We had a scheme extended to Ang Mo Kio in 1984. If the Member is asking whether we are going to have NPPs in his constituency, if he could just wait a little longer, the NPP will be set up.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister of State to go and check properly. I believe that the NPP coverage is on a constituency basis and not on a town basis. So the 26 blocks in Ang Mo Kio that is bounded by Cheng San as well as Chong Boon are not covered by NPPs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> This is a question of detail, Mr Speaker, Sir. When I mentioned that there are NPPs in Ang Mo Kio, I meant Ang Mo Kio Estate. If the Member is asking me whether we have NPPs in Chong Boon, Kebun Baru and Cheng San, including his constituency, these are details as to the

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [8th March, 1985] (2nd Allotted Day),
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1985 to 31st March, 1986.". [Minister for Finance, Minister for Education and Minister for Health).

  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Since I have allowed two days for the debate on the Budget Statement, I have decided that at 3.30 pm the Minister for Finance should be given a full hour to wind up the debate. This is only fair enough.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Koh Lip Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Koh Lip Lin (Nee Soon) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday in Parliament, the Member for Khe Bong said that he had at first wanted to talk about road tax and the increase in diesel tax and taxi fares but since other Members have raised these matters, he did not want to talk about them. But I look at it differently. I feel that any important issue should be repeatedly brought up, so that the more people talk about it and giving more opinions, the more helpful it would be to the formulation of policies and measures. Moreover, these are matters which the people of Singapore are concerned about. Therefore, as representatives of the people, we must try our best to make use of every opportunity to talk about matters that concern the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the reduction in certain taxes and levies, such as payroll tax, SDF levy and the like, are giving great relief and confidence to the business community, the increases in road tax, petrol tax and taxi fares have brought great burden to the general public. As some Members have mentioned, this would in turn bring about a chain reaction in a rising cost of living and higher prices in consumer goods and services. So this double-sided measure in both increasing and reducing taxes gives people the impression that the Govern-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ment is just taking from one hand and giving it to the other. In Chinese colloquial, it is scooping out a piece of flesh to patch a wound, like you have some wound on the left arm and you try to scoop out a piece of flesh from your right arm to mend the hole in the left arm. So this is actually not a practical way to solve the problem. I wonder whether the Minister for Finance i? applying the same kind of medication.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in road tax and petrol tax, I think is for the purposes of controlling the number of vehicles on the road and make the use of taxis more efficient. But I feel that the rates should not be so high and it could have been implemented over a period of years in gradual stages of small increases each time. If, all of a sudden, you increase the tax to a great extent, it would appear that you have not taken note of the situation all along and only until now, at the last minute, do you try to increase the tax all of a sudden, overnight. Or, you might have noted the situation but was unable to come to an early decision. I think this is not what an efficient government should do. I hope in future there would not be such a large scale increase of taxes, by 100% or 50%, particularly in the areas of income tax, price of HDB flats and other major matters. The increase in taxi fares will affect the commuters generally. It will perhaps affect certain people more, such as the old and those in the lower income group, particularly those who have to depend on the taxi as the means of transport for a livelihood. The increase in Road Tax and Petrol Tax will have some effect in reducing the number of vehicles, but after a few years the effect will be forgotten and there will be more and more vehicles on the road. Because in Singapore, owning a vehicle is a status symbol, whether it is a necessity or not. Some people must need a car in their job. The Ministers here cannot go about their business without cars, otherwise they would not be able to function properly. The Member for Bukit Ho Swee of the previous Parliament was perhaps the only one who went about without a car. Just like what the Member for Siglap has mentioned yesterday, the living standard of the people of Singapore has risen. So everybody wants to have a car. Although not everybody can afford a car, but car owners would like to retain
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> their cars and those who are without cars now aspire to have a car of their own. Car possession has become a status symbol of one's standing in the society and one's wealth and success and symbolizes one's prestige. So, having a luxurious car is better than having an ordinary car; having a big car is better than having a small car; and having a smaller car is better than without any car. It has come to my knowledge that in some well-known elite schools pupils often discuss about whose parents' cars are bigger and more luxurious, and so on and so forth. After school, some pupils would go home and ask their parents to buy a better car because their classmates have bigger and more luxurious cars.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give another example. A young lady is being courted by some suitors. One suitor comes on foot, one by bus, another by trishaw, yet another by car. Who has got a better chance? If you come in a nice car, you are likely to stand a better chance, other things being equal. Most people, having got a flat, a spouse and children, would next aim to own a car. With a car, one will be able to take his family for an outing or for shopping. It would also give his children and wife some feeling of status.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not mean to say that the people of Singapore are rather vain and unrealistic. What I am trying to say is that unless our social value concept has changed, our aim of life is still to own a car, after having obtained other necessities of life. Some people are willing to save for a car at the expense of other things such as food and entertainment. There are many suggestions on how to prevent the number of cars from increasing. But I feel that the best and most important solution is to provide a good and efficient public transport system. Our MRT and bus systems should be able to provide our people with a safe, comfortable, convenient, economical and efficient transport service. Only then you can basically solve the problem of car ownership or the number of cars on the road. I hope bus companies or operators would not at this juncture try to increase bus fares to make money to take advantage of the time when taxi fares and petrol tax have increased. They should
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> not try to make use of the opportunity to make too much out of the public, but should try to improve and provide a more efficient service to the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem I would like to raise is about the Ministry of Culture. This year's budget does not relate to the Ministry of Culture because this Ministry has been disbanded. People in the cultural circle naturally feel that the Government does not give priority to matters of culture. Some people say that Singapore lacks culture, or the Government of Singapore has got no culture. Culture and Education are two pillars of nation building. Education prepares the people for their role in nation building and Culture ensures that the Nation will last long.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I would like to mention about the abolition of Ministry of Science and Technology in 1981. At that time we were worried about the provision. Yet, for several years thereafter the Government has continued to spend a lot of money and effort in the promotion of science and technology. These facts have proved our worries to be unnecessary. For instance, in recent years the Government has allotted a lot of money for upgrading the building, facilities and increase in teaching staff of the National University, Nanyang Technological Institute and the two polytechnics. As a result more and more students have been enroled, more and more people are receiving science and technology education to provide the necessary manpower resources for our nation building.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next item worth mentioning is about computerization. The Government has set up a National Computer Board to implement the promotion of computerization throughout the nation. It has made much impact on public and private sectors. The Government has also been active in promoting the development of advanced science and higher technology through the Economic Development Board and the Science Council. They have made great contributions. Other measures relating to promotion of advanced science and high-tech industries, include the setting up of the Science Park, R&amp;D Assistance Scheme. Funds have been set up which have also given a great impetus
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to the rapid progress of our country in the fields of science and technology. So science and technology continue to receive the Government's support despite the abolition of the Ministry of Science and Technology. Therefore, I also believe that the Government will continue to provide assistance for the promotion of culture in our country, despite the dissolution of the Culture Ministry. But I am still a bit worried, perhaps unnecessarily, because the fund allocated to culture has always been very small. Last year, the allocation for promotion of culture was $13.5 million but the actual expenditure was only $8.8 million. This year, there is only $11 million to be spent on this item. Allocation to library and other culture related fields are similarly in the same state. The actual expenditure has been less than the budgeted figure. I do not know whether this trend will continue. I feel that the small sum provided is not enough for the promotion of culture. Divide it among the whole population, each Singaporean would get only a few dollars. I hope the Government could be more positive in the support and promotion of culture and try to help promote the traditional cultures of the various communities in Singapore in order to develop them into a Singapore culture.

  <br>
  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Yuhua)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget announced by the Minister for Finance other than the question of an increase in tax for taxis has generally met with good response. Here, I would like to touch on two matters. One is about the contribution to SDF, now reduced from 4% to 2%. In the present circumstances when there have been some economic slow-down and frequent retrenchments the business circle generally feel that the reduction is very welcome.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of SDF arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s when we reached a certain stage in our economic development which made it necessary for us to restructure our economy. To do this we need to upgrade the skills of our workers. At the same time
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> we had to raise the wages of the workers to the extent of compelling employers to accelerate the process of mechanization, automation and to promote high technology industries. To implement this corrective wage policy the Skills Development Fund was then set up and a 4% levy was then imposed on employers. Although the Government could train about 20,000-odd workers in one year, there are 1.2 million workers in the labour market who need training. About 300,000 of them have only below Primary 6 education. When we talk of training, some employers may laugh because of the current spate of retrenchments. On the other hand at other times when the workers are busy, employers will say that they do not have the time to be retrained. However, in my view we should take the opportunity now that we have a slower economic growth to retrain our workers. In the long run, the training and retraining of workers will be beneficial to companies as they will then be better able to manage any new technology introduced by their companies. Thus without a skilled workforce, a company certainly cannot mechanise or automate smoothly. Why should we urge the companies to train their workers? Because workers are closely connected with the company in which they work. Therefore, it is only through the company that workers may be trained quickly and conveniently. Most companies or manufacturers know their businesses and market conditions well, but unfortunately often forget that it is equally important to train their workers for their own viability. An example is the BEST courses that we are promoting at present. Apart from the PAP branches and the NTUC, the BEST Courses Council has also encouraged more than 1,000 corporate employers to set up such courses. However, only about 20 over percent of companies responded to the call. Therefore, the best way is to make companies pay to the SDF so that the cost of training expenses can then be reimbursed from such fund. The small and medium companies may find it less beneficial to set up such training courses for their employees. However, collectively with assistance from the Fund they can provide training for their employees. I understand that the SDF has planned for more than 200 courses,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> including courses on cookery and fashion designing. People may say that the SDF has already collected a lot of money. However, it has to be pointed out that the contributions for 1984 has totally been committed to the various training schemes for 1984 and 1985. In other words, the funds which are available at present are accumulations from 1980, 1981 and 1982 because during those periods there were not many comprehensive training schemes that were formulated or proposed. Therefore, the money has not been spent. In order to move towards hightechnology development, the SDF should continue to increase its fund.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important point is that in order to minimise retrenchments we should look into ways of increasing productivity and raising the quality of our products to increase their competitiveness in international markets. We should put greater efforts into training our workers so that we could elicit the best from each individual. Without proper training workers may not be able to meet the challenge of high-tech development and this may be one of the contributing factors for retrenchment. This problem is greater for older worker. Therefore, when the economy improves I am of the view that we ought to restore the SDF contribution to 4%. In a period of economic downturn we understand the Government's rationale to help companies to overcome their present difficulties. But in order to meet future challenges in high-tech industrial development, we should restore the SDF levy to 4% in order to ensure that training schemes will continue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to touch upon the question of shortage of labour. Talking about this topic, it reminds me of the fact that there are 300,000-odd women who have not come out to work. Even worse, some 100,000 working women drop out of the workforce every year because of marriage or childbirth. Manpower is Singapore's only resource. Today there are equal opportunities for education and work for both men and women. To maintain a healthy economy those who are able must participate actively in it and it would indeed be a loss for Singapore if this tremendous potential in its womenfolk
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are not tapped. Only through economic progress and development can we realise the objective of raising the living standard of our people, Personally, it is thus my view that every human potential must be utilised and developed to ensure Singapore's continued economic progress and development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a social view point, to ensure social stability we should work towards having our own local workforce comprising entirely of Singaporean workers. That I believe is the aim of the government and this objective could somewhat be met by encouraging the 300,000-odd women who have not come out to work into the labour market. However at present of greater importance is how to retain the women who are already in the workforce. Before I suggest any solutions or proposals however, I would like to say that before trying to solve a problem we ought to be clear in our minds what our objectives are. We should then have the right perceptions and have confidence in achieving these objectives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I say that we ought to have the right perceptions? This is because there have been many views expressed on the pros and cons of women working outside their homes. There is of course some relevance in the view that the increasing rates of divorce and juvenile delinquency could be partly attributed to women working outside their homes. This is because with economic independence women may be less tolerant in their marriages and this may lead to higher rates of divorce. But the problem of divorce in a society actually related to many factors. One's perception towards this issue is usually moulded by the prevalent social norms, family values and cultural background, etc. For instance, in our conservative society, divorce is normally regarded as an unpleasant and even shameful thing and quite often because of this family members may also intervene to help salvage a marriage. But to the West, it is a personal matter, that is entirely a personal choice. Maybe the more divorces you have gone through, you will, perhaps, become the more popular.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about women coming out to work, in Japan as in the United States
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 50% of them are in the workforce. In spite of this, the divorce rate in Japan is five times lower than that in the United States and juvenile delinquency cases are also fewer than in the US. Compared with the other ASEAN countries, the female participation rate in Singapore is higher, so also is the divorce rate. As regards social and crime problems, I think you all know the answer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me say that whatever measures we take to encourage women to come out to work, I still would stress on personal choice. I am not saying that every woman must come out to work otherwise she would be at fault. What I am saying is that it depends on the individual. But I feel that the Government and the social organizations have the responsibility and duty to take every possible measure to enable married women to make a better choice between looking after the family and coming out to work or even better to be able to take care of both so that all the people concerned will benefit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of working mothers in relation to child development, some say that when the mother comes out to work, it will affect the development of her children. But we have real examples as in the case just after the Second World War, when many married women and widows came out to work yet their children were brought up quite well or satisfactorily. Of course this may not necessarily be so in every case and is certainly debatable. But the point to note here is that there are two viewpoints on the matter. The more optimistic one stresses on quality parent-hood with working parents still able to provide good care for their children. Social organizations and the Government have an important role to play here. We must promote various measures to take care of the situation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just mention some measures that have been taken in Singapore to encourage women to come out to work and have a better social standing. The Government has contributed much in the past 25 years during which period many changes and reformations were made.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> First of all, in 1961 Parliament passed the Women's Charter and the next important reformation was when the Government implemented equal pay for equal work for men and women in the Civil Service. Before that, female civil servants after marriage would be treated as temporary workers. There were also other measures such as the setting up of creches in housing estates and family planning. In 1981 the Government implemented a half day working scheme for women and in 1983 it allowed female civil servants to have one year's unpaid leave to look after their children. In order to help married women the Government also implemented full-day schools for children and reduced their income tax contributions. Encouragement has also been given to three-tier families by HDB, and so on. You may say that since much has been done by the Government there is no need to do anything more. However, we need to review and assess the results of those measures in order to make adjustments, changes and improvements wherever necessary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that the Government should appoint one particular department as a coordinating body to coordinate the measures carried out by the various departments, such as the Ministry of Community Development, the Ministry of Education, and others which have been dealing with the related matters under their respective portfolios. This central coordinating body will be able to coordinate and promote all the various measures. Here, I would like to suggest some improvements. In respect of the half-day working system, for instance, we could make certain adjustments to allow for flexibility in the working hours or in the working conditions of the women.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of setting up creches to enable women to work, although the Government has given financial assistance at the moment, there are only 37 creches in the whole of Singapore, compared with Japan, where there are 22,000 creches. In Japan, the creche accommodation ratio is as follows: For one out of 49 children under one year old, there is one creche that can accommodate him. The ratio is 1:49. One out of nine children between
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> one and two years old can be accommodated in a creche. The ratio is 1:9. For children between three and five years old, one out of four can be accommodated in a creche. The ratio is 1:4. But in Singapore, out of 133 children between two years and six years old, the creche can accommodate only one child. The ratio is 1:133.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB's three-tier family method can also be improved upon. Young couples living away from old parents after having children of their own should realize the advantage of staying together with their parents. When there is a flat available nearby for sale or resale, priority should be given to such couple or aged parents to stay together.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the full-day school, it will be useful to parents and students particularly older parents. The full-day school should thus not be given up just because of failure in the first experiment. To make it attractive, we should consider the various factors like locality, transportation, teaching facilities, the contents of curricula and time-table. I would also like the Government to encourage private enterprises to respond to the Government's measure in giving married women one or two years' unpaid leave to enable them to look after their children. I hope that more systematic aid can be given to the womenfolk who intend to come out. to work, to guide them in lessening their psychological inhibition. There are certain women's organizations which are helping the womenfolk to come out to work but they lack human resource and financial assistance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote some examples from Japan for reference. The rate of female labour participation is nearly 50%, slightly higher than ours. What is to be noted is that for those between 25 and 29 years old, the participation rate is also about 50%. That is to say, 50% of the mothers also come out to work. Those between 40 and 55 years old, the participation rate is 60% whereas in Singapore only 47% and 26% respectively. In Japan, 50% of the children of working mothers are being looked after in the creches, 47% by their grandparents or relatives while in Singapore 43% of children of working women are looked after by their grandparents or relatives and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> about 2% are looked after by the creches. Although women in Japan are working a half-day system, according to what I have read the so called half-day working system is actually a 6-hour day. Women in Japan, quite unlike what we think, play an important role in their economy. As early as the Second World War, women had played an important role in the Japanese economy while their men were in the armed forces engaged in the war. Here in Singapore, ours is an unique society where we may need to accept and absorb Western science and technology and management skills but at the same time continue to preserve our good traditional values and culture, that is the eight good traditional virtues of loyalty, filial piety, humanism, love, courtesy, righteousness, integrity and shame-consciousness. So we need not be worried about any undesirable consequences if we want to encourage our women to come out to work. If we want to increase our national productivity and economic progress and raise the living standard of the people and reduce the gap of wealth between the rich and the poor or to help those poorer people, I feel that the best way is to give them work. So I appeal to the Government to appoint a special department to coordinate, promote and implement various measures to encourage women to come out and participate in various kinds of work in the society.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong): Mr Speaker, Sir,l would like to address my comments today to the substance of the Government's economic policy. When times are not as good as they used to be and firms are not doing well, it is common for the finger to be pointed at the Government, and criticism to be levelled at its policies and what it has been doing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Rochore yesterday made a very comprehensive critique of the policy. I shall refer to some of the things which he said for convenience, because these are arguments, lines of thought, which are common, and which we hear over and over again. He crystallized three arguments, which I would like to discuss.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government should not be in the private sector. It should confine itself to public business. It should not go into entrepreneurship, into enterprise. Secondly, Government surpluses are the cause of private sector deficits. Because the Government has kept its house in order, it has been able to spend within its means, and therefore the private sector is unable to cope within its means. And thirdly, Government expenditure has drastically increased over the years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to present an alternative view, because these are impOrtant issues, and therefore both sides of the argument should be heard. First of all, on the subject of Government in business. Why is this bad? Allegedly, it is bad for two reasons. (1) Bureaucrats are not entrepreneurs. They do not know how to make money. (2) Government exploits its position and squeezes out other private entrepreneurs. In other words, the bureaucrats are too clever at making money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine this. Why did the Government go into business? The Government moved into business where private capital, private enterprise and experience, were lacking, where risks were great, where the contribution to the national economy was significant. These were areas which, if the Government had not moved into, nobody would have moved into. Some examples were given yesterday of Government companies. Let me give a few more - SIA, DBS and NTUC Income.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sort of company is SIA? It is one of the best airlines in the world. It makes money. It is progressive. It is competitive. It is an airline which we are proud of, and whose benefits to us go far beyond the balance sheet and the profit and loss statement, which is very healthy, year after year, at a time when international airlines .in general, and airlines in the West in particular, have been having a very difficult time of making business. Lacking in entrepreneurship? They may be Government servants, but that does not mean they do not have brains, or initiative, or ideas. So that is SIA.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS. It is the only bank in Singapore, even today, which makes long-term loans for industrial purposes. Other banks make commercial loans, short-term. You take it, you do business, you return the money to me. The bank is safe - which is the correct thing for a private bank to do. DBS fosters long-term industrial development of the country. It is a role which DBS has played successfully and which, if any other bank wishes to fulfil, it is most welcome to do so. And DBS also pays dividends and makes money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC Income. Income has become one of the largest insurance agencies in Singapore. Why? Because it developed a brand new, vast, and important insurance market, a market of workers, of union members, of ordinary men-in-the-street, who previously did not make any precautions against ill-health, against death, against the unforeseen. NTUC Income came in and Yes, you have a need for insurance. Let us give it to you at reasonable, very competitive prices."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our economy is that much better as a result of there being SIA, DBS, Income. Have we squeezed other people out? Far from it. We wish others would come in. Perhaps the problem is that these Government companies have become so successful, that rather than attribute it to business acumen, the explanation given is that they have cut corners, and exploited the Government's position. I do not think that explanation holds water.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some investments have gone bad, of course. The Government is not infallible. The Government has never claimed to be infallible. When you are in business, you take risks. And when you take risks, you must know when to cut losses. One of the cardinal principles of this Government is that we do not throw good money after bad. If an investment which looks promising turns out in an unexpected, unfavourable way, well, that's that. It was a bad decision, we learn from it, but we do not throw good money in to rescue it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens to the successful investments? Once it is built up, is there a strong reason for the Government to stay on? There is no strong reason, and in fact as the Minister for Finance has stated in his
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Budget statement, we are planning to move out of some of these activities, as the private markets have developed, and there is more capital available to finance these activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would just like to leave this thought with you: there is nothing sinful in the Government owning a profitable investment. Would you rather the Government own loss-making investments? Surely if there is a profit, it redounds to our credit, and we are proud of what we have done. So although we are moving gradually into an expanded private role in our economic development, and we hope the private entrepreneurs can move in as quickly as possible, nevertheless, we are not at all ashamed about what we have done in business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument is about surpluses: Government surpluses are bad because Government surpluses are financed by private deficits. This is a most remarkable argument. I consulted the Member for Leng Kee yesterday. He said he had never heard of it before. So I really could not figure out what it means. But surpluses, so far as orthodox economists understand them, are the result of a successful, growing, prospering economy, and prudent management on the part of the Government. Why do we have surpluses? Is it because we have been raising taxes year by year? Is it because we have been spending money like water? Neither. We have, in fact, been reducing our tax rates year by year, every year, with one exception, and that is, car taxes, for good reasons of public policy, not reasons of fiscal policy. And every year the Minister for Finance has come forward, and every year the Straits Times has published, "Another Painless Budget." You can read the records. So each year the burden on the economy has been less, each year we have lived within our means, and spent the money wisely on things which we need.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these surpluses, we have a strong Singapore Dollar, we have large foreign reserves, and we have a very low inflation rate. Last year, it was 2.5%. So all his talk about inflationary policies being out-of-fashion in this inflationary time, flummoxes me. I cannot figure out what it
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> means. I tried to understand a bit more, and the argument was further elaborated into talking about deficit financing - that the Group of Seven, the most advanced industrialized countries in the world, have all gone for deficit financing. Why is it we are in surplus?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there something wrong with that? The United States for years has been struggling helplessly with its deficit problem. They have US$200 billion short a year, and there is no way they can solve this problem. They are extremely concerned, and they are hoping to wish it away. That is effectively what Congress is doing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you wish that on us? Can we, as a government, spend money, put money into people's pockets, ask them to go and spend it, and that way fill up our shipyards, fill up our hotel rooms? What will happen to the money? It will be spent on consumption, it will be spent on imports. The Singapore Dollar will go down, prices will be driven up, inflation will be up. We will have the worst of all possible worlds. What is the sensible way to fill up the hotel rooms? Encourage tourism, is it not? How do you encourage tourism? Well, one way is to light up Chinatown, light up Orchard Road, and invite tourists to come. But somehow or other, yesterday morning, I remember during the Oral Questions the opposite argument was put forward, "Why are we lighting up Chinatown?" It is extremely strange. We light up Chinatown so that the tourists will come in, the hotels fill up, the retail trade moves, and everything is carried along. That is why we light up Chinatown.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked about overheads. What overheads are you talking about? Payroll tax has gone. Skills Development Fund - you heard what the Member for Yuhua said - that is for training, for upgrading, for improving our skills, for raising our productivity. That is what SDF is about. Cut it down? In order to stagnate? What is an overhead? CPF - is that an overhead? Is that something which the Government takes away from the workers? Or is it something which is part of the salary, which belongs to the workers, something which the workers use to spend for Medisave, for a house, and for old age?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> CPF is part of the worker's earnings, and we are proud that we are able to have such a large amount of savings put aside for a house to live in and for old age. Very few countries can do this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our payroll was supposed to have doubled in five years. (I do not know whether this is exactly so, I have not checked the numbers.) But if so, I think we should congratulate ourselves. What does it mean to have a payroll which doubles in five years? It means our high wage policy has worked. Workers' incomes have gone up. Inflation has stayed down, and that means real purchasing power has increased, We deliberately raised wages because the alternative is to go for low wages, low skills, and low standards of living - misery. Is that desirable?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has payroll gone up? Payroll has gone up because productivity has gone up, because workers are producing more, because it is more worthwhile for employers to employ workers. If it were not, workers would be unemployed. And despite everything which the Member for Anson and others say, there are no workers unemployed in significant numbers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason why payroll has doubled in five years is that this is the way to share wealth. This is the solution to the problem of the 10-15% of the population which we have been talking about. To have the whole economy booming, and to have all share in the income. Do you want to have a low-wage policy? Do you want to have a payroll that remains stagnant in five years? I do not think we would have Opposition Members criticizing us if the payroll remained stagnant for five years. I think we would be the Opposition, if payroll remains stagnant in five years. That is what we have done.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Government surpluses, financing private deficits, or private deficits financing Government surpluses - I do not know, but perhaps I shall have to seek some more advice after this from the Member for Whampoa. But I really cannot figure that one out. Least of all can I make sense of that, when we go on to the next
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> argument that Government expenditure is up, and that is bad. I would have thought, if you said Government surpluses are bad, then Government expenditure should be good. If I am spending money, I am trying to get rid of the surplus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, Government expenditure was also criticized. What are we talking about? From 1979 until 1985, our GDP has expanded in real terms by about 70%, that means nearly double. And our requirements, our standards, our expectations, have correspondingly doubled. What does the Government spend money on? It spends money on defence; it spends money on health; it spends money on education. It spends money on investment in people, it spends money on providing the infrastructure for the wealth to be created. We are proud of what we spent. What have .we spent which we think we have wasted money on? There is none. We have spent money on universities, on investing in facilities for our people, on hospitals for our people, on necessary equipment for our defence forces.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we disagree that Government expenditure should go up in this fashion, then I think a supplementary question would be in order. What would you propose the Government not spend the money on? Tell us. Do you prefer to give up NUS? Or would you rather prefer to give up NTI? Or perhaps, if neither of the above, you would like to sacrifice two junior colleges, one hospital, and half a dozen other teachers? What do we wish to sacrifice? I think we buy things which we need. We discuss the Budget which we spend. We discuss the items of expenditure. We shall be spending the next two weeks doing this, and if anybody believes that we should have a Budget which is half what it is, I think we have time to debate that. Let us hear which he wishes to do without.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the arguments are so self-contradictory that they only realize the absurdities of the business when they all come together at the same speech. Well, we are talking serious business here. This is not a court. This is a Parliament in which we debate. In court, you can do this, and there is a good reason you can do this. If a person is charged with murder, he is allowed to make incompatible lines of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> defence. My first line of defence, "Your Honour, I was not there." My second line of defence, in case you do not believe me, "I was there, but I did not hit him." And my third line of defence, in case you still do not believe me, "I was there and I hit him, but he did not die straightaway." I do not know how many people charged with murder get away with those lines of argument. I would not advise it in this House.
  <br>12.13pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Abbas Abu Amin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Abbas Abu Amin (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Budget day has often been looked upon as "a day of reckoning" for the taxpayers and businessmen alike. With the exception of the motoring public whose fate will always be a foregone conclusion as long as Government is intent in its endeavour to curb the increase in car population through heavier taxation on related items, it has not been the case for the others in Singapore when the 1985 Budget was announced by the Hon. Minister. Sir, I agree with the hon. Member for Leng Kee that the Budget should be viewed in its entirety to realize its overall implications in relation to local conditions and the world economy which has always influenced our own.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was indeed a well-prepared Budget, designed to motivate the private sector to accept a revitalized economic programme in which businessmen and employers must themselves play decisive roles. This "Businessman's Budget", as it has been enthusiastically hailed in a local press, serves as an open challenge to the private sector to take a leading role and steer Singapore's economy into a new phase of economic excellence. The cost-cutting incentives offered by the Minister have been exacting ones. They are realistic and timely, though some of them have been considered, in some quarters, to be long overdue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, I am sure that the private sector will be able to accept with confidence and renewed vigour the Government's challenge to establish Singapore as an international centre for finance, tourism, sophisticated services and specialized products. With further Government encouragement and continued
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> support, by way of a high-level economic committee to review the general economy, Big Business will be able to meet new challenges ahead and raise Singapore's economy to greater heights and achievements in the late 90s and beyond.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister's decision to provide encouragement to those who take time, effort and expense to upgrade themselves by way of tax deductions is, in principle, an appropriate move and in keeping with present trends found in a highly sophisticated market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of economic restructuring to upgrade our industries to more highly sophisticated, brain-intensive industries, the quality of our workforce in terms of higher technology and modern methods of operations must be further enhanced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mechanization, automation and computerization to work successfully, our workers must be competent enough to operate them and operate them effectively so that the desired results can be achieved. They must therefore be trained and retrained to meet new demands.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in our keenness to promote the acquisition of higher skills among our skilled workforce, we must not lose sight of the plight of our unskilled and semi-skilled workers who are, by and large, at the lowest rung of our economic ladder. This group of workers, because of their low educational background, have often been side-tracked from this race to acquire new skills. Unless they are given the opportunity to advance to high level skills, they will not be able to contribute significantly and be more productivity. They will remain in lowly-paid, unskilled jobs, jobs which are bound to become obsolete with time. I do believe, Sir, that many of these workers can be upgraded if given the right motivation, encouragement and opportunity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now we heard the hon. Member for Yuhua explaining the good work done by the VITB, the NTUC and a few enlightened companies to train their workers by organizing BEST classes. Perhaps more such courses could be organized in future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the move to reduce the Skills Development Fund contribution and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the suspension of the payroll tax is another move in the right direction that can reinforce the principle I have just outlined. However, it must not be seen by employers as only tax bonuses to boost their own profits without further regard for the basic principles that had prompted their introduction in the first place; ie, to impress upon employers and managers the need for skills training and manpower development for their own workers. Employers should now reciprocate the Government's gesture in these two areas by ploughing back the money "saved" to establish better relationship within their companies. They should initiate their own skill development programmes to upgrade the skills of their workers locally so as to enhance their company's productivity. There should be more welfare schemes for the workers so that better employer/ employee relationship can be established.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lest we forget the 2% reduction in the Skills Development Fund contributions, though useful, will not however help the smaller companies very much. They require more assistance from Government if they are to survive during this trying period.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, Sir, is a small country with a small market force. She needs supportive industries which are mainly operated by Singaporeans. The shift to higher technology which is good for Singapore will put a great strain on these supportive industries if special considerations are not given to them by way of lessening their financial constraints. For a start, Sir, it is my considered opinion that these smaller companies should be exempted temporarily from contributing to the Skills Development Fund.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the decision taken by the Hon. Minister for Finance to pay the 13th month NPAA on a pro-rated basis to those who leave the service under circumstances beyond their control, before completing the year, was a commendable one, and I fully support the sentiments and rationale behind this decision. This has been a long standing issue and I am sure Members of this House, especially the Member for Geylang Serai, are pleased to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> see that it has finally been put in its correct perspective.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to comment on the tax increases. The same rationale has been used to justify increases in road tax, petrol and other related items. The Government has always been adamant that these measures would reduce the car population in Singapore. However, Sir, in actual fact, there has always been an increase in the car population. While the increase in such taxes did not produce the desired results, Government has profited by it through increased revenue. This has cast doubts among the motoring public as to whether the Government is serious in its intent to reduce the car population in Singapore. There is still much unhappiness among the motoring public because the measures taken and the policies governing the car industry are not really consistent. One example is that there is no restriction on the number of cars the public can buy as long as they can afford the price. This in no way subscribes to the Government's intention to curb the car population. Meanwhile, those who need their cars for want of better transportation, will have to tighten their belts and endure the burden until such time when they are completely overwhelmed by tax increases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already announced that the MRT system will resolve road congestion problems and provide better public transportation so that there will be no necessity to own a car. Until that day comes, Sir, I feel that the motoring public should not be further burdened with heavy taxes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in taxi fares may, on the contrary, necessitate the lower income group car owners to continue to maintain their cars despite the heavy burden they are made to bear. Again, this would contradict Government's objective to reduce the car population. The increase in petrol price will not only affect the car owners but also the non car owners and non taxi users through indirect increases in food prices and other services. This chain reaction, Sir, will eventually hit the lower income group the hardest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would urge the Government to look into other areas for a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> more definite system to reduce the car population and congestion on our roads. The public transport system must be further improved to encourage more people to use them. During peak hours, more Scheme B buses should be put on the roads to ease the peak hour traffic. Perhaps school children should be provided with a special bus service to cater for their own special needs. I agree with the suggestions by some hon. Members that a complete re-think on the PARF and ARF schemes be undertaken, with a view to limiting the purchase of new cars without giving one for scrap in exchange.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>12.24 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been declared in the Budget statement that the aim of the Government is to have increased economic growth. It is a worthy aim. But this year is a year which is bad for business, and the most pressing problem for the Government to overcome is to make sure that the cost of running businesses in Singapore does not increase any further. Our GNP growth is predicted to fall from 8.2% last year to about 5-7% level. One Japanese market research institute has predicted that our GNP will drop to about 5.9%. Most businesses in Singapore therefore shall survive only on small margins. What is the reason for the rising cost of business in Singapore? Ask any businessman. Probably he will not tell you about the wages, but he will rattle off repeated familiar reasons: high cost of property tax, high cost of rentals, high CPF contributions and, up to last year, payroll tax, Skills Development Fund levy, high transport costs. Every one of these factors or pushing up costs in business is an act of the Government. Is the Government itself making attempts to bring down its own cost of running the administration? The answer is a clear no. We have heard from the Member for Rochore rattling off figures of increasing costs to maintain the Government administration. He was so concerned that he even advised the Government to make structural changes his year in the administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have examined the Budget, and what do I see? Nearly all expenditures for all political appointments in all Ministries have increased except two. Two Ministries have jacked up their political appointment expenditure by 235%, increases from about $200,000 to over $500,000. On the average, the increased expenditure on political appointments was 65% more than last year's figures. This ever-increasing trend of Government expenditure is unhealthy. Government expenditure has risen sharply from $2.5 billion for fiscal year '79 to $6.1 billion for this year, an almost22 '-fold increase. This expenditure increase that I mentioned does not include (1) development expenditure, (2) servicing of public debt, (3) transfer made to the Development Fund Account. The Government expenditure increases are highly inconsistent with the present bleak economic outlook of the country, especially when all sectors of the economy, ironically, have been called by the Government to trim down their overheads to ride over the present slow business period.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget is not free from blame for pushing up costs. The 25% absolute price increase in petrol, as a consequence of increased petrol tax from 50% to 60%, has made our petrol in Singapore so much more costly that our motorists are reported to be flocking to pumps across the Causeway. This trend obviously will continue. Each full tank paid for in Johor Baru will cost between S$20-$30 less. It is by our own Government's action that our local petrol pumps are losing business to those across the Causeway. This will prompt us to ask: is the Government really sincere in helping our local businessmen? It is time now for the local businessmen to tell the Government to bring down its own costs of high overheads. An increased Government expenditure will ultimately bring up costs in the private sector because Government expenditure is paid or by revenue. As we are all aware, the main source of revenue is income tax and indirect taxes. These two forms of taxes comprise about 65% of revenue collected. The fact that Government revenue increased from $4.1 billion for fiscal year '79 to the present $10.6 billion shows a substantial increase in the burden of tax borne by Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase in the burden of tax can be attributed to the increase in Government expenditure. Taxi drivers will, with effect from 1st October this year, have to carry an additional burden of tax when the $6,600 diesel tax is imposed, but ultimately the public, being taxi users, will bear this increase. Motorists are also subjected to a higher burden of tax, with the 15% road tax increase and the petrol tax increase from 50% to 60%. All this additional burden of tax, as previous Members of this House have said, will be passed on to the ultimate consumers, and inevitably bringing up another round of inflation. It should be stressed that our people are already subjected to a heavy tax burden. This is concretely evidenced by the hefty rise in Government expenditure from $4.1 billion for fiscal year '79 to the present $10.6 billion as mentioned earlier.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of $6.4 billion in revenue to be collected will have to come mainly from income tax and indirect taxes. As mentioned, these two forms of taxes account for about 65% of the increase in Government revenue. Despite the fact that Government has announced concessions, such as the suspension of payroll tax and a cut in Skills Development Fund contributions by 2% to ease the burden of our business sector so as to tide them through this present difficult economic situation and there is a projected drop in revenue from income tax, the total projected revenue of the Government remains unchanged at $10.6 billion. The total amount of revenue remains unchanged, ie to be maintained. This would mean that the loss of revenue on the concessions given and the projected lower income tax receipts will have to be made good by increasing the burden of other taxes. It must be noted that however Government shifts the burden, it cannot be denied that the burden will still ultimately fall on the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that in this Budget the concessions given in suspending the payroll tax and the Skills Development Fund cut by 2% and the decrease in entertainment tax will have to a certain extent be made good by the diesel tax,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> petrol tax, car road tax increases, unless of course, as the Member for Rochore has mentioned, the Government does not spring surprises in customs and excise tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards CPF, it is heartening to note that the CPF rate of 50% will not be increased. I support the Member for Rochore's suggestion to cut the present rate down to 40%. At this rate of contribution, it will be enough to give workers their security in old age and to purchase a home and enough for their Medisave.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party in the last general election has already mentioned that the 50% contribution is too high. The massive accumulated CPF funds now stand at $22 billion. This massive accumulated amount will eventually cause a lot of problems to the Government, in particular, to paying back the money when a contributor reaches 55 years of age. The suggested postponement of repayment will not solve the problems. (t is time Government laid the bare facts regarding the intended postponement of the repayment of CPF to contributors before this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a question which everybody likes to ask: how is the Government going to fund the repayments of CPF to their depositors? Is the Government funding CPF repayments through taxation? I hope the Minister in charge of CPF will enlighten us on these important points.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was stated in the Budget statement that "education and training is the cornerstone of our economic upgrading strategy and the key to a better life for our people." Mr Speaker, Sir, can we achieve this aim under our present education system? The Minister has now given a choice to parents to choose whether they want their children to be streamed at their third year of school. Is this not an admission that there is something wrong with streaming? I would say that streaming at the third year of school is bad; it is cruel and it is humiliating to a child. The child at that tender age is not fully developed. If we look at streaming from the point of view of the psychologist, or the educationist, or even from the sociological point of view, we find that there is no justification whatsoever.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychologists have told us that there is such a thing as a late developer. A child at eight or nine years of age is not fully developed. He may appear to be slow at that age but when he reaches 15 or 16 years of age, he may suddenly blossom. But if he were already streamed at that early age, then he would be deprived of an education. Members of this House would certainly know who are the well known examples of late developers. Sir Winston Churchill was one of them and, of course, the other one commonly cited is Albert Einstein, the greatest physicist the world has ever known.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, streaming is not based on general intelligence. It is based on language ability. A child may be good in other subjects, but if he fails in the second language he is sent to the Monolingual stream. Is that fair to the child? A child at eight or nine years of age is a very sensitive person. If he were told that he is a failure, a reject, no good, this traumatic experience may be irreversible, and it would do that child more harm than good. You put the child into the Normal Stream, and once his self-image, his self-confidence is shattered, how is he going to be able to learn? Teachers will tell you that students in the Normal class are, in fact, becoming unteachable. So there is no question that a child is able to learn at his own pace. The fact is that his self-image and self-confidence has already been shattered. Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Minister for Education or the Minister concerned would look into this question of streaming at greater depth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would just like to deal with this increase in diesel tax for taxis. Now, the Minister for Communications and lnformation over the TV and the press has stated that even if the fall in demand is 20%, the taxi driver will still not suffer any loss. But we are confident, having looked at the problem very closely and very carefully for a long period of time, we are confident that it would not drop below 15%. Then we get a very contradictory statement from the Secretary-General of the NTUC, who is also the Second Deputy Prime Minister. He is reported in the press to have said that the cab fare rise was too sudden and too high and that the Ministry of Communica-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tions and Information would review taxi fare increases and the new diesel tax levy. The Member for Teck Ghee has said that this is not a court house. If it were a court house, this kind of contradictory evidence would have shattered whichever side the two Members are in.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Hear! hear!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> We have got two clear-cut conflicting statements. Which one is correct? Is the Minister for Communications and Information correct? Or is the Second Deputy Prime Minister's statement correct? On the one hand, one Minister has said that they have studied the matter closely, very carefully, and for a long period of time, and all their calculations and all their feedback from the taxi drivers have shown that they are confident that despite a 15% drop in occupancy, of course no traffic jams, taxi drivers will still make a higher income when the $6,600 diesel tax is imposed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, as my learned friend, the Member for Anson, has said, this matter has been brought before the Cabinet and the Cabinet must have viewed it in the presence of the Second Deputy Prime Minister. And if the Second Deputy Prime Minister was present, or at least he could have read the Minutes of Proceedings in the Cabinet, he would have known that the Ministry of Communications had looked at the matter closely and carefully and for a long time. And if that is the case, why does he come out and say, "Well, this thing has been introduced suddenly. This is a sudden hike." It is most unbelievable. If this Government is going to be credible, I hope they would not give out such conflicting reports.
  <br>

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> So this matter has caused great unhappiness amongst the taxi drivers. There are about 12,000 of them, and the diesel tax increase will contribute to the Government revenue by about $79 million. This is no small matter. I hope that the Government will come out with clearer statements. And if they are not sure of the policy, I would urge that they should altogether either drop the idea of imposing the $6,600 diesel

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, historians looking back over current events in Singapore will rightly conclude that the 80's represent a crucial period of transition. The political transition is in evidence and I shall comment on it later. Allow me now to describe the elements of the economic transition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me comment on the world economic conditions. Let us never forget our role in the world economy, how small we are geographically, in terms of population, what kind of area in the world we find ourselves in, how close the nearest war is to our borders, how dependent we are on world trade and investment. It would be completely foolish of Singaporeans at this juncture to turn insular,to be so concerned with domestic problems that they forget the more basic fundamentals of our survival.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the trends in the world economy? First, despite the economic recovery in America, Europe is still lagging behind. Japan is recovering all right. But there is fear that overall world economic recovery may shortly be aborted. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, among the industrial nations, there is a fundamental shift in the structure of their economies to a service-oriented economy, away from manufacturing towards services. This must bring in train stresses and strains, the lowering of productivity, the threat to world trade. Already we have seen increasing protectionism. Even as tariffs have been lowered, non-tariff barriers have come to the fore, and these non-tariff barriers which are quantitative, like orderly marketing arrangements, voluntary export restraints and so on, represent very potent threats to the world economy, especially to the viability of developing countries like ours.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, we are seeing an escalation of protectionism, escalation into services. Even tourism has been subject to exit taxes and other forms of taxes. It
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> extends also to higher technology products, an area which we have been hoping to get further into. And because of these protectionist devices and their extent (of them) foreign investment has become much more limited and this is evident in our latest figures for Singapore. It has nothing to do or little to do with domestic cost conditions. It has everything to do with world economic conditions. And if Members of this House would want economic lessons, let them turn to proper experts and not quacks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Let them pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Well, we would not charge a fee for Members of this House. Furthermore, Sir, the industrial countries are in the process of re-industrialization, as the Minister for Finance told us. It is a curious phenomenon. It is a phenomenon born of protectionism. Because the Americans and the Europeans have raised such high import barriers they are inducing the Japanese to invest in America, in Europe, otherwise Japanese exports will be shut out from those markets. It is a very inefficient form of investment and it is a kind of investment that threatens the viability of developing countries like ours, because not only do we have to compete with countries exporting to America but we now have to compete with Japanese investments in America and in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are the debt problems of developing countries which the Minister for Finance has highlighted. It is now US$900 billion and by the end of this year it will get close to US$970 billion. The sheer cost of servicing these debts alone amounts to $90 billion or more a year, a staggering sum when you compare with our GDP. We need to ask ourselves: how did these developing countries get into so much debt, so much difficulty? The reasons are not far to find, and I find the reasons very instructive for us here in Singapore, especially in this period of transition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is because those countries have low savings rate and I challenge any economist anywhere to dispute this: that the basic cause of the difficulties in many countries in the world, developed and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> developing, is because they are saving too little. They are consuming too much. They are living off the future. Not only private citizens but governments are doing this together. It is the blind leading the blind, and they all fall into the pit together. It is irresponsible government spending, wasteful government spending. It is governmental corruption that has added to the woes of these countries. If we compare with our own country, we have much to be thankful for.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may gripe about our high CPF rates, our high rates of savings. I am not ashamed of them. As an economist, I would tell you in this House, Sir, and the Members here, that Singapore would not be where it is today without the high savings and investment that Government policies have engendered. Singapore would not be where it is today if we had irresponsible government expenditure. Do you know the surest evidence of irresponsible government expenditure? Where it is to be found? It is to be found in the rate of inflation. And we have consistently low rates of inflation compared to the rest of the world. We have 2.6% last year or an average of 4% over the last five years as compared with double-digit inflations or compared with a thousand per cent rate of inflation in Israel. I was in Israel in November of last year and you can see the kind of economy that has to cope with 1,000% rate of inflation a year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know what it means? People are having to make trips to the bank several times a day. They postpone their payments as long as they can. Why? Because with every delay in payment there is a gain in terms of inflation. People are trying to cheat other people, and there is a lot of expenditure on bank tellers and bank clerks just to cope with the number of zeros that the cash registers have to register. In no time at all, such a rate of inflation would bring any government down. We do not need an opposition to bring this Government down if this Government is guilty of misuse of funds. The rate of inflation will be so high. People will be out in the streets. It will be revolution. It will be riots. It will be mayhem. We would not be able to debate in an orderly fashion like this in this Chamber. So I say, let us count our blessings.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more than that, the de the developing countries poses a severe threat to the world economy. It threatens to de-stabilize the international monetary system. It threatens to bring on a depression so severe that it will make the last Great Depression look like a minor recession. These are the facts of life that we have to face up to and if we want to reduce savings at this time, where are we going to get the wherewithal to tide over a world depression of long duration, of great depth?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, supporters of the Member for Potong Pasir have written to the press and have supported his position on growing vegetables and rearing chickens. Yes, we have in a sense made fun of his proposal. But what is the reality? The reality is, we do not have the land. We would like to rear chickens. I like to rear chickens. I am growing vegetables in my garden for the information of the Member for Potong Pasir, but I do it as a hobby. We cannot be self-sufficient if we try to grow our own food. It is just impossible. Let us have a public debate. Let us have the facts and figures. Let us not beguile the public with simple statements that look good.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we could survive a great depression by rearing chickens and growing vegetables, Mr Speaker, Sir, the world would be in a better position. It would be in a very blessed position. We would have no problems. We would not have to agonize over the possibility of a great depression. It is going to be that $22 billion worth of reserves that we have that is going to tide us over some years of a great depression. Make no mistake about it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associated with these problems are the currency gyrations that we see in a world economy today. These currency gyrations, instability in exchange rates, are threatening the world economy in ways which are not evident. They are bringing on added protectionism. They add to the cost of our exporters and our importers as well. When you export a good and you do not get payment until three months later, in the meantime, the exchange rate has moved against you, you have to bear the cost, the risks of the exchange rate change. These, Mr Speaker, Sir, are the real cost, real threats that our people have to face up to.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not play shadow boxing. Let us not set up straw man to punch and so on. Let us not try to assign blame where blame is not due. Yes, there are certain things about Government policies that may need correction and I will come to some of those later but let us first put things in perspective, as the Member for Leng Kee exhorted us yesterday.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was reading in the papers, Sir, that the United States, the economic super-power in the world, for the first time this year may become a nett debtor to the rest of the world. You think about it. Their government is in debt every year to the tune of US$200 billion. That has had the result of pushing up interest rates all over the world. They have had to borrow money from the rest of the world and paradoxically the US dollar has gone up in value. For how long, it is anybody's guess. The bankers and the currency traders will tell you that they are holding their breath. They never know when the dollar is going to come plummeting down. It is a fool's paradise people are living in. President Reagan would like to have a Singapore-style budget. He would like not to have to worry about a deficit of this sort. He would like to have a surplus that we have in Singapore. It is a much more pleasant situation, much easier to govern under such conditions. Given these difficulties, we have got to be aggressive. We have got to have initiative. We have got to be innovative in searching out new markets, new opportunities in the world economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, let me talk about the public sector here in Singapore. The achievements of full employment, low inflation, balance of payments surpluses, public sector surpluses, these are no accident. We come back to the same point that I made earlier. Because of high savings rates, because of responsible government expenditure, because of emphasis on development rather than on recurrent expenditure, we have gotten to the place today, a very blessed position, a position that many countries in the world would like to be in. We take our jobs for granted. Our people just move from job to job. I like to talk to my former students, graduates
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> from the University. Three years after graduation, many of them have had three to four jobs and with each job they get promotion and they get a higher salary. That is not exactly desirable but that illustrates for us the opportunities available to our people here in Singapore. Again, opportunities that we take for granted. Perhaps we should send truck-loads or plane-loads of young people to Europe, maybe not in a little Volkswagen, but in a bus trip across Europe. It will open their eyes to see what unemployment means - the degradation, the shame of unemployment, having to live on the dole, on subsidies from the Government, on handouts. I thank God we are not that kind of country, not that kind of economy, and let us keep it that way.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we want to advocate measures, like reducing CPF, if we are really genuinely concerned about the poor, the low-income group, let us be mindful that it is precisely the low-income group that need their CPF savings most of all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> They are the ones that depend completely on the CPF savings to finance their purchase of HDB flats. They are the ones that are in danger of not having enough CPF balances at age 55. I challenge anybody to contradict what I am saying and produce figures to show me I am wrong. And we are concerned. Government wants to help the lowest 15-20% of the population. And how can we uplift their standards of living if we want them to spend more and discourage them from saving? How can we do it? So I say, be careful what we advocate here in this House. It is superficially appealing but it is going to hurt a lot of people, the very people we claim we want to help.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is moving towards what may be called privatization. I think this is all to the good and as the Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry ---

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was commenting on the Central Provident Fund when we adjourned for lunch. The Member for Potong Pasir asked whether the CPF would be able to repay its contributors when the time comes for withdrawal. I have here the Monthly Digest of Statistics, February 1985, and on page 98, Table 11.20, the data given is as follows: in 1984, the CPF collected $5.4 billion but the amount withdrawn was only $3.5 billion. Of this $3.5 billion withdrawn, only $817 million represented withdrawal at the retirement age. In other words, only 30% of the total amount collected for the year was withdrawn by people upon retirement. In other words, on the basis of the current figures, every year the CPF takes in more money than the amount withdrawn by people upon retirement. The total amount due to contributors is $22.7 billion. It might interest the Member for Potong Pasir to know that our external reserves for this year happen to be exactly that figure, $22.7 billion. I believe that is an underestimate because our gold stocks, as I understand, have been valued at cost, and so the actual figure may be higher.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir also mentioned that because of rising Government expenditure, Government has had to tax more and more each year. I just looked up the figures in the Yearbook of Statistics, page 204, for the last five years. I find that the percentage of increase in Government revenue from year to year has been dropping:

  1982-83                   15.2

  1983-84                  - 0.02

  1984-85                   12.4

</pre>
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Sir, statistics can be made to lie. The Senior Minister in the Prime Minister's Office has exhorted us to tell the whole truth, but some people tell everything but the truth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, I would like to make some comments on the Government's proposal to sell off Government companies. I think it is a good move at this time. After 25 years of building up a very solid infrastructure, after much effort to attract the multinationals to set up bases in Singapore to export, it is time we gave stimulus to the private sector in Singapore. As to Government companies, the Minister of State for Trade and Industry said earlier, in defense of Government's efforts in these companies, that by and large they have done well. But at the same time I would urge the Government to look carefully to see whether some of these companies might not have departed from their original objectives, or that they might have exceeded whatever authority or original goals given to them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of divesting Government ownership, I think one must make a distinction between privatization of ownership and privatization of management. I think it may be wise to go beyond privatization of ownership and to allow more private management to take over some of these companies. And I would like to see that, in the process, there is more share ownership by workers-a process already begun I believe if one reads press statement about Singapore Airlines (SIA). It has from its inception been encouraging employees to buy share. So when the Government offers its shares to the public, I am sure this would be a point that they would pay attention to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, we come to the question of our taxation policy. Over the last few years, we have seen a switch in terms of Government tax policy - away from taxes on income to taxes on expenditure. The rationale for this policy should be obvious, namely, that Government is trying to encourage greater production and trying to give more incentives to individuals and firms to produce more. Let us never forget that it is only when we can produce more that we can safely spend and consume more. To do otherwise is to court disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sir, here, as in other countries, taxes on expenditure are very unpopular measures and, beyond a point, they even become counter-productive. Taxes on expenditure have been used in Singapore to achieve certain social goals. We need to ask ourselves a number of questions. First, do people understand the entire rationale for these taxes, for example, in the car ownership, taxes on taxis, ie, the diesel tax, and so on? Do people understand these policies? Are people able to see the comprehensive road transport policy of the Government? There are buses, there is the MRT to come, there are taxis, there are private cars, private vehicles. Perhaps more explanation need to be given. At the same time, hon. Members in this House have brought to the Government's attention that taxes which impose costs on people and on the production process can have a multiplier effect. And I think Government would be foolish not to take this into consideration. The problem is, when taxes on expenditure become too high, people get too angry; and when they get too angry; they stop listening. So we have got to defuse the anger and to get the people to listen to the rationale. There is clearly a need, as several Members in this House have pointed out, the need to look for alternatives to fiscal measures to achieve a social policy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the private sector itself? So far, nobody in this House has really said anything about what the private sector can and should do for itself. Neither in the press do I read any statements by the private sector about what they can do and what they ought to be doing for themselves. People complain about paternalism. On the other hand, people should not treat Government like a "Big Daddy" that can give hand-outs and goodies. I think we have got to disabuse people of this attitude towards Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when there is an economic challenge, or the downturn, our entrepreneurs, our businessmen, must search for effective ways to overcome the problems. They need to look for new lines of production, perhaps new markets, to have
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> greater efforts at productivity, and a willingness to use some of the fat profits accumulated over the past five years for times such as this, so that they can hold out during a period of recession. I believe that our people are more resilient, more enduring, but they need to speak out exactly what they can do, share ideas of what could be done. And above all, one should not panic. One should not create an atmosphere of panic. The banks, in particular, should not over-react. I believe they have been over-reacting to the Hoo Thye case. I think we do ourselves a tremendous disservice if we over-react both publicly and privately. In every crisis, there is opportunity, and I believe myself that we have all the vital ingredients for a great new boom to come. Firstly, we have an excellent infrastructure. Secondly, we have created tremendous excess capacity, whether it be hotel rooms, shopping complexes, offices, or residences. All we need are the people to fill these rooms and offices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is plenty of capital around but we need to redirect the capital away from speculative channels to productive channels. I have advocated over SBC, on Friday Background, that the Government should consider a lowering of company taxes from the present 40%. If over the years we can gradually lower this tax, say, to the level of Hong Kong, I believe we will see a tremendous influx of new businesses, new head offices being established here, to fill up those empty offices and shopping centres. We have the trained manpower. We have been investing in this social infrastructure, whether it be university or technical and vocational training. What we need is simply a release of entrepreneurial energies. And I believe our people are creative, and I believe that the vision of the year 2000 of creating a City of Excellence, a Society of Distinction, is achievable. That is within our reach if only we are united, if only we work together towards constructive policies. We can bring in the tourists if we make the efforts, as are being made. We can encourage new companies to come in.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much, Sir, for the economic transition. Now, if I may venture a few words on political transition. As we have now got
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> a group of younger leaders, people are looking at them to see whether they have style or substance, or preferably both. I venture a classification of leadership, a four-fold classification. Firstly, soft-headed and soft-hearted; secondly, soft-headed and hard-hearted; thirdly, hard-headed and hard-hearted; and fourthly, hard-headed and soft-hearted. Now, I know what Members would prefer, namely, the fourth category. A hard-headed government with the heart soft enough to be caring and compassionate for the needs of the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, here I might give a little anecdote. I met an ex-MP recently. He was formerly in Government. He was very critical of several aspects of Government policy. And as I let him talk, after a while I asked him this question, "If you are so critical, and if you claim you have been so critical for so long, why did you stay so long in the Government?" And he gave this answer, and it is something which should really make us sit up and take note. He said to me, "The reason I stayed so long is because the Prime Minister is an honest man; the Cabinet is honest. They are for a better Singapore. That is why I put up with their nonsense." Therein lies a lesson for our younger leaders. If they can continue this tradition of honesty and effective government then we can have a bright future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But maybe I can give a word to the older leaders. Ex-MPs and ex-Cabinet Ministers can be one of two things. Firstly, they can be bitter in resentment, vengeful, bent on destructive criticism, kicking the ball into their own goal post. They will become the laughing stock of Singapore. People will ask, "Wasn't he part of the team responsible for the very policies he is now criticizing?" On the other hand, these older leaders can be elder statesmen. Beneath the grey hairs and beyond the receding hair lines, there is the wisdom of years that can be tapped by the younger leaders. They can be graceful in retirement, a little anxious at times perhaps about the bold new policies of their successors but, by and large, able to enjoy their pensions. Perhaps there is a third option: we can export their services to China and other places.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have a word for the Opposition. The Opposition, Sir, is a part of the political transition. The question is: what kind of Opposition does the public want? I know what the public does not want. They do not want a destructive Opposition, an abusive Opposition, an irresponsible Opposition, bent on mischief. The public wants a constructive Opposition. They want a credible Opposition and not superficially credible, mouthing apparently truthful platitudes, but people who know what they are saying, really truthful, and having done their homework carefully.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us raise the level of debate in this House and outside the House. I agree with some writers to the press that we should not be personal. If I have appeared to be personal at times and have offended the hon. Members of the Opposition, I do apologize for it. But I reserve the right to be angry, Sir, if I see Singapore's best interests being threatened.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a proposal. The proposal is that the Government should provide briefings, information that is not secret, to educate the Opposition MPs in Statecraft. Perhaps then we shall see more constructive debates and propositions in this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second proposal is that in the process of gathering public opinion, forums should be encouraged in which genuine, constructive, in-depth discussions can be conducted about vital issues facing our nation, about the CPF, about road transport policy, about the Government Budget. There are so many misconceptions, largely stemming from ignorance. The Opposition Members were saying that the Government is getting more revenue, as though the Government is taking the revenue for itself. And who is the Government? Are there corrupt people in the Government? The Ministers are on salary, honestly and plainly on salary. Who benefits if Government gets revenue? Ultimately, it is the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to educate the people in terms of economics. What makes Singapore tick? It is vital, Sir, as we consider alternatives for future development, that people should get at the truth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, we are all in a third kind of transition. From the Presidential speech
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and from contributions by Members in this House, and feedback from the public, it is clear that Singaporeans are searching for something more besides material things. And I believe it is not merely culture, be it music or drama or literature. It is really "coming to terms with God". Quite a few Members have already passed into the next world from this Chamber. Many more are due to go, soon. This nation, Sir, must turn to its Creator and acknowledge His ways. We have been much blessed, Mr Speaker, Sir, and I believe, if we seek God with all our hearts, we shall prosper as a nation and be secure.
  <br>

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed to respond to some points made by the Member for Potong Pasir regarding CPF as I am the Minister in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, although the Member for Potong Pasir claims to be a responsible Opposition Member, he has made unfounded statements both during the elections and in this House, which confuse and mislead the public. One begins to doubt his sincerity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One statement that he has made concerns the pricing of HDB flats. The Member must be still wondering how he can build four blocks of HDB flats at a profit. More likely, he must be considering how he is to get out of the fix he has got himself into. My sympathies with him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue that he has raised this morning concerns the CPF, ie, the Government will be unable to pay back the depositors. Before I proceed, may I ask the Member whether he has ,any facts or figures to substantiate his claim? Would the Member like to reply?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was looking through my file and I shall presently produce the facts and figures that the Acting Minister requires. But the fact is that my Party has got two sets of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> facts and figures, one concerning the HDB and we have had it before, I repeat, before the elections. And that set of facts and figures has never been rebutted by the Minister for National Development. He has come forward with a new scheme. Many people have said that he is just sidetracking the issue. Instead of the Government coming out clean to justify and say that, in fact, the HDB is not making profit, it has come out with a new scheme just to draw the attention away from the responsibility of the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards CPF, I have stated, if you have listened carefully, that it is "eventually" - the word is "eventually" - and our calculations have shown that. So if the Acting Minister wants it, I will produce those facts and figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, since the Member has made an important allegation, he should have the facts and figures at his fingertips to substantiate the point. He wants the electorate to believe him and these are the points on which he has gone to the elections. So surely the facts and figures must be right there with him for him to produce now rather than trying to delay and avoid the issue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for HDB pricing, it is not for me to debate with him. I think the Minister for National Development will take him on on his point - within the three - month period during which he has to accept or reject the proposal or offer from the Minister. If Members recall, in fact the Minister has amply explained during the elections why he figures produced by the Member were faulty. But, as I said, my concern here is with the CPF and before I proceed, I just want to know whether he has facts and figures ready to substantiate the point that he made this morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed to answer that? I have already stated that we have got two sets of facts and figures, one in relation to the HDB and the other in relation to the CPF. I am speaking about the second set of figures in regard to the CPF. And that has been published in our Party's magazine known as The Demokrat and it has been out for months, and we have got no reply
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> from the Government side. This is most surprising. I am sure the Acting Minister is aware of this publication.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> We request the Member to produce those figures in time so that we can consider them in this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the moment, let me just explain the figures that I have to show how he has been misleading the public. The total deposits of members with the CPF as at 31st December 1984 amount to $22.7 billion. The foreign reserves of Singapore as at the same date, 31st December 1984, is about $23 billion. In addition, we have loans to HDB and JTC which amount to $10.8 billion, not counting the others like the loans to PUB, loans to companies and so on. So we do have these foreign reserves of $22.7 billion. We also have local reserves amounting to $10.8 billion, the figures I have just quoted. If you add these two figures alone, it comes to $33.5 billion, which is about 50% more than the sum owing by the CPF to all its members, Therefore, it shows very clearly that Government reserves are much greater than the CPF savings of all its members. Even if today all the CPF depositors were to be allowed to withdraw their entire CPF savings - I am saying "if"; I am not saying that we are going to allow this but if we allow it -there is definitely more than enough money to pay off all the depositors. So do not worry about this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be seen from this budget and from previous budgets, the Government has been extremely prudent in its budgetary and reserve management policies. There is absolutely no danger that the Government will be unable to pay back the CPF depositors. So long as we continue to have yearly surpluses as noted by the Member for Rochore and so long as we invest our surpluses in good, strong assets which appreciate over time, there is no question that we will be able to pay back the CPF depositors. It may be true that with the aging of the population at some point in time, the CPF contributions to the CPF may be less than the amount withdrawn.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> That is right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> But so long as each dollar of CPF money is fully invested and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> backed by hard reserves which appreciate over time, there is no problem of paying back the CPF money. Our CPF savings are invested carefully in bonds, properties and other assets which are a good hedge against inflation. When the time comes for the CPF to pay back the depositors, these assets will be simply sold to obtain the necessary cash. Where then is the problem of repayment?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this has helped to clarify the issue and to show how, in fact, without hard facts and figures, the Member has been misleading the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has further raised the point this morning that CPF contributions should be reduced from 50% to 40%. This is something which is very popular on the surface. But you must realize that CPF is workers' pay. Lower CPF means lower pay for the workers. Is that what the Member wants?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Whampoa has already explained very clearly why we need to have high savings, why the CPF rate should not be reduced at this time of great economic uncertainty. We may well need the CPF savings to tide us over a severe world depression, which may be triggered by the world debt crisis. He has further made the point that the lower income group especially are the ones who will require high CPF savings to enable them to purchase HDB flats, for Medisave and for old age security.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really a paradox that this CPF scheme that we have, which many countries are trying to emulate, has become a whipping horse of the Government. We should realize the full benefits of the CPF scheme. Through CPF we have been able to have yearly surpluses, to have a high savings rate which has enabled us to build and to pump prime the economy even in times of recession. There is no need for us to borrow externally, and these sources of funds are non-inflationary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF scheme is, in fact, a wonderful scheme. Many countries, Taiwan, Malaysia and others, are trying to copy us. And yet because of the falsehoods and the confusion spread by the Opposition, the CPF has now become a whipping horse of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, these are the points I want to make.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Second Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Second Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Potong Pasir was not here yesterday when I explained my stand, in as far as the taxi fares and the diesel tax and measures taken by the Ministry of Communications are concerned. So I thought it is necessary that I should explain the point.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir had twisted my words, in the same way as the Member for Anson has done yesterday. But I know the Member for Potong Pasir is new in this House, and he is young, so we will forgive him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Potong Pasir repeated the claim that there is a contradiction or differences of view between myself and the Cabinet. We know that that is not true and is incorrect. It is true that the subject has been thoroughly discussed in Cabinet and I agreed wholeheartedly with the decision of the Cabinet that (1) measures will have to be taken to solve the taxi shortage problem, and (2) to increase taxi fares in order to increase the income of taxi drivers, as has been ciamoured by the taxi drivers themselves for some years. The measures finally adopted by the Government will obviously have an impact on taxi drivers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications' assessment is that the impact on taxi drivers would be small. My feeling, based on the feedback that I had from taxi drivers, as I am Chairman of the NTUC Comfort Board of Directors, is that the impact would be large. Hence my suggestions to the Ministry of Communications to review these measures if it fails to achieve the intended objective. I hope I have made my position clear. I also hope my feeling would be proved wrong, instead of the assessment of the Ministry of Communications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, when the measures are put into operations soon, I believe it is the 1st April, I hope that all the taxi drivers and all of us who use taxis will give the scheme a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> try. Cooperate with the Government and try it out, and let us hope that the intended objective will be achieved. If not, we will urge the Ministry of Communications to review it. That is my stand. Thank you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Second Deputy Prime Minister by way of clarification? If the Ministry of Communications' calculations are proved wrong, will the Second Deputy Prime Minister assure the House that he will urge the Cabinet not to impose this diesel tax?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> The Member's question is, whether I can assure him that I will urge the Cabinet to review the measures introduced. Is that your question?

  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Will you tell them to review it?

  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> I have already mentioned earlier that we will have to let the scheme come into operation first. I expect, as I mentioned in my statement, that there will be a drop in demand in the first one or two months of the operation, and if it fails to achieve the objective, then I will urge. I have already said so. That is in my statement.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his Budget statement, the Minister for Finance said that "the outlook for 1985 is not as rosy as for last year." But he went on to say that "the last five years have been years of exceptional prosperity for Singapore and for Singaporeans."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when unveiling the 'Vision for Singapore by 1999', the First Deputy Prime Minister also boldly proclaimed that by 1999 Singapore will become a developed country, with a standard of living which is better than the Americans and the Japanese and equal to the Swiss today.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Sir, such a vision and promises really sound exciting. Are they achievable?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for Finance and the First Deputy Prime Minister talked about matching the standard of living of the Japanese or the Swiss, they were referring to the per capita income. Yes, based on the projections of our economic growth, we can reach the targeted per capita income. But I must say that the figure of per capita income by itself is not an absolute measure of the well-being and comfort of our entire population. Labour share of national income, distribution of income and cost of living are important factors to consider. Our labour share of national income, in terms of wages, for instance, still falls below that of the Japanese and the Swiss. Per capita income only tells us half the story. To complete the picture, we must also set targets with respect to other social and economic indicators.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have examined the income figures of our workers over the last 10 years. In 1975, the average monthly income of all the salaried workers in Singapore was $480. In 1984, it has increased to $1,094. The annual average increase in wages over the 10-year period was around 10%. Even if the figures were adjusted for inflation, the average real growth in wages is over 6% annually. By any standard, this is a remarkable achievement. Due credit must be given to our Government, our businessmen, our workers and, of course, our trade unions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is, have our ordinary citizens benefited much from the wage increases in comparison with the better qualified professional, technical and managerial staff? Is it true that the wage increases enjoyed by the ordinary worker is what we call "peanuts", which is nothing to boast about? Let us look at the figures and statistics again. In 1975, the average wage of the production and manual worker was $320. In 1984, the average wage was $730. The annual increase over the 10-year period averages 10.2%. For the clerical, sales and service related workers, the monthly wages increased from $400 in 1975 to $810 in 1984. The annual increase was about 8.5%.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how about the professional and managerial staff? In 1975, the average wage of this category of employees was $1,200. In 1984, it was $2,400. The annual increase was also around 8.5%. So, over this 10-year period, from 1975 to 1984, annual wage increase of production and manual worker was 10.2%. The increase for clerical and sales worker as well as for the professional and executive was about 8.5%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at these figures, we can see that the increase of income of our population, in percentage terms, is fairly uniform. There is therefore no ground for complaints that our lower educated, lower income group, is not getting a fair deal for their effort, and a fair share of the economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a stark fact which is thrown up from these figures is that although, in percentage terms, all categories of workers enjoy more or less the same rate of wage increase, the income gap between the manual worker and the managerial staff in quantitative terms, in dollars and cents, has widened. This can be easily understood. A 10% wage increase for a person who earns $500 is $50. But a 10% wage increase for a person earning $2,000 is $200. Whereas in 1975, the income gap between a manual worker and a managerial staff was $900 in 1984, it has widened to $1,700.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we know, the disparity in income between the manual and the skilled and managerial staff is due essentially to the difference in educational and skill levels and the influence of supply and demand. Because of the rapid economic growth, skilled workers, engineers and managers were in great demand. Their wages therefore went up. While we could bring in unskilled workers in large numbers to meet our demand for labour, we were not able to do so for the professional and technical staff because of the scarcity of such personnel. The wages of the technical and managerial staff in Singapore have escalated to the extent that today our engineers and managers are getting more than their counterparts in the developed countries. While the production workers in Singapore are earning about one-third or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> one-fourth of their counterparts in Europe or America, our engineers and managers are getting more than their counterparts in these countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not begrudging the high wages of our engineers and managers. We know that the cost of living of the middle income group, for instance, the cost of owning a house and the cost of owning a car, is very high. But I am rather annoyed that the rising wages of our ordinary worker is singled out as the factor which affects the competitiveness of our industry and exports. If Singapore wishes to remain competitive, not only should the wages of the production workers be competitive, so must the wages of technicians, engineers and managers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how about the overheads and other operating costs? We all know that land cost and property prices in Singapore are high. The transportation cost is high and is getting higher, The utilities and other overhead expenses are high. I think it would be wrong to pursue a policy which allows the overheads and other operating costs to rise while, at the same time, trying to maintain our competitiveness by keeping wages low. Our people will become worse off at the end of the day because they will have to live with rising costs and inflation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also caution the Minister for Finance that if we want to succeed in attracting high-technology, high value-added industries into Singapore, we must build up a sufficiently large pool of technicians and engineers who are available at reasonable cost. Our competitiveness and our ability to attract high technology investments will be determined not by the availability of a large number of unskilled cheap labour but rather by the supply of a large pool of skilled workers, technicians and engineers. The Government must intensify its programme to produce more engineers and technicians so that, by supply and demand and pricing mechanism, the wage cost of such categories of personnel can be adjusted to a more reasonable level. Sir, I welcome the Minister's plan to set up a high level committee to undertake an in-depth review of our economic
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> development plan. I hope that the Committee will examine thoroughly all the factors that affect Singapore's competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the distribution of wealth and the share of economic and productivity gains in the form of wages has, in the past more than one decade, been determined to a significant extent by the National Wages Council (NWC). NWC has served a useful purpose. Not only has this tripartite body brought about orderly wage increases in the last 13 years but it has also contributed greatly to the industrial peace and harmony which we are enjoying today. There is no denying that because of the existence of NWC recommendations, intense negotiation and bargaining, which is adversarial in nature, has been alleviated at the enterprise level. Wage increases and collective agreement negotiations have been concluded rather expeditiously because both parties, the union and management, could use the NWC guidelines as the basis for negotiation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NWC, as an institution, has served us well. It has contributed to the industrial peace which should not be taken for granted. We should not forget that political stability and industrial peace is the single most important factor in influencing an investor's decision to invest in Singapore. You can have the cheapest labour cost in the world. You can have the most attractive incentive schemes to lure the investors. You can scrap all the Government taxes and levies. But with political strife and industrial unrest, you are going to attract nobody.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some employers have suggested that NWC should be phased out because it resulted in unrealistic wage increases. Under the present business and economic conditions, the pressure is even greater for the abolition of NWC. But the arguments and reasons put forward are, in my view, far from convincing. The NWC usually recommends a range of wage increases as a guideline. The recommendations take into consideration the previous year's economic performance, prevailing business conditions, and projection for the future. The employers and the unions use
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the guideline as a basis for negotiation and the actual settlement depends on the profitability of the establishment, the existing wage level, the productivity of the workforce, and the situation of supply and demand.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explains why there are employers who are prepared to pay even beyond what the NWC recommends and there are some who pay below the guideline because of financial and other constraints. But if you take away NWC recommendations and ask both parties to start negotiating from a blank sheet of paper, you are asking for a lot, of trouble. The Member for Rochore has suggested yesterday that the union should not use the reduction of payroll tax and SDF levy as a leverage to ask for more wage increase. My response to him is that instead of leaving it to the individual union and employer to argue over this matter, NWC is the best forum where such issues can be discussed sensibly and rationally. NTUC will ask for what we think is fair to our workers. I hope the Minister for Finance do agree with my view of the need to retain NWC.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the final analysis, the wage level and earning capacity of our workers will depend basically on their education and skill levels. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister for Finance's statement that "education and training is the cornerstone of our economic upgrading strategy and the key to a better life for our people." But what puzzles me is that, while highlighting the importance of education and training, the Minister has, at the same time, allowed for a reduction of the Skills Development Fund levy. I can understand the reasons why the Government has decided to scrap the payroll tax and to reduce the SDF levy. This is to reduce the costs of doing business in Singapore. While I can join the employers and the businessmen in applauding the Government's decision to suspend the collection of payroll tax, I cannot agree to the reduction of SDF levy without expressing some reservations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, employers must be reminded that SDF levy is not a Government tax which is slapped on the companies arbitrarily. SDF was set up during the implementation of the economic restruc-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> turing and wage correction policy for a very specific purpose of upgrading our workforce. The Fund was set up with the consensus of the employers, the unions and the Government. The contribution to the SDF, which started from 1979, was as a matter of fact part of the wage increases agreed upon by the NWC. The 4% SDF contributions could have been added to the disposable income of the workers. I cannot therefore agree to the reduction of the SDF without feeling some loss on the part of the employees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must remind the employers of their obligations to train and retrain the workers. The Minister for Finance has decided to reduce the SDF levy with the good intention of lightening the burden of the employers which I would have no objection if this is indeed going to make the company more competitive. After all, if our workers can help to make the companies more viable, why not. But the employers should not lose sight of the original objective of the SDF. Reduction of SDF levy should not be misconstrued to imply that we are relenting in our effort to train our workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said that SDF has accumulated a sizable balance and hence it was possible to lower the rate of contribution without jeopardizing the scope and effectiveness of the SDF programme. I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the need to pay particular attention to the retraining of our older workers. It is true that jobs are plentiful in Singapore. But it is also true that many older workers, especially those who are retrenched by their employers after spending many years with the company, could not fit into the new jobs which are created by the establishment of new industries. There is a mismatch between the job seekers and the job vacancies. Many of these workers who are above 45 years of age are unskilled or illiterate. It would be very difficult for them to find jobs of reasonable remuneration once they are retrenched. Many of them tried to apply for a hawker stall or to become a taxi driver. But the Government has stopped building new hawker centres and driving a taxi today is not necessarily a lucrative vocation.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government may wish to introduce schemes to encourage these workers to take up part-time skill training. It would be better for them to attend some upgrading courses so that they can acquire marketable skills and seek alternative employment when they are phased out of their present jobs. The solution to the problems of retrenched workers is not, as the Member for Anson suggested, to put them on the dole. This is most humiliating. The solution, Sir, is to help them find gainful employment. This is where the Government can help.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, in my view, the Government has not been providing adequate guidance to the workers, especially those engaged in the sunset industries, on the types of skills that they should try to acquire. Neither is the VITB adequately equipped to train large numbers of existing workers. The SDF too does not have any scheme to sponsor retrenched workers for skills training. If you are out of employment, you do not qualify for SDF grant, the only exception being the BEST programme. I suggest that the Minister for Finance ask the Ministry of Trade and Industry, SDF and VITB, to study the problem or set up a special task force for this purpose. At a later stage, the Government may have to consider introducing incentives to encourage companies to employ older workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me say a few words regarding measures taken by the Government to curb car ownership. I am sure the Minister for Finance is aware that increasing road tax, diesel tax, petrol tax and taxi fares has an inflationary effect. It causes a chain reaction in price increases. The general public will suffer as a result. Many of my colleagues in this House have already voiced their concern yesterday about the impending rise in the cost of living. Let me inform the Hon. Minister for Finance that the price hike has already taken place. Last night, someone told me that he has to pay 10 cents more for a cup of coffee at a hawker stall which he frequents. A colleague of mine had to pay $2 more for a hair-cut when he went to a barber shop two days ago. Sir, I am not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> convinced that the ultimate solution to the problem of increased car population and road congestion is to keep increasing levies on car owners and car users. There must be other non-inflationary measures which can be explored and introduced by the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposition of diesel tax too has caused much dissatisfaction and anxiety among the taxi drivers. In spite of the assurance given by the Minister for Communications and Information, there is fear among the taxi drivers of a possible drastic drop in demand, thus affecting their income. I would like to join my fellow MPs in this House to appeal to the Minister for Finance to consider reducing the diesel tax if the income of taxi drivers is indeed adversely affected by a drop in demand.

As a professional accountant, I know that the CPF Board operates more like a big bank. It is like saying that the biggest bank in Singapore will have no money to pay its depositors. If we make this sort of misleading statement, unless the intention is to have a run on the bank or to have a run on the CPF Board, I think it is irresponsible. [Applause]

  <b>The Minister for Finance, Minister for Education and Minister for Health (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me begin my reply by first thanking all hon. Members for the more than usual interest which they have given to this Budget Statement and also for their numerous suggestions and comments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging by the speeches which we have heard in the last two days, it would appear that Members have gone through the Budget with a fine tooth-comb. The increases in road tax and petrol tax and the imposition of diesel tax on taxis have been given a disproportionate amount of attention by Members. And understandably so.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Members must have received a lot of unsolicited feedback from their constituents and taxi-drivers, and I truly sympathize with them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, fascinating as this topic may be, I shall resist the temptation of leading off with this subject, particularly as my colleague, the Minister for Communications and Information, has informed me that he intends to give a full explanation of Government's land transport policy during the debate on his Ministry's estimates in the Committee of Supply. I shall therefore leave it to him to do most of the difficult ork, and concentrate on elaborating the Government's economic policy. However, Sir, if there is time, I should like to make a few observations on the increase in petrol tax and the imposition of diesel tax on taxis.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, several Members, I think the Member for Leng Kee first, then the Member for Rochore, Member for Anson, Member for Potong Pasir among others, have painted a gloomy picture of the economic and business situation in Singapore today. The implication, Sir, is that our economy is in serious trouble, indeed on the verge of collapse. And Government for some strange unknown reason has chosen to turn a blind eye to the plight of our businessmen and is doing nothing to help them. Is this true? Consider the facts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had five years of exceptional prosperity. We still have a severe labour shortage. We have overfull employment. Then because we expect that this year our growth rate would be, say, 6% as against 8.2% in 1984, does this mean that Government should hit the panic button, bring out the first-aid box, render some instant stimulants, irregardless of the long-term consequences?

   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a young society and it is perhaps not surprising that we have not yet achieved the degree of serenity which older societies have. Singaporean,9 are often of a volatile nature. One day, we are jubilant when the sun is shining. Newspapers are filled with stories about our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> economic success -to such an extent that I worry. Because such stories tend to create natural feelings of resentment in our trading partners. But the next day, Sir, when there is a shower, we are plunged in gloom and we expect the sky to fall down on our heads. Newspapers seek out then the most sensational stories of bankruptcies and retrenchments that they can find. Businessmen, Chambers of Commerce, Members of Parliament, particularly Backbenchers, each have their own ideas about what kind of instant medicine that is required to bring our economy to life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have to inform the Members of this House that the rumours about the impending demise of our economy are greatly exaggerated. And for us to prescribe a patent medicine in order to give our economy a quick-fix is precisely what we should not do. It is because, Sir, governments in Europe, Australia, New Zealand,have adopted ad hoc measures to prop up ailing sectors to protect jobs in non-viable industries trying, like King Canute in the legend, to resist the sea of market forces that have brought their economies to their knees. I ask the Members to ask themselves: why have we been able to weather one economic storm after another? The reason is not a complex one. The answer is very simple. Sir, it is because we have set our sights correctly, because we have had the courage and the determination to adhere to our chosen course, to overcome obstacles which arise in our way rather than choose to be diverted into dangerous and unsafe byways which may appear to be easier-going but which inevitably will lead us into the forest of economic stagnation if we give in to temptation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in case Members and businessmen have forgotten, I would like to remind them that business is not the civil service. Business is about taking risks, and making a profit if you are right and going bankrupt if you are wrong. No government can ensure the profitability of companies. I know that some governments have tried to their great regret, and to the regret of their taxpayers when the inevitable debacle occurs. Government can only create the necessary conditions - a free enterprise
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> economy, political stability, predictable and stable rules. Businessmen must do the rest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, business is not only about taking risks. Business is also about change and the mastering of change. We do not live in a static world. The company, the entrepreneur, who can adjust to market conditions, will survive and prosper. The businessman who believes that the world or the Government owes him a living will soon run into disaster. Sir, the world of business is not a playground. Rather than complaining about high overheads or the intrusion of Government in the economy, I think that businessmen can more profitably spend their time looking for new business opportunities, working hand-in-hand with the appropriate Government agencies to seek new markets for their enterprises. Sir, in business, as in love, fortune favours the bold.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The path to our economic success is clear: more education and training, more mechanization and automation. Only then will we have high productivity which will make it possible for our companies to pay high wages. What about those companies which can only survive on the basis of lowly-paid workers or which are badly managed? What will happen to them? The answer, Sir, is that they will go bankrupt. Should governments help these companies? The answer is no. Will their workers suffer? Yes, if we have been foolish or timid and we have not taken the timely measures which we did in the last few years. Then our economy would be stagnant - no growth, unions fighting with each other, unions fighting with employers, as the coal miners are doing in England, each seeking to preserve their share of an ever-diminishing economic pie.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, because we did not allow these temporary setbacks to divert us from doing what we knew was right, because we allowed the market to operate, we have had and we will continue to have full employment, with high wages for our workers, high wages that are justified by high productivity, whether this is in manu-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> facturing, in hotels, in services, in banking or in tourism.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has asked if the Government has any scheme to devise a plan for unemployment benefits to help those workers who are retrenched or who are thrown out of employment. Sir, the Member will never learn. Look at those countries which have generous unemployment benefits - Holland, England, Australia. Are their economies doing well? Are their workers employed? Does he want Singapore to follow these countries? Sir, in England or in Holland, workers can afford to go on holidays because of their unemployment benefits. On some occasions, a worker cannot afford to work because what he gets from unemployment benefits is more than what he will receive if he gets a job. Where then is the incentive to work? Under such a system, Sir, the most sensible course of action for you and I would be to draw our unemployment benefits and have a good time. It is stupid to work. And that is why the governments of these countries are crippled by enormous social welfare spending, enormous deficits, high taxes and a fragmentation of the fabric of their societies. I think, Sir, our system in Singapore is better - free enterprise, high growth, good wages for good work, no wages for no work. Then you will have full employment and a prosperous society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I do not want to imply that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade and Industry treat the economy of our country with benign neglect. We monitor very carefully the level of economic activity in Singapore and when measures have to be taken, they will be taken timely and appropriately. While keeping steadfast to our long-term economic goals, we will make sure that we do not price ourselves out of the world market, that our international competitiveness will not be eroded by too high tariffs, or rates, or fees, or statutory contributions. In this respect, Sir, I am heartened to hear from the Minister for National Development yesterday that HDB would be freezing the rentals of their shops for another year. And I am also pleased to read in the press that the TAS intends to reduce the tariffs for the international telephone and telex services.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it never rains but it pours. JTC has just informed me that for the period from 1st April 1985 to 31st December 1986, they intend to give a 10% reduction in current rentals on industrial land and a 15% reduction in current rentals on standard factory buildings, terraces, workshops and flatted factories. [Applause] And they will review these rates after 1986.

  <b>Dr Tony Tan Kong Yam:</b> As the Member for Rochore says, "Ask and you shall receive." Sir, these moves by TAS and JTC are, in my view, all the more commendable because they were initiated by the statutory boards themselves and were not done on instructions from the respective ministries or from me. It shows that the management of these two statutory boards have a keen perception of the markets in their respective areas and are prepared to exercise the flexibility given to them to make rapid adjustments to market conditions. Sir, I commend more statutory boards to follow their good example.

  <b>An hon Member:</b> What about Housing Board for a start?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, I come to the speech from the Member for Whampoa. Sir, in my view, it is an outstanding speech worthy of the close attention of all Members in this House. The Member has suggested, among other things, that Government should consider a cut in corporate tax in order to stimulate the economy. I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to brief Members on this important matter. It is important, Sir, to realize that we do not have a corporate tax in Singapore on the same basis as corporate tax in other countries. We have a one-tier taxation system in Singapore in that the income of a company is taxed only once, either as company profits or as shareholders' dividends. At the company level, the 40% company tax in Singapore can be viewed as a tax on undistributed profits. But if a company distributes all its profits, then the rate of tax eventually suffered is determined by the circumstances of its shareholders. This effect is achieved through the granting of a tax credit which no doubt many Members
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are familiar with. The impact of a reduction in company tax for most companies would therefore be to improve the companies' cash flow and to increase their after tax profits which will be available for ploughing back into the business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above, Sir, is necessarily a very simplified explanation of the implications of company tax in Singapore. Now, Sir, I will explain why there are good reasons that it is not opportune at this time to reduce company tax. Company tax collection is the single largest contributor to Government revenue. In recent years, it has accounted for about $2.5 billion, or about one-quarter of our recurrent revenue. A reduction of 1% in the rate of company tax would imply a loss of about $63 million. And if company tax were lowered by, say, 5% to be effective, this would result in a revenue shortfall of some $315 million. Therefore, if company tax is to be reduced, an alternative and substantial revenue source must be found. If the alternative source is to be indirect taxes, then we have to raise a large number of new taxes or raise the rates of existing taxes, like our road tax. And I think this would not be desirable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another good reason why company tax should not be reduced this year is because last year I introduced a three-year write-off for all plant and machinery in all sectors. Based on assumptions on capital equipment purchased and expenditure, the revenue loss for the first three years from this concession is estimated to be in the region of some $450 million. The effect of this concession on income tax collections will only be felt from this year onwards. This generous depreciation allowance helps companies to defer their taxes and thereby reduces the effective rate of tax and increases the companies' cash flow. And I would be wary about introducing further concessions before looking at the effect of the above concession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 40% company tax rate should also be viewed in relation to our present system of tax incentives. Already companies in many sectors enjoy very low rates of taxation. ACUs pay only 10% tax or less on their profits, while companies which are granted pioneer status pay no
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tax at all for up to 10 years of their operations. A company which seeks to systematically invest and expand its operations in Singapore can therefore enjoy the benefit of these tax incentives to substantially reduce its tax rate. This system we have found to be most effective in stimulating further investment and economic growth in Singapore. Also, Sir, our extensive network of tax treaties facilitates foreign investment as a tax exemption in Singapore is often reciprocated by way of tax sparing in the overseas country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, while I do not consider it desirable to reduce company tax on this occasion, I would not rule out the desirability of a cut in corporate tax in future years when our revenue position allows us to do so. As our economy continues to mature, there is merit in the argument that our tax system should be non-selective and that tax should be levied on a nondiscriminatory basis. However, due conside ration will have to be given to sectoral demands.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The move to lower the rate of corporate tax should also be tied in with the move to lower the maximum rate of individual tax. Previously, when the maximum individual rate was 55% and the company rate was40%, many high income individuals formed companies through which to conduct their activities and thereby legally avoided paying the 55% tax. One way these companies work is that most needs, for example, entertainment, transport and housing, were met through expenses charged against the company while the individual drew a low salary for his personal tax calculations. Such tax planning can only be practised by the self-employed but not by salaried workers. This is the reason why last year I reduced the maximum rate of individual tax to 40%, the rate of company tax. To avoid this problem in the future, it will be desirable for any reduction in the rate of company tax to take place at the same time or to be preceded by a lowering of the maximum rate of individual tax. This however, Sir, will have to be considered
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> very carefully as it will lead to a further drain on revenue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I would like to comment briefly on some points from the speech of the Member for Rochore. The Member for Teck Ghee this morning has made an excellent rebuttal of many of the points contained in his speech, and it will not be necessary for me to cover the same ground. However, I think that it would be churlish of me to ignore his speech altogether, and therefore I would like to pick up and comment on one or two areas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Member's long speech yesterday, he was most critical of Government's economic policy. Indeed, if we take him at his word, everything that we have done in the last five years has been wrong. Sir, even by the laws of probability, this is not possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have great respect for the Member for Rochore as a politician and as a scientist, fields in which he is a recognized expert. But, Sir, in economics I would respectfully suggest to him that one tutorial from the Member for Leng Kee is not sufficient. The thrust of the Member for Rochore's remarks is that it is in some way strange or immoral for the Government to run a surplus in its overall account. He would prefer that we run a deficit, presumably the bigger the better. And I suppose we finance this deficit, first, by running down our reserves and, secondly, by borrowing massively overseas. Sir, this strategy will give us a few years of glorious living, and then what? A massive hangover when the party is over! An overseas debt which will break us and our children for generations to come, which is what many third world countries are suffering from today. Sir, prudency may not be as much fun as profligacy, but I assure the hon. Member that it is a much safer course.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, I cannot follow the Member's economic reasoning. Having advocated that the Government should, if it is to be a good government, endeavour to incur a deficit rather than to earn a surplus, the Member then proceeded to criticize the scale of Government expenditure. He warns that Government expenditure is expanding too rapidly and we should take steps to curb the rapid rate of increase. Sir,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> these are sentiments with which I am very much in agreement with him. But if Government is to reduce its expenditure, then how can we incur a deficit? That is why, Sir, I think perhaps a second lesson in economics from the Member for Leng Kee would not be out of place.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not Government expenditure itself, Sir, which is worrying. It is how Government spends its money. And here in Singapore we have not wasted Government funds on consumption. The bulk of our Government expenditure is on development, on productive uses which will enhance the competence, the ability of Singaporeans, to earn their own living and which will improve our economic and physical infrastructure and this will pay dividends in due course. Sir, we have not wasted the Government's funds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not my purpose to ridicule the Member for Rochore who is one of our Party's elder statesmen. But wrong impressions, unless corrected promptly, can soon be accepted as gospel truth by the public. I must say that the Member has made a number of interesting points in his speech and, in particular, I regard his advice to the trade unions that they should not use the suspension of payroll tax as leverage to get higher NWC payments this year to be very sound advice. I hope that those Backbenchers who are trade union leaders will take this advice to heart.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, a few words on the Skills Development Fund which has been brought up by the Member for Yuhua and the Member for Boon Lay, Sir, the SDF has a crucial role to play in promoting and developing employer-based training and other activities which are critical to our economic restructuring. These activities have only recently taken off and are beginning to gather momentum. In fact, it was only last year that the SDF grant commitments began to exceed the levy collections. I would like to stress that the reduction in the rate of SDF levy should not be misconstrued to imply that we have reached a satisfactory level of training activity, mechanization or upgrading of our business operations. Economic restructuring is an on-going process that requires even higher levels of employer commitment and investment in these
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> areas. Given the current economic conditions, the SDF will continue to ensure that generous incentives are given to maintain and to increase the momentum of economic restructuring.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may be pertinent to remind the House that the SDF levy was introduced to encourage employers to run training programmes which are designed to equip our workforce for the activities of the future. It was to be expected that initially, the SDF would accumulate at a rate faster than its grant commitments. Now that the SDF has accumulated sufficient funds to allow a reduction in the SDF levy, I have been able to reduce it. But, as I said, this rate of levy contribution will be reviewed in three years' time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skills development involves the proper training and development of manpower in knowledge, in skills and in attitudes. As an investment in human resources, it is a necessary activity supporting the business of individual firms as well as the economy as a whole. To maintain economic growth, our economy must switch to higher skill, capital-intensive and brain-intensive activities. Our workforce, including our management, must acquire new knowledge, higher skills, the latest expertise. We must be able to use advanced machinery and equipment. We must keep abreast of the latest technologies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our tight labour situation and a highly competitive international market, we have to accelerate our economic restructuring process and move as fast as our competitors. We cannot wait for workers to develop these skills through lengthy on-the-job training programmes. We have to foster an intensive skills development programme now.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Pasir Panjang has suggested that, in order to assist small companies during these difficult times, they should be exempted from paying the SDF levy and presumably not participate in the various SDF schemes. Sir, this would be a retrograde step. If anything, small companies, more than large companies, need to be spurred to ensure that they give proper training to their workers. Most of the larger companies, for their own benefit, would have implemented
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> a fair amount of training, irrespective of whether the SDF was established or not. Training and manpower development are unfortunately not activities which are highly visible in small companies. Sir, indeed I sometimes suspect that small companies meet their needs for experienced personnel by poaching from the bigger companies. If we were to confine the SDF levy to the large companies and exempt the small companies from paying this levy, then this would be tantamount to penalizing those who train and rewarding those who do not train. I think that a better solution would be for the SDF to devise schemes which are specially tailored to meet the circumstances of small companies. And this is what the SDF secretariat is doing at the present time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I would like to touch briefly on the increase in the duty on petrol and the imposition of diesel tax on taxis. As I mentioned in my speech, the increase in petrol duty is, in my view, one of the most equitable ways of discouraging the excessive use of motor cars. Those who own cars but to drive only at weekends or at night are not unduly penalized. Those who drive excessively and therefore contribute to the congestion on our roads must be prepared to pay the price.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The move to increase the duty of petrol is also in line with the Government's energy conservation policy. Members may point to the falling price of oil in the international markets. However, we must remember that one of the causes for the recent oil glut has been the sluggish state of the economies in the Western industrialized countries. Once their economies pick up and go on the upswing, oil prices will invariably increase. If we do not make a conscious effort now to stem the increase in our energy requirements, future oil price increases will place a heavy strain on our economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the diesel tax increase, the past practice has resulted in a wide disparity in fuel cost between petrol and diesel-operated vehicles. This has resulted in making the fuel cost of diesel-powered taxis unrealistically low as compared to that of petrol-powered private motor cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> The diesel tax on taxis is aimed at removing this discrepancy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view the imposition of diesel tax on taxis is not only equitable but, in fact, overdue. The Ministry of Finance would have preferred to levy this tax on taxis with effect from the beginning of our fiscal year, that is 1st April, 1985, but the Ministry deferred to a request from the Ministry of Communications and Information to delay the imposition of the tax for six months to enable taxi drivers to earn enough to pay the tax. Sir, instead of vilifying the forebears of the Minister for Communications and Information, as the Member for Leng Kee delicately put it, the various taxi drivers' Associations should, I think, hold a dinner to thank the Minister for so assiduously looking after their interest. Sir, I can assure hon. Members that the Minister for Communications has a much kinder heart than the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the comments from the Opposition Members. The Member for Anson asked why the Government is so stingy. He says that even when we give a concession, we only give it half-way. On the suspension of the tax on telephone services and on trunk call charges to West Malaysia, he asked why this concession could not be extended to charges on trunk calls to other countries. Sir, the answer is really very, very simple. I cannot suspend the tax on trunk call charges to other countries other than West Malaysia because there is no such tax!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding payroll tax, his view is that it is not possible to suspend payroll tax; we either have to keep it or we should abolish it. I ask him to be patient, Sir. In a few months' time the mystery will be revealed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You are going to reveal it?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Yes, of course. Sir, the Member is also worried about the state of our tourist industry. He says it is time for us to sit down and think, to consider what will bring tourists to Singapore. But I think, Sir, the Tourism Task Force has just done that and has produced a series of recommendations which have
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> been endorsed by the Government. For example, the reduction in entertainment duty. The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board has been given a fresh burst of energy and new ideas, and vigorous action is being taken to publicize Singapore as a tourist attraction and to enhance and develop new tourist attractions in Singapore. The Member feels that one of the reasons why tourists do not come to Singapore is because we have, as he calls it, a sanitized culture; that we have driven life out of the streets of Singapore. I am not quite sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as to what he really intends. There are certain categories of people on the streets which I think all of us would prefer not to see. Sir, we are not in such desperate straits that we have to resort to such measures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Member has again repeated the allegation that our tax structure is discriminatory, that our tax system favours the rich. As I was listening to him, I became rather alarmed because for a moment I thought that he had forgotten to make this allegation, which is a standard part of his budget speech. I would then be deprived of the opportunity to table my yearly schedule (Cols. 981 - 982), Sir, which shows the distribution of taxpayers in Singapore. Sir, I am glad that Members will not be denied this annual dose of useful information.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies of schedule distributed to Members.]
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you can see from the schedule that in the lowest chargeable income group, ie, from $1,000 to $5,000, there are altogether 376,601 taxpayers. They comprise 53% of the total number of taxpayers. The tax they paid amounted to $38 million, less than 4% of the total tax collected in that year. The average tax assessed was $101. At the other extreme, our biggest taxpayers, those with chargeable incomes above $100,000, there were only just over 7,000 such taxpayers in 1983. They constitute only 1% of the total number of taxpayers in that year. Each of these taxpayers paid an average amount of $58,053 which, taken together, total $411 million, or over 38% of the tax collected in 1983. Sir, if our tax system is discriminatory, it is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> discriminatory against the rich by making them bear a disproportionate share of the tax burden.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if what I have just said sounds familiar to Members' ears, I must confess that this is not by accident. If Members will consult their Hansard, they will find that I have merely repeated word for word what I have said last year, but with updated figures. We are all getting old, Sir, and there is no use exercising more brain cells to think up new answers to meet a familiar situation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, to a few points raised by the Member for Potong Pasir. Most of the points which he has raised have already been touched on, and I do not think that there is need for me to spend much time on his speech. I will just mention one or two points.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir mentions, quite correctly, that income tax collections for fiscal year 1985 are likely to be higher this year than in fiscal year 1984 because of poorer business conditions. That in order to maintain Government revenue of $10.6 billion for 1985, about the same level as 1984, he says that Government is forced to resort to tax increases in order to meet the loss in revenue which arises from the tax concessions which I have just announced. Sir, the Member does not read his Budget Statement carefully. If he does, then he will note that the very first line of Section III of my Budget Statement states, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Consolidated Fund receipts on existing tax rates are expected to amount to $10.62 billion for the Financial Year 1st April 1985 to 31st March 1986.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operative words are "on existing tax rates". In other words, Sir, the estimate of $10.62 billion for fiscal year 1985 revenue was worked out on the existing tax structure and, in accordance with standard practice, losses in revenue due to the tax concessions announced or gains due to the tax increases have yet to be factored into the calculations. The reason for this is a straightforward one. It is not possible to estimate accurately, for example, the revenue loss which can result from certain
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tax concessions, one of them being the tax deductibility of certain educational expenses for individuals. This will depend on how many individuals take advantage of this concession and the amount which they claim. All I can say at the present time is that I do not expect the revenue loss from this concession to bankrupt the Treasury. Therefore, I would advise the Member for Potong Pasir that the Budget Statement should be read very carefully. A word here and there can mean a difference of several million dollars.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more serious note, Sir, the Member has brought out the issue of the Central Provident Fund and whether Government has the necessary revenue to pay to members when they go to withdraw their money. The Acting Minister for Labour and the Member for Whampoa have already spoken on this and I do not want to repeat the same arguments. I would just like to assure the Member for Potong Pasir that we live within our means. And that Government revenue is more than sufficient to meet estimated Government expenditure with a healthy balance left over to help finance our development expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the funds of the CPF members are safe and no member needs to worry that he will be deprived of his CPF funds because the Government has been profligate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, may I, in conclusion, take this opportunity to thank you personally and all the other Members of this House for the assistance and cooperation which they have given to me during the last four years when I had the privilege of presenting the Budget on behalf of the Government. It has been for me, Sir, personally, a gratifying experience and a source of much satisfaction that, despite the economic troubles which have plagued the world in the last four years, Singapore has continued to enjoy full employment and the economic well-being of Singaporeans has improved significantly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming months, Sir, the management of the economy will be largely in the capable hands of my colleagues, the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Minister for Trade and Industry and the Minister of State for Trade and Industry. Under their careful direction, I am sure that Singaporeans will continue to have the vigorous, imaginative leadership which has stood us in good stead all these years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, provided that we have a pragmatic, honest Government and a sensible population, we should not be apprehensive about the future. Indeed, my view of the prospects that face Singapore can be simply stated. If we work with and not against each other, if we are bold and not timid, if we do not shirk the hard decisions and go for the soft options, then whatever be the achievements we have made in the last 25 years, we have every reason to be optimistic that, as the motto of one of our schools says, "The best is yet to be."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much obliged, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. [Applause]
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I clarify something that I said to which the Minister replied? The Minister takes up my charge that the tax structure is discriminatory. But I am afraid the Minister has completely missed the point of my remarks. I was referring to the personal reliefs that are allowed. I mentioned that they are much lower than what they were in 1947, and I made a comparison with what they were in Malaysia. And I repeated that the Minister, I am afraid, misled the House two years ago when he said that because the rates were different they evened out. The families in Singapore were worse off than in Malaysia. It is no good producing these figures. We know that those who have the money will have to pay more. That is an elementary principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Community Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Point of order, Sir. If the Member wants to make a clarification, he can just repeat what he said. He cannot introduce new arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, I do not think there is much point in continuing this debate. We have finished the Budget debate now. All I would say, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that I believe that rather than increase personal reliefs, we should reduce our tax rates. That is better.
