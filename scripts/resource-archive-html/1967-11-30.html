<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise to move the motion  standing

in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Article

I  of  the Constitution of Singapore, elects Inche

Yusof  bin  Ishak as President of the Republic  of

Singapore  for  a further term of  four  years  to

commence  immediately  after  the  expiry  of  his

present term of office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be the third time that our President

has  been nominated as Head of State. Eight  years

ago,  on  the  3rd  of  December,  1959,  he   was

appointed  by the British Sovereign to the  office

of  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara under  the  Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, for a  term

of   four  years.  He  took  over  from  the  last

Governor,  Sir  William Goode,  who  was  for  six

months  the  first Yang di-Pertuan  Negara.  Inche

Yusof  was,  then, the personal representative  of

the  British Queen. His term of office as Yang di-Pertuan  Negara of self-governing Singapore  would

have expired on the 2nd of December, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the 16th September, 1963, two and a

half  months  before the expiration of  his  first

term  of  office, Singapore became  a  constituent

State  of  the  new  Federation  of  Malaysia.  By

Article 95 (1) of the Constitution of the State of

Singapore,   his  appointment  under  the   former

Constitution was extended by one day.  And  so  it

was that on the 4th of December, 1963, the Yang di-Pertuan  Agong of the Federation of  Malaysia,  on

the  advice  of  the  Singapore State  Government,

appointed  Tun  Yusof bin Ishak  to  be  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara of the State of Singapore, pursuant

to  clause (1) of Article 1 of the Constitution of

the State of Singapore, for a term of four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by the Separation Agreement on the 7th of

August, 1965, which came into operation on the 9th

of  August,  1965, and the subsequent Republic  of

Singapore Independence Act (No. 9 of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



1965) and the Constitution (Amendment) Act (No.  8

of  1965) passed in December 1965, Inche Yusof bin

Ishak  became, retrospective as from  the  9th  of

August,  1965, the first President of the Republic

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His present appointment, according to these

transitory provisions, ends on the 3rd of December - in three days' time. Today under Article 1 of the

Constitution  of Singapore, I am inviting  Members

of  the  House to elect Inche Yusof bin Ishak  for

his  third term as Head of State and President  of

the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast constitutional changes in the last eight

and a half years since the 3rd of June. 1959, when

we  first  took  office, reflected  the  momentous

changes  that were taking place in and around  us.

In  1959  he represented Queen Elizabeth II.  Then

from  1963  to 1965, for less than two  years,  he

represented  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Agong.  Now  he

simply   represents  us,  the  citizens   of   the

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Yusof and his wife, Puan Noor Aishah, have

graced   the  Istana  for  eight  years.  He   has

discharged his constitutional duties with devotion

and dignity and has won the respect and confidence

of  the  people.  With his wife,  they  have  been

patrons  of  Singapore society, the arts,  sports,

the  numerous charities of our expanding  society.

The  burden of these duties was undertaken by them

with  natural  grace. Eight years  ago  Puan  Noor

Aishah  did not speak any English. Now she  speaks

it  easily. The willingness to learn, the keenness

of Singapore and her people - a striving, thrusting

society - are personified in the President and  his

wife.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it comes so naturally that one finds it

difficult  to recall what it was eight  years  ago - the  stiffness and diffidence they must have  had

to overcome to fulfil their constitutional, social

and  ceremonial duties that now come easily. As  a

consequence, Singapore has benefitted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have every confidence, Sir, in commending him

to  this  House  for  a third term  that  he  will

execute  the  duties of his high office  with  the

same  dignity, willingness, and cheerfulness  with

which he first undertook them eight years ago. And

there  is the added aplomb, the savoir faire which

eight years as Head of State, informed on all  the

matters and the crucial issues which have affected

our  lives and fortunes, have given him. Nor would

I be accused of flattery if I were to suggest that

it  would not be easy to find another citizen  and

his  wife to carry out their duties with the  same

poise and graciousness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, through all the vicissitudes of

fate  and  fortune of the last eight  and  a  half

years  - and the House will remember how  grim  the

circumstances  were from crisis  to  crisis  - with

notable exceptions, the majority of P.A.P, members

held  together as a tightly-knit and stout-hearted

team,  so  enabling my colleagues and me to  steer

our  way  forward  and  to  ride  the  stormy  and

turbulent seas of change and revolution in  South-east Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be immodest if I were to compare the

Republic   of   Singapore  and   the   President's

Government to a sturdy ship and its toughened  and

somewhat  weather-beaten crew. Together they  have

successfully  completed many voyages through  calm

and  troubled waters in fair and foul weather. And

Singapore takes it for granted that this crew will

steer  their  ship  into the seas  of  the  future

confident that it will weather any storm  that  it

may encounter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I would not be thought too jocular if

I  were to compare, by way of broad analogy, quite

a   number   of  my  colleagues,  the  President's

Ministers, to professional Chinese chess  players.

We  can  still see them in "Ta Po", or "big city",

or  the  South  Bridge Road  area.  They  offer  a

contender  three-to-one  odds  on  any  one  of  a

variety  of over half a dozen set chess positions.

The  contender  can  choose to play  either  side,

black  or  white. Very seldom does  any  contender

make the experienced hand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



lose  on his stakes. It is not altogether in  jest

that I heard it said of some of my colleagues that

they could easily turn chess professionals if they

chose to give up their portfolios.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are very few fundamentally new moves

by  colonialists, Communists or communalists which

we  have not in turn encountered and checkmated in

the   past.   Every   ploy,  each   feint,   every

distraction,  either for internal or international

consumption,  we  have watched, studied,  parried,

and  been ready to counter the real blow which was

to be delivered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time we must all be constantly

alive to the dangers of being the same persons too

long  in the same office. We are all creatures  of

habit,  and the creative and imaginative parts  in

the  human being are stifled by the repetition  of

the same thought or speech patterns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, as a government, we shall be

judged  not  just by our own performance,  but  by

whether  we  have provided for continuity  in  the

quality and the verve of political leadership  for

our  society.  It  was said of a much-loved  Asian

prime minister that he was so long in office  that

when  he  died,  it was as if a  banyan  tree  had

fallen  and  no young sapling, ready to  take  its

place, was growing under or around him - so complete

was  his dominance and that of his generation over

their whole country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Younger talent there is and always will be. And

we   must  pass  on  to  that  young  talent   the

knowledge,  the  know-how, the  tried  and  proven

methods  of  good government. Only  then  can  new

ability, dedication and sincerity of purpose  find

expression   and  relevance  in  the   necessarily

different  mood  of  a younger generation.  Whilst

perhaps  for  the present, Singapore  may  not  do

better for itself by electing some other team, the

same  need  not  be said for the middle  '70s  and

beyond. For it will be a very different world. And

it may require a different style to carry off with

good  grace  and  sustained strength  a  different

posture and a revised and up-to-date



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



set  of  political, economic  and  social

policies   which   the  continued   survival   and

increasing prosperity of our multi-racial  society

may require of its leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whilst we congratulate ourselves on the

relative  certainty and stability with  which  our

affairs are being managed, let us always have  our

eye  further  over the horizon - towards  that  day

when  another team of good men and women will take

our  places.  It is amongst these  young  men  and

women of disciplined talent and ability, with  the

freshness,  enthusiasm  and  idealism  with  which

every  new  generation brings to its task  - people

now  in  their `20s and early `30s - that  we  must

seek  the possible leaders of a robust and  rugged

generation. It is not in the nature of things,  in

an  open  competitive society  such  as  ours,  to

nominate  one's heirs and successors.  But  it  is

within  our  capacity to ensure that  long  before

that time comes, there is available a whole cohort

of  younger  people  who have  been  equipped  and

steeled for the tasks of political leadership.  To

them we should pass on the valuable experiences of

the  last  two decades, the esoteric knowledge  of

men  and the affairs of men, the insight which  we

have  gained in this strange corner of Asia  - whom

and  what  to  trust, and what are just  words  of

kindness  and comfort, the civilities of form  and

protocol, with little or no content. In so far  as

it  is humanly possible, we must ensure that there

will be enough trained ability for a team that can

give  Singapore  that pride in  achievement  which

ability,  dedication and sincerity, combined  with

iron will, can give.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with these sobering

thoughts of our wider responsibilities that I  ask

hon.   Members  to  express  their  unanimity   in

electing Inche Yusof bin Ishak as President of the

Republic of Singapore for his third term from  the

4th of December, 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the

motion moved by the Prime Minister. Heads of State

come   into   being  in  many  ways  in  different

countries.   In  some  countries,  an   individual

proclaims  himself a President  and  nobody  dares

contest  this  claim unless he has  a  bigger  and

stronger army behind him. In other countries,  the

choice  of  a Head of State may be made solely  on

the basis of hereditary caste or race or religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Singapore, the Head of State is chosen by

democratic  procedures and according to democratic

principles.  The President, who  is  our  Head  of

State,  is  chosen  by  the people  through  their

elected  representatives in Parliament.  In  other

words,  he  is a popularly elected President.  The

principles  governing  our  choice  are  that  any

citizen of Singapore, whether of high birth or  of

humble  origins,  can  be  elected  to  this  high

office. Further, in making our choice, we are  not

influenced  by  his religion or his  race.  He  is

elected  solely  on the basis of  his  merit,  his

character, his devotion to duty and the esteem  in

which he is held by the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how we in Singapore choose our President

and  this is how it should be in our multi-racial,

multi-cultural, democratic society.  A  President,

as  Head  of  State,  is more than  a  symbol.  He

should,  both  in  his public  and  private  life,

reflect  the values and virtues which our  society

cherishes.  He should be dignified and modest.  He

should  not do things in private or in  public  of

which we would be ashamed because, as the Head  of

State, he symbolises Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, this Parliament is being called upon to

elect  Inche Yusof bin Ishak as President  of  our

Republic.  The  fact that this is the  third  time

that  Inche Yusof is being nominated for this high

office  is  testimony of his fitness to fill  this

responsible  office. He has  been  in  office  for

eight  years.  They were extremely  difficult  and

decisive eight



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



years  involving  many delicate and  controversial

issues.  A less cairn and less perceptive Head  of

State could have tarnished an office which has  to

stand above the dust and din of party and partisan

controversy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Yusof has managed to preserve his office from the taint of partisanship. He has always remained the Head of the nation as a whole - not the representative of any particular community, race, class or religion. As the constitutional Head, he has performed his functions strictly in

accord   with  the  letter  and  spirit   of   the

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though as a Malay I am gratified that a member of

my community is being nominated for the third time

to   be  the  Head  of  our  Republic,  it  would,

nevertheless, be unfair to Inche Yusof and even to

my  community to say that he has been nominated to

this  office simply because he is a Malay. I  find

greater  pride  in  the  fact  that  he  is  being

nominated for no other reason than that we believe

him  to  be the Singaporean with all the qualities

necessary to hold this responsible office.  It  is

his  qualities as a man and a citizen of Singapore

and nothing else which recommend him for this high

office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, that this Parliament and the people of

Singapore  should choose him as Head of State  for

the third time is also testimony to the unwavering

multi-racial  outlook of our  Parliament  and  our

people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion by the

Prime Minister for the election of Inche Yusof bin

Ishak  as  the  President of our  Republic.  As  a

relatively  new Member of Parliament, I  have  not

had  the privilege of knowing Inche Yusof as  well

as  some  of  my other colleagues here. Therefore,

like  many  hundreds of thousands of  citizens  in

Singapore, I must judge Inche Yusof's nomination



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



for  the office of President largely by his public

record.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not propose to give a detailed

biography  of  Inche Yusof, but I  would  like  to

select some details to highlight one point -  that

the  President of a country should in his own life

and  character reflect the history and  spirit  of

the people of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, like most of us in Singapore - whether

Chinese,  Indian  or  Malay  - Inche  Yusof  is  of

immigrant  stock.  He  is  a  Malay  of   Sumatran

descent.  On the paternal side, he can  trace  his

ancestral stock to Minangkabau and on the maternal

side  to Langkat. Inche Yusof himself was born  in

Perak.  He  began  his  studies  in  Malaysia  and

finished  them  in Singapore where he  passed  his

Cambridge  School  Certificate  examination   with

distinction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, Inche Yusof's story is not unlike that

of  the  vast  majority of us  whose  fathers  and

forefathers  emigrated  from  other  countries  to

settle  in  Singapore and make it their  permanent

home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, like many of us, Incite Yusof comes

from  a  humble  family. His father  was  a  civil

servant who brought up his children in the  modest

circumstances  that most of us know.  A  President

with  these humble origins can therefore know  and

understand  the  lives  and problems  of  ordinary

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another aspect of his life which

accords   with  the  spirit  which  built   modern

Singapore and which will sustain Singapore in  the

future.  Inche  Yusof relied not on  patronage  or

privileges of birth to build a respected place for

himself  in society. While in school, he  was  the

first  student to he commissioned by the  Governor

as a Second Lieutenant in the School Cadet Corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving school, he ventured into Malay

journalism at a time when Malay journalism was not

necessarily a sure road to wealth and success.  In

1938,  he  established  (he  Utusan  Melayu  Press

Limited  which he built up into the now well-known

Utusan Melayu. He was its first managing editor.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Inche Yusof's life is not unlike that

of  thousands  of other enterprising  Singaporeans

who  succeeded because they dared to venture  into

fields  which  the  more timid  and  unimaginative

dared not go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Yusof was not merely a pioneer in the field of Malay journalism. He held many distinguished public appointments long before he was made the first Yang di-Pertuan Negara. From 1948 to 1950, he was on the Film Appeal Committee. He has served on the Natural Reserves Committee and on the

Malayanisation Commission. He has also  served  as

Chairman of the Public Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when in December 1959 Inche Yusof was

appointed  as  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara,  it   was

because he had amply demonstrated that he had  the

qualities  and character necessary  to  hold  this

responsible   office.  If  he  has,  since   then,

discharged  his duties with dignity and  devotion,

it  is  because he has brought to his  office  the

spirit and character that built modern Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a multi-racial society like ours, progress and

prosperity  will be assured so long as  we  judge,

honour and reward its citizens purely on the basis

of  merit,  character and contributions that  they

make  to  the welfare of society. We must  welcome

and use talent from whatever linguistic, racial or

religious  groups it may come. We must not  stifle

it or shut it out because it expresses itself in a

different  language  or is of  a  particular  skin

colour.  Talent  is  a  very precious  and  scarce

quality,  and  a  society which shuts  it  out  on

racial,  linguistic  or  religious  grounds   must

eventually  disintegrate  and  perish  under   the

weight of fumbling mediocrities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in supporting the election of Inche Yusof bin

Ishak as Singapore's President for a further  term

of  four years, I am supporting a Singaporean  who

has   demonstrated  that  he  has   the   relevant

qualities to hold this high office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion of the Prime Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like to join my other colleagues  in

supporting the motion standing in the name of  the

Prime  Minister. As the Prime Minister said,  this

is  the  third time that Inche Yusof bin Ishak  is

being  nominated as Head of State.  On  the  first

occasion, he was appointed by the British Queen as

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara of an internally self-governing Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second occasion, he was appointed by the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong when  Singapore  became  a

State within the Federation of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now on the third occasion, his election as

President  is to be effected by the Parliament  of

an independent Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very strong reasons why Inche Yusof,

who  has served as Head of State for eight  years,

should  once again be nominated to hold this  high

office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said that a President and Head of

State is merely a symbolical figure expected to do

no  more  than  perform dreary ceremonial  chores.

This   may   be  so  in  terms  of  constitutional

abstractions,  but  in the eyes  of  the  ordinary

people    who   do   not   understand    political

abstractions, the Head of State is something  more

than a legal abstraction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the State personified. The State cannot

open  a sports meet or a charity bazaar. But  when

the  President or his wife does these things,  the

abstract concept of State is grasped in terms that

people can understand. The President and his  lady

make the State comprehensible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being so, the character and personality of

the  President  and his wife are as  important  as

their   ability  to  perform  ceremonial   rituals

correctly.  Anybody  can  be  taught  to   perform

ceremonies of State and we should, on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



this   criterion,   have  no  difficulty   finding

candidates to fill this post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But people are not impressed simply because a

President  has managed to cut a tape  properly  at

some opening ceremony. What is important is how he

talks  and  conducts himself with the  people  who

have invited him. Just as important is what people

think  of both his private and public life.  In  a

way,  the  Head  of  State is what  every  citizen

believes a model citizen should be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his eight years in office, Inche Yusof and

his wife Puan Noor Aishah have managed to surround

the  office of the Head of State with  an  air  of

dignity and simplicity. Inche Yusof, in so far  as

he  has  personified the State  for  the  ordinary

people,  has  enhanced the popular  image  of  the

State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to repeat what some of my

colleagues have said about Inche Yusof and of  the

reasons why it is appropriate he should be elected

as President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would only like to mention two points. The

first  relates  to  his refusal  to  surround  his

office  with flamboyance and pomposity.  A  lesser

man  would have transformed himself into a larger-than-life  President. But Inche Yusof has  managed

to  make the President no more than Citizen No.  1 - an  ordinary  citizen faithfully discharging  the

duties he has been entrusted with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence of this is his choice of residence. He

could  have chosen to stay in the palatial  Istana

Negara.   However,  right  from  the   start,   he

requested that he be allowed to stay in  a  modest

bungalow in the Istana grounds. The Istana  Negara

he  uses  only  to receive and house distinguished

visitors. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



may  be  a  small  point, but  it  does  show  his

approach  to  the office he holds. He invests  the

office  of President with the necessary ceremonial

pomp, but not his person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to mention is that

in  our multi-racial society where people are  all

too ready to see communal favouritism, Inche Yusof

has  succeeded in making people accept him as  the

symbol  of  all  communities, races  and  classes.

Though he is by accident of birth a Malay, nobody,

as  far as I know, thinks of him as Malay Head  of

State. He has been accepted by all communities  as

Singapore's  President  or "Our  President".  This

again is due to his ingrained indifference to  the

racial  and  religious origins of the  peoples  he

comes  into contact with. This is a very essential

quality in our multi-racial society, especially at

this particular juncture of its history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these, among other reasons, Mr Speaker, I

support the motion by the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Article

1  of  the Constitution of Singapore, elects Inche

Yusof  bin  Ishak as President of the Republic  of

Singapore  for  a further term of  four  years  to

commence  immediately  after  the  expiry  of  his

present term of office.
