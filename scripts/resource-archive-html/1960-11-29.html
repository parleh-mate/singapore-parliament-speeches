<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 97 (2) of the Singapore

(Constitution)  Order  in  Council,   1958,   the

Minister  for Finance may at any time before  the

end  of  the  year introduce into the Assembly  a

Supplementary   Appropriation   Bill   containing

Supplementary  Estimates voted  by  the  Assembly

during the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of this year, two Supplementary

Estimates  were  approved  by  the  Assembly  for

expenditure  out  of the Consolidated  Fund.  The

expenditures from the Development Fund fall to be

dealt  with under the Development Fund Ordinance,

1959,  and  do not have to be included under  any

Appropriation   Bill.   The   two   Supplementary

Estimates  approved  by the Legislative  Assembly

were   $2,312,190  as  the  First   Supplementary

Estimates,    and   $212,240   as    the    Third

Supplementary  Estimates, giving a  total  excess

expenditure  of  $2,524,430 over  the  authorised

expenditure   of   $246,646,260   in   the   1960

Estimates.  These excesses are  detailed  in  the

Schedule  to  the  Bill  and  have  received  the

consent of the Legislative Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara's recommendation to proceed  with

this  Bill and I move, "That the Bill be now read

a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Minister for Finance can formally

present  the  Budget Estimates for the  following

year,  the  Assembly  should  first  approve,  in

principle,  this  Bill which will  integrate  the

Budgets  of  the  former  City  Council  and  the

Singapore Government. It would perhaps be helpful

if  I  were to outline the method and process  by

which the integration of the City Council and the

Rural Board into the Government Ministries is  to

be achieved, and I hope this will put the Bill in

its  proper perspective and make its purpose more

clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three stages of integration: first,

administrative  integration;  second,   financial

integration;  and  third,  complete   integration

legally by the transfer of staff and property and

the establishment of a Public Utilities Board. As

regards  the first, His Excellency the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara in his Address at the opening  of

the  present Session of the Legislative  Assembly

has   stated  that  "all  departments   are   now

administratively integrated with and directed  by

the  respective  Government Ministries".  It  was

achieved  at the beginning of this year when  the

various departments were allocated to appropriate

Ministries  and  came  under  their  control  and

responsibility for day-to-day administration  and

policies.   This   was  a  purely  administrative

arrangement  whereby Ministers in charge  of  the

Ministries acquired authority over the running of

those departments of the City Council which  were

transferred  to  them,  but  legal   and   formal

responsibility   lies  with  me   together   with

financial and staffing matters. In the course  of

this  year,  Sir, the departments have  therefore

been  functioning  within the Ministries,  and  I

hope they have all gained valuable experience  in

advance   of  complete  legal  integration.   The

Ministries  in  turn have become acquainted  with

their  new responsibilities. They have  drawn  up

new  organisational and establishment charts  and

are ready to assume formal responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second stage is that of financial

integration  which  must  take  effect  from  1st

January, 1961, by virtue of the fact



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



that  we have now, in the Budget Estimates to  be

put   forward   by  the  Minister  for   Finance,

integrated  the Budgets of the City  Council  and

the  Central Government. Two Bills are  necessary

for this purpose: one, the Property Tax Bill and,

two, the Local Government (Financial Integration)

Bill. As regards the Property Tax Bill which  the

Minister  for  Finance has  just  introduced  for

First  Reading,  I would like to  anticipate  the

Bill by making a brief reference in case property

owners  are  unduly upset by the nomenclature  of

the  Bill,  that  it is an administrative  device

whereby local rates on assessments are no  longer

payable as a result of the abolition of the Local

Government Authority, and a property tax in  lieu

of  the  local rates is to be introduced  by  the

Property  Tax Bill. The assessment provisions  of

the  Municipal Ordinance and the Local Government

Ordinance will no longer apply in 1961  and  they

will  be  replaced by similar provisions  in  the

Property   Tax  Bill  coupled  with  the   Local

Government (Financial Integration) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final stage of integration, which we hope

will  be completed by the beginning of next year,

will  be when the whole process is completed  and

the  Public  Utilities Board is set up;  and  the

staff,  assets  and liabilities as  well  as  the

formal  transfer of those functions,  duties  and

powers now exercised under the provisions of  the

Local  Government  Ordinance  and  the  Municipal

Ordinance,  are transferred either to the  Public

Utilities Board or the Government Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this last stage will be completed by two

further Bills, the Local Government (Integration)

Bill  and the Public Utilities Bill. We  hope  to

introduce  these two Bills, either in January  or

in February next year. The intention is that they

should  all become operative by the 1st of  July,

1961. This is the date from which the staff would

be  formally transferred either to the Government

or  to the Public Utilities Board, and from  that

date  all  Ministries - I  will  divest  myself  of

formal responsibility for the overall control  of

staff  and other matters of the City Council - will

assume    formal   responsibilities    for    the

departments allocated to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



them  and  for their functions and duties,  which

they are already doing administratively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Local Government (Financial

Integration) Bill, its object and purpose  is  to

enable all moneys received by virtue of the Local

Government Ordinance and the Municipal Ordinance,

excepting certain moneys specified in this  Bill,

which  are  to be excluded, to be paid  into  the

Central  Government's Consolidated Fund. It  also

provides  for payments connected with  the  Local

Government services and other functions performed

by  the  Local  Authority to be  charged  to  the

Consolidated Fund. Clause 3 of the Bill  provides

for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three trading departments are specifically

excluded from the provisions of the Bill since it

is  the  Government's intention  to  establish  a

Public Utilities Board comprising the Water,  Gas

and  Electricity Departments. Their moneys  shall

be  continued to be kept separate, and they  will

operate  their  own Budget. As hon.  Members  who

have  already had advance copies of the Estimates

will   notice,  the  Budgets  have  already  been

integrated. This is a purely administrative  Bill

to  legalise  the fusion of the two Budgets,  the

Government's and the City Council's.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[The Prime Minister].

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second budget of the P.A.P.

Government.  The  background against  which  this

budget  is  being presented is markedly different

from that a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



year  ago.  Then  we  had  to  contend  with   an

atmosphere  of uncertainty. The P.A.P. Government

had been in office for barely five months and  we

saw     how    during    election    campaigning,

irresponsible    Right-wing    Parties     worked

themselves  into  a  fright. It  would  not  have

mattered  if the hysteria they generated confined

itself  to  those  parties and  their  few

well-wishers. But in the nature of things, the  fright

campaign   must   have   further   repercussions.

Although  by November of last year we managed  to

stabilise the position considerably, there  still

remained  some  hesitation and uncertainty  which

had to be removed before the economy could settle

down to effective work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are in office for nearly a year and a

half. In making a review of the economic position

in  1960, I have the advantage that there has now

been  sufficient  time for our policies  to  make

their impact and for results to be known. This is

the ultimate test. For a government is judged not

so much by its expressions of good intentions but

by  its  concrete  achievements  in  the  way  of

economic prosperity and public welfare.  By  this

standard the people of Singapore have done well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year under review has been a good one for

Singapore.  There has been a marked expansion  in

trade, in industrial output, in the standards  of

personal consumption, in business confidence,  in

the  conditions of workers, and in the  level  of

public  services. I shall elaborate  on  this  in

more detail at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, since Singapore is a centre of

international  trade  and  part  of   the   world

economy.  I  must  make a brief review  of  major

economic events and trends in the world at large,

and  more  particularly in our  two  neighbouring

territories,   the  Federation  of   Malaya   and

Indonesia.  In  both the western  world  and  the

communist  countries.  1960  has  generally  seen

sustained   economic  expansion.  The  industrial

countries   of  Europe  consolidated  the   gains

initiated in previous years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, however, the expansion was halted in

the  third  quarter  of this year  and  important

economic  indicators  showed  a  downward  trend.

However, the economies of the western industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



world had been strengthened to a marked extent in

the  last  15 years so that, even if a  recession

were  to take place in the United States,  it  is

unlikely  that  it would lead to a general  world

recession. We have moved a long way from the late

40's  and 50's when even a mild recession in  the

United   States  brought  misfortune   to   other

countries.



<div align="center"><i>Economic Development in Asia</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia, the newly independent countries

struggle    valiantly   to    achieve    economic

development.  India prepares for a massive  third

Five-Year  Plan  in an effort to  lift  her  four

hundred  million  citizens from the  age-old  and

dire poverty. The Plan envisages a capital outlay

of  100,000  million Rupees. The  rate  of  gross

capital  accumulation  is to  be  increased  from

about 11 per cent at present to about 14 per cent

by   1965-66.  Large  new  industries  are  being

established.    Through    extensive    community

development schemes, India tries to spur  on  her

stagnant   rural  economies  to  race  ahead   of

population  pressure.  Other  South  and

South-Eastern  Asian  countries too have  accepted  the

over-riding importance of economic development as

a  national objective, though most of  them  have

not achieved, so far, the success in planning and

execution that India has.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In East Asia, the other Asian colossus, China

continues  to  make  great  strides  in  economic

development. Through the stern discipline of  the

Communist society, the Chinese have been able  to

mobilise  the manpower resources more effectively

than those countries constrained by the processes

of   democratic  persuasion.  When  six   hundred

million  industrious  people  apply  their  brain

power and muscle power in a concerted effort, the

result  cannot be other than a prodigious advance

in material output.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the non-Communist Asian countries, Japan

has   shown   the  most  striking  expansion   of

industrial  output. The Japanese plough  back  no

less than 25 per cent of their national income to

expand their economy, a rate that has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



few  equals  in contemporary history. The  result

has  been a rate of development that exceeds  the

best  achieved by Western Germany, whose economic

revival after the war has been acclaimed  by  all

as nothing short of miraculous. In 1959 the Gross

National  Product of Japan increased  by  16  per

cent, a world record. Industrial output increased

by 29 per cent. Yet this phenomenal expansion did

not bring in its train price-inflation or balance

of  payment difficulties. Prices were steady  and

Japan's   foreign   exchange  reserves   actually

increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the general picture in Asia is one in which

every   Government  has  accepted,  as  a   prime

objective  of  policy, the  conquest  of  poverty

through the expansion of material output  by  the

application  of capital and know-how.  Asians  no

longer  accept poverty, disease and ignorance  as

the  natural  order  of human society.  All  move

forward,  or  try  to  do  so,  towards  improved

material  well-being. But the journey is  a  long

and  harsh one and not everyone is aware  of  the

sustained  effort and sacrifices that  this  must

impose.



<div align="center"><i>Federation of Malaya</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, favourable conditions in the Western

industrial world send their impulses to  the  raw

material  producing countries  of  tropical  Asia

through  better prices of raw materials.  In  our

case,  this takes the form principally of  higher

prices  for  rubber and tin. Rubber  remained  at

over  $1 for the best part of this year, reaching

the  peak of $1.43 in May. Since the latter  half

of  September, there has been a sustained decline

in  prices of rubber. Rubber and tin prices  have

brought about a marked increase in prosperity  in

the   Federation  through  increasing  both   the

Government revenues and the incomes of  companies

and  persons. In Indonesia, rubber prices had not

only increased her foreign exchange earnings, but

also  increased  the  physical  quantity  of  her

rubber  exports. The effect of this has  been  to

increase  the  purchasing  power  in  these   two

countries. Singapore has directly benefited  from

prosperity  in  the Federation, although  in  the

case  of  Indonesia, the level of trade  has  not

expanded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term prospects for rubber, according

to   expert   opinion   is  sound.   Furthermore,

extensive replanting of rubber undertaken by  the

Federation in past years will be reflected in the

years  to come in increasing production. Part  of

this  increased output will flow to  the  world's

market through the port of Singapore, and this is

something  which  we  can look  forward  to  with

gratification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my last budget speech, I referred to the

necessity  for establishing some form  of  common

market  arrangements with the Federation. Members

already  know  that discussions on this  proposal

had  already commenced with the Government of the

Federation  of  Malaya, who are  making  a  close

study  of the scheme which we submitted to  them.

As  the matter is still under consideration, I do

not  think  it  appropriate for me  to  make  any

public   comment  on  it.  A  matter   of   vital

importance  in  our economic relations  with  the

Federation  of  Malaya is one  that  affects  our

currency arrangements. The currency we are  using

is  one  in  which the Governments  of  the  five

territories participated, namely, Singapore,  the

Federation  of  Malaya,  the  State  of   Brunei,

Sarawak and North Borneo. In February this  year,

the  five  Governments  initialled  an  agreement

which   makes  for  certain  changes  which   are

necessary  by  virtue  of  the  status   of   the

Federation  of  Malaya as an  independent  State.

This  agreement has been given legislative effect

by  the  passage  through this  Assembly  of  the

Currency Ordinance on the 21st of September  this

year. It now remains for all the participants  to

bring  into  force  the various ordinances  taken

through  their legislatures. As a trading centre,

we  understand the imperative need for  a  strong

and  stable currency. The Malayan dollar with its

automatic  convertibility  into  sterling,   made

possible   by   substantial  overseas   reserves,

provides such a strong currency. So now  we  have

five  territories  in this  area,  which  have  a

common  historical background of British colonial

rule,  sharing  a  common currency.  This  surely

stands  as  a stabilising economic force  to  the

advantage of all the participants. It is the hope

of my Government that it would be possible to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



retain, if necessary with suitable modifications,

the  present co-operative arrangement between the

five  territories  which has worked  so  well.  A

strong  currency is something we enjoyed  for  so

long  in  the past that its importance has  often

been  taken for granted and even overlooked.  But

without  the  firm  financial  base  of  a  sound

currency,  no underdeveloped region can  hope  to

tackle   the   immense   problems   of   economic

development.



<div align="center"><i>Indonesia</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to Indonesia. The improvement in our

relations  with  Indonesia, to which  I  referred

last  year,  continues to make progress.  A  Fact

Finding   Mission  was  sent  by  the  Indonesian

Government  to Singapore and it held  talks  with

officials  of the Singapore Government  at  which

useful  interchange  of  views  took  place.  The

Singapore Government intends to dispatch its  own

Fact Finding Mission to Djakarta to clear the way

for a trade agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the problems arising in our trade with

Indonesia are long standing and difficult.  While

we are a free trade economy with controls reduced

to  the barest minimum, the Indonesians prefer  a

policy  of  "guided economy".  This,  in  effect,

means  the imposition of controls over all  major

aspects of trade and production. What we have  to

do  is  to  meet  the legitimate requirements  of

Indonesia's guided economy in such a way  as  not

to  destroy our entrepot trade. Again, as this is

a  matter  which is under discussion between  the

two  Governments, I do not think  it  appropriate

for  me  to  make  any detailed public  comments,

except  to hope that the solution which  will  be

mutually  satisfactory  to  both  countries  will

emerge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we are pressing ahead with our

plans   to   establish  a  Trade   and   Cultural

Commission in Djakarta. I expect that  this  will

be established early next year. During the period

under  review,  trade with Indonesia  fell  to  a

slightly  lower level as compared with 1959.  Our

exports  to  Indonesia averaged $9.8 million  per

month this year as against $10.9 million in 1959.

Certain items, such as textile yarn,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



showed  a substantial increase, being about  $943

thousand  per  month this year as  compared  with

$553 thousand last year. But many items declined.

Following   upon   the   strengthening   of   the

Indonesian foreign exchange reserves,  there  has

been  a  greater diversification in the items  in

our  export to her, and one hopes that this trend

will   continue.   Our  imports  from   Indonesia

averaged $83.4 million per month as against $94.6

million  in  1959.  Rubber,  the  most  important

commodity, showed little change, averaging  $50.0

million  per  month this year  as  against  $49.7

million  last year. Petroleum products  showed  a

severe decline.



<div align="center"><i>Improvement in Singapore in 1960</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now review how Singapore has fared so far

this  year.  I  referred before to  the  improved

conditions  in  the  trade and  industry  of  our

State.  May  I  be  permitted  to  amplify   this

statement.  There was an increase in our  foreign

trade,  as I mentioned before. Total imports  and

exports  increased from $5,348  million  for  the

first 9 months of last year to $5,720 million for

the corresponding period this year. In percentage

terms this means an increase of 7 per cent.  This

increase  did  not  result entirely  from  higher

prices  of  rubber  and other  primary  products.

There was also an increase in the physical volume

of  goods handled. The greater physical volume of

trade  shows  itself  in the figures  of  cargoes

discharged and loaded in Singapore. From  January

to July this year the general cargo discharged at

the  Harbour Board wharves was 1.215 million tons

compared  with  1.132  million  tons  last  year,

representing an increase of 7.3 per  cent.  Cargo

loaded rose from 1.035 million tons last year  to

1.074 million tons this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improved trading position is reflected in

the  financial  statistics of the  country.  Bank

advances to customers increased from $503 million

in  January  to $569.5 million in September.  The

major part of this increase in bank advances



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



went to trade and commerce. In January this year,

$336.7  million was advanced to trade  rising  to

$388.4 million in September, an increase of  more

than 15 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing industries of Singapore saw a

general advance in production. Published material

on   this   subject  is  somewhat   patchy.   The

Government  has decided to remedy this  state  of

affairs  for,  having regard  to  the  importance

which it places on industrialisation, it is vital

that much more statistical information about  our

industries  should  be at our disposal  than  now

exists. Accordingly a census of manufacturers was

carried out in the third quarter of this year and

the  results  are being compiled. The  census  of

manufacturers is based on a coverage of all firms

employing  10 workers or more per factory  and  a

sample  survey  of  10 per cent  of  the  smaller

establishments. It is proposed to carry out  this

census annually so that the Government shall have

at  its disposal comprehensive and reliable  data

on the progress of industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results will not be available for some time

yet   and  we  have  to  rely  on  the  scattered

information  which it had been the past  practice

to  collect. This shows a fairly substantial  all

round  increase  in the output  of  manufacturing

industries. Other than soft drinks and soap,  all

industries  covered  show considerable  advances.

The  cigarette industry continues to  make  great

strides, the quantity produced in the first  nine

months  of  the year increasing from 1.6  million

pounds  in 1959 to 2.1 million pounds this  year,

an  increase  of  28 per cent.  Other  industries

which show substantial progress are coconut  oil,

25  per  cent increase, rubber footwear,  23  per

cent  increase, and remilled rubber 36  per  cent

increase.   The   electric  power   consumed   by

industries increased by 13 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry which had been

depressed  for  some considerable time  began  to

press  ahead.  This was principally  due  to  the

building programme of the Housing and Development

Board, which was established



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



this year. The Board lost no time in getting down

to   work   and  pulling  itself   out   of   the

difficulties  created  in  the  S.I.T. by   the

mismanagement of the former Minister for National

Development.  The  Housing and Development  Board

has  to  date awarded contracts to the  value  of

$21.8 million and by the end of this year expects

to  increase it to $27.3 million. This will  mean

that  in  about  a year's time,  when  all  these

houses  and flats would be completed,  8,350  new

homes   will  be  available  for  the  ill-housed

citizens  of Singapore. An innovation  which  the

Housing Board intends to introduce is the $20 per

month  one-room flat for workers whose income  do

not permit them better accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revival of the construction industry this

year   brings  about  improved  figures  in   the

production and import of building materials.  The

output  of sawn timber has increased from  10,300

cubic  tons in January this year to 16,700  cubic

tons  in August. Imports of cement and steel bars

increased  substantially in  the  course  of  the

year.  For the third quarter of this year,  these

are   34   per  cent  and  20  per  cent   higher

respectively  than  the average  for  last  year.

Bricks  have gone down badly but this appears  to

result   from  the  greater  use  of   substitute

material, principally cement blocks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expansion of trade and industry going

on  at  the  rate described above, it  is  to  be

expected  that,  as people have  higher  incomes,

they  will purchase more goods. There are certain

consumer  goods  the  demand for  which  reflects

sensitively  changes in personal  incomes.  These

are  the luxury and semi-luxury goods. The import

of  refrigerators  showed a  continuous  increase

during  the year. For the third quarter  of  this

year,  the  number of refrigerators imported  was

more than 50 per cent higher than the average for

1959. The registration of new motor cars showed a

similar  marked increase. Compared with the  1959

average, new motor car registrations were 39  per

cent  higher  in the third quarter of  this  year

than   in  1959.  The  number  of  motor   cycles

registered showed an even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



greater increase - in the third quarter of 1960, it

was  more  than  2½ times last  year's  average

quarterly  rate. So too were the  number  of  new

driving   licences.  This  showed  a   continuous

increase during the year, from 5,500 in the first

quarter to 6,300 in the third quarter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the indications are that there was a

solid and substantial revival of the economy this

year. What is remarkable in this economic revival

is that the expansion in trade and production did

not  bring  about any inflationary  process.  The

currency  in  circulation for the Malayan  dollar

area   remained  practically  stationary,   being

$1,162  million in January and $1,166 million  in

September. Prices of consumer goods did not rise.

On  the  contrary, the official index  of  retail

prices showed a decline of 5.4 points from  317.2

in  January  to 311.8 in September. I am  acutely

aware of the inadequacies of the present official

price  index  and am taking steps to institute  a

new  series which will have a more scientific and

realistic  basis.  Whatever  the  faults  of  the

present  index, if there is any error introduced,

it  would be in the direction of understating the

fall  in prices. This is due to certain technical

reasons into which I need not enter here.  Taking

into  account all items of consumer goods in  the

course  of the year, there has been a significant

fall  in prices. There are very few instances  in

contemporary  economic  history  where   economic

expansion    and    falling    prices    occurred

simultaneously.



<div align="center"><i>New Industries</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of industrial expansion has shown

improvement since the last budget. There are  now

no  less than 54 projects under various stages of

consideration  for the award of  pioneer  status.

Twenty-six projects can be considered to be  firm

proposals  and  gazette notifications  have  been

issued or will soon be issued in respect of those

that  qualify  for pioneer status.  The  two  oil

refineries  have  already  been  awarded  pioneer

status and construction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



work  has  commenced. Some of the new  industries

for  which  pioneer  status is  being  considered

include  the  manufacture  of  a  wide  range  of

consumer   goods   such   as   condensed    milk,

chocolates, toothpaste, garments, matches and  so

forth.  Among  the  major  proposals  are   flour

milling,  textile  weaving and  a  steel  rolling

mill.  The  total capital involved in  all  these

projects is well over $100 million, and when they

are  in  operation, they would provide employment

for more than 2,500 workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Projects still in the exploratory stages include

a  wide  range of industries. I do not,  however,

propose to supply more information about them  at

this  stage.  The  authorized  capital  of  these

projects is estimated to be in the region of  $70

million  and  they would provide  employment,  if

carried to fruition, for some 2,000 workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As distinct from the establishment of new

industries,   the  expansion  of  existing   ones

proceeds   apace.   Many  of  these   are   small

establishments. Since we assumed office, 85 small

factories have been established providing a total

employment of 1,049 workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal circumstances, industrial expansion of

the  scale  I  have described can  be  considered

satisfactory.  However, in the present  situation

of  Singapore with its population explosion, much

more is required. An expansion of at least 2 to 3

times  the present rate would be necessary.  Much

more needs to be done to accelerate the growth of

industry. Members are aware of the various  teams

of  international experts who have recently  been

in  Singapore and who are, at the present moment,

conducting  their investigations here.  There  is

Mr P. L. Schereschewsky who came to Singapore in

July  this  year on a preliminary  study  of  the

prospects  of  establishing a steel  industry  in

this  island.  He  has completed his  preliminary

report and will return soon with a larger team of

specialists in various lines of steel  production

and marketing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mission sent by the United Nations Technical

Assistance  Administration to  study  methods  of

industrial  expansion in Singapore  is  the  most

powerful  team that has been dispatched  by  that

organisation.   It  is  headed  by   Dr   Albert

Winsemius who has a distinguished record both  as

a  Government  official and as an  industrialist.

Members   of   his  team  include  an  Electrical

Engineer,   a  Chemical  Engineer,  a  Mechanical

Engineer,  an  Industrial  Site  Planner  and   a

Shipbuilding Engineer. The team has been  working

very  hard  since their arrival in  October  this

year  and  we  look  forward to  receiving  their

report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the conditions necessary for rapid

industrial  growth  is  peace  and  stability  in

labour-management    relations.    The     P.A.P.

Government is a Government elected by the  people

and  is one that is partial to the working class.

It  is  to  be  expected that workers  and  their

unions  would take steps to redress the disparity

of   power  which  they  experienced  under   the

previous Government. There have been a number  of

claims  for  wage increases nearly all  of  which

were  settled amicably by negotiation. There have

been   more   claims  for  fringe  benefits   and

substantial gains were made in respect of these.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is natural that employers profess alarm at

the  revival  of  trade union strength.  Although

there  have been some individual instances  where

the  unions displayed an unnecessary waywardness,

on   the  whole  the  labour  position  is   well

contained through co-operation between the  union

leaders  and the Ministry of Labour and Law.  For

the  most  part  both labour and management  have

shown    good   sense   to   effect   settlements

satisfactory to all. Those who take alarm at  the

manifestations  of  increasing  activity  of  the

unions should not lose their sense of proportion.

The  P.A.P. Government is fully aware of the need

for peace and stability. This is one of the basic

pillars  of our policy. The close attention  with

which  we have paid to this problem has expressed

itself in many items of legislation, particularly

in  the  recent  establishment of the  Industrial

Court.  The  P.A.P. Government is as  anxious  as

anybody else



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



to  press  ahead  with  the industrialisation  of

Singapore,  which cannot be brought  about  under

unsettled  labour conditions. The Government  has

asked  the  Singapore Trades Union  Congress  for

full  and  wholehearted co-operation in  bringing

about  this  stability  and  discussions  are  in

progress on how this can be brought about.



<div align="center"><i>The Economic Policy of the P.A.P. Government</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discussed industrial expansion and its

relation   to   labour   and   capital   in   the

circumstances we find ourselves in Singapore. The

policy  of the P.A.P. Government in these matters

is  implied rather than explicitly stated  in  my

remarks. I wish to take this opportunity to dwell

more extensively on it for now we are entering an

area  in  which  the  cobwebs  of  prejudice  and

preconceptions   abound   and   frustrate   clear

thinking.  It is important that these cobwebs  be

swept   aside  so  as  to  leave  no   room   for

misunderstanding.  There is  no  doubt  that  the

volume of misunderstanding is considerable  among

the unthinking sections of the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman is somewhat surprised that not

only have we not expropriated his property but we

have   given   him   every   encouragement    and

opportunity   to  expand  his  enterprise.   Some

doctrinaires are angered that we have not  pulled

down the house in the name of revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic revival which I discussed has been

contrived   principally  through   the   existing

institutions  of  free enterprise.  A  number  of

persons in left wing organisations, trade unions,

political  parties and so forth on noticing  this

phenomenon have expressed dissatisfaction. It  is

sometimes  alleged  in these  quarters  that  the

P.A.P. has  moved  away from  its  revolutionary

ideas.  I  want  to examine these allegations  in

some  detail  and  in  so doing  to  clarify  the

economic policy of the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some persons who call themselves socialists

almost  regard as an axiom that when a  socialist

government  assumes power it must set  about  the

task of socialising the means of production. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



simple  words  this  means nationalising  private

business. What is the P.A.P. policy on this?  Did

we  say  to  the electorate that we  intended  to

nationalise private business and on assumption to

office go back on our words?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the evidence points to the contrary. In the

series  of  electoral statements which have  been

compiled  in a volume entitled "The Tasks

Ahead - P.A.P.'s   5-Year  Plan - 1959-64",   the   chapter

dealing with economic policy states quite clearly

that  the  industrialisation  programme  will  be

achieved  through  the  institution  of   private

ownership  and free enterprise. We even  went  to

the  extent of stating our stand towards  foreign

businessmen, and I quote from page 25 of  Part  I

of the "The Tasks Ahead":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Foreign business concerns which wish to

establish  factories in Singapore will  be  given

all  the encouragement and assistance they  need.

We  shall  give  them  guarantees  in  regard  to

security of capital, remittance of dividends  and

other matters which all modern governments regard

as normal practice".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Fourth Anniversary Celebration Souvenir

number  of the Party published as early as  1958,

it  was  made  quite clear that we have  not  the

slightest intention on assumption of office to go

for nationalisation. May I quote from page 14  of

the Souvenir number:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first and most obvious conclusion we can

draw is that the scope of realising socialism  in

Singapore is narrow. The entrepot trade cannot be

socialised.  Such factories as we  now  have  are

hardly worth nationalising and they should remain

in private ownership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is required in the next few years is a

substantial     expansion    of     manufacturing

industries.  How  is this to take  place?  It  is

obvious  that private enterprise should be  given

the   maximum  encouragement  to  establish   new

factories in order to provide employment for  our

increasing population".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could be clearer than that we have been

consistent  in our actions and that  our  present

policies  date  back from unequivocal  statements

made  before the elections to the public  and  to

the electorate. It is therefore absolute nonsense

to  say  that we have deviated from our  previous

intentions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can our policies be distinguished from those

of a non-socialist government? The answer to this

question can be set out both in terms of  general

principles  and  in  relation  to  the   specific

problems  facing Singapore. In countries emerging

from colonial rule, an immense amount remains  to

be  done  to bring about equality of opportunity,

in  the  abolition of unearned privilege, in  the

attack on the evils of poverty and ignorance  and

generally  in laying the foundations  of  a  more

just  social order. It can redress the  imbalance

between the working class and the employers which

in   the  colonial  regime  was  tipped  strongly

against  the workers. Under the colonial  regime,

many  persons  had  their  opportunities  limited

through  no  fault of their own. In Singapore  we

know how circumscribed were the opportunities for

useful  careers open to those who did not receive

an  English language education. We have also seen

how  the  P.A.P.  Government  has  brought  about

greater  and more equal opportunities  for  those

who  have been to the middle schools and  Nanyang

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A socialist government would not merely bring

about  equality  of opportunities between  groups

and classes in the country. It would also try  to

expand  opportunities for all to  exercise  their

abilities to the full for the benefit of society.

In  Singapore  this  is  a  most  urgent  problem

because  of our rapid population growth  and  the

prospect of mounting unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A right wing government would view this not with

alarm    but   with   delight.   For   increasing

unemployment must sap the strength of the working

class  movement by reducing the bargaining  power

of organised labour. When this happens then wages

will go down, exploitation of workers intensified

and  profits  increase.  A Right-wing  government

would  therefore feel no urgency about  expanding

the    economy    and    increasing    employment

opportunities through industrialisation. It  will

leave the free play of economic forces to produce

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



desired  adjustment, which will be to the benefit

of employers and the detriment of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A socialist government, on the other hand, views

the  prospect  of  increasing  unemployment  with

grave  anxiety  and  will strain  itself  to  the

utmost to avoid this situation. The expansion  of

the economy however means that money will have to

be  found  somehow  to finance  those  additional

economic  and industrial services and  facilities

which are needed. A socialist government will get

the  money  through taxation in such a  way  that

those  who  can  afford to pay  taxes  share  the

greatest  responsibility.  Therefore  by   fiscal

measures wealth is withdrawn from those  who  are

better off and put to uses for the benefit of the

whole society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this can be done within the framework of

private  ownership  of industry.  In  the  modern

state,  the instruments of regulation  that  have

been  developed in so many countries have  become

both varied and refined. They can be used for any

number of purposes according to the policy of the

government of the day. For instance, they can  be

used  for the purpose of preparation for  war  in

support of aggression against other countries. Or

they  may  be  designed to enrich those  who  are

already  rich and impoverish those who are  poor.

Or they may be used both to increase the national

wealth  and to redress gross inequalities in  its

distribution without at the same time  destroying

the  incentives  to effort and  enterprise  which

sustain  the functioning of the system of private

ownership.



<div align="center"><i>Review of Expenditure in 1960</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from this long but necessary

dissertation on basic principles, I now  turn  to

more  mundane affairs. In fact I turn to a review

of  Government expenditure and revenue  in  1960.

The  1960  Estimates were framed on the basis  of

expenditure being in the neighbourhood of  $275.3

million  and revenue at $269.2 million. In  other

words,  there  would have been a  deficit  of  $6

million to be paid from cash reserves during  the

year. In addition to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



estimated  expenditure, the  Assembly  was  asked

during  1960, to approve Supplementary  Estimates

of  $2.5 million, $200,000 of which was met  from

savings,  making a net additional expenditure  of

$2.3   million.   Thus,   the   total   estimated

expenditure for 1960 was $277.8 million  and  the

estimated deficit was increased to $8.5  million.

This  sets the picture out in so far as Estimates

are concerned. However, there is the question  of

ability to fulfil these Estimates and here  there

is  some  doubt as to the possibility of spending

$277  million this year. The main reason for this

can   be  said  to  be  that  the  machinery   of

Government  in 1959 - in fact commencing  from  the

latter half of 1958 - was severely curtailed in its

activities  because  of restrictions  imposed  on

expenditure  due  to  the  decline  of   economic

activity  in  the  State  and  the  slight  world

recession in trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is evidenced by the total expenditure over

the  various quarters of the years concerned.  In

the  first quarter of 1959, total expenditure was

$50.9  million;  for  the second  quarter,  $57.7

million;  for  the third quarter, $52.0  million,

and  for  the  fourth quarter, $54.6 million.  In

1960, the downward trend continued but there  are

now signs of improvement. About $50.0 million was

spent in the first quarter; $52.0 million in  the

second  quarter;  $54.0  million  in  the   third

quarter  and  it is estimated that $65.0  million

excluding  a  transfer  of  $20  million  to  the

Development  Fund would be spent  in  the  fourth

quarter.  This, however, still gives a  shortfall

of  about  $30  million on  the  total  budgetted

expenditure for the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also be noted that total expenditure

never  does  keep  up with the  Estimates,  there

being time lags in payments, delays in fulfilling

orders,  difficulties of recruitment, or planning

and  implementation problems. For instance,  from

1950   to  1958,  total  expenditure  had   never

exceeded  total  estimates except  in  1954  when

$240.5 million was voted and $248.9 million spent

and  it  was only in 1951 and 1952 that estimates

were nearly achieved by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



actual  expenditure.  For the  rest,  expenditure

fell  short  of  estimates and in 1955  and  1953

under-expenditure  was $32.8  million  and  $40.7

million respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the general picture has been given. Now

with  regard to the details of under-expenditure.

The  following  is  an  indication,  Ministry  by

Ministry, of under-expenditure against  the  1960

Estimates.  The  Prime  Minister's  Ministry  has

underspent  to  the extent of $3.6  million.  The

main reason for this is the fact that Rural Board

works  on  roads and building constructions  have

been  delayed by a lack of engineering staff.  In

addition, about $1½ million will not  be  spent

by the Public Works Department because of lack of

engineers and architects to supervise maintenance

work  for  which an estimate of $6.8 million  was

made  in  the Budget. Roughly only $5½  million

will  be  spent. In this connection, it  must  be

stated that though every effort is being made  to

bring  the  establishment  of  the  Public  Works

Department   to   strength,   there   are   still

deficiencies  in a number of senior  posts  which

cannot  be filled substantively since experienced

men  are  not available. The Ministry  of  Health

will  underspend to the extent of  $6.8  million.

The large under-expenditures occur under Personal

Emoluments where it has been extremely  difficult

to  recruit  professional  medical  officers  and

specialists and where there have been substantial

delays  in  recruiting and training of  ancillary

staff. Then, under Special Expenditure, there has

been  a drop in Hospitals Board and Tan Tock Seng

Hospital's  expenditure because of the  shortages

of staff referred to above. The Government is now

taking   action   to  recruit  overseas   trained

personnel to strengthen the establishment of  the

Ministry  of  Health and it is hoped  that  under

these conditions, the Ministry will be able fully

to perform its functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministry of Finance, under-expenditure

of  about  $7.4 million will occur in  1960,  the

main  reason  being that it was not necessary  to

seek  loan  money  to  such  an  extent  as   was

envisaged.  $2 million therefore remains  unspent

on  account  of  the  Public Debt.  In  addition,

Pensions,   Retiring  Allowances  and  Gratuities

amounted to only $16.6



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



million as against the estimate of $18.6 million,

there  being smaller pensions payable  than  have

been   estimated   for,   thus   affecting   both

commutations of gratuities and rates of  pensions

payable. Finally, it is estimated that because of

stricter  controls  on  travelling  and  courses,

fellowships  and scholarships abroad, expenditure

under  the  head "Ministry of Finance"  would  be

smaller than expected. There has also been  staff

re-organisations so that it has been possible  to

keep  down  the  cost of the votes providing  for

replacement of officers under training, on  short

leave,  sick  leave,  etc. There  has  been  some

slight   under-expenditure  in  the

Accountant-General's  and  the  Inland  Revenue  Departments

totalling   roughly  $200,000   and   these   are

accounted  almost completely for by the  shortage

of personnel in Division I of the Public Service.

With  regard to the Ministry of Labour  and  Law,

there  will be a very small under-expenditure  of

about $½ million and this is accountable almost

completely  by  more  careful  administration  of

residential   institutions, community   centres,

creches as well as stricter investigation of  all

claims for public assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry of Culture, under-expenditure

will  be also very small, roughly $400,000.  This

is  due  to under-expenditure in the Broadcasting

Division as well as the Printing Division because

of a more careful distribution of work and better

and  more  efficient organisation of  facilities.

Under  the Ministry of Home Affairs, about  $2½

million will not be spent. This is mainly due  to

under-expenditure on the Defence Services because

of  the  abolition of the M.A.A.F. and delays  in

recruitment  and  problems of obtaining  seconded

personnel to the Singapore Military Forces.  Also

$1.2  million will not be spent from Police votes

because  of  vacancies  in  senior  appointments,

difficulties  in  recruiting  constables  of  the

higher  standards  now laid down  and  delays  in

fulfilling   requisitions   for   equipment   and

furnishings.  Finally, there will be  about  $5.3

million  underspent  for  Education  because   of

controls on grants-in-aid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



payments  and appointments of teachers  where  it

has   not  been  possible  to  recruit  qualified

personnel.



<div align="center"><i>Revenue in 1960</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the principal items of revenue, income tax

yield  is  estimated at $75 million for  1960  as

against  the provisional estimate of $65  million

at the beginning of the year. At the beginning of

the  year, it was expected that the slightly less

favourable  trading conditions  would  result  in

lower  incomes and lower income tax  collections.

This  increase is attributable to more  energetic

measures  being taken in following up assessments

and ensuring speedy collection and the policy  to

deal  with the large assessments at once  leaving

the smaller assessments to later in the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against the estimated revenue of $43.1

million   in   respect  of  tobacco   duty,   the

collections up to the end of October amounted  to

$33.2  million and it is likely that the  end  of

the  year figures will show collections about  $3

million below the original estimates. This is  in

the  main due to a change in consumer habits away

from  foreign  imported brands of cigarettes  and

tobacco  to  locally manufactured  products.  The

rate  of duty on these is smaller. There was also

a  switch in use by manufacturers from cut rag to

tobacco  leaf,  the rate of duty  on  the  latter

being lower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petroleum revenue was estimated at $40.4

million.   Figures  for  the  first  ten   months

indicate that the actual revenue will be  in  the

region  of  $38  million,  a  shortfall  of  $2.4

million. This year's collection will, however, be

higher  than the actual revenue of $34.2  million

in  1959.  The  revenue  estimates  will  not  be

reached   partly   due  to   the   lower   petrol

consumption  of  smaller  cars  which  are   more

popular   nowadays.  There  has  also   been   an

increasing  tendency  for taxis  to  switch  from

petrol to diesel fuel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquor revenue was originally estimated at $23.5

million  and  this  would probably  be  realised.

There has been an increase in demand for imported

beer at the expense of imported spirits and local

beer  but the overall production at the two local

breweries has exceeded the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



previous  year's figure. The anticipated  revenue

of $7 million for Entertainment Duty this year is

likely to be achieved by the end of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against an estimate of $4 million on taxes on

totalisators   and   sweepstakes,   the    actual

collections for the first ten months amounted  to

$4.7  million  and  it  is anticipated  that  the

original  estimate  will  be  exceeded  by   $1.2

million   by   the   end   of   the   year.   The

intensification  of  the war  on  bookmakers  has

resulted  in higher takings on the tote,  thereby

increasing  the  amount payable to  the  revenue.

Stamp  Duty  was  estimated at $3.8  million  but

there  is  likely  to  be  a  shortfall  of  $½

million.  As against this, Estate Duty may  yield

an  excess of $400,000 over the estimated  figure

of $4 million.



<div align="center"><i>Surplus for 1960</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main revenue sources I have mentioned will,

in  the  aggregate,  achieve an  excess  of  $5.7

million  as compared with the original estimates.

There was, in addition, a welcome addition to our

funds  which was not provided for last year.  The

Government of the Federation of Malaya agreed  to

commence  the  repayment of the $30 million  loan

made  by  the Singapore Government in 1954.  This

repayment  is not due until 1964 at the earliest.

However,   in   view  of  the  extremely   strong

financial  position of the Federation Government,

we  made  a request to them that the $30  million

loan  be repaid earlier than scheduled, in  three

annual  instalments  of  $10  million  each.  The

Federation  Minister  of  Finance  took  a   very

sympathetic view of our request which  was  based

on  our urgent need for development finance. I am

sure  Members  will  join me  in  expressing  our

appreciation of the sympathetic manner with which

the  Federation  Government met our  request  for

early repayment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the accounting convention regulating

Government accounts, which is conducted on a cash

basis,  the  $10  million capital  repayment  was

credited to the revenue account. This has enabled

the revenue to exceed the estimates by nearly $16

million. The result of combined under-expenditure

and  revenue  excess is that  the  year  1960  is

likely to end in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



substantial  surplus of $37 million.  Expenditure

should stand at $248 million and revenue at  $285

million.  Even  after  taking  into  account  the

capital  receipt of the loan repayment, a sizable

surplus still remains in the Ordinary Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as this surplus is the result of strict

control   of   expenditure   exercised   by   the

Government, the position is gratifying. But there

is  another reason for under-expenditure which is

less   welcome.   This  is   the   inability   of

departments  to realise their special expenditure

items.   Such  expenditure  requires   a   fairly

prolonged  period  of preparation  and  planning.

This  is  especially  true  of  public  work  and

construction.   Owing   to   the   shortages   of

Engineers,   Architects,  Surveyors   and   other

technical  staff, much of this construction  work

could not be initiated early enough this year for

completion and payment during the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bottlenecks to expenditure have, as I

stated before, given grounds for anxiety.  It  is

apparent that there must be a review of policy in

regard  to  methods of preparation, planning  and

supervision    of    special   expenditure    and

development projects. The Government has  already

set  up a Commission to enquire into the capacity

of   the  building  trade.  This  Commission  has

submitted its preliminary findings and has made a

number  of  valuable proposals in regard  to  the

organisation of Government Departments  concerned

in  building  and construction. These  are  under

examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to strengthen the

technical   personnel   of   the   Public   Works

Department  by  recruitment  or  secondment  from

overseas  countries.  We are holding  discussions

with  the United Kingdom Commission, Commonwealth

and  consular representatives of various overseas

governments  to obtain their assistance  in  this

matter. The first result of this policy has  come

to light only a few days ago. Last week a team of

six  Japanese  Engineers and Industrial  Planners

arrived in Singapore. These were appointed by the

Japanese  Government,  at  the  request  of   the

Singapore Government for assistance in making



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



physical plans for the Jurong Industrial  Estate.

It  is likely that we shall make use of technical

assistance  of this kind from overseas  countries

for  several of the major projects entered in our

Development   Plan.   The  Government   is   also

considering other methods whereby our shortage of

experienced  technical  staff  may  be  overcome.

There is the possibility of more extensive use of

Consulting  Engineers and  the  adoption  of  the

system  of  international tenders for design  and

construction for major projects. By such methods,

it  is  hoped  that  the  substantial  volume  of

construction  work,  which  will   have   to   be

undertaken  in  the  next  four  years,  can   be

successfully undertaken.



<div align="center"><i>The 1961 Expenditure Estimates</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the 1961 Estimates. First

the   Ordinary  Expenditure.  By  far  the   most

important  feature  of the  1961  Budget  is  the

inclusion  within it of monies for Government  to

undertake all functions, other than those of  the

public  utilities  now  performed  by  the   City

Council.  In the People's Action Party manifesto,

the   intention  of  abolishing  the  politically

separate  entities of the City Council and  Rural

Board has been stated as one of the planks of the

Party   platform.  Over  the  past   12   months,

therefore, administrative arrangements have  been

gradually unfolding to provide for the absorption

of  the local government functions into those  of

the  State. It is now possible to take the  final

step  which will completely merge in all respects

these  organisations into the Central Government.

The  Budget has, therefore, been framed  on  this

basis  and  in  1961 all monies  payable  to  the

Municipal Consolidated Rate Fund will now come to

the  Government,  except for  those  specifically

allocated  to  the public utilities functions  of

the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Rural Board, the procedure is

much   simpler  since  Government  financed   the

difference  between  revenue and  expenditure  by

means  of an annual contribution and it has meant

amalgamating physically the Rural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



Board   estimates   into  those   of   Government

Departments  which  will  undertake   its   work.

Following on this, all the facilities provided by

the  City Council and Rural Board have got to  be

undertaken  by  Government.  Wherever   possible,

similar facilities undertaken by Government  have

been reorganised or expanded to take into account

new undertakings in the city and rural areas.  It

has  resulted, in some instances, in considerable

savings in expenditure due to the possibility  of

removing  duplication or, in  some  instances,  a

slight expansion of Government facilities with  a

withdrawal  of  the cost of the Local  Government

function.    However,   certain    administrative

difficulties  are  bound to arise,  the  main  of

which   are  those  relating  to  personnel   and

finance.  There  are the problems of  maintaining

the  same  status  and terms  and  conditions  of

service  of  City  Council employees  within  the

Government framework. Since about 8,000 employees

are   concerned,  this  is  a  question  of  some

magnitude.  However, there have been  established

working  parties  to go into these  problems  and

their    reports   which   take   into    account

organisational  and  establishment   aspects   of

integration with regard to staff matters are  now

under  consideration by Government.  Negotiations

will   commence   with   the   respective   staff

associations  to work out an equitable  means  of

absorption   of   City  Council  employees   into

Government.  There  is  no  intention  to  reduce

salaries, retrench staff or generally vary  terms

and  conditions  of  service.  However,  a  large

measure  of  "give  and take" will  be  necessary

since  two  relatively  separate  structures  are

being   interwoven  into  a  pattern  of  Central

Government  organisation. On the financial  side,

the   main  problems  are  what  one  would  call

"accounting  difficulties". The City Council  has

run  its budget on an accrual basis, i.e., income

and  expenditure were the basis of the accounting

system. Government, however, runs its accounts on

a  cash  basis and frames its budget on  receipts

and   payments.   The  two  systems   are   quite

incompatible and it has been necessary to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



make  a  number  of  accounting  adjustments   to

provide  for the gradual transfer of the  accrual

to  the  cash basis. Fortunately, in this respect

there  has been time and with the advice of three

experts loaned by the Canadian Government, it has

been possible to devise a satisfactory compromise

which  will  come  into  operation  on  the   1st

January,  1961. It will be possible therefore  to

operate a Budget which takes into account the new

Integrated Departments though still acknowledging

that certain procedures will have to be continued

with the City Council techniques. There will, for

instance,  have  to  remain  the  entity   of   a

Municipal  Provident Fund and contributions  will

have  to  continue until such time as an amicable

and  workable arrangement has been resolved  with

regard  to the retiring benefits of City  Council

employees. However, it is hoped that during  1961

most  of  these problems will have been  resolved

and   consolidation  of  the   local   government

functions into the Central Government sphere will

be accomplished in time for the 1962 Budget which

could  be  in  all  senses a  Central  Government

Budget of the State of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the integration of the Local

Governments into the Central Government. Now  for

the  more  specific increases in  expenditure  on

account  of Government Departments in  1961.  The

total  estimated expenditure for  what  could  be

called  "Government Departments" will  be  $308.5

million,  an increase of $33.2 million  over  the 1960 Estimates.  By  far the  largest  and  most

important  increases  have  occurred  under   the

Ministry  of Health ($6.5 million), the  Ministry

of  Finance  ($16.8  million),  the  Ministry  of

Labour and Law ($4.5 million) and the Ministry of

Education ($2.8 million). The large increases  in

the  Ministry of Health are due to two  important

changes in the Budget. The first is the necessity

to  provide  in  the  Budget now  for  Hospitals'

Board's  expenditure and the expenditure formerly

incurred   by   the   Tan  Tock   Seng   Hospital

Corporation. Both these organisations  have  been

abolished   and  the  Ministry  of   Health   now

undertakes the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



direct  administration of the two  organisations.

The  reasons for this have already been explained

and   could   be  summarised  in  one   word   as

"organisational" though also the question of  the

responsibility for health services  resting  with

the  Minister  for  Health  and  not  with  these

independent organisations was also another  valid

reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue and expenditure of these two bodies

will  now  be part of the Government account.  An

addition  of roughly $3 million which was  before

found  from  the Hospitals Board's and  Tan  Tock

Seng  Hospital  revenue  will  now  have  to   be

provided  as expenditure from Government  because

these  revenues  will be paid straight  into  the

Consolidated  Fund and cannot be  netted  against

expenditure. In addition, there has also been  an

increase    in   estimated   Hospitals    Board's

expenditure  by about $3 million  for  1961.  The

same  procedure would have to be applied for  Tan

Tock Seng Hospital where the whole expenditure is

now shown under the Ministry of Health though  in

fact here the increase is much smaller since only

$100,000  or  so  of  Tan  Tock  Seng  Hospital's

revenue has got to be met from Government  funds.

There   is   also   an  increase   in   estimated

expenditure on personal emoluments by about $2½

million because of the increase in nursing  staff

and  ancillary medical workers, the total  number

of  new posts being roughly 300. There have  been

relatively  small  increases in the  professional

grades  since  it  is proposed to  fill  existing

vacancies before new posts are created. The total

number of Divisions I and II new posts is 50.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large increase in the Ministry of Finance is

due   to   two  factors:  one  is  the  increased

contribution   of   $10   million   towards   the

Development Fund. As stated before in the revenue

estimates,  there is expected to be a payment  of

$10  million by the Federation of Malaya  towards

repayment of the $30 million loan made to  it  by

Singapore in 1954. There has been a first payment

of  $10  million this year and there  will  be  a

final  payment  of $10 million  in  1962.  It  is

essential that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



what is virtually a capital payment should not be

dissipated  on  recurrent  expenditure.  However,

because  of  the limitations of the Constitution,

it  is  necessary that this windfall  payment  be

made  direct into the Consolidated Fund. The only

way to transfer it out to the Development Fund is

by  means of the Contribution towards Development

vote   under  the  Ministry  of  Finance  or   by

Supplementary  Estimates  under  the  Development

Fund    Ordinance,   both   ways   are    legally

permissible.  It  is  therefore  felt  that   the

Contribution towards Development under  Head  28,

Subhead  53 of the Ordinary Estimates  should  be

increased  from  the normal $20  million  to  $30

million.  This is an indication of the importance

Government attaches to the expansion of  economic

development and industrialisation of  the  State.

The  other increases are due to $2 million  being

provided  as  an Advance Account  to  enable  the

Pubic  Works Department to make forward purchases

for  the  integrated City Engineer's  Department;

$2.8  million for the Public Debt and $2  million

for Pensions, Retirement Allowances, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another significant increase in the Estimates is

the  Ministry  of Labour and Law's  provision  of

$3½  million  for  the  Work  Brigade  and  the

Industrial  Arbitration Court. The  functions  of

the  Work  Brigade have also been explained  when

the  1960 Budget was introduced in this Assembly.

Members  were told of the provision of $7 million

as  unemployment  relief  works  to  be  executed

through the Work Brigade. Already a large  number

of  labour  intensive projects have started.  The

establishment  of camps has already  taken  place

and  recruitment and training of the  Brigade  is

taking  place. There is now available a  core  of

experienced  and hardworking personnel  available

to  Government  to  undertake some  of  the  more

intensive  labour  projects  of  the  development

programme. A Director has recently been appointed

who  will now co-ordinate the administrative  and

technical aspects of the Brigade. It is no longer

felt that the provision for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



the   Work  Brigade  should  be  regarded  as   a

developmental   expenditure  and  therefore   the

monies   are  being  provided  in  the   ordinary

Estimates    under   the   Ministry    for    the

administration of the Brigade and expenditure  on

its projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very significant development is the

establishment   of  the  Industrial   Arbitration

Court.  The  Court has already begun to  function

and  in  time will take its place as one  of  the

major  pillars  of the State ensuring  industrial

peace  with justice. The total cost is  estimated

at about $100,000. Then there will be an increase

of  about  $1 million for expenditure  on  public

assistance and the development and integration of

community  associations. The latter is now  being

firmly  pursued through the People's Association.

A  large  number of community centres  have  been

built  and  work  on  providing  integration  and

development is being pushed ahead. With regard to

public  assistance, with the  improved  tempo  of

economic  activity in the State and more  careful

scrutiny and investigation of claims, it will  be

possible  to  keep expenditure within  reasonable

bounds  and  therefore only a small  increase  is

contemplated  for  1961. Finally,  there  is  the

large  increase of the Ministry of  Education  of

$2.8  million  for  new  posts  of  teachers  and

expansion of educational facilities in the State.

It  will  be  seen that about 880 new  posts  are

being  provided to the Ministry and  the  largest

number  of  these will be about 680  teachers  in

Division  II. The next largest increase  will  be

ancillary  staff  to maintain and  upkeep  school

compounds   and  buildings.  In  all  about   150

Division  IV  employees will  be  appointed  next

year. Other significant developments are the sums

of    money   provided   for   scholarships   and

fellowships  and  over $1 million  more  for  the

University  of  Malaya.  There  will  be  further

increases  to provide for more science facilities

and teaching equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen, therefore, that 1961 will be a

year  of  considerable  expansion  in  the  basic

facilities provided to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



public,  both in the economic and social spheres.

It  will be a year when more rational expenditure

of  public funds should occur. It will also be  a

year  when  larger  calls will  be  made  on  the

Government  machinery to expand and  develop  the

already  existing facilities. It will be  a  year

when Government itself will have to carry the new

responsibilities  of  providing  the   facilities

which  were  previously  provided  by  the  local

Governments.



<div align="center"><i>Development Plan</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first draft of the Development Plan was

completed  in  June this year  and  some  of  the

details  had  been  published.  Since  then,  the

Singapore  Government  has  approached  the  U.K.

Government  and  the  World  Bank  for  financial

assistance in financing the Development Plan. The

World  Bank  sent its mission to  Singapore  last

month.  The results of discussions with the  U.K.

Government are known. Though the amount  that  we

obtained by way of assistance in loans and grants

is  not as much as we had hoped for, nevertheless

this would be a useful addition to our resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been my intention to publish the

Development  Plan at about the same time  as  the

Estimates. Unfortunately, circumstances prevented

this.  It was necessary to amend the Plan in  the

light  of  discussions with the World  Bank,  the

U.K.  Government and the U.N. experts.  The  work

involved   in   making   these   amendments   and

adjustments  throughout  the  Plan  to   preserve

consistency  is both intricate and  considerable.

At  the same time, the staff engaged in this work

had to meet many other urgent calls on their time

such  as  preparing material for the U.N. experts

and  the  World  Bank  team and  arranging  their

programme  of  work in Singapore  so  that  their

expertise  and energies may be used to  the  best

advantage  in the short time they are  here.  The

result has been a delay in finalising the details

of the Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to emphasize that the Plan itself deals

only  with capital expenditure by the Government

and  public  authorities,  such  as  the  Trading

Departments  of the City Council,  the  Singapore

Harbour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



Board, the Singapore Telephone Board and the

Housing  Board.  It  does not take  into  account

capital outlays in the private sector, for these,

by  and  large,  are  something  that  cannot  be

forecast with any accuracy in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the capital outlays by the Central

Government  are  concerned, the details  for  the

period   1961-1964  appear  in  the   Development

Estimates.  Both  the expenditures  provided  for

1961  and  the  costs of completed  projects  are

entered  in the Development Estimates. I wish  to

emphasise  that,  in  many instances,  the  total

costs  are provisional estimates and are  subject

to   revision.  Further,  in  the  light  of  the

financial position in the years to come,  it  may

be   necessary  to  revise  either  by   way   of

amendment,  deletion  or  addition  the   capital

outlays entered in the Estimates. The Development

Plan,  therefore,  is not a  rigid  programme  of

capital  expenditure  but  objectives  which   we

think, in the light of present circumstances, are

attainable  and desirable. They do not constitute

authority  for  expenditure and, as  I  mentioned

before,  revisions will be made to the Plan  from

time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention here to go into the

details of this Plan. When the report on the Plan

is  published,  which I expect to be  early  next

year,  the  public will be able to  know  exactly

what we want to do, why we want to do it and what

we expect to result from the Plan. But some broad

indications  of the magnitude of expenditure  may

be usefully made here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total capital expenditure for the Central

Government is envisaged at $746.8 million for the

years  1961-64.  Of this, my own Ministry  claims

the  largest share, $194.2 million. This consists

of  $100  million  for  the Economic  Development

Board  and  $93.7  million  for  developing   the

industrial site in Jurong, reclaiming land in the

Kallang Swamp and other minor items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major item of capital development is

in public housing and no less than $203.1 million

has  been  provisionally allotted to the  Housing

and Development Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social services have staked their claims on our

capital  resources  and both  the  Ministries  of

Education   and   Health   have   been   allotted

considerable sums, more than $100 million between

them - for   the   construction  of  new   schools,

hospitals, clinics and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the expenditures of the Central

Government, the Trading Departments of  the  City

Council - soon  to  be  integrated  into  a  Public

Utilities  Board - have been allotted $147  million

for   the  expansion  of  public  utilities.  The

Harbour  Board  has  in the course  of  execution

capital expansion works which will amount to  $18

million,  while  the  Telephone  Board  plans  to

expand  its services by $17.5 million. The  total

expenditure during 1961-64 therefore  amounts  to

$929.2  million.  It is expected,  however,  that

some  of  these  projects will not  be  completed

during  the Plan period and a reduction of  $53.0

million   is   being  allowed  for.   There   is,

therefore, a balance of $876.2 million  that  has

to  be  provided  by  way of  revenue  surpluses,

additional revenue, domestic loans and loans from

overseas.  It is not my intention here  to  enter

into  the  details of how a development programme

of  this magnitude will be financed. I only  want

to  develop two points. The first is what we hope

to  achieve by the development programme,  and  I

also want to say something about the burden which

the  citizens  of  this  country  would  have  to

shoulder  to provide the resources to  carry  out

the Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal objective of the Plan is to

promote  a  sustained growth of the  economy,  in

particular to bring about industrial expansion at

an  accelerated rate. Thus, special attention  is

being paid to providing what is commonly known as

the industrial infra-structure. This consists  of

the  building of better communications,  such  as

sea   ports,   roads,  airports,  railways,   the

provision of ample and cheap power and industrial

water,  and  the  development  of  an  industrial

estate  of  adequate size with all the facilities

for  the  transportation  and  marketing  of  raw

materials  and finished products.  In  this  way,

capital expenditures of the Government would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



induce   and  encourage  investment  of   private

capital  both from local and overseas sources.  I

have  already referred to the rate of  industrial

expansion  now going on. If we have  achieved  so

much  with so little effort, there is every  hope

that   if   we   increase  the  inducements   and

facilities  for  private capital  investment,  we

have  every chance to achieve a sufficiently high

rate  of  growth to provide work for our  growing

population. Our present rate of industrial growth

demonstrates  that there are ample  opportunities

in Singapore and that there are persons with both

capital  and enterprise who are prepared to  make

use  of  these opportunities. This is one of  our

strongest  assets which we should  cultivate  and

encourage with care and attention.



<div align="center"><i>Revenue Proposals</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hardly necessary for me to explain that

the  State  will  not be able to  carry  out  the

development programme on a scale that we  planned

without further increases in revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained that, in part, the

surplus  was  due to the inability of departments

to  implement development projects for this  year

to the extent that had been allowed for. With the

measures  that we have in mind and which  I  have

described, to strengthen the technical  personnel

in  Government,  this  administrative  bottleneck

will  be reduced and finally eliminated. Further,

the   surplus  in  Government  accounts  can   be

misleading,  because  of the  separation  of  the

Ordinary    Estimates   from   the    Development

Estimates.  If  we take both estimates  together,

the  picture is less attractive. Indeed,  in  the

years   to   come  when  development  expenditure

gathers  momentum, it is likely to  be  the  case

that our financial resources will be strained  to

the utmost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In planning for the future, we cannot work on an

annual  basis, but must have regard to the  total

period  of the Development Plan. In this respect,

the  calculation of available financial resources

against  anticipated expenditure  will  leave  no

room for complacency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



In  the next four years the total expenditure  on

development  is estimated at $876.0 million.  The

amount  of  money  we can raise  internally  from

loans,     profits    of    public     utilities,

appropriations from the revenue and running  down

of  reserves  will  provide  no  more  than  $500

million.  About  half this sum will  be  provided

from  appropriations  from  the  revenue  of  the

Central  Government and from the trading  profits

of  public  utilities. The  other  half  will  be

financed through loans, both long term and  short

term,  which the Government proposes to float  in

Singapore. A substantial part of these loans will

be  taken  up by the Central Provident  Fund  but

banks, insurance companies and the general public

are  expected to take up the rest. The  estimates

of  available finance are based on current  rates

of  taxation. A gap of $376 million remains to be

filled. Part of this, we expect, would come  from

loans from overseas. We have been promised by the

U.K.  Government a loan of $42.8 million. It  may

be  possible  to  borrow more.  There  are  other

sources of finance available to us, such  as  the

World   Bank,   the   International   Development

Association,  trade  credits  from  suppliers  of

equipment and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can hardly expect, however, for other

Governments,  the  World Bank  and  other  United

Nation agencies to consider our applications  for

loans  in  a favourable light unless we ourselves

have  put  in  all  the effort possible  to  help

ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is still one of the most lightly taxed

countries in the world. It is true that there are

Colonies,  such  as Hongkong, Sarawak  and  North

Borneo, where taxation is even lighter, but if we

look  around in the developing countries of Asia,

we  will  find  that  their  taxation  rates  are

incomparably  higher than ours. For instance,  in

India  the rates of personal income tax go up  to

as  high as 45 per cent in respect of income more

than  $15,000 per year together with a  surcharge

of  5  per  cent and a supertax of 15  per  cent.

Above that there is the capital profits tax.  And

there  are import duties and sales tax on a large

range of goods.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In framing the new taxation proposals, the

Government  has four principal considerations  in

view.  First, the new taxes should  be  borne  by

those  who are enjoying the largest benefit  from

the  expansion  of the economy. Next,  those  who

have been left out of the taxation orbit will  be

called  upon to make their contribution. Thirdly,

our taxation rates must have some relation to the

tax   structure  in  the  Federation  of  Malaya.

Finally,  taxes should influence the use  of  our

scarce resources, especially land, in such a  way

as  to promote maximum economic advantage for the

State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these in mind, the following new taxes will

be introduced in the coming year:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Property Tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Business Registration Tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Stamp Duty on Import and Export Declarations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Increased assessment on Rubber Estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Increased rates on Private Lotteries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Fees levied for the practice of certain

professions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Passenger tax on embarking air travellers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Decrease in the rates of personal allowances

on  income  tax and increase in the  maximum

rate of tax on personal income.



<div align="center"><i>Property Tax</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the integration of the City Council

with   the   Government,  the  Local   Government

Ordinance  under which local rates are levied  on

land  and  houses in the city will no  longer  be

enforceable. Similarly, on the abolition  of  the

Rural Board, it will no longer be proper to  levy

rates  in  the  rural  areas.  These  rates   are

intended  to  finance services and  utilities  of

equivalent  value from the revenue  so  obtained.

With  integration,  however, all  expenditure  is

financed  from  the Consolidated  Fund,  so  that

individual  items of revenue lose their  identity

in  the pooling into the Consolidated Fund,  from

which all Government expenditure is met.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To replace these rates, it will be necessary to

introduce a system of taxation. We will call this

the  property  tax. This is not  a  new  form  of

taxation  but  an amendment of existing  ones  to

suit  the changed circumstances. A Bill to  carry

them into effect has been introduced by me today.

I  will  draw attention to some of the  principal

features of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the assessment of tax on properties, it is

important that there must be some expectation  of

stability  as regards rates of taxation  so  that

persons, especially those intending to build  new

houses, can plan ahead in confidence. Hence it is

proposed  that  the  rates levied  will  be  held

constant for a period of three years. In the city

area, it is not proposed to make any increase  in

the  rates  on  property  tax  as  compared  with

existing local rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rural areas, however, increases will be

made depending on the extent to which these areas

have  been  enjoying  urban facilities,  such  as

lighting,  water, roads, sewerage and  so  forth.

The  lower rates for the rural areas are a  relic

of the past when large tracts of land outside the

city   awaited   development.  To   induce   such

development, rates on property had been fixed  at

very  low  levels. No one can say that, with  the

acute  pressure  on the land, we can  afford  the

luxury  of low taxation rates in the rural areas.

Further  development  of  the  rural  areas  will

depend much more on the projects initiated by the

Government than the unassisted effort of  private

individuals.  Accordingly, rates on property  tax

in   the  rural  areas  will  increase  as   the

development of these areas proceeds apace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, proposed that property tax on

industrial establishments in the rural areas will

not  be  increased beyond the present rates.  The

reason   for   providing   industry   with   this

inducement is obvious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group of persons selected for favourable

treatment  are  owner occupiers of property.  The

present practice does not distinguish between the

rates



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



applicable  to properties let out and  properties

occupied by the owner. However, in the assessment

of  annual values, owner-occupied properties  are

assessed  on  favourable terms. This practice  is

quite  irregular  and  I  propose  to  stop   it.

However, in order not to penalise owner occupiers

of  small  properties, the rates of  taxation  on

them will be fixed at less than the general rate.

Owners  of  such properties are,  by  and  large,

persons  of small means, who, by the exercise  of

thrift, have come to acquire their own homes.  It

is wrong that such persons should be penalised.



<div align="center"><i>Business Registration Tax</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of the Federation of Malaya

introduced  the  tax  on business  by  way  of  a

registration  fee  in  1953.  As  a   result   of

subsequent  opposition  by  a  section   of   the

business  community,  this tax  was  modified  in

1956. The original registration fee was $100 to a

maximum of $300 per annum for businesses  in  the

cities  and  $25  to  $75 for businesses  in  the

countryside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to levy the following rates of

annual fees for businesses in Singapore:-



<pre>

                                                     $ c.

         Sole proprietorships in the city area      50.00

         Sole proprietorships in the rural area     12.50

         Partnerships in the city area             100.00

         Partnerships in the rural area             25.00

         Public limited companies                1,000.00

         Private limited companies                 750.00

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for introducing this form of taxation

is   apparent.   A   large  majority   of   small

shopkeepers do not contribute whatsoever  to  the

Inland Revenue. Further, if the proprietor  is  a

man  of  abstemious  habits,  he  does  not  even

contribute to the liquor and tobacco tax.  If  he

lives  in a shop premise, as is usually the case,

he  does  not own a motor car and hence does  not

contribute  to the petroleum duty.  Such  persons

are   in  a  truly  privileged  position.   Their

children receive education, the cost of which the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



State  pays  up to 98 per cent or  more.  If  any

member  of his family falls ill, he can get  free

treatment  or  near  free  treatment   in   State

hospitals  or dispensaries. Further,  they  enjoy

the full protection of law enforcement and public

order.  It  is only equitable that he  be  called

upon  to make a contribution towards the cost  of

providing these benefits. Nor can it be said that

the  rates  are  unduly high. Hawkers'  licensing

fees  are  on  the average much higher  than  the

rates we are levying on sole proprietorships  and

partnerships.   The  yield  from  this   business

registration  fee is expected to  be  about  $2.0

million per year.



A  duty  of  $1,000 per year on limited companies

can  hardly be regarded as excessive. As  against

the  unincorporated businesses, a limited company

enjoys  substantial benefits by way of limitation

of  the liability of shareholders. Most of  these

concerns  are  substantial  businesses  and  this

additional duty will bear lightly upon them.  The

tax yield is expected to be $1.5 million.



<div align="center"><i>Stamp Duty on Import and Export Declarations</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hongkong, there is a system of taxation on

every declaration made by traders on imports  and

exports of goods. The tax is HK$1 per form.  This

seems to be an easy way of collecting money and I

propose  to introduce a similar tax in Singapore.

The  yield is expected to be $500,000 a year.  It

cannot   be   said  that  this  will  impose   an

intolerable burden on the business community, nor

will this duty constitute an encroachment on  the

free  port status of Singapore. The sum is  small

and  the  tax will be borne by large  numbers  of

merchants.



<div align="center"><i>Increased assessment on rubber estates</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present small holders pay an assessment of

$8.00 (5 cents per tree) and a surcharge of $1.12

in  respect  of  each acre of small  holding.  As

regards the big estates, there is a tax which  at

present is 3¼ per cent ad valorem on the f.o.b.

price  of rubber and a surcharge of half  a  cent

per  pound  for  rubber  research.  The  tax   is

assessed  on  production  returns  submitted   by

rubber



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



estates  and  is levied under the Rubber  Estates

Assessment Ordinance and the surcharge under  the

Rubber   Estates   (Surcharge)   Ordinance.   The

Federation  of  Malaya imposes a duty  on  rubber

exported from the port of shipment. Part  of  the

levy  goes  towards research. A substantial  part

goes towards the replanting funds and there is an

anti-inflationary cess which is steeply graduated

with respect to rubber prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to impose a similar export

duty  in  Singapore because of the administrative

difficulties  stemming from  our  large  entrepot

trade  in  rubber. We are therefore proposing  to

increase  the rates of assessment on big holdings

to  bring  them  approximately to  rates  in  the

Federation. The tax on estate production will  be

related to the price of rubber. Commencing with a

rate  of  3 per cent when the price is  under  60

cents a lb., it will increase to 12 per cent when

the  price exceeds $1 per lb. There will be  a  1

per  cent  increase  for  each  5  cent  platform

between these limits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rates of taxation are expected to equate

to  rates prevailing in the Federation of  Malaya

for  similar prices of rubber. The present  rates

of   taxation   on   rubber  in   Singapore   are

considerably lower than those in the  Federation,

especially  at high prices of rubber. Considering

that land in Singapore can often be put to better

use  than  for  rubber plantations,  the  present

rates of taxation are unrealistically low. It  is

also  proposed to increase the rate of assessment

on  small  holdings from the present 5 cents  per

tree  to  15 cents per tree. This is the  maximum

rate   provided   for  in  the   Rubber   Estates

Assessment  Ordinance. At  this  new  rate  small

holders  will be virtually paying tax at a  price

of  rubber of 65 cents per lb. This is arrived at

on the basis of an average stand of 160 trees per

acre producing about 250 lb, to the acre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to discourage the use of land in rubber

planting in Singapore, it is proposed to  levy  a

tax on land under immature rubber at the rate  of

$35 per acre per year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual increase in revenue from all these

measures is estimated at $400,000.



<div align="center"><i>Increased rates on Private Lotteries</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a machine in use in Singapore known as

the one-arm bandit. The purpose of the machine is

to  ensnare optimistic persons to part with their

money.  In  spite of the fact that the  odds  are

greatly against the player, the patronage of

one-arm  bandits increases year by year. In 1955, the

Government proposed to tax these machines at  the

rate  of  20 per cent on 150 per cent of the  net

takings. As a result of vociferous protests,  the

tax was reduced to 20 per cent on 137 per cent of

the  net takings. It is now proposed that the tax

should  be  increased to 30 per cent on  137  per

cent  of  the net takings. Besides this there  is

the  matter of private sweepstakes. These  pay  a

duty  of  20  per cent, while the Singapore  Turf

Club  pays 30 per cent. There is no justification

for  this  discrimination and it is  proposed  to

increase  the rate on private sweepstakes  to  30

per  cent.  The  additional  revenue  from  these

measures is expected to be $150,000.



<div align="center"><i>Fees levied on certain professions</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present rates of fees paid by professional

persons  in  private practice are extremely  low.

For  instance, an advocate and solicitor pays  an

initial fee totalling $84 and a $50 annual fee, a

doctor   pays  an  annual  fee  of  $40  but   no

registration  fee, a dentist pays a  $20  initial

fee and a $50 annual fee and a pharmacist pays  a

$5  initial  fee  and a $20 annual  fee.  Neither

accountants nor quantity surveyors, nor engineers

pay   any   registration  fee  or   annual   fee.

Architects  pay  an initial registration  fee  of

$100 and an annual fee of $75 to their Board.  It

is  time that the different treatment enjoyed  by

various  professional  persons  be  placed  on  a

rational  basis. It is proposed  that,  with  the

exception   of   pharmacists,   all   the   above

categories  of  professional persons  in  private

practice   be   required  to   pay   an   initial

registration fee of $250 and a quarterly  fee  of

$125. For pharmacists,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



the initial registration fee will be $100 and the

quarterly fee $5. An additional revenue of  about

$1   million   is   expected.  The   professional

associations have been consulted in regard to the

levy of these fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the justification for raising fees to

the  scales  proposed, apart from the tidying  up

effect?  It  could  be argued  that  since  these

persons  are in short supply, to require them  to

pay  additional fees would be contrary to  public

policy,   since  it  might  reduce   the   supply

forthcoming. There might be some grounds for this

argument if the fees proposed were penal, say, if

they  were  fixed at ten times the sums proposed.

It  is  a  well-known fact that the  earnings  of

professionals   in  private   practice   are   so

substantial that the additional fees required  of

them  will  not  either  materially  reduce   the

attractiveness  of  their  trade  or  impose   an

intolerable  burden upon them.  The  argument  in

favour  of these fees rests on two points. First,

with  the  expansion  of the  economy  which  the

Government  expenditure  is  intended  to   bring

about,  these professionals are likely  to  enjoy

immediate benefits much more than other  sections

of the community. They have never had it so good;

and  in the years to come they will have it  even

better.  A small extra contribution from them  is

therefore not inequitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument rests on the disparity in

incomes  between persons in private practice  and

those  in  the Government Service. This  is  only

partially redressed by the higher income tax they

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all international airports in the world

charge  a  small  sum  on  embarking  passengers.

Singapore   proposes  to  follow  this   sensible

practice.  The  Government has borne  the  entire

share  in  the  maintenance of  services  at  the

airport and a substantial part of its development

expenditure. It is only just that those  who  may

use  all these facilities contribute towards  the

cost.  It is proposed, therefore, to levy a small

fee  not  exceeding  ten dollars  in  respect  of

passengers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



embarking on overseas flights and $1 per head for

those travelling to the Federation of Malaya  and

the  Borneo territories. Discussions will be held

by the Director of Civil Aviation with interested

parties. These sums are trivial in comparison  to

the  cost  of  fares and there is  no  reason  to

expect  a  diminution in the  popularity  of  air

travel as a consequence. Transit passengers  will

not, of course, be charged this tax. A sum of  $1

million is expected to be collected per year.



<div align="center"><i>Decrease in the rates of personal allowances on

income tax and increase in the maximum rate of

tax on personal income</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the Federation Government lowered the

personal allowances of an individual from  $3,000

to  $2,000  and that for the wife from $2,000  to

$1,000.  Bearing  in mind that income  tax  rates

between  the  two territories should  not  differ

substantially, it is proposed to follow the rates

introduced  by  the  Federation  last  year.  The

Federation also increased the maximum rate of tax

on individuals by 5 per cent, from 40 per cent to

45  per  cent. It is proposed to do  likewise  in

Singapore and increase the maximum rate to 55 per

cent on incomes above $100,000 per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limitation in the number of children

eligible for relief to four as against eight will

not be adopted and it is proposed to continue  to

give relief to children at the present rate up to

a maximum of eight children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While reducing the general rates of relief, I

propose  to  introduce for  the  benefit  of  the

majority  of tax payers a personal income  relief

in  respect  of earned income. It is proposed  to

give  a  relief  of 20 per cent of earned  income

subject to a limit of $1,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important innovation which we are

making  in  our tax laws, that is to  distinguish

between  income  earned as a result  of  personal

exertions  and income accruing from the ownership

of  property.  It  is only just and  proper  that

income  earned through the effort of one's  brain

or  brawn  should  be  taxed  more  lightly  than

property income. For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



the worker - be it through physical or intellectual

effort  or  both - makes a current contribution  to

the  wealth  of  the nation, while the

property-owner  lives off his past efforts or the  efforts

of his ancestors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me give some broad details of the

operation  of  these changes.  The  reduction  of

personal  allowances means that more  people  are

brought  into the tax orbit. It also  means  that

those  who are already paying taxes have  to  pay

higher   rates.  But  the  earned  income  relief

diminishes  the impact of reductions of  personal

reliefs, more particularly for those with smaller

incomes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, without earned income relief, a working

bachelor earning more than $2,000 a year or  $170

per  month  has to pay tax. Earned income  relief

raises  the  minimum level to $2,400  a  year  as

against  the present level of $3,000  a  year.  A

married couple without children who would pay tax

at  an  income  of $3,000 a year  without  earned

income  relief does not do so until their  income

from work goes above $3,800 a year when their tax

liability is only $2 per year. A family dependent

on  a worker with three children - and this is  the

average family in Singapore - does not have to  pay

tax  until their income reaches $6,000 a year  or

$500  per month. They then pay a tax of $12.50  a

year.  No one can say that the changes we propose

to  the income tax structure imposes any hardship

upon the poor or that we are asking any person to

pay tax that he cannot afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word about the extra yield of these new tax

rates. People not paying tax but who would now be

required  to do so would contribute an additional

$¾  million  a year. Present tax  payers  would

contribute  the bulk of additional revenue,  that

is  another  $3¼  million, giving  an  expected

increase of $4 million a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional revenue from new taxes and

changes  in existing rates will amount  to  about

$10.5 million. Perhaps some of those who will pay

these taxes may regard these additional calls  on

their pockets as unnecessary impositions. But the

additional taxes, as all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



taxes  garnered  by  this  Government,  will   be

returned  to  the people in the form of  schools,

hospitals,  new  industries, lighting  and  other

amenities.  Every cent collected from the  people

will be used to make life better for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people assume that the Government can

create  out  of  thin  air the  money  needed  to

provide the many services the people demand.  The

Government is not wealthy in its own right. It is

not  a private company of individuals but a  body

of  men  elected by the people to perform certain

duties. It has to pay for the many services it is

called upon to do and the money for them must  be

provided  by  the people by way of taxes.  A  bad

government  will  dissipate  these  resources  by

mismanagement  and corruption. A good  government

will see to it that the people get the best value

for their taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In distributing the burden of new taxes, the

P.A.P.,  as  a socialist Government, has  ensured

that  the taxes will be shared among many  people

in  proportion to their ability to  pay.  Of  the

eight  tax increases, seven do not at all  affect

the lower income group. The proposals relating to

income  tax again fall very lightly on  the  wage

earner. Of the $10.5 million new taxes only  $¾

million will come directly from bachelors earning

less  than  $310  a  month or an  average  family

earning less than $500 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore taking the tax proposals broadly, it

can  be said that it is those who are better off,

such  as air-travellers, shop-proprietors, import

and   export  firms,  professionals  in   private

practice,  who have been asked to  make  a  small

extra  contribution  to the  cost  of  generating

prosperity for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, care has been taken not to

blunt  incentives to effort by the imposition  of

penal rates of taxation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding my statement I wish to bring

up  the  subject of variable allowances, a matter

closely   connected  with  the  previous  budget.

Members will recollect that certain reductions of

these  allowances  were made in  respect  of  the

upper  income  brackets in the Civil  Service.  A

professional allowance ranging from $75  p.m. to

$225  p.m. was subsequently introduced  to  keep

Government   rates  of  pay  for  technical   and

professional officers at a competitive  level  as

against  pay rates in business. The justification

for the reduction of variable allowances lies  in

the  serious  financial  position  we  faced   on

assuming office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the position is less grim, should not

the  Government reconsider its stand?  There  are

many factors to be considered. First, recruitment

to  nearly all grades, except professional grades

in  short supply, proceeds satisfactorily at  the

rates  of pay we now offer. In the years to come,

as  the increasing supply of students emerge from

our  schools and universities, the Government  as

an  employer will find it an even easier  job  of

recruiting  into the public service.  As  regards

the  professional  grades in short  supply,  they

cannot be obtained from local sources in adequate

numbers  for some time whatever the pay,  and  we

must look overseas as we are now doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have to consider the additional taxes

that the public has to pay. It was the contention

of  the  Staff  Side that the  cuts  in  variable

allowances  were justified only  if  the  general

public was called upon to shoulder the burden  by

financial stringency. With these new taxes,  this

argument  of the Unions no longer holds good,  if

indeed it ever held good at any time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two considerations therefore lead

irresistibly to the conclusion that there  should

be  no  revision of rates of variable allowances.

But  the  fact  remains that the  Government  has

successfully ridden the financial troubles of the

early   days  and  it  must  therefore   make   a

reappraisal  of the issue of variable allowances.

I am therefore willing to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



have   negotiations  commenced  for   a   partial

restitution of the variable allowances. In  doing

so,  may  I warn against undue optimism that  any

large  scale raids into the public purse will  be

allowed?  To restore variable allowances  to  the

full  would mean that practically the whole yield

of  additional revenue would be eaten up  at  one

fell stroke. The Treasury will not allow this to:

happen  and  it will have public opinion  on  its

side. The Government employees cannot expect more

than  a  modest restoration of pay cuts. Further,

as   the   quantum  is  one  that  has  extensive

repercussions on the financial structure  of  the

State  and  its  capacity to finance  development

expenditure, the Government considers  that  this

is  a matter of public policy and is not an issue

that  can be submitted to arbitration. With these

provisos,   I   welcome   the   commencement   of

negotiations  and will ask my Ministry  officials

to invite the Staff Unions to start these soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It remains for me to express my appreciation of

the   various  officials  both  in  the   Central

Government  and the City Council whose  sustained

endeavours have resolved many intricate  problems

or  financial integration to enable me to present

this first integrated set of Estimates of Revenue

and   Expenditure.  The  Government  Printer  too

deserves our thanks for a neat job of work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, which follows the provisions of the

United  Kingdom Judicial Proceedings  (Regulation

of  Reports)  Act, 1956, seeks as stated  in  the

long   title   of  the  Bill  to   regulate   the

publication of reports of judicial proceedings in

such  a  manner  as to prevent injury  to  public

morals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill provides that in the case

of  judicial proceedings generally, it shall  not

be  lawful  to print or publish, or cause  to  be

printed  or  published, any  indecent  matter  or

indecent surgical or physiological details  being

matter  or  details which would be calculated  to

injure  public  morals. The clause then  provides

that  in  the  case of judicial  proceedings  for

divorce,  dissolution  of  marriage,  nullity  of

marriage,  judicial separation or restitution  of

conjugal  rights, the reports of the  proceedings

shall  be confined to particulars of the  parties

and  the  witnesses, a concise statement  of  the

charges,    defences   and    counter    charges,

submissions on questions of law and the  decision

of  the court thereon, the decision of the  court

and any observations made by the court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill does not affect the printing or

communication of proceedings or evidence for  use

of  the  court  proceedings, or the  printing  or

publishing  of any notice or report in  pursuance

of  the  order  of  court,  or  the  printing  or

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill to change the name of "Raffles

National Library" to "National Library" is not  a

manifestation of oversensitive nationalism nor is

it  an  attempt to obliterate the name of Raffles

from  the  history of Singapore.  His  name  will

continue  to  find  a place  in  the  history  of

Singapore though the place accorded to him in the

future  may  be  somewhat  different  from   that

accorded him by imperial romantics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where before the dreams and ideals of Raffles

were  the  motivating force of the ruling  class,

today  new  ideals and aspirations have  replaced

those of Raffles. It is therefore fitting that an

institution like our library should reflect these

ideals not only in spirit but in name as well. If

the  spirit of Sir Stamford Raffles is,  at  this

very  moment, hovering in this august chamber,  I

am  sure  he  will accept this inevitable  change

with good grace.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could have no objection to a national

institution, like the library, becoming a  symbol

of  national loyalty and aspiration.  After  all,

Sir, modern Singapore is not the creation of  Sir

Stamford Raffles alone. Hundreds of thousands  of

nameless  people  contributed to  its  growth  by

their blood, sweat and tears.

acknowledging  a historical fact  which  fanciful

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to enable a person, who is born

in  the Federation of Malaya, or who is a citizen

of  the  United  Kingdom  and  Colonies,  or  the

Republic  of  Ireland, or who is  a  Commonwealth

citizen  (other than a citizen of Singapore),  to

be registered as a citizen of Singapore if he has

served for a period of not less than three  years

full-time  or five years part-time in  the  Armed

Forces of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present under subsection (2) of section 15 of

the Ordinance, provision is made for citizens  of

foreign   countries  to  qualify  for   Singapore

citizenship by way of naturalization if they have

served  satisfactorily for a period of  not  less

than three years full-time or of four years

part-time   in   the   Armed  Forces   of   Singapore.

Previously,  until  section 8  of  the  Singapore

Citizenship   Ordinance  was   amended   by   the

Singapore Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance,  No.

41   of   1960,   the   period   of   residential

qualification required in respect of persons born

in  the  Federation of Malaya or citizens of  the

United   Kingdom  and  Colonies,  for   Singapore

citizenship by way of registration was  only  two

years.  It  did  not matter very much  that  this

concession  as regards satisfactory service  with

the Armed Forces of Singapore was not extended to

them,  because under section 15 of the  Ordinance

this  concession  was  only  made  applicable  to

applicants  from  foreign countries  serving  not

less  than three years full-time service  or  not

less than four years part-time service, which was

longer     than    the    two-year    residential

qualification under section 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the period of residential qualification

required  under section 8 is now eight years,  it

is  considered reasonable therefore to take  into

consideration satisfactory service with the Armed

Forces   by   persons  born  in  the  Federation,

citizens



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



of  the  United Kingdom and Colonies  or  of  the

Republic   of   Ireland  or  other   Commonwealth

citizens   applying  for  Singapore  citizenship.

Therefore, in clause 2 of the Bill, section 8 has

been  amended to provide that the period of  such

service should be three years full-time and  five

years  part-time. Since the period of residential

qualification  under section 15 of the  Ordinance

has  been extended from eight years to ten years,

it  is also considered reasonable that the period

of full-time service and part-time service should

be  increased from three years to four years, and

from  four years to six years respectively.  This

is done in clause 4 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition of such full-time and part-time

service  in  the  Armed Forces  of  Singapore  by

applicants   for   Singapore  citizenship   under

sections 8 and 15 of the Ordinance is meant as  a

reward  for  the demonstration of their  loyalty,

affection for and willingness to serve the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the opportunity has also been taken to

introduce an amendment in clause 3 of the Bill to

make  applicable  to applications  for  Singapore

citizenship,  by  way  of  naturalization   under

section 15, the provisions of section 11  of  the

Ordinance  which provide that certain periods  of

residence  shall not be taken into  account  when

considering applications for citizenship. Section

15  only  came  into operation on  2nd  November,

1959,  when  the  provisions of section  9  which

dealt  with citizenship of aliens by registration

lapsed, and this is the reason why section 15 was

not  mentioned  in section 11 when the  Singapore

Citizenship Ordinance came into operation on  1st

November, 1957.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg  to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present Mental Disorders and Treatment

Ordinance  (Chapter 145), as amended in  1957  by

the  Mental  Disorders and Treatment  (Amendment)

Ordinance,  enabled police officers to  apprehend

persons  believed to be mentally ill and to  have

them   admitted   to   a  mental   hospital   for

observation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found in practice that an increasing

number  of mentally ill persons are taken by  the

relatives  or  others direct to  a  doctor  in  a

Government    hospital   for   examination    and

treatment. Unfortunately, the existing  Ordinance

does  not allow a medical officer in a Government

hospital   or,   for  that  matter,   a   private

practitioner in the City or rural areas  to  send

any person believed by him to be mentally ill  to

a  mental hospital for examination and treatment.

Therefore,   doctors  have  had  to   refer   the

relatives  of such persons to the nearest  police

station  for  action  to be  taken  by  a  police

officer  under the powers provided in section  32

of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill amends the present Ordinance to enable

a   medical  practitioner,  including  a  medical

officer,  to send persons believed to be mentally

ill  direct  to a mental hospital for observation

and for treatment. To simplify and facilitate the

examination  of persons believed to  be  mentally

ill, the Bill also provides for such mentally ill

persons  found  by the police to be  taken  to  a

doctor  of a Government hospital. It will be  for

the  doctor to decide whether the patient  should

be  sent  to the mental hospital for observation.

This  latter  provision  is  also  based  on  the

precept  that the doctor and not a police officer

should  decide  whether a compulsory  psychiatric

examination is required in any suspected case  of

mental  disease.  Not only will  such  a  medical

examination serve to establish whether  treatment

should be therapeutic or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



psychiatric, but by ensuring examination  by  two

doctors  prior to admission to a mental hospital,

it  will provide a satisfactory safeguard for the

patient himself.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, under the Printers and Publishers

Ordinance,  only books printed in Singapore  must

be  sent  to  the National Library. It  has  been

found  that  the law is defective in  that  books

printed outside Singapore by local publishers  do

not  come  within the scope of the Ordinance.  In

that way, many valuable publications are lost  to

the National Library and other institutions which

are  entitled  to them. This defect also  enables

publishers  to  go  outside Singapore  for  their

printing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, therefore, seeks to remedy this

defect  by  bringing  within  the  scope  of  the

Ordinance   all  books  published  in  Singapore,

whether   printed  here  or  not.  The  onus   of

submitting the printed publications or  books  to

the National Library now rests with the publisher

and  not  the printer, for it is obvious that  if

books printed outside Singapore but published  in

Singapore  are to come within the scope  of  this

Ordinance, then it must be the publisher and  not

the   printer   who   must  be  responsible   for

delivering  the  publications  or  books  to  the

National Library.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from shifting the onus from the printer to

the  publisher,  and  from bringing  all  locally

published material within the scope of  the  law,

this  Bill also requires the publisher to deliver

free of charge six copies of any book printed  or

published  in  Singapore to the National  Library

instead  of the present three copies.  This  will

enable  the National Library not only to  keep  a

complete  record of all books published here  but

also  to  send the books to such institutions  as

will benefit by having such books.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine for default under the Ordinance has

also been increased. It should also be noted that

publications printed by the Government Printer or

on  behalf of the Government are now not exempted

from  the  Ordinance, and six  copies  should  be

delivered to the National Library as in the  case

of  all  other  publications by  members  of  the

public.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to amalgamate the

Queen  Street and the Silat Road Sikh  Gurdawaras

under  a single constitution and management.  The

Silat   Road   Gurdwara  and  the  Queen   Street

Gurdawara are, under the provisions of the  Silat

Road  Gurdwara Ordinance (Chapter  318)  and  the

Queen Street Gurdawara Ordinance (Chapter 311)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



respectively, placed under the management of  two

separate Boards of Trustees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the Silat Road Gurdwara had

encountered  financial difficulties through  lack

of  regular  income, and the maintenance  of  the

temple  became  a  matter of  concern.  For  this

reason, the present Boards of Trustees of the two

temples  applied to the Government to  effect  an

amalgamation  of the two Gurdawaras,  because  it

was  felt  that if the Silat Road and  the  Queen

Street   Gurdawaras   were   placed   under   one

management,  the  funds of the  financially  more

viable  Queen Street Gurdawara would be available

to  the  new  Board of Trustees  for  the  better

management of the Silat Road Gurdwara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amalgamation is made with the approval of

all  sections  of the Sikh community.  This  Bill

repeals the Queen Street Gurdawara Ordinance  and

the  Silat Road Gurdwara Ordinance, and  provides

for  the  constitution of  a  Board  of  Trustees

consisting  of nine members drawn proportionately

from the different sects of the Sikh community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also includes the names of the first

nine  members of the Board who have been proposed

by the Sikh community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the new Bill provides under

sub-clause  (3) of clause 2 that the common  seal

shall  be in the custody of the President of  the

Board,  and  lays down the procedure for  signing

documents and affixing the seal of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 lays down the powers of the Board, and

clause  4  vests  in  the  Board  all  the  land,

premises  and monies at present held by  the  two

Gurdawaras, and  the  responsibility   for   the

maintenance   of   these  two   Gurdawaras,   and

generally   for   their   financial   and   other

involvements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 5 the Board is given power to acquire

and  deal  with property, and clause 6 lays  down

the  procedure  for  the  disbursement  of  funds

belonging to the Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in clause 9, the Board is given powers

to   make   rules  not  inconsistent   with   the

provisions of this Bill.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WITH UNIVERSITY OF MALAYA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on the evening of the 17th of November this year,

the  Professor  of English at the  University  of

Malaya  delivered  an inaugural  lecture  on  the

subject  of  "Robert Graves and  the  Decline  of

Modernism".  A  report of this  appeared  in  the

Straits  Times of Friday, the 18th.  This  report

gave  the impression that the lecture was  mainly

directed at the Government on a matter of  policy

in  which the Government was interested.  On  the

following  morning,  that  is,  Saturday,   there

appeared in the Straits Times a letter purporting

to  have been written by the Acting Minister  for

Labour   and  Law  to  the  Professor  concerned,

stating in no uncertain terms what the Government

thought  of  this  particular Professor  and  his

lecture. So, Mr Speaker, Sir, on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



Saturday morning the public was able to read this

letter  of  the Government which,  in  my  humble

opinion, was couched in language quite unbecoming

of   a  Minister.  On  reading  the  report,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it seemed to me that three  issues

arose from that publication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue is the question of academic

freedom  and the question of University autonomy,

both  matters being inextricably mixed  one  with

the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue which seems to arise was the

wording of that letter and the manner in which it

was  couched, and whether it was a kind of letter

which  a  Government Minister  of  the  State  of

Singapore should write to any person,  be  he  an

alien or a citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue that seems to arise, Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  was  the  proposition   by   the

Government   that  aliens  in  Singapore - and   by

"aliens"   the   Government  meant  non-Singapore

citizens   or   non-Federal  citizens - should   be

permitted   to   speak  on  matters   which   the

Government  thought were matters of  policy  and,

therefore,  political. Since then, the University

of  Malaya Students Union have held a dinner, and

events   have  since  taken  place  between   the

publication of that letter and today which  seems

to  me  to  have satisfactorily disposed  of  the

question   of  academic  freedom  and  University

autonomy.  Apparently a modus operandi  has  been

arrived   at  between  the  Government  and   the

University  of Malaya; and the statement  of  the

Prime Minister assuring the University that there

was no intention of encroaching upon the academic

freedom or the autonomy of the University,  which

I  was very gratified to note, disposes of what I

thought  was  the  first issue when  I  read  the

letter in the Straits Times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are two other issues which remain

undisposed of, and it is on those two issues, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that I would like  to  say  a  few

words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the trouble arose out of

matters  related to what is culture and  what  is

not  culture.  We are all fully  aware  that  the

Government is embarking on a praiseworthy mission

to  create  a  Malayan culture  out  of  all  the

cultures



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



that  we now have here, and to give it a direction

and  a  purpose;  and  out of that  direction  and

purpose  to create something which will  be  ours,

and  ours alone. A very praiseworthy mission! When

somebody  comments  on  it,  even  though  he  has

violated the rules of hospitality - shall I  put  it

that  way,  even if that is accepted, which  I  do

not - should  we,  as  a  Government,  address  that

person  in terms to say the least of it unbecoming

of a Government? Terms like "mendicant professors"

and  "asinine remarks" were used which,  I  think,

Mr Speaker, Sir, would be unbecoming if they were

used   in   this  Assembly.  What  more   when   a

responsible  Minister speaking for  the  State  of

Singapore,  Mr Speaker, and not for  the  P.A.P.?

What some of our Ministers do not understand,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, in my humble view, is that they  are

no  longer P.A.P. members when they write  letters

as  Ministers  of the State. As Ministers  of  the

State  they  belong to the State and  not  to  the

Party.  If  our  Ministers would appreciate  that,

then  I think we would have gone a long way  along

the road to understanding what democratic concepts

are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it right and becoming that a Minister should

write such a letter on such an occasion couched in

such  terms?  I think it was not. I see  that  the

Professor  concerned has sent in a letter  couched

in  terms  acceptable to the Government.  In  this

letter  the Professor has said that no slight  was

intended.  I  have not seen any Government  letter

yet  in  the  Press apologising for the  terms  in

which  their first letter was couched. This letter

took  the fight far beyond the Professor  when  it

included  the  phrase "mendicant  professors".  It

takes  in, with one fell swoop, all the Professors

in  the  University who are either  not  Singapore

citizens or Federal citizens. Subject to what  the

Minister  for Education has to say - and  he  is  an

authority on this subject - I understand at least 60

to  70  per  cent  of the teaching  staff  in  the

University, at least at the higher levels, are not

Singapore  citizens or Federal  citizens.  Anyway,

the  point is that quite a large proportion of the

teaching  staff of the University are  non-Federal

citizens or non-Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



citizens.  So,  in  carrying  the  fight  to  this

Professor  who,  in  the  Government's  view,  had

erred,  they  took  the  fight  further  than  the

Professor  and,  if  I  may say  so,  gratuitously

insulted  the  rest of the teaching staff  in  the

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a young State setting out on quite a

perilous  journey. We know that the  perils  which

the  State  is  facing  are  getting  greater  and

greater  from  day  to day. I  think  the  Finance

Minister appreciates that, and I think most of our

Ministers   are  beginning  to  appreciate   that.

Running   a  State  of  250  square  miles,   with

difficulties surrounding us all around, is not  an

easy  matter.  We  have always  talked  about  the

creation of confidence. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  is

no  way  to  create confidence  in  the  State  of

Singapore.  A letter of this nature, I  dare  say,

would  have been wirelessed all round the academic

world.  We  are still going to the academic  world

outside   for  recruitment.  The  Prime   Minister

himself has said that for years to come we have to

go  abroad to recruit teaching staff. Is this then

the  way  to  recruit  teaching  staff  abroad  by

calling   them  "mendicant  professors  who   make

asinine remarks"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, Sir, deals with aliens. It

would  appear  from the tone of  the  Government's

release on the Prime Minister's statement that  if

the  statement complained of had been  made  by  a

Professor who was a Singapore citizen or a Federal

citizen,  then the Government would have taken  no

action on it. This statement comes from the  Prime

Minister,  and I accept that statement. Therefore,

we  reach  the  position then that  any  alien  in

Singapore,  be  he a Professor or  otherwise,  who

dabbles  in  politics  or makes  statements  which

might  relate  to  Singapore  politics,  will   be

slapped  down.  If  that  is  the  policy  of  the

Government - perhaps they may be right - then I  think

they  should  see that that policy is  implemented

fairly and squarely so far as all persons who make

such  statements  in Singapore are  concerned.  Is

this  a  statement intended to apply only  to  the

University of Malaya; or is it intended  to  apply

to all educational institutions in Singapore; or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



is  it  intended  to  go  beyond  the  University

campuses  in Singapore and take in everybody  who

is in Singapore and who happens to be an alien?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members will recollect several occasions

on  which  statements had been made by aliens  in

Singapore   after  the  advent  of   the   P.A.P.

Government  which  had a direct  bearing  on  the

politics  and the policies of the Government.  In

those  cases, Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not  see  a

quick  reply couched in strong, virile  terms  in

the  manner that the Government reacted  on  this

occasion. This question can then be asked of  the

P.A.P.  Government  - why  is  it  that  on   this

particular  occasion  they  reacted   with   such

rapidity  when on other occasions they  had  kept

quiet?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Prime Minister meant what he said, when

he said that no alien would be allowed to comment

on matters political, then that must equally well

apply  to  anybody who says anything  that  might

have  any relation to the political situation  in

Singapore,  be  it  good  or  bad.  Or   is   the

Government only saying that they shall slap  down

only   those  people  who  criticise  the  P.A.P.

Government  and who thereby indulge in  politics?

Or  are  the Government also saying that  anybody

who says anything about Singapore, be it good  or

bad,  will be slapped down? If the Prime Minister

says  that no alien should interfere in politics,

then  he cannot restrict that statement by saying

that the Government will only slap down those who

dare  to  criticise  them or who  make  slighting

remarks  about them; but all the others who  have

good   things  to  say  about  them  are   passed

unnoticed. And the first thing the Prime Minister

will  realise  is that wherever there  is  power,

there  are  always sycophants hanging around  who

will  try to say nice things about the Government

in  order to get on here. But I do not think that

is  what  the Prime Minister means. I agree  with

the  Government, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there are

in   Singapore  a  number  of  aliens  who   make

gratuitous  statements about Singapore  politics,

and  this  policy  of  the  Government  will   be

supported by us if they slap down every foreigner

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  who  dares to make a  statement  about

Singapore politics. I think the time has now come

when   aliens  must  keep  out  of  politics   in

Singapore, and if the Government mean  what  they

say, then I think they should slap down everybody

who dares to make such statements.



<br><br>6.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the fact that the  Member  for

Farrer Park has chosen to raise this motion about

Government  relations  with  the  University   of

Malaya  when  the  case has already  been  closed

would  appear  as  if he has  taken  on  a  brief

without  a client! He has stated that the Enright

case appears to have raised three issues, one  of

which  was  the academic freedom and autonomy  of

the  University, which he now concedes as  having

been satisfactorily settled, as Professor Enright

himself  has  admitted that he had  no  right  to

comment on nor criticise Government policies, not

being  a citizen of the State of Singapore.  That

leaves  two  other issues. One is the nature  and

terms  of the Government's letter which,  in  his

opinion, was couched in very strong language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are times when it is

necessary   to   say  things  in  rather   strong

language.  It is just like using a ruler  to  rap

the  knuckles  of  a  child who  is  persistently

creating trouble. It should not be forgotten that

the Government only took action when Enright made

a  second statement. The first occasion  was  the

publication  in  the  Malayan  Undergrad  of   an

interview  which  he  gave  when  he  arrived  in

Singapore. The second occasion was when  he  made

his  inaugural address. Unfortunately he did  not

stick  to his subject and it was when he  crossed

the  line that he got the rapping. Therefore,  it

was  necessary  for Enright  to  be  told  in  no

uncertain  terms  that there would  be  no  third

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the third point, whether aliens have

the  right to comment on and criticise Government

policy, the Member for Farrer Park has, in  fact,

agreed that it would be advisable that all aliens



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



be  told that they should not comment on nor take

part  in  politics, nor to speak on controversial

issues  which  are matters of importance  to  the

citizens of the State. This is important, as  the

Member for Farrer Park has indicated that in  the

University  of  Malaya, which was established  in

1949,  there  is  a Senate which  is  largely  an

expatriate  class. Mind you, this is a  relic  of

the  days  when the University of  Malaya  was  a

colonial  University. In the  past,  whenever  we

talked  about  expatriates,  we  meant  to  imply

expatriates   of   European   origin.   In    the

University, however, an expatriate is one who  is

a  non-Malayan, so we have expatriates  of  every

hue and colour, from white to yellow to dark.  In

1949,  the  Senate of the University  of  Malaya,

which  is composed largely of professors  in  the

various  departments of the University,  numbered

around  25  of which there were only  four  local

members. Today, there is a possible membership of

38,  but I think the average attendance is around

35,   and   only  a  third  are  local   members.

Therefore,  we have a Senate in which  two-thirds

are  expatriates.  It  is  important  that  in  a

situation like this, when Singapore is doing  its

best  to  create  a common culture  and  identity

among  its  people, with all the difficulties  of

language  and so forth, that the Senate which  is

largely controlled by expatriates should be fully

conversant with the trends and tendencies of  the

country.  If we do not call a halt to  expatriate

members of the University staff commenting on the

policies of this country, then we shall  have  an

impossible  position in which expatriate  members

of the Senate will attempt to seek shelter in the

University  on  the  pretext  that   it   is   an

autonomous institution, as if it were,  shall  we

say,  a foreign concession where they have

extra-territorial rights, and from where they can snipe

at  the  Government, and in which they  can  seek

protection. So I think (fortunately the case  has

been satisfactorily settled) it was a timely move

on the part of Government to silence once and for

all  expatriate  members of  the  Senate  of  the

University of Malaya. As explained by  the  Prime

Minister in his speech to the students



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



at   their  annual  dinner,  before  the  present

Constitution  came  into  force,  every   British

national was a citizen of Singapore by virtue  of

the  fact that he was a British national, but  it

is  now  necessary for one to prove one's loyalty

to  Singapore  by  becoming a  Singapore  citizen

before  he  has  the right to  criticise  and  to

comment on political issues in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do feel it is necessary at this stage to

say clearly to all those who are here on teaching

assignments  that  they  have  freedom,  in   the

pursuit  of knowledge, to express their views  on

the  subject for which they are employed, but not

to  cross the line, but that if they do so,  then

they will get what they deserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel, Sir, that the Member for

Farrer  Park is only trying to stir up again  the

dust when it has already settled.



<br><br>6.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a

feeling  that the Member for Farrer Park  has  to

speak on this motion, which has probably gone out

of  date  since  it was first submitted  to  you,

although  the  matter  has  been  more  or   less

amicably  settled,  and I  quite  understand  the

predicament  of  the Member for  Farrer  Park  in

having  to  flog a dead horse. But since  he  has

indulged  in  flogging a dead  horse,  I  feel  I

should  comment  on  some of the  points  he  has

raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first objection, as far as I can see, is to

the strong language used by the Government in its

communication  to  Professor Enright.  I  am  not

quite  sure, Sir, whether those words would  have

been  permitted in this Assembly, but  if  anyone

were  to read the wartime speeches of Sir Winston

Churchill, he would find that that hon, gentleman

used   robust  language  when  he  felt  it   was

necessary to do so. In this particular  case,  in

view   of  the  Professor's  remarks  which  were

directed  at certain policies that the Government

is pursuing, which is to try and create a Malayan

culture,  we  felt  that,  because  the   subject

concerned was so vital to us and because we  felt

so strongly about it, it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



necessary  to  make known our  feelings  on  this

matter in no uncertain terms; and I am quite sure

the  letter conveyed our feelings in no uncertain

terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that issue was raised, there has been a

lot  of talk about the sanctity of the University

and   the  freedom  of  the  University.  But   I

remember,  Sir,  there was an occasion  when  the

freedom  of the University was involved,  when  a

number of students said certain things which were

not  agreeable  to  the then  colonial  power.  A

number of students were brought to trial,  but  I

cannot  recollect  at  that time  the  Professors

coming  to  their defence, because  the  students

espoused  a cause which has since then triumphed.

But  now  an  expatriate Professor made  what  we

thought,  on  the  basis of  his  lectures,  were

sneers  at the Government's policy - not  only  the

Government's  policy  but a  policy  accepted  by

everybody, including the Opposition - of trying  to

create a Malayan culture at all costs. There were

two   such  occasions.  On  the  first  occasion,

Professor  Enright  gave  an  interview   to   an

undergraduate  journal, and he  must  have  known

that  a  report of it would be published  in  the

newspapers.  It  was in fact a  challenge  to  an

accepted Government policy which is vital to  our

political  peace  and  stability,  that  is,  the

creation of a Malayan culture. The Professor then

said  that he did not think the Government should

waste its time in trying to go out of its way  to

create   a   Malayan  culture   and   a   Malayan

consciousness and Malayan unity among the people.

It  was  couched in terms of a challenge.  A  few

days  later,  the Professor gave a lecture  on  a

very  admirable subject - "Robert Graves  and  the

Decline of Modernism". In fact, Sir, if I may say

so,  I  was  personally invited  to  attend  this

lecture. At first, I intended to attend  it,  but

perhaps some second instinct made me decide  that

I  should not do so. It was just as well, because

not   only  would  the  Professor  have  had  the

satisfaction  of  attacking  or  criticising  the

Government  publicly, but perhaps he  would  also

have had the satisfaction of seeing a Minister of

the Government sitting quietly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



listening. Because at an inaugural lecture, I  am

told, you cannot talk back to the lecturer - to the

little snipes and sneers that he might have made.

When a Professor who has been here for only seven

months  should suddenly say that not only is  the

Government  wasting  its  time  but  that  it  is

probably wrong in trying to go out of its way  to

weld  the  people  into  a  nation,  then  it  is

necessary  for  the Government to make  it  quite

clear  that  anyone who is not here to  take  the

consequences  of  his  gratuitous  advice  on  an

important  matter should not give this gratuitous

advice. Surely, Sir, if Professor Enright makes a

suggestion,  his suggestion is more an  advocacy;

because  he  is  a  Professor, he  can  naturally

influence all the young students who sit  at  his

feet if he tells them that this is all a waste of

time, that the banning of jukeboxes really shocks

him,  and that the Government's attitude  towards

yellow culture is equally shocking to him.  If  a

Professor  of his standing should claim  academic

freedom  to  make  what we  felt  to  be  asinine

remarks such as yellow culture is something which

is found everywhere and we should not do anything

about it, and implying we should re-open the

juke-box  establishments which were recruiting grounds

for fresh gangsters; if that was all the advice a

Professor of his eminence - which he is, in his own

right - could give, that the Government should stay

out of this business of trying to weld the people

into one nation through the process of creating a

Malayan  culture,  that  it  should  not  try  to

interfere  with jukebox operators,  and  that  it

should let yellow culture flourish, then we  felt

that  obviously the Professor was speaking  on  a

matter about which he was not fully informed.  He

was therefore called up - in fact, I was one of the

Ministers  present  there - and  told  that,  as  a

Professor in English, he had a perfect  right  to

discourse  on matters on which he was an  expert,

but   that  if  he  persisted  in  sneering   and

belittling  the Government's policy  on  culture,

then  he was really trying to undo a work,  which

we know is an extremely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



difficult and a very delicate one. It appeared to

us  that  he was trying to upset the Government's

policy of creating a Malayan culture, and that it

would  therefore  be necessary  for  us  to  lake

action  if he persisted in this. If the Professor

had  then  and  there accepted  the  position  as

stated  by  the Government, that as an  alien  he

should   not   enter  into  political  issues - not

politics  as such - but political issues  of  great

moment to the country, then I am quite sure  that

the  matter would not have become the controversy

that it did become.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, when we say that aliens

should  not enter into political issues, it  does

not  mean  that a Professor of Political  Science

should  not  discuss politics.  But  when  it  is

discussed  in  such  a way as  to  embarrass  the

Government  or  the  people  who  are  trying  to

achieve something, and where the speaker is not a

Singapore  citizen who will take the consequences

of  his advice, then we say that he has no  right

to   enter   into  political  issues   of   great

importance to this country. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we

therefore  feel  that  the  Government  has  said

nothing  which  needs  retracting,  and  it   has

certainly  done  nothing for which  it  feels  it

should  apologise to the Professor concerned.  In

fact,  the Member for Farrer Park was quite wrong

when  he  said  that Professor Enright  needed  a

reply. No reply is needed from the Government. We

published  Professor Enright's assurance  to  the

Government,  and  on  the  same  day  we   issued

Government's letter stating that it was gratified

to  note  that the Professor concerned had  given

this  assurance. If he had given it much earlier,

he   would  have  spared  himself,  a  number  of

University  students, and the Member  for  Farrer

Park  the  trouble of moving a motion asking  the

Government  to apologise for something  which  it

feels it has no occasion to do.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps I ought to explain to hon.

Members  that there is no motion as  such  before

the House. The motion is for the adjournment, and

there is only a discussion on the adjournment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  had not thought of speaking on this particular

motion  for the adjournment. But in view  of  the

replies  of  the Minister for Education  and  the

Minister  for  Culture, I would  like  to  submit

here,  Sir, that their replies are no replies  at

all  to  the  issues which the Member for  Farrer

Park  has brought up. The Member for Farrer  Park

did  say  that there were three issues  involved.

The   first  issue  was  the  autonomy   of   the

University. That issue has been happily  resolved

as  a  result of the exchange of letters  between

Professor Enright and the Minister for Labour and

Law,  and  the speech given by the Prime Minister

at the dinner of the Students' Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue was about the first letter sent

by  the Acting Minister for Labour and Law  which

the  Member  for Farrer Park said was couched  in

language  most  unbecoming of a Minister  of  the

State of Singapore. Use as strong language as the

Minister  wants,  use as robust  language  as  he

pleases,  but  for the dignity of the  people  of

Singapore,  never  should  he  stoop   to   using

unbecoming language. For the wrongs of  Professor

Enright,  in  the  eyes of  the  Government,  why

should all Professors in the University of Malaya

be  classified  as  "mendicant professors"?  What

else  do  the  words "mendicant professors" - those

were  the words used - mean if they were not  meant

to  apply to expatriate Professors who come  here

to  teach  our children to become better citizens

of  Singapore,  when they are being  lumped  into

that  term "mendicant professors"? They may  earn

their living elsewhere. They may be able to  earn

much  more outside Singapore. They come here  and

try  to do their part. For a Minister to use such

unbecoming language, it is felt by the Member for

Farrer  Park, and I share that feeling with  him,

is not becoming of a Minister of a young State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue brought up by the Member for

Farrer   Park  was  that  if  restriction   about

criticism of Government policies is to be  placed

on aliens,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



then  the  Government should see to it  that  the

restriction  is  placed on  all  aliens.  If  the

Minister for Culture were to ask his staff to  go

through  the  newspaper  reports,  he  would   be

informed  that there had been criticisms  of  the

Government's  policy  on culture  by  some  other

visitors.  What surprised the Member  for  Farrer

Park was that it should be aimed at one, and that

the  others should be left free to say what  they

wanted.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I really do not wish to

comment   on   what  has  occurred  between   the

Government  and Professor Enright.  But  I  would

like  very  much to reply to what the Member  for

Cairnhill  has  said about the  Government  using

unbecoming  language. Apparently he objects  very

much to the terms "mendicant" and "asinine".  May

I  say,  Mr Speaker, that the value of terms  is

relative?  For example, if you call Tun  Lim  Yew

Hock  Professor Tun Lim Yew Hock in this country,

it  is an honour. He is treated with respect. But

I  am  told that in the United States,  when  you

call a man "professor", you mean he is a quack. I

myself   had  the  unhappy  experience,   in   my

ignorance, of calling a real professor  who  came

from  the  United States "Professor", and  I  was

very much rebuffed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out, Mr Speaker, that a

Professor  of English in particular, and  a  poet

too, would surely consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



all  this  as either poetic licence or  political

licence,  and I do not seriously believe  that  a

man  of literary merit would very much object  to

the  term  "mendicant", just as much as  we  have

gathered quite lately that there is a four-letter

word the use of which a jury in England have even

admitted to be quite proper. On the other hand  I

would  say that in other countries such  a

four-letter  word would be very improper.  This  again

bears out my point that the value of a phrase  or

a  word  is  relative to values  which  exist  in

different countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end on this note. We certainly

do   not   wish   to  see  aliens,  non-Malayans,

interfere  in  our  political life.  And  as  the

Member for Farrer Park has said, while we are  in

the process of seeking a national identity, while

we  are trying to form a cohesive whole from  out

of a crucible that is molten, we should not allow

outside forces to tamper with our efforts. And  I

would  like  to  end with this note  of  warning.

Aliens  also should not permit themselves  to  be

used as political tools or the political pawns of

others who have an interest in local politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.
