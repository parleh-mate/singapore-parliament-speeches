<div align="center"><b>REVISION OF TAXES ON NON-ESSENTIAL SPENDING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to

inform this House that there will be revised rates

of customs duties and taxes on liquor, tobacco and

cigarettes  and  petrol; of road  tax  on  private

vehicles,   and  of  import  duty  and  additional

registration fees on cars. These changes will come

into  effect  from  3.00  p.m. today,  i.e.  16th

October, 1972.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised taxes are on non-essential spending.

Taxes  on  luxuries, in accordance  with  the  tax

principles  contained in the  President's  Address

and  Addendum, must gradually go up. They  do  not

and  will not affect essential items, and so  will

not add to the cost of living of ordinary workers.

They  have been prompted as much by the  need  for

more  revenue  as  by the need to achieve  certain

necessary   or  desirable  economic   and   social

objectives.  A  cut  in  the  use  of   cars   and

consumption  of  petroleum  will  reduce   traffic

congestion and pollution. A drop in consumption of

liquors,  tobacco and cigarettes will promote  the

nation's  health. The lower consumption  of  these

nearly  all imported goods will also save  foreign

exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures are expected to yield some $38.25

million in additional revenue. This small sum will

be  useful, however, to meet part of the  expected

additional  Government  expenditure  in  the  near

future.   Part  will  go  into  directly   related

expenditure  on roads and flyovers; part  will  go

into  the increased disbursements on salaries  and

the  13th  annual payment. The Government proposes

to  pay a further annual payment in December  this

year, although only eight months will have elapsed

since  the last such payment. In future  the  13th

annual payment will be made in December, when they

will   be   most  welcome,  because  of   seasonal

requirements.   In   addition,   the    Government

anticipates  by  next  June,  in  accordance  with

National  Wages  Council guidelines,  to  increase

wages  and salaries of civil servants. There  will

also  be  revisions of salaries of civil  servants

who  have stagnated for a very long time on  their

present salaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comparison of the previous and new rates is

shown  in the Table (See Appendix, cols. 85-8.) which I have asked the  Clerk

to distribute to Members.



[Copies  of the Table handed in to the  Clerk  and

distributed to hon. Members.]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional particulars of the taxes are as

follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Liquors</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The customs duties have not been revised for

brandy  and  whisky since 1955  and  for  liqueurs

since  1947. They were last revised for  wines  in

1964 and for beer and stout in 1968. With the rise

of  per  capita  income, the  consumption  of  all

liquors  has  increased.  It  is  hoped  that  the

increased  duties  may have the  desirable  social

effect of reducing the consumption of liquors.



<br><br><i>Cigarettes and Tobacco</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's anti-smoking campaign and the

revision  of  customs duties in  early  1970  have

slightly retarded the growth of smoking among  the

population.  The  previous  average  increase   of

between  7 per cent and 10 per cent in the  annual

consumption  of cigarettes has been  cut  down  to

about  3 per cent during the last two years. These

figures  show  that  Government's  policy  against

smoking  has had some success. Duties on  imported

cigarettes  and  leaf tobacco have been  increased

further and may reinforce other measures like  the

ban  on cigarette advertisements. Without increase

in  duty,  the  rise  in  spending  power  of  the

population  might  lead to increased  consumption,

especially by young people taking to the habit for

the  first time. The increase in customs  duty  of

cigarettes  will be beneficial either way:  if  it

cuts  down  smoking, the health of the  population

will  benefit; if it does not, the Government will

obtain  some compensating revenue which will  help

to  meet  the  increased burdens  of  health  care

caused  by  tobacco-induced  diseases,  especially

lung  cancer  and chest diseases.  The  Government

would  not  be unhappy to see revenue fall.  Young

people  should not start smoking. It is  a  dirty,

dangerous and expensive habit.



<br><br><i>Import  Duty  and Additional Registration  Fee  on Private Cars</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various studies of the pattern of long-term

development of the Republic have shown that action

has to be taken to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



avoid   the  Republic  being  swamped   by   motor

vehicles.  Private cars serve a useful purpose  in

transporting the people. But they have also  often

become  items of conspicuous consumption.  Despite

the  Government's  effort  in  improving  existing

roads  and constructing new ones, the increase  in

the number of vehicles has aggravated the problems

of  traffic  congestion  and  air  pollution.  The

number of cars has been increasing at the rate  of

8-10  per  cent per annum. We are unable to  build

roads  and flyovers at 8-10 per cent to match  the

rate  of  increase of cars. We shall have to  take

further  action  to discourage greater  and  often

unnecessary ownership of cars, especially  amongst

the  ever  more common two- or three-car families.

The  alternative is chaos and congestion.  Traffic

will be paralysed, affecting our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reduce the buying of cars, we are

adopting a two-pronged policy. First, taxes on the

purchase  of  all types o new cars will  increase.

Secondly, Road Tax on medium and bigger cars  will

continue  to go up. The import duty has  therefore

been  increased fiom 30 per cent to 45  per  cent.

The  Additional  Registration Fee  has  been  made

uniform  at  the rate of 25 per cent for  imported

Commonwealth,  non-Commonwealth cars  and  locally

assembled  cars.  This  harmonisation  means  that

British  imported cars will have to pay  the  same

rates  as  other cars. As popular  brands  of  the

smaller  British  cars like  the  Austin,  Morris,

Vauxhall,   Escort  and  Cortina   are   assembled

locally, only British luxury cars like the Jaguar,

Rover  and  Rolls Royce will be affected  by  this

abolition   of  special  preferential  rates   for

imported British cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no change in the import duty and

additional  registration  fee  for  omnibuses  and

goods vehicles. So public transport which we  want

to  make  popular will not be burdened with  extra

duties.



<br><br><i>Road Tax on Private Cars</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1966, the basis of road tax on motor

vehicles was changed from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



the  horse power to the cylinder capacity  of  the

engine.   The   road   tax  is   being   increased

progressively  on  private cars above  1,000  c.c.

Owners  of  medium  size cars  will  have  to  pay

between  $22 and $40 more per annum. For  example,

the  Austin A40 and the Hillman Minx will pay  $24

and  $30  respectively more per annum. Larger  and

expensive   cars  will  have  road  tax  increases

ranging   from  $200  to  $1,200.   The   largest

increases  will be for Rolls Royce, Mercedes  600,

Chevrolet Impala, Bentley, and similar cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These revised rates should encourage more people

to  use  public transport, whether buses or taxis.

It  is  in  the interest of all in Singapore  that

most  people  should use such public transport  to

travel  to  their places of work, particularly  in

the  central city area. The Government intends  to

improve  public transport by better,  cleaner  and

more  regular buses, and with conductors, bus  and

taxi drivers being more courteous and considerate.

For  the  long-term, there is a feasibility  study

for a Mass Rapid Transit System.



<br><br><i>Petrol</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to encourage economy in the use of

cars   the   duty  on  petrol  has  been  slightly

increased from $1.30 to $1.35 per gallon, although

the  rates given in the table are indicated in the

metric  system  as $2.80 to $2.97  per  decalitre.

Again,  the  increase in the duty will not  affect

public  transport, as all buses and taxis  run  on

diesel.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  the  question of revised tax on private  motor

vehicles, I am just wondering whether it would not

be  more logical, instead of increasing the tax on

all  categories  of  vehicles except  those  under

1,000 c.c., to impose the increase on those people

who own more than one car. Surely the intention is

to  discourage  people having too many  cars.  For

cars  up  to  2,000  c.c., I  think  it  is  quite

reasonable for the rates to remain the same. A lot

of  people  depend on private cars as  their  only

means of transport. For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



example, those who stay in Yio Chu Kang,  and  who

have  to go all the way to Jurong, at present find

it   almost  impossible  to  go  there  by  public

transport.

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the

Speech of the President be agreed to: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of

Singapore, express our thanks to the  President

for the Speech which he delivered on behalf  of

the  Government  at the opening  of  the  First Session of this Parliament.".'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed a great honour for me, as a new

Member  of this House, to propose this motion.  It

is  also a golden opportunity for me to say a  few

words in support of the speech of the President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know very well that our island Republic

with more than two million mouths to feed has done

extremely  well  in the past few  years.  We  have

solved  most  of our social and economic  problems

which   only  a  few  years  ago  appeared  almost

unsolvable to a lot of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



people both inside and outside Singapore. In fact,

we  have  done  much more than  just  solving  the

problems. We have created the spirit to succeed in

overcoming  problems,  the  spirit  to   sacrifice

individual  rights  for  the  well-being   o   our

country.  We  may  proudly call this  spirit  "the

Spirit of Singapore".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our successes, Singapore is now

sometimes  classified  as  a  "developed  nation",

though  we  are still in a developing  stage.  All

these  are  the  fruits of the  hard  work  of  an

honest, imaginative and intelligent leadership, to

which  I  am  proud to associate myself  now.  But

proud though we all are, these are not all we have

in  mind. We want to do more, much more,  for  our

people,  for  our beloved country, no  matter  how

small is its size.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that all Members in this House

will  fully  agree with me that in this electronic

age  sheer  size means nothing. It is the  quality

that  counts it is the quality of the people  that

decides  the destiny of a country. If all we  have

were  big  pieces of waste land with  millions  of

illiterate  and  poor  quality  people,  not  even

supermen could lead them to prosperity. But we are

fortunate  to  have  hardworking  and  intelligent

people living on this island at the cross-roads of

the world. We have inherited the best cultures  of

both  the  East and the West, but we have  yet  to

melt  them down completely, drain out the  harmful

and  the useless, and to mould the rest into a new

progressive  culture which  we  may  call  it  the

Singapore  culture.  This  is  a  difficult  task.

Because  it  is  not  easy, it is  therefore  more

challenging and interesting to excel ourselves  to

try and achieve this goal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we can create a unique Singapore culture

which  would  be  the envy of the world,  we  must

first  of  all  further raise the quality  of  our

people.  Although we are successful,  economically

and  socially,  there  is  still  ample  room  for

improvement.  We  are  a metropolitan  state  with

virtually  no  countryside,  not  to  mention  any

hinterland.  We  are relying on the  patronage  of

other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



countries  for  our living. We must  therefore  be

able  to do better than their own people. We  have

already had some success in this respect but there

is  a  lot more that we should do, or we will soon

be  caught  up  by  them.  If  this  happens,  our

importance  as the brain services centre  of  this

region  will  be lost. In order to  maintain  this

lead,  we  must not allow ourselves to indulge  in

the usual bad social habits of big cities, such as

being   individualistic,   selfish,   extravagant,

hedonistic, indifferent, impatient and  physically

weak.  These are some of the destructive  elements

that   would  ruin  any  people,  no  matter   how

successful  they  are  now.  We  should,  wherever

possible,  encourage our people to lead  a  simple

but meaningful life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President said in his speech

that "We can become a centre for excellence in all

fields  important  to  our economic  and  cultural

life".  To  make our city state worthy of  such  a

description, all our people, both old  and  young,

whether  educated  in  Chinese,  Malay,  Tamil  or

English, are required to work harder, to be better

disciplined,  to know better of any skill,  be  it

technical   or   managerial   know-how,   be    it

professional  skill  or  languages.  Touching   on

languages,  we  have four official languages.  Any

one  of them may be used in this House. Though  it

is  always easier for a person to express  himself

in  his  mother  tongue, there are many  occasions

when it would be more convenient and economical to

use  a  common language to speak to our countrymen

of other ethnic groups. In this competitive world,

time  means money. If all our people know  two  or

more languages, one of which is common to all,  no

one  can dispute that a better understanding among

our   people  can  be  fostered  more  easily  and

whatever  business to be discussed can be resolved

faster. Our progress would then be faster too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has now become the

most important business centre in this part of the

world.  English, being the accepted  international

business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



language,  has  become a necessary  lingual  skill

which  any  Singaporean, who does not wish  to  be

left  behind, must know. I call it a lingual skill

because  we  need  it to make a living.  It  is  a

foreign tongue to all of us, except a few.  It  is

more  a tool than a language to us. Though  it  is

not   possible  to  learn  a  language  thoroughly

without  learning  its content,  it  is,  however,

possible  to know the content but not  to  imitate

and  practise it. To be able to do this,  we  must

all  be  exposed  sufficiently  long  to  our  own

traditions  and cultures when we were  young.  The

knowledge so acquired would then be the foundation

of  our  education  which would guide  us  through

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if all our people are to be bi-lingual or even multi-lingual, our school teachers

will  have  to  work harder. Those who  are  mono-lingual   should  start  now  to   learn   another

language. Learning is never too late. The  learned

teacher, Confucius, once said that among any three

men  there  must be one worthy to be his  teacher.

Though his saying does not specify the teaching of

a language, it is equally applicable to any one of

our school teachers. I am pleased to note that the

Singapore Chinese Middle School Teachers' Union is

very  interested  and  concerned  in  raising  the

standard  of the teaching of English as  a  second

language  in  Chinese schools. I hope  that  their

members will set an example by learning English if

they are still mono-lingual. This will serve as an

effective encouragement to their students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank you and

Members  of  this  House for  the  opportunity  to

address you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this First Session  of  the  Third

Parliament,  as the President has pointed  out  in

his  speech,  is convened under a situation  quite

different  from  that of the previous  Parliament,

especially when compared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



to  the  political situation in 1963. It  goes  to

show  all the more the distinctive quality of  our

people,   the  perseverance  and  the  unrelenting

spirit of the Government leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent PAP victory in all the 65

constituencies   proved   that    the    political

consciousness   of   our  people   has   generally

increased and they have given, most appropriately,

their  verdict  on  the  false  pretences  of  the

opposition  parties. The myth  of  the  opposition

parties  -that  the  people must  have  opposition

parties   so   that   their   interests   can   be

safeguarded, and that it is only with the presence

of  opposition parties in Parliament can there  be

democracy -has been exposed. The fact is  that  it

is  not  the people who wanted opposition parties,

but ambitious foreign elements who wanted to plant

their  agents  in  our Parliament by  infiltrating

into our political infra-structure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitutional amendments-to prevent

Singapore  from being swallowed up by others,  and

the  investigation into the financial  sources  of

the  various  political  parties  to  ensure  that

Singapore  will not be bought over by others,  are

the  basic  rights of our people.  The  opposition

parties  are  fearful of these two  Constitutional

amendments.  This is quite natural. As  a  Chinese

saying  goes,  "If  one does not  commit  anything

against  his conscience during the day,  one  need

not  be alarmed by the knocks at one's door in the

night." If the opposition parties have nothing  to

hide,  then  these  two Constitutional  amendments

will provide them with an excellent opportunity to

exonerate themselves. They should therefore  fully

support these amendments; why are they in  such  a

scurry instead in opposing them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time, however, that,

foreign  elements have tried to set  foot  on  the

political   activities  in   Singapore,   and   it

certainly  will  not  be the last.  These  foreign

manipulators  of our opposition parties  will  not

rest  at this. They have in the past attempted  to

sway  the thinking of our people through the  mass

media.  When  we  had to take certain  pre-emptive

measures against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



some newspapers in the interest of our people  and

our  sovereignty, a handful of individuals in  the

International  Press  Institute  expressed   their

extreme  dislike  and  dissatisfaction.  This   is

particularly the case with one gentleman who  came

from a country which claimed to be "a full-fledged

Western  democratic prototype". He  expressed  his

profound  shock  and disgust, and  promptly  burst

forth  with nonsensical utterances. But, in  point

of  fact,  his own country had already a precedent

in  taking even stricter and more severe  measures

against the press. Recently, this government  even

proclaimed  martial  law. The  first  volley  was,

ironically,  aimed at the press.  Newspapers  were

closed  down, and many journalists were  arrested.

According    to   information,   this   particular

gentleman  himself  has been imprisoned.  The  so-called  freedom of the press which he  so  proudly

cherished has proved to be unworkable. He  himself

has  dismantled  the  facade  of  democracy,  when

freedom  of  speech has fallen  through.  But  the

curious  thing  is  that the  International  Press

Institute  has not uttered the slightest complaint

or disgust, yet only not so long ago they launched

an  all-out attack against Singapore. There  is  a

Chinese  saying  which goes: "If  one  is  on  the

payroll,  it  is  his  duty to  obviate  disasters

befalling his master." If this is not manipulation

by others, what is'?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our country is situated at the

centre    of    Southeast    Asia-a    militarily,

economically,   politically   and   geographically

strategic  location.  Whatever  we  do  will  have

widespread effect on the rest of the region.  That

foreigners  are  interested  in  our  country   is

therefore  quite  simple  and  natural.  "Befriend

distant  countries, subjugate nearer  ones"  is  a

most   important  strategy  in  the   relationship

between  countries. This historical saying  should

provide  a  lesson  for us. We must  be  vigilant.

Whilst  we  have no intention to harm  others,  we

must   nevertheless  possess  the  capability   to

protect ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are more than adequate in dealing with

these opposition fragments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



But  the  greatest challenge that faces  us  comes

from  the Communist party and its agents. From  my

long   years   of  experience,  I  respect   their

organisational  ability. The relationship  between

China  and  the  United States, similarly  between

China  and  Japan,  have developed  very  rapidly.

Especially  in  the case with Japan,  China  would

rather  establish diplomatic relations with  Japan

first,   setting   aside  other   minor   problems

temporarily.  This is an indicator that  it  is  a

matter  of time before China will establish direct

relations  with countries in Southeast  Asia.  The

table  tennis  teams from Singapore and  Malaysia,

representing  two  independent countries,  visited

Peking recently. Undoubtedly this is an unofficial

recognition  on  the  part of China.  The  Barisan

Sosialis,  however, are still shouting  that  they

are  striving  to  establish a  Malaya  (including

Singapore). A reality which even China has decided

to  accept  but  the  Barisan Sosialis  are  still

reluctant  to acknowledge. Their policy  will  not

then be accepted by the people of Singapore. It is

merely  a  matter of time, therefore,  before  the

Barisan Sosialis will have to revise their  policy

-   between  now  and  the  time  China   formally

recognises Singapore and Malaysia. Or perhaps they

may  even  form  a  new political party,  transfer

their  ground  support, adopt a  new  strategy  of

first  recognising our independence  and  then  to

exploit chauvinistic sentiments, hoping to capture

political  power. We must guard ourselves  against

this  move.  Our  people are of  course  not  that

naive,   because  we  know  that  if  we  have   a

government which sets out to work mainly  for  the

Chinese, then our neighbouring countries will  not

tolerate us that easily. Remember, what we want is

to  set our own destiny, and, most important, that

we  will  be  able to continue to  survive  as  an

independent nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service has been accepted by everyone.

This  is  the  most  important aspect  which  will

ensure  that our country will continue to maintain

its stability and economic growth. It should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



not  be  overlooked that the military is the  most

important  criterion in a country's survival.  The

opposition  parties advocate disarming  ourselves.

This  is  a  fatal thing to do. Instead  of  being

dependent  on  others, we should rather  be  self-reliant. The second World War has taught us a very

good  lesson. At that time, if Britain  wanted  to

defend  the  Malay Peninsula, it was within  their

means to do so. But if that was to be so, it would

mean   that   they  had  to  reduce  the   defence

capability of their Motherland. What was  the  use

of  winning the battles in the Malay Peninsula and

had  London  been  occupied by  the  Germans?  And

hence, both Malaya and Singapore were abandoned. I

have  read  some history of the war in  Singapore.

There  was  one  author who,  after  examining  in

detail  the  war  documents of  both  Britain  and

Japan,  discovered that before the  war,  military

colleges   in  both  countries  had  carried   out

intensive  studies  of  the  various  attack   and

defence   strategies  in  regard  to   the   Malay

Peninsula.  What is surprising is that both  sides

had come to almost identical conclusions. The only

difference  was that Britain merely shelved  their

battle  plans  for  record purposes,  while  Japan

implemented theirs. The result was another British

military disaster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discovered that some of our own military

officers  have  not even read the war  history  of

Singapore,  let  alone the war  history  of  other

countries.  In  the  Addendum to  the  President's

speech on the Ministry of Defence, mention is made

of  raising the efficiency of our armed forces  in

all  elements. Recently, when another batch of our

Armed Forces scholars were sent abroad on military

scholarships, it was announced that a new  subject

had been introduced in their course of study, i.e.

the  study of the history of wars. This is a  move

in the right direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is the foundation of nation-building.

If  the educational standard of our people is low,

all  these are mere empty talks. In the  last  few

years,  the Ministry of Education has continuously

reviewed and revised its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



education  policies,  putting  more  emphasis   on

science  and technological education, in order  to

lay  a sound foundation for nation-building.  But,

perhaps  owing  to  the changes taking  place  too

quickly,  there  has  been, quite  understandably,

some     unavoidable    dislocation     in     the

administration.  The Member for  Bukit  Batok  has

said before that he is an administrator and not  a

politician.  I  believe that after  December  this

year  when  he  has  assumed  the  office  of  the

Minister of State for Education, all these will be

changed,  and  there  will  be  no  administrative

sluggishness in the Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my working experience in the

Ministry  of Labour, I have discovered an anomaly.

There   are  many  graduates  of  vocational   and

technical   schools  who  have  been  trained   in

subjects like metal work, woodwork, welding, etc.,

but  have  not been taken in by the factories  and

not  even  absorbed as apprentices. Instead,  they

have  become  car park attendants or office  boys.

These  jobs  are  completely irrelevant  to  their

training. This is a waste of their training and  a

loss  of  our  trained personnel. The Ministry  of

Labour   will  study  methods  in  which  we   can

strengthen the training in this respect,  so  that

young  workers, who intend to join the  industrial

production  forces, will get the sort of  training

of  a  better standard and so achieve  a  greater

level of efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial development in our country has been

very  rapid.  The  number of industrial  accidents

also  increases in direct proportion to the number

of  workers. Although the Government has tried its

best to promote industrial safety and hygiene, the

success  of this depends largely on the  full  co-operation between management and labour.  In  some

of  the  factories I visited, I found that  safety

precautions  are  not  up  to  the  standard.  The

facilities for personal hygiene are far from being

acceptable; in fact, some are even makeshift. Some

factories  do  not  even have  modern  sanitation.

Surprisingly, they have been allowed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



carry on production. From now on, the Ministry  of

Labour  will  enforce  stricter  compliance   with

Labour laws and measures, especially against those

who do not take seriously the Labour legislations.

We  shall  not allow our workers to work under  an

adverse  working  environment.  If  need  be,  the

Ministry  will  adopt more stringent  measures  in

dealing  with  those who violate our Labour  laws.

Some foreign industrialists have come to invest in

Singapore in the posture of saviours of Singapore,

and  they  treat  our local workers  in  the  same

manner  as  they would treat workers in their  own

countries.  This  attitude must  be  rectified  as

early  as  possible, for otherwise, we would  find

ourselves  difficult  to maintain  the  industrial

harmony so vital to our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1959, we have achieved outstanding progress

in  many fields, such as education, social health,

and   housing   construction.   Our   neighbouring

countries,  of course, have their own views  about

our   achievements.  Our  success   has   somewhat

conspicuously     reflected      the      relative

ineffectiveness of others. This is not our  fault.

We  cannot sit back and do nothing just to  please

other  people.  Our  efforts  are  aimed  at   the

interest  of our people. Campaigns such as  health

and  family  planning have been  held.  Some  hon.

Members  may not be in total agreement with  these

campaigns: but all these measures are necessary to

ensure  that Singapore will have a better  future.

Unfortunately, however, while on the one hand,  we

have  provided solutions to our problems, we  have

not realised that some of the solutions themselves

have  brought  about  new  difficulties  and   new

problems.  For  example, in the  field  of  public

housing  many countries around us, even  those  of

the  more  advanced countries in the  world,  have

expressed their admiration for our success in this

respect. Of course, we do not simply demolish  the

old  buildings, resettle residents in new  housing

estates   and   just   stop   there   with   self-satisfaction.  We are aware of some  inconvenience

caused but we have good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



reasons  in  doing so. We have done  all  this  in

order to re-vitalise the older part of the city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we have solved the problem of housing,

this  solution has nevertheless brought along with

it  other social problems, some of which have  not

apparently  been  considered. For example,  social

amenities  appear to he lacking  in  some  housing

estates.  Although  there are  community  centres,

shops,  clinics and other establishments, we  have

overlooked some other needs. The younger  people's

needs  are  catered for by community centres,  and

those  who  are  in  the age  group  for  national

service  join  the  Armed  Forces.  But  we   have

unconsciously overlooked the interests of some  of

the  middle-aged  people, who are already  parents

and  who are the mainstay of our country. Some  of

them having no other places to spend their leisure

hours, find their way to the bars. I had lived  in

a  Housing  Board flat and I have discovered  that

for many years, I searched in vain for a neighbour

for  a  game  of chess. We have neglected,  so  to

speak, the social needs of people in the age group

of  30-50 years. Whilst we concentrate on moulding

our  younger population, we should not at the same

time  ignore  the  interests of the  head  of  the

household.  Remember,  he  has  a  vote.  He   can

influence the thinking of his whole family. He  is

already  socially established.  Whether  he  be  a

teacher, taxi driver, ordinary factory worker,  or

hawker, he has an established status. His thinking

is  more stable. Unfortunately, and unconsciously,

we  have  not  been  able to provide  recreational

facilities for this middle-aged group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of the open spaces of Housing Board

estates,  plants and shrubs have been  planted  to

enhance the environment. These shrubs and trees no

doubt add colour to and break the monotony of  the

open  spaces, but the children who live  in  these

estates do not make sufficient use of these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



facilities. In fact, it is argued, would  it  then

be  better for them to live in China town, because

they  could  then  play in the  shaded  alleys?  A

family  of seven or eight would, in any  case,  be

too  congested in their confined home environment.

But  when these families shift to their new  homes

in  the estates, their new neighbours arc complete

strangers.  One  would  find  his  neighbours  are

Hokien, Cantonese, Teochew, or Hainanese who  come

from  the various corners of Singapore. There  is,

therefore,  a certain feeling of isolation  and  a

barrier among them. So each one of' them adopts  a

secluded attitude by keeping to his own family and

cares   not   for  others.  There  is  no   social

intermixing  among  the  neighbours.  The  parents

would  prefer  their children to  remain  at  home

during the day as it is too hot outside, or it  is

too   dark   in   the  night.  [Interruption]   My

colleague,  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister   for   Communications,   may   have   an

extraordinary experience of exposure to  the  moon

or  gallivanting  at night. He  may  be  quite  an

expert   on  this.  His  experience  may  not   be

beneficial to the House. I think he should await a

more appropriate occasion for its disclosure!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of all this is that children in

Housing   Board  flats  have  not   much   of   an

opportunity  to  stretch  their  muscles,   quite

contrary   to  the  intention  of  the  Board   in

providing such recreational amenities. This is  by

no  means  a criticism against the Government.  In

pointing  out all this, I am merely attempting  to

show  an example that sometimes satisfactory plans

or  solutions to a problem very often  neglect  to

cater  for the ramifications which may be  brought

about by the very solution or plan. Over the years

our  experience tells us that once  a  problem  is

solved, it does not necessarily mean that that  is

the end. New problems keep cropping up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we move forward and progress, we must at

all times maintain our vigil and understanding  of

our  own position in relation to, the degree  and

level of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



development of our neighbouring countries. As  the

Chinese  saying  goes, "Know yourself,  know  your

enemy,  and in a hundred battles you will  have  a

hundred  victories." Some people  only  understand

themselves but do not understand others.  So  half

the battle is lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is this: Our success can be provocative

to  others.  This is what I mean by  the  residual

problems arising out of the solution to the  major

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the motion.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  on  behalf of  the  people  of  my

constituency, I thank the President for delivering

his  Address  on  the 12th of this  month.  It  is

doubtless  that  the  policies  outlined  in   the

Address  signify a new era in the history  of  our

nation  building.  It has set out  many  important

tasks for us to perform so that in future we  will

strive for a more just, more reasonable and richer

society.  The  President also pointed  to  certain

unhealthy  trends  existing in Western  countries.

For example, a section of the population would  be

enjoying the fruits of the hard labour of  others.

In  other words, their attitude is not to  do  any

work  hut  to reap the benefits of the  labour  of

their  fellowmen.  Such  wrong  mentalities   have

brought great harm to these countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if there are people in Singapore

who  harbour this thinking, we should correct them

by  criticising their faults. Otherwise they  will

be  a  hindrance  to our task of nation  building.

However,  we  are  glad that the majority  of  our

people  have the good quality to work  hard.  They

realise  that  they  must  work  hard  to  improve

themselves. They do not believe in luck.  We  have

been able to solve most of our problems because of

these  excellent qualities. We have  overcome  the

difficulties in our programme of construction  and

nation  building, and we have been able  to  steer

our  nation from rough and troubled waters to calm

seas. We have progressed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



all round and our economy is booming. All this  is

due  to  the  hard  work and the spirit  of  self-reliance  of  our  people.  In  order  to  further

advance  the work of nation building and  to  reap

more  fruits of our labour, we should  set  higher

ideals  and  urge  our youths  to  he  more  self-reliant,   so  that  they  can  make   a   greater

contribution to the task of nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President also touched on

the  possibility of spreading prosperity from  the

urban   to  the  rural  areas.  As  a  Member   of

Parliament  representing a rural  area,  I  firmly

support  this  wise policy. I feel that  with  the

adoption  of this policy, the people in the  rural

areas,  like  the people in the urban areas,  will

enjoy  the fruits of prosperity engendered by  the

buoyant  economy. It cannot be denied  that  since

the  PAP came to power, we have spent millions  of

dollars  in construction work, and on the  various

projects  to provide better roads, drains,  street

lamps, and electricity for the rural people. Their

living  conditions  have thus  improved.  However,

this  does not mean that all the problems  in  the

rural areas have been solved. As a matter of fact,

many  M.P.s,  including myself, who represent  the

rural  areas,  still  feel  that  there  are  many

problems  yet  to  be  solved.  For  example,  the

problem of better roads, street lights, and  water

supply  still  exists in many areas.  In  view  of

this.  I  would like to suggest that for our  next

Budget,  more  funds should be allocated  for  the

development  of  rural areas, so  that  the  rural

people  can  enjoy  a  higher standard  of  living

arising  from  our developing economy.  Since  our

economy  is booming, it is not difficult  for  the

Government  to allocate more funds for  the  rural

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring up another matter, i.e, the

price  of  pigs in the rural areas. We, the  rural

M.P.s,   have   met  members  of   the   Livestock

Association, and have discussed this problem  with

them.  We  then adopted certain measures to  solve

some of the problems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



of the livestock farmers. At one time, the farmers

were  allowed to slaughter their pigs on  Mondays.

However, this practice has now been stopped by the

Primary Production Department, thus causing a drop

in  the  price of pigs. I would like to appeal  to

the Minister concerned to look into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Addendum to the

President's Speech on the Ministry of Defence,  it

was  mentioned that "the urgency over our  defence

build-up has lessened as we now have some  defence

capability." This is indeed gratifying because  it

shows  that we now have a firm foundation  in  our

task of nation building and defence build-up. This

means  that  we can review our policy on  national

service. The aim of this review is to economise on

the  use  of our manpower. I refer to two aspects.

The  first is that we should enforce stricter para

military training in our secondary schools.  Under

this arrangement, the training could be done after

school    hours   or   during   school   holidays.

Instructors should be drawn from the regular armed

forces. If we can do this, we can then shorten the

time  for national service. At the present moment,

physical  education teachers also give instruction

in  military training. It is not possible  to  get

good results if we use physical education teachers

for this purpose. The second point relates to part-time  national service. We should relax our policy

in  this regard to exempt those who are physically

weak  or  those who have to solve their  financial

difficulties,  and this will also help  to  reduce

the shortage of labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to touch on the quality of our

people.  We know that we have to raise the quality

of  our  people. We would like to see our citizens

achieve  a higher level of education so that  they

have  the  ability  to earn a  better  living  for

themselves.  This  is a fundamental  problem.  But

what  do  we understand by "good quality"  of  our

people? We have to study this in detail.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



From  my  point  of view, I think  "good  quality"

should  include the following: diligence, honesty,

knowledge,   sense   of   responsibility,   social

discipline, a sense of fair play, helpfulness, and

a willingness to help others. In addition, we must

not  forget  that we must be well-behaved  and  be

polite and courteous when dealing with people.  In

this  connection, I think the Government is  aware

that  some people keep long hair and grow a beard.

They  put  on  such fantastic attire  that  it  is

difficult to distinguish whether they are  men  or

women.  The Government should, through the process

of  education and other measures, put  a  stop  to

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the President's Address to Parliament, mention

is  made  of the necessity of keeping our families

small  so  that the next generation will  be  well

looked after. Our apprenticeship schemes will meet

the  needs of our industries. There is also a need

to  promote cultural activities and to build  more

parks  and recreation grounds, so that our  people

will  enjoy a more pleasant and richer  life.  Our

workers are encouraged to raise their productivity

so  that  their wages can go up in stages  and  so

achieve  a  higher standard of living. Undoubtedly

all  these  measures are correct and constructive.

For  the benefit of our future and for the benefit

of  the  people,  we must support all  these  wise

policies  with all our strength. All in  all,  the

President's  Address ushers in a more constructive

era.  In the next five years, we are going to have

a  greater  number of satellite towns,  with  more

modern  industrial and business centres, a greater

number   of  more  sophisticated  and  progressive

industries, a better communications system, and  a

cleaner and greener environment. All these deserve

the  utmost  consideration by our  people  because

they  are worthy causes. Irrespective of  race  or

religion, we should unite and march forward in our

common aim to build a more prosperous and a better

Singapore  so  that our people can have  a  better

life.
