   <h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>COMPLAINTS AGAINST NOISE</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Particulars)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many cases of complaints against noise have been reported to the Police since 1st January, 1981; (b) what were the causes of the noise in all these cases; and (c) whether the existing laws are adequate for the Police to deter people from making excessive noise in housing estates as well as on the road.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar) (for the Minister for Home Affairs): Mr Speaker, Sir, there were 15,611 cases of complaints against noise reported to the Police between 1st January, 1981 and 2nd February, 1982. This works to an average of 1,115 cases per month or 37 cases per day. This is not an alarming figure considering that we have some 500,000 households, 110,000 business establishments and 400,000 motor vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaints are usually made against noise emanating from:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) weddings, parties and other social functions;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the inconsiderate use of musical instruments and audio equipment;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) family disputes and quarrels;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) children crying or playing;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) dogs barking;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) motor vehicles, and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) other sources, such as construction activity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the problem of noise pollution in housing estates as well as on the road is not legislation alone. Landscarce Singapore is a busy modern metropolis with considerable industrial and commercial activity. It is densely populated, and we have no choice but to live close to one another in high rise buildings. It is, therefore, inevitable that there will be a certain amount of noise from roads construction sites and our neighbourhoods. There must be a tolerance to a certain amount of noise which will result from our living conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem, however, is to prevent noise levels from becoming excessive or intolerable. There are several laws which deal with the problem of noise. The law under which the Police usually take action is the Minor Offences Act. Under the Act, the Police can only take action when excessive noise occurs between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. As such, the Police are sometimes hampered by this limited provision. The other laws on noise pollution are as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Motor Vehicle (Construction and Use) Rules, 1974, which deal with excessive noise from vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Environmental Public Health Act which deals with industrial noise, and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Public Entertainments Act, which controls the sound level of loud speakers.
  <br>
  <br>The Police have been working on proposals to amend the laws but this is a complex matter and may take some time to finalize, as other departments controlling and regulating noise pollution activities are involved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People living together in a community such as ours, should learn to be considerate and refrain from making loud noises unnecessarily. At the same time, they should also be tolerant towards the occasional noises which are not intended to annoy. This will not only create a more friendly and pleasant neighbourhood to live in, but the Police will also have fewer complaints of this nature to investigate and can, therefore, deploy more men to combat crime.

   <b>DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Particulars)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will give the numbers of persons detained without trial in Singapore as of the 15th of February, 1982 under (i) the Misuse of Drugs Act; (ii) the Immigration Act; and (iii) any other written law other than the Internal Security Act and the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act and the periods of their detention spaced at five year differentials; and what safeguards are provided to ensure that innocent persons are not detained under these laws.

  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The Misuse of Drugs Act 1973</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me point out at the outset that under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973, drug addicts are committed to approved institutions, which are not detention centres, for compulsory treatment and rehabilitation. They are not detained for criminal offences. The Act provides for committal for treatment for six months at a time, subject to a maximum of 36 months. As of 15th February, 1982, 3,356 persons were receiving treatment in Drug Rehabilitation Centres (DRC). None of them had been detained for more than five years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts is similar to the compulsory isolation and treatment of those suffering from infectious diseases as well as those committed to mental institutions for violent behaviour. We consider drug addiction to be a pernicious disease which, if not checked, will erode the very fabric of our society. It is necessary to commit drug addicts for treatment and rehabilitation because drug addiction, like an infectious disease, spreads rapidly. If drug addicts are not identified and sent for treatment swiftly, they will continue to spread the habit to others in our community.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Safeguards</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are adequate safeguards to ensure that non-addicts are not committed under the Misuse of Drugs Act. First, under the Act, the Director and the Deputy Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) can order a drug addict, who has been confirmed to be a drug addict either through a positive urine test or by the medical doctor through medical examination and observation, to be admitted for treatment and rehabilitation at a DRC for a period not exceeding six months. Secondly, an addict's further stay in the DRC will be assessed by a Review Committee which is chaired by a medical doctor. This Committee will either transfer him to the Day Release Scheme or extend the committal period.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third safeguard is an elaborate system of collecting two urine samples from suspects and this has been in operation
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> since 1977. The system is fully laid down in the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations, 1977. Under this, a suspected addict whose first urine test is positive can apply for a second urine test on the same sample. It ensures that no mistakes occur during urine collection.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, a drug addict can make a complaint under the Act, to a Magistrate pursuant to section 33D of the Misuse of Drugs Act that he has been improperly committed for rehabilitation. The Magistrate will conduct an inquiry into the complaint and he can order the discharge of the inmate from a DRC.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, as a further safeguard, of course, any person, through his counsel, can file a writ of habeas corpus in the High Court for the release of an inmate from the DRC on grounds of improper committal.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The Immigration Act</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons detained under the Immigration Act are prohibited immigrants, illegal immigrants or persons remaining unlawfully in Singapore. As of 15th February, 1982, there were 10 persons detained under this Act. Of this number, only one has been in detention for more than five years. Prohibited and illegal immigrants have to be detained. They have no right to be here and should not be allowed to stay here. Singapore cannot. be a haven for those who may be a burden to society and are unable to qualify for entry under the normal immigration regulations. Detention is an effective deterrent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards safeguards, there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that innocent persons are not detained under the Act. Each case is thoroughly examined and investigated to determine whether the person should be detained pending removal from Singapore. The person is brought before a magistrate in Chambers who authorizes the Detention Order signed by the Controller of Immigration if he is satisfied that the detention is lawful and valid. The Immigration Department reviews the detained cases regularly. Where the identity card and nationality of the detained person can be established, the appropriate foreign mission in Singapore is approached and requested to issue a travel document to facilitate repatriation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as other laws are concerned, 88 persons were isolated and given treatment for infectious diseases, such as cholera and enteric fever under the Infectious Diseases Act in 1981, and as of March 1982 there were 46 "violent" patients being isolated and treated under the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in closing, I think it is necessary for me to draw the attention of the House to a matter concerning certain information which was given to a foreign newspaper, the International Herald Tribune, published on 15th March, 1982. Members will recall that the Minister for Home Affairs had supplied a written answer to the Question for Written Answer by the Member for Anson concerning persons under preventive detention. This was tabled in this House on 3rd March, 1982. Subsequently, on 3rd March, an Oral Answer was given here to the question by the Member for Delta on whether preventive detention for secret society gangsters and drug traffickers was meeting its objective, and now we have another question.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer, Mr Speaker, Sir; to this article which appeared in the Intemational Herald Tribune where the Member for Anson is quoted as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But someone must say . . . that there are 5,000 detained people in Singapore who have not had a trial. People don't really know what is happening in Singapore. They see the clean streets and the tall buildings and they don't know people are starving here.'
  <br>
  <br>Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to emphasize the statement, "there are 5,000 people detained in Singapore." Now, perhaps the Member for Anson could clarify his arithmetical skills. From the information that the Ministry has already supplied to this House - there are 17 people detained under the Internal Security Act, 1,019 detained under Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act for secret society activities and drug trafficking, which comes to no more than 1,036. Yet the Member for Anson has alleged in an overseas publication that 5,000 people are detained here. Let us leave out the mental patients. But what baffles my imagination is that, before the answer to the question was given, he had already worked out a figure which is far from the truth, Perhaps he has lumped in, for good measure, the drug addicts
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> who are being treated and rehabilitated. Even then, we do not get a figure of 5,000. Perhaps it is his intention that all those who are presently being treated and rehabilitated should be sent to the courts, convicted and sentenced so that they are burdened with a stigma for the rest of their lives, without solving the drug addiction problem. I would be interested to know how he arrived at the figure of 5,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that these different questions for information on statistics under any other laws also, are a vain hope that somehow the information would tally with his figure which he had given before the answer was given in this Chamber. I am sorry to say that I am unable to doctor the figures to suit his predetermined figure. And perhaps it would also be interesting for him to justify, either now or on some subsequent occasion, where are the starving thousands in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Rumours!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I answer the Hon. Minister of State on his comments, may I ask my questions first? The Minister speaks of sufficient safeguards for persons detained under the Misuse of Drugs Act. He says they are either given a urine test or subjected to a medical examination. Would he tell this House whether there are any persons who are detained, whose urine tests have proved to be negative and whose blood tests have proved to be negative? There are persons who are detained, for whom neither a urine test nor a blood test was done. Would he also tell this House what is the medical examination that is conducted of a person before an order is made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me respond to that question. I think it has been pointed out in this House by the Minister, and certainly pointed out on many occasions outside this House, what the difference is between a situation where a suspected drug addict is subjected to a urine test and where a suspected drug addict may have a medical examination. The answer to this question, if I may summarize everything that has been said before, is as follows.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law is very clear. A person could be sent for treatment and rehabilitation either on the basis of a urine test or on the basis of a medical observation and examination under section 33 of the Act. That is the first point. It is not a urine test and medical examination/observation but a urine test or medical examination. And there are very good reasons for this, Mr Speaker. Let me enumerate them. The first is that certain kinds of drugs which are addictive by nature will not appear and are not traceable in a urine test. This has been made very clear before.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, even where a urine test is conducted, the time factor is crucial. If there has been a lapse of more than six days between the time the drug was consumed and the administering of the test, it will not show in the urine test. This is why it is absolutely essential to have a medical examination.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason why it is important to have a medical examination, and why a medical examination is indeed ordered, is that through a medical examination, properly trained specialized doctors can observe withdrawal symptoms, which are indicative of drug addiction. For these reasons, it is possible that a person may ,have a urine test with a negative result. But that does not mean that he is not a drug addict. Indeed, if it has passed the six-day period or if he is on a drug which is not traceable in a urine test, but the medical examination shows that he is indeed exhibiting symptoms of drug addiction, the law has provided, and quite properly so, that he should be sent for treatment. That answers the question by the Member for Anson.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe he asked for the details or the precise nature of the medical examination. These are matters, Mr Speaker, Sir, which are properly within the scope of the professional acumen and expertise of the doctors. It suffices for me to say that the two doctors have experience in this area, and I would like to leave questions of judgment on medical matters to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question on the safe-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> guards under the Misuse of Drugs Act. The Minister states that the law is very clear. That it is clear is plain to anyone who reads the law. The question is: is there not a danger of innocent persons being detained under this law?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister talks about medical examination. He is not able to tell this House what exactly the medical examination consists of. As I understand it, Mr Speaker, Sir, the examination is left in the hands of one doctor who is attached to the rehabilitation centre. What is the precaution taken against the diagnosis of this doctor being wrong? Would the Minister tell this House what safeguards has a man got, who thinks he has been wrongly accused of being a drug addict when he knows that he has never consumed any drug in all his life? What safeguard is there of challenging this doctor's opinion? Is there an appeal to a medical tribunal consisting of people who know something about drug addiction, besides the doctor at the drug rehabilitation centre?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I answer to the substance of the question, let me answer the innuendo that is hidden in the question, namely, to raise shades of innocent persons being sent to detention. Let me disabuse the Member for Anson of this innuendo.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let us recall that it cost the Government an incredible sum of money maintaining these rehabilitation centres. It cost us a great deal of energy - deploying staff, including professional people, to run these rehabilitation centres - and indeed if all the people in the rehabilitation centres were not drug addicts, they could be usefully deployed to assist the Ministry of Labour in meeting the severe labour shortage. So there is no reason whatsoever for this Government, in view of these points which I have mentioned, not to close down these rehabilitation centres and to do away with them if the situation warranted it. If there were no more persons who are genuine drug addicts, nobody could be happier than this Government. But in the interest of the nation and to prevent drug addiction from spreading, we have to take these drastic measures,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possibility of abuse, let me say, is a theoretical possibility in any exercise of governmental power. The theoretical possibility of abuse is not a good reason for denying power to meet this dangerous threat to our society. I have already enumerated the safeguards. I have spelt out five to six safeguards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, let me point out that the Member for Anson is wrong again on his understanding of the facts. There is not just one doctor. There are two full-time doctors. Furthermore, I do not think he listened to me when I -pointed out the safeguards. I said that there are review committees which meet every six months to review the cases. And the chairmen of these review committees are medical practitioners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if the Member is not satisfied, he should tell us on some occasion how he proposes to deal with the serious problem of drug addiction. What plans does he have? How would he attack this problem? Release all the drug traffickers who are now under preventive detention? Release all the drug addicts so that for the rest of their lives they will be in misery and also subject others to misery? This is a serious problem we are talking about. The Government has tackled it and has seen it fit also to provide five to six safeguards. If the Member says that these safeguards are not enough, let him come out with the plans.

  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon (Minister of State of Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State of Education (Dr Tay Eng Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have the opportunity to ask a supplementary question but I want to direct the question at the Member for Anson. Yesterday in this House, he spoke about our rugged society and went on to sneer about the ragged society, casting a slur on the people of Singapore. Now we hear that he has reported or alleged to have reported to an international newspaper that there are 5,000 detainees in Singapore and that the people of Singapore are starving. I think he owes us and the people of Singapore an apology. Will he apologize publicly to the people of Singapore?

  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I ask a supplementary question? I am indebted to the

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Minister of State but I am afraid he has not answered my question. He has given us a very lengthy statement. We all know the old game that if you cannot answer a question, you put another question to the man who asked you the question.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is this, if I may repeat again, Mr Speaker, Sir. Is there not a serious danger of this doctor being wrong in his diagnosis? And what is the safeguard provided in such a case? Is there an appeal to an independent medical tribunal which will look into this matter and satisfy itself that the diagnosis is correct?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we have a problem. It is not so much an inability or an inadequacy of my answer, but I think it is an unwillingness on the part of the Member for Anson to accept an answer which somehow does not tally with his predetermined intentions of tallying information with his figures. Perhaps we can sympathize with him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To respond to his supplementary question, the answer is, of course, there is no danger. I have pointed out the whole panoply of the safeguards. For there to be abuse, there will have to be collusion between the apprehending officers, the Director and his Deputy Director, further collusion with the two full-time medical doctors, and yet even further collusion with the chairmen and members of the two appeal committees. Perhaps he might also want to suggest, I guess, that there has to be collusion with the magistrate later on. I think this is ridiculous, Mr Speaker, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there is no doubt that here we have to challenge the professional competence of the medical doctors. I for one and the Ministry have no reason to suspect the integrity or the professional competence of either of the two medical practitioners. If the Member for Anson has a solid reason or evidence which casts serious doubts in any one particular case on the professional competence or the personal integrity of either of these two doctors to warrant the kind of investigation which must follow, then let him say so and let him supply us with the particulars.

  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it must be plain to anybody that there does not have to be any collusion for a man to be wrong in his diagnosis. Why are we evading this issue? I take it that the Minister is not going to answer this question.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I move on to something else and, that is, the Immigration Act. The Minister says that one man has been detained for more than five years under the Immigration Act. May I ask how long it is intended to keep this man in detention? Until he dies?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me respond to that question. Once again, the question is pregnant with implications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Innuendoes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Innuendoes. Let me give Members of the House a proper perspective. Sometimes when listening to this question we tend to forget which country this legislature is located. We think we are located in a country with vast expanse of land endowed with abundant mineral and agricultural resources, sparsely populated, so that we must bend over backwards to accept every illegal immigrant. But the truth is to the contrary. We are a legislature in Singapore and our immediate and over-riding obligation - and we will be abdicating our responsibility if we were to forget this obligation - is to our people, Singaporeans, Singapore citizens. That is the first preliminary observation I wish to make.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second preliminary observation is that we have laws, like any other sovereign country has laws, concerning immigration. Who can come in? Under what conditions, with what travel documents, for how long, and so on? What happens when people violate these regulations concerning our immigration? This is the crucial point. If a person violates our immigration regulations, should we condone it and tell him, "OK. If you manage to sneak through, good luck. You can stay in Singapore for as long as you like." Obviously not. We cannot bestow on persons who have wilfully violated our immigration regulations the fruits of their illegality. That is the second preliminary observation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning this person, I do not, of course, have all the details about him. Let me say that he came back to Singapore despite the fact that he was subject to a Prohibition of Entry Order. In other words, this is a person who not only did not comply with the immigration laws but he also violated a Prohibition of Entry Order served on him previously. For further information, before the Prohibition of Entry Order had been served on him he had been engaging in nefarious secret society activities in Singapore and, in fact, had been detained for such secret society activities. He was detained, served a Prohibition of Entry Order which he violated. As far as I understand he has refused to go back to the country of origin. In fact, he has refused to disclose information and refused to give documents as to the country from whence he came. The question then is this: what do we do? He had lost his documents. In fact, many people deliberately lose their documents in the hope that hiving told us that they have lost their documents they would be let in Singapore for free. All I can say is that I cannot conjecture his future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me indicate the principles on which we deal with this case and the principles are the most important to be considered. The first principle is, that no person should be allowed to enjoy the fruits of his illegality, in this case, illegal entry into Singapore compounded by the fact that there was a Prohibition of Entry Order served on him. Furthermore, as to whether he can be released in the immediate future, we will have to investigate in the light of his violation of the Prohibition of Entry Order and in the light of the fact that he had been involved in criminal activities. Should he be released into our Singapore society? This matter will have to be looked into by the Immigration authorities, particularly as to whether he will produce documents which will enable the Ministry to expedite his return to his country of origin.

  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, again I am indebted to the Minister for his very lengthy statement about the principles. No one is quarrelling with the principles. Let us get that clear. What I want to know is: what is the Government proposing to do with this man? They have had five years of investigation, five years of asking for his documents but he has not produced them. What do you propose to do? Just give us a plain answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thought I have made myself clear, Mr Speaker, that this is a case which has resulted in detention on very special and unusual circumstances. I myself cannot see how the Member for Anson wants me to give a categorical decision now as to whether this person is going to be released tomorrow or the day after, for that would spell a lesson for everybody else who is 9 potential violator of our immigration laws. Some people might think: "Well, four years' detention, OK. Five years' detention, it might be worth while living in Singapore for the rest of our life." I am certainly not going to indicate in this House that we are going to release a person who has violated the immigration laws after X number of years. I think it will be contrary to our national interest to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be surprised if the Member for Anson presses the Government for an answer on this case for he, in fact, would be encouraging all those who are thinking of violating our immigration laws to make a mathematical calculation, probably more accurate than he, that it might be worth while for them to violate our laws.

  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for National Development how the Housing and Development Board justifies its policy to exclude Singapore citizens, whose wives are not citizens, from applying for accommodation in the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Board's apartments even where the wives have lived in Singapore with their husbands for several years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yock Suan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, applicants for HDB flats must satisfy certain conditions to be eligible for public housing. Citizenship is one of the conditions to be fulfilled. For families consisting of only husband and wife, the minimum citizenship requirement is that one of them must be a Singapore citizen and the other a permanent resident.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A citizen who marries a foreigner, therefore, has first to apply for permanent residence for his spouse. If he is unsuccessful in his application, he cannot satisfy all the conditions stipulated in the eligibility rules for public housing. Therefore, he cannot apply for accommodation in HDB fiats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration of the spouse's stay in Singapore is irrelevant to the issue of public housing eligibility. There are numerous foreign embassy staff, professional pass holders and work permit holders, who have stayed many years in Singapore but who remain foreigners and are not eligible for HDB flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware of this policy. My question was: how does the HDB justify this policy?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know of one instance. A man working for the Ministry of the Environment for a number of years - he is a Government employee - is a Singapore citizen and he married another Singapore resident, but she is not a Singapore citizen, a Malaysian woman. They have been here for many, many years. The quarters he is occupying is to be demolished to make way for redevelopment. The poor man has been applying for accommodation in HDB quarters but has been turned down. What does the HDB or the Government expect people in this situation to do? A man who is a Singapore citizen and who has given years of service to the Government - his crime would appear to be that he married a Malaysian woman who has been resident in Singapore. What does the HDB and the Government propose to do in such
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cases? The Immigration Department refuses his wife permanent residence. What is the man going to do?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I answer, I must say that once again we find him making innuendoes like it is a crime to marry a Malaysian. But that is not really the point. The point here, in answer to his question, is that public housing for Singaporeans is not a right. It is a privilege. It is not a right. No country has given its citizens the right to public housing. Singapore can, in fact, be very proud in that we have already housed 70% of our population, and this percentage is rising to 80%, 90% in the near future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, applicants must satisfy certain conditions to qualify for public housing. For example, some families consisting entirely of citizens are not eligible simply because their household income exceeds the qualifying ceiling. Why does not the Member for Anson champion these people? Another example. The HDB maintains a blacklist of applicants who have been disqualified from applying for HDB flats for various reasons, for example, if they had misused their flats as gambling houses or for other vices. Tenants who are guilty of vandalism in lifts may, in fact, be evicted from their HDB flats. Tenants who misuse their flats as stores for bicycle thieves or subversive elements will also be disqualified.

  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Acting Minister for Social Affairs in how many cases has public assistance been terminated or withdrawn since 1st January, 1977; how many of them were the result of investigations which revealed that the recipients had grown-up children or close relatives to whom they could turn for support; whether he is aware that some of these children or relatives refuse to support the recipients; and what measures he proposes to take against these children or relatives after counsel from the Counselling Section of the Social Welfare Department has failed to convince them of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> their duty to maintain and support the recipients.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Acting Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the five-year period from 1st January 1977 to 31st December, 1981, 8,839 persons had their public assistance allowance withdrawn. Of this number, 2,035 or 23% had their allowance withdrawn because they had grown-up children or close relatives who could, and were prepared to, support them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the hon. Member and also this House that public assistance allowance will not be withdrawn if the children or close relatives, though financially in a position to support the recipient, do not in fact do so. The facts of each case are carefully considered by the Public Assistance Review Committee under my Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happily, as of now, the number of public assistance recipients who have well-to-do children or close relatives and yet do not receive any support from them, is small. If, in future, there is evidence that growing numbers are abandoning their parents, the Government will consider introducing legislation to confer on needy, aged parents the right to claim maintenance from their children. Members of this House will know that legal provision already exists for minor children to claim maintenance from their parents and for deserted wives to claim maintenance from their husbands. It is to be hoped, Sir, that it will not be necessary to introduce such legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if it is the hope of the Hon. Minister that legislation may not be necessary, may I know what steps the Government is taking to ensure that such legislation may not be introduced? Does this also mean that the Hon. Minister believes that legislation can promote filial piety? I have my doubts.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first answer the second part of the hon. Member's question, Frankly speaking, Sir, I have my doubts too. I do not think that legislation can promote filial piety. Sir, filial piety is a matter of the heart. It is a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> two-way process. Both the parents and the adult children have their respective roles to play. But, like all laws, Sir, the proposed legislation, if ever it is introduced, will be aimed at the minority. The primary purpose of the law is, therefore, to codify an obligation which all sections of the community already recognize and which the vast majority of adult children gladly discharge. So this piece of legislation, if ever it is introduced, would therefore act as a deterrent to the errant minority who neglect their needy, aged parents. Therefore, those of us who are already discharging our obligations to our parents have nothing to fear about this legislation, if it is introduced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I personally feel that to counsel anyone on filial piety, after he has reached adulthood, is going to be difficult. I would not say that it is impossible because my Ministry, after repeated attempts and sustained efforts, has been fairly successful in a limited number of cases. Therefore I would rather classify this task as difficult, not impossible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we really want to succeed in preserving the integrity of the family and also to avoid the social scourge of children neglecting their needy, aged parents, we have to introduce educational programmes with a view to, firstly, instilling in the minds of the young, respect for the elderly and a sense of life-long duty towards one's parents. Secondly, making young parents aware that their responsibility towards their children does not end with the provision of food, clothing and shelter, and that without their active cooperation it will not be possible to ensure that children will grow up with a deep sense of belonging as a member of the family.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second factor is very important because the alienation of children from parents does not only occur in households where parents have failed to discharge their basic responsibility of providing the essentials of life to their children. The weakening of the bonds between parents and children can also come about as a result of the failure on the part of a parent to relate to the children during infancy and, more important, during adolescence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> This is exactly what I meant when I said that filial piety is a two-way process.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the education of the children, I think we all agree that the Ministry of Education's recent move to introduce Religious Knowledge as a compulsory subject at Secondary 3 and 4 levels is a step in the right direction, although people in certain quarters feel that this subject should have been introduced at levels lower than Secondary 3. But that is beside the point. I think we all agree that religious knowledge is a very good subject because we all know that the major religions of the world preach filial piety and also compassion for the poor and the handicapped..But I would like to caution here that in implementing this new syllabus, we have to guard ourselves against lending support to evangelistic fervour or to the spreading of religious bigotry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may digress a little, Sir. As a Muslim myself, I feel proud to say that the Muslim society in Singapore, and elsewhere, attaches great importance to filial piety and respect for the aged. How does this come about? The answer is very simple. To a Muslim, to be filial is more than just a moral obligation. It is his religious duty. I cannot help going back into history because yesterday the Member for Anson went back into history, about 20 years ago, when he queried why the public assistance rates prior to 1973 were revised downwards, In the days of old Singapore, Sir, it was quite common to see three or four generations living happily under one roof in a kampong. I am happy to say that this age-old tradition is still being observed, even as more and more Muslims, more and more Malays, live in HDB flats. Adult children who live away from their parents provide regular financial support to the latter. They also hold reunions on festive and religious occasions. The small number of parents who experience unfilial conduct on the pan of their children are usually too ashamed of the fact to even talk about it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention all this, Sir, because I feel that there is something positive, something useful that we can derive from Religious Knowledge in our efforts to inculcate filial piety in our young citizens. Besides the school, the Government, through its
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Family Planning and Population Board (FPPB), also conducts family life education programmes for newly married couples. My colleague, the Hon. Minister for Health, may want to confirm this. Such programmes are also conducted by private organizations, like the Family Planning Association, the Roman Catholic Church. For the Muslims, such programmes are also being organized by the Adult Religious Students' Association of Singapore (better known as PERDAUS), and the Islamic Theological Association of Singapore (better known as PERTAPIS), for those who are about to be married. We certainly appreciate the efforts of these organizations, and I would like to see more of such activities being organized. With the pooling of these resources in this direction, I am confident that we do not have to introduce any legislation on the maintenance of the needy, aged parents.

  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier on the Hon. Minister mentioned that 2,035 social welfare assistance cases have had their allowances withdrawn because they have grown-up children. First of all, may I ask him what are the criteria used by his Ministry to establish that their children are, in fact, able to support them; and secondly, how many of these cases were subsequently reinstated upon appeal.
  <br>

  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned in my answer to the hon. Member for Punggol, these 2,035 cases are persons with children and relatives who are able and are willing to support them. There is no question of. appeal. These are cases of public assistance recipients with families, children or relatives who are able and are willing to support them. Therefore, they withdrew from the Public Assistance Scheme.

  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> I thought he was supposed to come out with figures for me. Anyway, typical of PAP Members of Parliament, I take my job seriously and have come up with the answer.

There is nothing to hide. This is in line with the Government's policy on family planning. There are other more stringent measures which we have taken and which we have made known to the public.

To my lay mind, I am happy with the Budget, And the case to be met by the Hon. Minister in this debate was analysed in his characteristic fashion by my Friend, the Member for Whampoa, in the House yesterday. Whilst it is a hard fact that inflation is a phenomenon that no developing economy, in particular a fast developing one, can escape from, there must be cogent reasons to justify specific Government measures that had the effect of fuelling our high rate of inflation. These specifics were clearly dealt with by the Member for Whampoa in last year's debate, but there was no effective response. Therefore, we can anticipate an analytical reply from the Hon. Minister to the said Member's critical remarks this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the exception of the hon. Member for Anson, and this we shall soon test and know as we go along, this House accepts the Government's philosophy underlining the Budget proposals. The criticisms in the House have been directed largely at questions of detail. This has been so over the years during which we, the PAP Government and the people of Singapore, saw Singapore through her worst periods of unemployment and social dislocation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advent of Anson, however, its Member gave us notice both at the hustings and through the international press, that Singapore was henceforth going to be a different place and that the Workers Party was about to swing into a wide-ranging philosophical attack on the Government's policies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Anson spoke for more than 45 minutes. It is unfortunate that he spoke immediately after my good Friend, the Member for Whampoa. A greater contrast in content, reason and argument could not have been revealed. The Member for Whampoa gave a reasoned
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> argument supported by facts and figures. He was persuasive enough, even though I cannot agree to all he said. On the other hand, the Member for Anson waffled through his speech, setting out suppositions and conjectures which he was never able to substantiate. I think the trouble with the Member for Anson is that his opinions are always chasing facts which are non-existent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PAP Government has never claimed infallibility. Far be it for us to claim that we are always right. But we have been right most of the time and where we have not anticipated developments correctly we have had the courage and capacity to adjust. This financial policy as set out in the Budget Statement is based on a cold and sober assessment of our future and sets out a realistic plan. No doubt there can be improvements as can be seen from the deliberations and contributions made by my colleagues, the PAP Backbench, have suggested and will be suggesting. But, Sir, the suggestions and comments must have cogent reasons behind them. The Member for Anson had, however, decided that the financial policy must be opposed and made a pathetic attempt to find points that he could attack.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his more tuan 45 minutes of verbosity, there was only one attempt by him, as I could discern, to support his argument by facts when he tried to show that the average NWC increase did not result in any increase in real income. But, Sir, unfortunately he came to grief because he does not seem to be able to add 2 and 2 and get 4.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he took the average NWC increase of 14% and deducted 4% CPF as if the CPF contributions were not the workers' money. This 4% belong to the workers which they have contributed. He then deducted further a cock-shy figure of 10% increase in food prices for the lower income group and then stated that it was possible that they suffered a cut in real wages. Sir, if a first year 'A' level student indulges in this kind of economic argument, he will find himself out of the class in double quick time. The hon. Member must remember, having been taught in school, that one cannot add apples to oranges. He has just mixed up apples,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> oranges, papayas and what-have-you and obtained not a fruit cocktail but a product, to use an euphemism, which if spread evenly on Parliament grounds will give a luxuriant growth of grass. My purpose in drawing attention to the Member's confusion is not to belittle him but to show the danger that he poses when he has absolutely no grasp of even simple economic concepts and yet he holds himself forth as one who can do a better job of managing the economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give yet another example of his confusion, he lamented the fact that workers have been penalized for job-hopping. Sir, does he not realize the difference between incentives and penalties? Of course, there are incentives for workers to stay in a job and if they job-hop, they lose these incentives - they lose certain privileges. This is how it should be. No one is prevented from job-hopping but it would be insane to expect that people should be encouraged to job-hop. The Member talked of the need to motivate workers. Is not the incentive to stay and become skilled in a job a method of motivation? The trouble with the Member is that his mind works in such strange and mysterious ways that even he cannot understand the meaning of his utterances.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member made much of the fact that his party was the first to use the phrase "a caring society". I do not have to tell hon. Members that this is not true. But even if it were true and his party first used the "caring society" slogan, what does it prove? Does the Member think that leading a nation and solving its problems is a matter of finding the right slogans? One does not solve problems by coining slogans. We in the PAP have leaders who cared enough to put their lives on the line from 1954 to lead this nation. Where was the Member for Anson when the communists and communalists were running loose?

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government's financial policy, has shown himself to be dangerously ignorant of what makes for our economic performance and success. If we follow him, far from having a caring society, we will have a scaring society. You are scared and you know what it is to be scared. There will be chaos in the nation and all that we have so painstakingly built up over the last 23 years, 1959 till now, since independence it is 17 years, will be destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Hon. Members</b> may be aware that in the Workers Party publication Towards a Caring Society on the subject of defence, the party states that in the present-day context of relations between nations, the present expenditure on defence is wasteful and unnecessary. It further states that the party sees the main threat to our society is from within and therefore advocates the maintenance of a regular army (not a National Service army that we now have but a regular army) to meet the threat to our society and to maintain peace. Sir, it is clear that somehow in a confused way the Member for Anson has arrived at the right conclusion. The conclusion is that if his economic policies are implemented, there will soon be such a mess that it will require the army to intervene to maintain law and order. Sir, I cannot think of a more certain prescription for the demise of our nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I would like to add my support to the Motion moved by the Hon. Minister for Trade and Industry.

  <b>Encik Saidi Haji Shariff (Kaki Bukit):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my colleagues, the PAP Members of Parliament who spoke yesterday and today in support of the Motion standing in the name of the Minister for Trade and Industry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am no economist and cannot adequately comment on the Budget Statement. But I dare say that the Minister has presented a kind and enlightened Budget which very few of us can quarrel with. The Budget Statement reflects the caring attitude of our Government and the great concern it has for the well-being of its citizens, the workers and management staff alike, the young and the old. He gave
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> a brief and concise description of the Singapore economy in 1981, without leaving any stone unturned. He clearly spelt out the Government's economic policy which he concluded with a message to Singaporeans that the Government will continue to govern firmly and fairly but we must pull up our socks if we want to avoid being dragged into the quagmire of economic stagnation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday two of my PAP colleagues who are prominent economics lecturers debated on the pros and cons of rapid economic growth. This gave me some insight and understanding of the formulation of economic policies. As a layman and non-economist, I believe that in our national development we should aim for achievement of political stability, economic growth, full employment and price stability so that we, the citizens, could hope and work for a reasonably decent and comfortable life, and seek opportunities to improve our quality of life. These four aims are closely related and interdependent of each other. There is, therefore, a need to set down priorities and strike a balance in our attempt to achieve all the four of them. What is crucial here is: who runs the Government? They must be men of upright character and conviction, and have the necessary qualities of leadership and are ready to discuss national issues frankly on the basis of facts, figures and reality, and not on baseless rumours. They must have the capacity and the courage to lead the people from one difficult period to another; and help them to help themselves towards improving a standard of living of their own, their families and children. There is need for the Government and the people to work together to achieve these objectives. There is no need for any opposition, if it is for opposition's sake, and use rumours to support its views.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your indulgence, Sir, let me illustrate my point further by drawing my experience of working for the last one year in a shipping company whose business is to transport cargo from one international port to another by ship in the most profitable manner possible without jeopardizing future expansion. In deciding to buy or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> construct a ship, there is need to consider the following: first, the size of the ship so that as much cargo or containers as possible can be carried; second, the shape or design of the ship that will enable it to float and move fast through the waves and reach its destination safely in time; third, the type of marine engine for the ship which will ensure low consumption of oil. There are obvious constraints to a maximum achievement of all the three factors mentioned. Hence, the need for some sacrifice of one in order to have some achievement of the other. The most important thing to consider is that the transportation of the cargo by the ship should be done efficiently and in the most profitable manner possible, no matter what the size, speed and oil consumption is. In the long run, it depends upon the effectiveness of the captain and his officers in leading the crew to steer the ship safely to its destination with its cargo intact despite bad weather and stormy seas. There is need for teamwork and close cooperation between the captain, his officers and crew. There is no place for any member of the crew to act as a rebel without cause, opposition for opposition's sake, but is still interested to join the rest in reaching the destination safely.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have enjoyed political stability for the last 16 years. This has made it possible for us to gain economic growth that generates employment opportunities for every citizen. The stability of prices is shaken considerably because of factors beyond our control. But what is important, in view of the gloomier years ahead, is to ensure that every citizen is equipped with an adequate capacity for employment in work of higher skills which will give higher wages to enable him or her to continue enjoying a higher standard of living. Therefore, we must continue to work hard to generate and sustain high economic growth at this opportune time and situation we are now in. At the same time, we must intensify consumer education among our people and take the necessary steps to combat inflation or control price stability. I appreciate the Chinese proverb quoted by the Member for Leng Kee that "A boat sailing against the current must forge ahead or else it will be driven
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> back". Let me add here a Malay pantun which I used to sing at campfires:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kapal kecil jangan dibelok
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kalau di belok patah tiangnya.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gadis kecil jangan di pelok
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kilau di pelok patah pinggangnya.
  <br>
  <br>Our small boat should not be turned around but must continue to sail forward no matter how bad the weather and strong the current is or else the mast will break and the boat will sink.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore support the Government's economic policy as stated by the Minister for Trade and Industry but may I make some comments on certain areas of the policy, budget and tax changes. Let me first of all praise our Government for the commendable performance of the Singapore economy in 1981 despite the depressing economic conditions of the world, particularly in the West. This has been possible because of the forward-looking policies of the Government in the seventies. Whatever modifications, changes and concessions which have been made to the policies are due to the contribution of constructive criticisms, opposing views and suggestions from the majority of our Backbench Members of this House who have always the interest of their citizen constituents at heart. If this has been going on very satisfactorily for the last 13 years, I see no reason why we need anyone here to act as the so-called opposition. There is need for continued political stability and there is need to prevent the emergence of irresponsible opposition in this Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower training and development has been pointed out as the key to our ability to sustain economic growth in the coming years to ensure employment of our people at higher wages. There is need for coordinated efforts by all Ministries and statutory boards in the public sector and companies/corporations in the private sector to adopt a comprehensive national approach in human resource development and management covering all sectors of our society. Facilities and opportunities for life-long education and training should be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> provided not only to upgrade our skills but also to better our academic qualifications and to enjoy life fruitfully, Workers should be grateful that the NTUC has prepared a comprehensive programme to help those who have missed the opportunity of a basic education. I notice that a sum of $6,849 million or about 55% of the total budget will be spent on development projects and $548 million of this development budget is allocated for the School and Junior College Building Programme, third phase development of the Kent Ridge Campus of NUS, new complex of NTI and expansion of the Ngee Ann Technical College. Our children can look forward to having the privilege of better opportunities and facilities for higher academic and professional qualifications at a cost which is highly subsidized by our Government. What about those adults, like myself, who have left school, worked and settled down but wish to improve their academic or gain professional qualifications? Is there a plan for the NUS to offer diploma or degree courses on a part-time basis to adult workers who can pursue their studies in the evenings or by correspondence?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies have seized the opportunity of the availability of the Skills Development Fund training grants to send their staff for training. To meet this demand, many agencies or training institutes have emerged or mushroomed in Singapore offering all kinds of training at exorbitant fees because they are conducted in posh hotels which provide sumptuous lunches and dinners to the participants. The lecturers are normally lecturers with a string of qualifications from overseas universities. I wonder if there is need to check and monitor the effectiveness of these training programmes or seminars conducted by these agencies, so that companies will get the kind of training they really require for their staff and that they will be granted SDF grants eventually. For this purpose, there is need for courses to be conducted for senior management staff of companies to help them understand what and how to plan their manpower development strategy. This will help to ensure that all workers at all levels from junior, middle
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> management executives and senior staff receive the necessary training required.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already present an increasing awareness of productivity among employers as a result of the thrust of the wage correction policy. This productivity awareness must be enhanced not only among workers on factory floors and offices but also among our people in their homes and students in schools. Let the concept of productivity be driven hard into the work-consciousness and philosophy of our people so as to ensure that at all times our products and services are of the highest standard. Automation and robotization will push further our drive for increased productivity but it must always be remembered that it is the people who make the organization or company tick. Hence, there is need for an effective personnel management approach being adopted by employers, including the Government. It is everyone's responsibility to develop a quality labour force in our natural resource-scarce Republic. It is important to stress that to achieve higher growth in our rate of productivity, we need to economize the use of labour, increase the supply of trained manpower, induce more people to join the labour force and give higher capital investment per worker. But I believe the most important factor to be considered seriously is human motivation at all levels, to increase output and strive for excellence. Apart from fostering team spirit, improving staff morale, implementing welfare schemes and incentive bonus payments, there is need to develop human relationship skills at all levels of the workforce in any organization. In view of the stress and strains of present-day living in an urban environment and a fast working pace, we need to develop a very informal and friendly social atmosphere where our people can live and work happily, and this goes a long way to motivating them to excel for higher output. Training in human relations should be part of our manpower training and development and it should be incorporated into our education system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now comment on the Budget itself. I fully agree with the three objectives which the Budget sets out to achieve. I wish to add that in addition to accelerating the public housing construction programmes to meet the rising demand for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> housing, we should include the social objective of upgrading and speeding up the process of community development towards the re-creation of a new community in the housing estates with stronger ties of friendship, a sense of belonging and a commitment to common destiny. There is need to develop in our people to respond readily and to rally cohesively in the face of hard and difficult times ahead and to cope with any crisis threatening their survival. For this consideration, there is probably a need to increase the allocation of funds for those ministries and statutory boards which are directly involved in community development and in providing community services. The future and survival of our Republic depends upon the success of our efforts to build a more cohesive society of people living in housing estates and who will be able to respond adequately in meeting hard times ahead and any serious crisis that may occur.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully appreciate the Government's move "not to levy any new taxes or raise the rates of existing taxes", and I support the rationale that "rates of income tax should never reach a level where they discourage hard work and stifle talent." Most people are now aware of the increasing PUB charges and I am sure they have, on their own, adopted various means to lower consumption. It is therefore long overdue that "tax should be levied on only those items in the PUB bill that vary according to consumption." There is need to enhance our people's, knowledge on how to save energy, particularly electricity, so that it becomes part of their life-style and hope that one day there is no need to levy a tax on PUB bills any longer. May I suggest that in order to get all residents indirectly involved and committed to the work of Residents' Committees, we should give them an opportunity to make monetary contributions to the RC fund or any community development project in their own estate and that this contribution be fully tax deductible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion standing in the name of the Minister for Trade and Industry.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Liew Kok Pun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Liew Kok Pun (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me begin by congratulating the Minister for Trade and Industry for having presented the Budget Statement. It is one which could be described as a no-pain-now-but-heavy-weather-ahead Budget. Singaporeans must be relieved to know that our economy is on an even, steady keel, despite the downturn in the world economy and a deepening world economic recession. Here, Sir, I would like the Member for Anson to note this important point. We have, as a nation with positive political leadership, sound economic planning and a disciplined workforce led by the NTUC, weathered several world economic storms and we have also chalked up impressive economic records over the last two decades. We have not been haunted by the spectre of unemployment that looms so large over many developed countries. However, we cannot afford to be complacent or contented with our past achievements simply because we have become so used to progress and affluence. What we have built up over the last 23 years through sheer hard work, grit and perseverance, can crumble overnight if we do not put in sustained efforts in our drive for greater productivity in all sectors of the economy. A country devoid of any resources other than its manpower can survive only if it has a rugged, resilient and resourceful people. They are also usually a people who have forged for themselves an intense and dynamic culture. There are ample examples in modern history to support this observation. The north-eastern Asian countries comprising South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong, despite their scarce resources and inhospitable geographical terrains, have been chalking up good economic progress. What makes a country tick is, therefore, the quality and calibre of its people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would therefore like to focus my response to the 1982 Budget Statement on the most crucial and critical factor in the restructuring of our economy upstream, It is also the most decisive element in the survival equation for Singapore. This factor is the quality of our workforce, the quality of our people. My contention is that we can build a higher-quality economy
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> only with higher-quality components. It is going to take more than physical investments to increase productivity. If this is so, we cannot afford to have manpower wastage in the labour force, much in the same way as we must minimize educational wastage in the education system. This point is significant in our labour-deficit economy, and it becomes increasingly crucial with a declining pool of indigenous workers caused by declining birth rates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1980 Census of Population of Singapore has outlined, among other things, the educational profile of our workforce. It has revealed that in 1980 Singaporeans were generally better educated than in 1970 and have enjoyed greater social mobility than before. However, it has also shown that we are still short of trained and qualified manpower because of the rapid expansion and diversification of our economy in the past decade. A startling feature that emerges from the Census Report is that we have more than half a million persons aged 10 years and above who were without any qualifications. Those with primary level qualifications accounted for 68%. The proportion, however, decreased with each higher level of qualification. The proportion with secondary and upper secondary qualifications declined to 19.1% and 8.8% respectively. Only 4.1% had tertiary qualifications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy is not going to move upstream and thrive unless there is a massive effort to upgrade our manpower at all levels. We have to embark on a planned programme to upgrade human skills. Workers who are not trained or who do not even have basic education remain part of the society. In the era of microprocessor technology and robots, what is to become of an unskilled, premature school leaver 20 years from now? To do nothing will be to create a social time-bomb.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human resource development is, therefore, the number one priority in the agenda of manpower and educational planners, personnel managers and teachers. Inputs into the labour market are from the education system. If there is a large number of premature school leavers who do not even have a good basic education with a minimum level of literacy, the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> quality of the workforce will be lowered. The problem of producing a higher-quality workforce must, therefore, be tackled at source, that is, in our schools. I shall take up this subject of how we can reduce educational wastage when we debate the Education budget tomorrow. If there is educational wastage in schools, there is also manpower wastage in the workplace. Manpower wastage is like a withered plant. If you take a plant, put it in the wrong type of soil and do not water or fertilize it, it will wither and die. In the same way, a worker may be given a job not suited to him. The work environment may deprive him of an opportunity to develop in his workplace; the management-style may stifle all his initiative. Each individual worker has an untapped potential in him which, in a labour-deficit economy, we cannot afford to ignore. Instead, we should find ways and means to maximize his potential. What is needed, therefore, is for us to formulate a recruitment-to-retirement plan for human resource development to maximize the contribution of each worker.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a manpower training and development plan for those in the labour force, I would urge the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Labour to initiate a comprehensive study of the training needs of major industries. Relevant training programmes can then be formulated and the training resources required to mount them provided. The sudden upsurge of interest in manpower training and development, triggered off by the restructuring of the economy and the collection of skills development levy by Government in 1979, has generated a great demand for different types of training courses, especially those relating to management and to computerization. In response to this demand, various training institutions, including the National Productivity Board and the NTUC, are stepping up their training programmes. There is, therefore, a pressing need for some form of coordination and planning in our efforts to provide for the continuing education of our workforce. In this respect, I would like to congratulate the Ministry of Labour for planning to set up an Institute for Continuing Occupational Development to retrain workers and upgrade their skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a mammoth task to cope with the demand for professional renewal or skills upgrading. There are simply not enough training facilities and trainers. A far more efficient delivery system, appropriate for adult learners, must be used to replace the traditional system of training. The traditional chalk-and-talk method of teaching in a classroom is ill-suited for adult learners. Moreover, it can train only a limited number of workers at any one time. We are now automating, mechanizing and computerizing our industries to bring about an increase in productivity. Surely we can think of a more productive delivery system of reaching out to more trainees at any one time. One of the more effective and efficient ways is through computer-assisted, self-paced learning which can even take place in the home or the work-place. The shortage of good effective trainers can then be compensated for by well-produced video-taped programmes which make use of the expertise of a master trainer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government should also consider the certification or accreditation of courses that can lead to the award of a professional qualification. Credit points can be given for the successful completion of a course and the accumulation of a certain number of credit points will qualify the worker for a recognized professional diploma. Other incentives for workers to upgrade themselves should be examined, including time-off for retraining. Giving time-off for workers to undergo retraining is not an unreasonable proposal. It is not uncommon for management staff to do so. A manager is expected to spend time reading, thinking and reflecting. He has to find more creative and innovative ways of managing his company. Sometimes he has even to take study leave for this purpose because it is recognized that doing so would benefit the company. In the same way, giving workers time-off for retraining will, in the long run, benefit the company. Management must be enlightened to see and apply the benefits of retraining within the work environment. Perhaps study room facilities and other training resources can be made available in the company for the benefit of our workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rapid obsolescence and the explosion of knowledge and technology, we can expect everyone to, need to undergo retraining several times throughout his working career. In the light of this, we can consider learning and retraining to be a life-long process. However, in the last analysis, I believe the onus of human resource development rests with management. No amount of training and retraining will benefit the company and the employee if management is unable to draw out the best from him. Management should provide both the motivation and the job enrichment to develop the employee to the fullest. What I am saying is that the key factor in human resource development is a management culture based on a sound philosophy of managing people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this note I support the Budget Statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Minister for Trade and Industry made his Budget Statement in this House on the 5th March this year, he said that in 1981 despite world economic recession and mounting unemployment in the Western countries, our economy achieved 9.9% growth. This is commendable indeed. The new financial budget provides $12.44 billion for expenditure. This is made up ,of $5.59 billion for recurrent expenditure and $6.85 billion for development expenditure. Our estimated revenue for the year is $7.64 billion. This alone is more than enough to meet our recurrent expenditure and there is a surplus of $2.05 billion to boost our development needs. On the resources estimates, the Development Fund will provide $1.74 billion, leaving a shortfall of $3.06 billion to be met by the Development Fund. As long as our annual revenue is enough to meet our recurrent expenditure, our economy will be in a sound state, because the development expenditure will bring more revenue when the various development projects are completed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we have achieved 9.9% growth in 1981, in 1982 we will have a surplus in our revenue to meet recurrent expendi-

Therefore, the Minister for Trade and Industry could, with justification, announce in his Budget Statement that for this year there will be no new taxes or any increase in existing taxes. There are only some minor adjustments in taxes with some concessions or marginal reductions. This shows that our economic policy has been correct, and what has been achieved has been the joint effort of our people. We should be glad about it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the end result of this adjustment in taxes with some concessions is that people in the middle and lower income groups do not actually benefit much, while those in the upper income group benefit more.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, I agree to the measure that compulsory CPF contributions should not be taxed just as the total CPF contributions withdrawn by a person on retirement at 55 years should not be taxed. But under the present CPF regulations the year-end bonus and other allowances are being taxed. However, there are some loopholes in the announcement that all CPF contributions will be tax free. Through manipulation, those with higher income will be able to pay less personal income tax. For instance, a person who is earning an income of $5,000 per month could arrange to draw $3,000 per month, thus paying a maximum CPF contribution of $660 per month, while the balance of $2,000 per month, totalling $24,000 for the year, will be drawn at the end of the year as bonus, for which he pays 22% totalling $5,280 as CPF contributions. This amount being tax free means that he could make $1,000 to $2,000 per year. In this way, those with higher incomes will be able to evade even more tax. Employees in the Government departments could not do so whereas in the private sector the people could arrange in such a way as to evade or escape payment of tax. This will result in a reduction in Government revenue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1979 estate duty exemption limit for a house was raised to a maximum of $200,000. This limit was further raised to $600,000 in 1981. The result is that the rich who could possess two or more houses with a total annual value of not more than $600,000 would stand to benefit, whereas those in the lower income group may not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have any dwelling worth such a large sum of money. So it is correct to plug this loophole. I would only agree with the principle that in land-scarce Singapore every family should be able to own a house for posterity as implemented through our home ownership scheme, and that such a property should be free from estate duty.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 70% of our population live in public flats. How can they benefit? They never aspire to live in a house costing hundreds of thousands of dollars which the rich can now better afford to possess or even excel. To these people who live in public housing and another 10% who are waiting for public flats, their only hope is that the Government will not increase the prices of flats by 30-odd per cent in one year, particularly when they are still waiting for allocation. Even the announced 10-odd percent increase in prices of flats annually hurt them sorely. They only hope that the Minister for National Development could build more houses so that they may be able to buy the cheapest possible flat with their CPF contributions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on 3rd March, the Minister for Trade and Industry announced in Parliament that the salaries of Administrative officers will be increased by 22 % to narrow the gap of 40% between their salaries and those of the executives and professionals in the private sector in order to curb brain drain. However, there are more than 60,000 civil servants whose salaries are much lower than their counterparts in the private sector. Their salaries should likewise be adjusted from 1st April, 1982 so that the Government departments would not be functioning with only the head without any limbs to support.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the low morale of the subordinate civil servants, how are we to encourage team spirit and to increase productivity? No wonder the people in the middle and lower income groups comment that what the Government announced earlier this month is only adding wealth to the rich and is not giving assistance to the needy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the global economic recession, we in Singapore enjoy political stability. We have excellent facilities in trans-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> portation and communications and other services. We have able and trainable technicians and craftsmen with suitable education. In 1981, the total investments was $1.9 billion. It is also heartening to know that 32% of the $1.9 billion, or $610 million comes from local capital. This is a record and a highly commendable achievement. This goes to show that we do have enough capital from local sources and that we have now built up in the commercial and industrial sectors stronger confidence and better recognition in our industrialization programme. From the Economic Survey, we note that in 1979 local investments were only $120 million, being $12.7% of the total investment, while in 1980 it rose to $226 million, being 14.4% of the total, Last year it was as high as $610 million. This is a vast improvement over investments in the 1970s.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to encourage our local entrepreneurs to industrialize. The EDB and other Government agencies should also attach some importance to our local investors, instead of focusing all their attention on larger foreign investors. They should also find some way to encourage local industries to go into joint ventures with foreign investors so that we would be able to absorb their experience in production, technology, management and marketing. We must realize that local capital is important in our long-term industrial plan and needs protection.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No advanced industrialists will invest in Singapore simply because we are a beautiful garden city. They do their calculations. They will study the various tax concessions available and whether the investment climate is favourable to them. They must make sure that their investments are well secured and profitable before coming here to set up factory and start production. In the meantime, our neighbouring countries are also moving towards industrialization. They are also trying their best to attract foreign investment by offering all sorts of tax concessions and establishing a favourable investment climate. These foreign industries, as pioneer industries, are now enjoying a five-year tax holiday here. Therefore, to take full advantage of the tax holiday, these industries keep working day and night to increase their production so
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> as to make as much money as they can, but once the five-year period is up, they will probably leave for other places which can offer them better terms. Only our local industries will remain and be rooted in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the Economic Survey, although our foreign trade in 1981 was over $10.2 billion, the growth was only 10%, whereas in 1980 the growth was 34% and in 1979 it was 32%. What a big contrast. It goes to show that our foreign trade is slackening. Perhaps, this is due to the fact that in 1981 the United States and Western European countries were facing economic recession. Their factories had closed down and many people were unemployed and they tightened their policy of protectionism. Domestically, we were affected by unfavourable factors, such as the appreciation of the strength of our currency and the rise in our bank interest. However, we should not be discouraged because of these setbacks. Our Trade Department should establish more offices overseas at important centres to collect trade data and introduce our local products to the foreign importers through trade expositions and also to introduce our trade delegations to meet the importers of the foreign countries so that our products could be marketed there. Take, for example, Japan. When they feel that their own productions are priced beyond competition, they would use their trade offices in the various major cities in the world to look for cheap industrial products from Western countries. They would buy the products and sell them to other consumer countries so as to gain a lot of foreign exchange for their country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our National Productivity Board should also conduct courses in international market survey and management so that we could cultivate our marketing talents to help our industrial products to gain entry into more foreign markets, and thus help our country to gain more foreign exchange and increase our economic fibre.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the last decade the Economic Development Board has been doing a great job in attracting foreign
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> investments to our country. However, they seem to have neglected the smaller manufacturers and enterprises in Singapore who are suffering heavy losses or meeting with great difficulties. Under our open economic policy, many multi-national corporations have set up factories and offices in Singapore. With the setting up of these factories and offices, they have also brought in a good number of medium and small trading and service companies. These trading and service companies are backed by the factories here. They are also enjoying certain incentives from the Government and the financial aid of their national banks. They are virtually like tigers with wings. They have strong capital and very advanced management know-how. They came here fully prepared and very soon many of our local traders and agencies here would be overcome by them. So long as these foreign companies know that they can make a profit in Singapore, they will set up offices here and take over the agency rights from our local traders and agents, so that all the hard work of our local traders and agents over the years are lost and they will suffer great losses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the sake of industrialization and our survival, we welcome more foreign investments into Singapore to help us industrialize and give our youths more employment opportunities as well as to impart to us more advanced technology from the more industrialized countries. This is a move in the right direction. But we have to take note that these foreign companies are competing with our local traders for the same type of business, thus undermining the interests of local traders, although it makes no apparent difference to our national trading system because foreign companies also have to pay 40% company tax. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, the question is whether these foreign companies operating in Singapore are really paying taxes on their profits? Are they paying taxes to our Government? This is a big question. When many of these foreign companies make a profit here, they send down their own personnel to become Deputy General Managers or departmental heads and paying them big salaries, overseas allowance, car allowance,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> housing allowance, personal allowance amounting to $10,000-$20,000 per month, when indeed most of the work is done by the local people. And the so-called Deputy General Managers or departmental heads spend their time on the golf course playing golf, the most expensive game. If these companies make further profit, they will arrange with their parent companies abroad to make expensive purchases from them. Some of these items are so expensive that it is hard to believe. They will open letters of credit through their national banks, thus channelling the profits made in Singapore into their parent companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we want to learn the technology and production methods of the more advanced and industrialized countries and emulate the good examples and practices in their management, etc., we should also look at the other more seamy side of the coin and try to foster and protect our local investors and enterprises so that their investment growth can keep pace with our economic growth. This is our duty so that they will not be at a disadvantage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic reports and forecasts from the various countries conclude that 1982 is a more difficult year for the world economy - the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and other Western industrialized countries are faced with mounting unemployment and economic stagnation or depression. Even Japan reports a great drop in their overseas trade in the last quarter. Thus for the first time in seven years Japan will not be able to achieve the targeted growth of 4.1% for the fiscal year up to 31st March. Faced with this difficult economic situation, it is difficult for us to expect another near 10% economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not rest on our laurels of our past achievements and be complacent. On the contrary, we should pull up our socks and prepare for rainy days. We should brace ourselves up, work together, make concerted efforts in order to brave the stormy seas. If we can sink or swim together, we will be able to weather the storms ahead and we will b? forging forward according to our charted course in our task of economic construction and nation building.

  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to share the sentiments as expressed by the Member for Ang Mo Kio in regard to salary revision for the Administrative and Professional Services in the Singapore Government service. The Minister has proposed that the salaries of the Administrative and Professional officers in the Singapore Government service be revised since their emoluments are much less than their counter-parts in the private sector. It is said that if Labour is worthy of hire, his wages must be commensurate with his duties and responsibilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to my query the Minister stated that a similar study will be made for the rest of the civil service. I am astonished, however, that the Minister has singled out a small category of public employees for priority for this remedial measure, He has chosen to treat as second class employees the other thousands in Government 'Service who are also performing equally important duties and shouldering responsibilities at different levels.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unlike the private sector which is made up of thousands of individual businesses and organizations, the Government is like a massive machine. Its employees at different levels are all parts of this machine. If any part of this massive machine is defective, then the whole machine or organization is affected, and I need only to make reference to the famous poem about how a war was lost for want of a horseshoe nail.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past few years, political leaders, management experts and academicians have been pounding away on the concept of teamwork for efficiency and higher productivity. Teamwork has been declared as the essence of operational cooperation and increased productivity. This requirement has been rammed down the workers' throats week after week and month after month. They have been asked to respond at functions as members of a team so as to enable management to achieve productivity goals. It has been stressed that team-work and the resultant higher productivity are essential for our survival.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that the Minister has allowed the impression to be created that he is more concerned with nurturing only the top civil servants and that he is prepared to reward them with higher salaries and other benefits while the majority of the Government employees are treated as aliens who have to wait indefinitely while the top civil servants condescend to look into their plight. It is illogical for the Government to exhort and preach to the workers the spirit of teamwork while it treats the same members of the team in a different way. These employees are more badly affected by inflation and the high cost of living. They deserve improved salaries and conditions of service even before the already well-paid Government servants get better terms.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was extremely gratified at the Minister's response to the Member for Moulmein's suggestion that civil servants should be given a 14th month interim bonus payment while the Government studies whether it should remove the one month ceiling of such payments. The Minister's reply that he would pass the suggestion to the Finance Minister, of whom he is confident would consider it seriously, is most encouraging. Sir, there does not appear to be any reason why the Government cannot pay a 14th month bonus. Some Government trading organizations have made massive profits over the years. The Port of Singapore Authority, for example, made a profit of more than $200 million last year; and there is no reason why its employees should not share in the profit which was, in part, a result of their own higher productivity. This 14th month payment will be a special benefit to the lower income employees who find it difficult to make ends meet because of the present high cost of living.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget proposals of the Minister for Finance have been generally welcomed by the articulate and have been described in the press as a "breather" budget. The Minister himself noted that, and I quote:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I hope that Singaporeans will not look on this Budget as an occasion for rejoicing but rather as a respite to enable them to consolidate and improve their position'.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask: to whom was the Minister addressing when he said this? Was he speaking to the majority of the people in Singapore? Or was he addressing a small minority - the elite, those with high incomes?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are generally five tax concessions, but in the ultimate analysis the three major concessions are obviously meant for the wealthier people, while the other two, which concern the public at large, are minimal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concession relates to the removal of the $5,000 tax exemption ceiling on CPF contributions. Mr Speaker, Sir, how many people in Singapore have incomes which result in CPF contributions exceeding $5,000 per year? The number is comparatively small.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Hear, hear!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> The majority of the workers in Singapore will not benefit from this tax concession. It is clear that this concession will benefit those with high income; the higher income the greater the benefit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concession relates to raising the estate duty exemption limit for one residential property from $600,000 to the full value of the property. Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask: for whose benefit is this exemption? Already 75% of our citizens live in HDB flats and soon the figure will be 85%. It is clear that none of these flats are worth anything near half a million dollars, let alone one million dollars.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for whom is the tax concession made? Certainly not the workers. It would seem to be for the elite - the small percentage who can afford to live in large bungalows or luxury flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third concession relates to the total exemption of CPF balances from estate duty. It is difficult to believe that this concession gives any major benefit to the working class, because workers use a large part of their CPF to buy HDB flats. When they retire, their balances with the CPF will be so small that they will attract only minimal estate duty. The obvious inference then, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that this tax concession is for the benefit of those
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> who do not live in HDB flats, in other words the better-off members of our community who own luxury flats, bungalows and semi-detached houses, etc.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concession by way of the removal of the 10% tax on fixed charges in PUB bills for domestic refuse, etc, if computed in dollars and cents, is clearly minimal. And it may well be asked: why were these taxes introduced in the first place?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax relief for those who support their aged parents whose incomes do not exceed $1,500 per year is also illusionary. The relief has been increased from $750 per annum to $1,000; in other words by about $20 per month, and at the present time of high living costs the concession makes a mockery of the concept of filial piety.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know if any one of our decision-makers, be he a top-echelon civil servant, politician or manager, has tried to live on $1,500 per year and whether he will agree that $20 per month will take care of the impact of inflation!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the one hand the Government pontificates Confucian ethics and urges the younger generation to take greater care of their aged parents and senior citizens. On the other hand, the Government gives very little tangible encouragement to those who wish to do so. Responsibility for parents is part of Asian culture and such virtues ought to be fostered by visible support from the Government. The impression, unfortunately, is being created that the Government is only paying lip service to this worthy tradition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would urge that the Government should be more concerned about bread and buffer issues which affect the ordinary people, ordinary people who comprise the majority in Singapore. It is a source of great amusement to the workers of Singapore to be told that they are not so badly off financially, because last year inflation was not so bad and the high cost of living is progressively going down. I do not know where the Minister gets his facts, but if he really believes that the high cost of living is going down, he ought to have a talk with the working class, people who can hardly make ends meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government has a good track record since it came to power in 1959. It is committed to certain goals and it has kept its promises of 1959, It has provided housing, education and equal opportunities and employment, higher incomes, a better quality of life, etc. Very few developing countries can boast of such progress, but let us not lose sight of our ideals and objectives, and what we stand for.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding my criticism, I would like to assure the Minister for Trade and Industry that the Budget will get my wholehearted support.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr M.K.A. Jabbar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr M.K.A. Jabbar (Radin Mas)</b>(
  <i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank, through you, the Hon. Minister for Trade and Industry for presenting the 1982 Budget in such a cogent way that everyone can understand the financial policy of the Government. When I spoke on last year's Budget, I stated that the PAP is a democratic socialist movement. Proof of this can be found in the records of this House. I wish to emphasize the same fact once again this year. I can cite statistics to prove this from the time of colonial rule and the previous governments. We do not have to beg from others. From the period of British rule and the previous governments, I can give statistics to prove that we have achieved 23 years of political development. And our country has achieved progress in many areas. But people in some quarters are hiding the truth and are asking whether he PAP Government is a socialist Government. I wish to cite some examples.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since some of my colleagues wish to peak, I shall make my points brief. I read in the newspapers that the Hon. Prime
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Minister of Malaysia, Dr Mahathir Mohd, has said that his country will benefit by learning from its neighbouring country, Singapore, how its administration has developed, rather than learn from other foreign countries. That being so, we can see the progress our people have made under PAP rule, Everyone can see the leadership qualities of the PAP and the hard work the PAP has put in.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in some countries around us, we can see guided military rule by military officers. One can see some governments plagued by riots and communal unrest. Further, we can also see despotic officers seeking revenge against one another. We can also see some governments suppressing the real aspirations of trade unions while claiming that they are true socialists. But we are the real socialist Government. We are the true socialist movement. Since our country is small, with no natural resources, we are wholly dependent on our human resources. Chinese, Malays, Indians and Eurasians live in harmony, without any prejudice, calling themselves Singaporeans. Happiness in this country is permanent. The PAP has helped to achieve this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to cite another example. Though Singapore is small amidst major world powers, the people of the world have complete faith in our leadership. That is why Professor Tommy Koh has been appointed Chairman of the international Law of the Sea Conference. He has taken the great responsibility of uniting the various nations. Does this not show that we are socialists?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have seen communal, racial and religious riots in many democratic countries in the world. Even children and infants have been killed in many countries. They are living in misery. But in our country we have prevented these events from happening.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government has formed Residents' Committees, the Citizens Consultative Committees, community centres and Meet-the-people sessions. Were they not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> created by the PAP Government? Nobody can deny that the PAP has achieved this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday in this House, the Hon. Member for Anson touched on the NTUC. As I am a trade unionist involved in this organization, I wish to give my views. We have great faith in the Minister for Trade and Industry and his officials. Before the Minister prepared the Budget Statement, he invited representatives of the NTUC and its affiliates to discuss and give their views on the Budget. We are indebted to him for this. The National Trades Union Congress dedicates itself to the growth and progress of our Republic. The trade union movement is an important movement in Singapore. Through tripartite cooperation, it has set an example for industrial peace. The National Trades Union Congress has done, and always will do, things in the interest of the nation at heart. Through its many stalwarts, the Labour movement has helped to achieve progress. We can see it in this House. For example, the experienced Mr Ho See Beng, Mr Seah Mui Kok, Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee, Mr Sia Khoon Seong are Members of Parliament. They are given the opportunity to voice their views. Being Members of this House, nobody can deny that they are able to voice the views of the workers. People know that their views are heard in this House. One person from the National Trades Union Congress is a Minister without portfolio. This was mentioned yesterday.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workforce itself is indebted to the Government for appointing a trade unionist as Minister. We are proud and consider it a boon to have a trade unionist as a Minister. We thank the Government for this. But the Member for Anson, without reason, seems to criticize this. This has hurt the feelings of the workers of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NWC recommendations were made in the national interest and with economic growth in mind. I think these recommendations make very good guidelines for wage increases. This is my view. If these recommendations are legislated as some want it to be, certain capitalists may be dissatisfied and pull their investments out from our country.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some managements have made some mistakes, and because of this, some people say that the second tier Nwc recommendations have not been implemented properly. So certain people have been disillusioned by this. Having the national interest at heart, Ministers should rectify the position. The cooperation of workers and management should be enhanced by this. The sorrows of the daily-rated public employees have been brought up by my colleagues here. They should be given better living standards. But one more point I wish to bring up is that, once the NWC recommendations are announced, hawkers quickly jack up their prices. But some workers do not get the NWC wage increases. As some say, the hawkers do not understand that not every worker benefits from the NWC recommendations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Anson supported job-hopping. I do not support it. Job-hopping is something we should not allow. It may cause many problems. Some workers have job-hopped because they want to get more money. But this affects the discipline among the workforce and that is the reason why job-hopping is not encouraged. Therefore, we should not allow job-hoppers to use Singapore as a training ground.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NWC recommendations should remain as it is and should not be legislated. The Government should approach other institutions and get their guidelines regarding the NWC recommendations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government has conducted religious knowledge classes to promote honesty and discipline among students. All the religions in Singapore support this move, but at the same time there are some shortcomings about which some races are not happy, and I wish to bring them to the notice of the Minister. It is thought that all Muslims have to learn religious knowledge in the Malay language, but there are Muslims, Christians and Hindus of Indian origin who wish to study religious knowledge in the Tamil language. I think this request should be given consideration. Since the Government's policy is to give equal status to all the four languages, the people feel that the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government should do something to strengthen that policy. I know that problems may arise both in the classroom and among the teachers in the teaching of this subject, but I believe that there will be cooperation if something is done to fulfil their desires.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs should be praised for taking some bold action. Recent arrests made by the Ministry has some importance. It took two raids to stop the plan for terrorism, sabotage, murder, robbery, arson, assassination of political leaders and overthrowing the Government with the assistance of foreign aid. These courageous actions should" be commended. The arrest of Zainal Abidin and his group was given great publicity over television. The opinion of many people is that such elements who are involved in subversive activities should be referred to as "anti-nationals" and should not be referred to by their race or religion. Indian Muslims in Singapore or the Malays do not lend any support to this kind of activity. It is better that no reference is made to religion or race. My appeal is that I hope better forms of publicity for such future events could be found so that we can create a better and progressive nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Ministry of National Development, I wish to comment that the old one-room rented flats have no proper facilities to dispose of their rubbish. I agree that those living on the upper floors must not cause any nuisance to those on the floors below when disposing of their refuse. But the HDB does not know that some of the rented one-room flats on the lower floors have not been provided with sufficient facilities for the disposal of rubbish. The Ministry and its officials should look into this problem. Where are they going to dispose of their rubbish?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to bring another point to the attention of the Ministry of National Development. Under the rules of the HDB, if the family income of husband and wife is $620 per month they do not qualify for rented flats. However, they may purchase a flat. In order to qualify for a rented flat, either the husband or the wife has to resign. By resigning, they would get a smaller income and thereby qualify to rent a smaller flat. Will the Minister raise the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> income ceiling to avoid this kind of a situation? If he does, I can assure him that those in the lower income group and the poor people would be most grateful to him. For example, how can a couple, who are hawkers by occupation and therefore have no CPF savings, be able to purchase HDB flats? I humbly request that the $500 income ceiling should be raised so that some of these people would be able to rent flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for Trade and Industry for his 1982 budget. I thank you for allowing me this opportunity to speak and also may I say that I support the Motion in the name of the Minister. I repeat that only through the PAP will our country be prosperous.

  <!-- Dr Chau Sik Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Chau Sik Ting (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join hon. Members of this House in congratulating the Minister for Trade and Industry for presenting a painless Budget Statement which has drawn up an economic development strategy for the 80's.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower, with capital and land, are the three basic factors of production. The cost of repair of many items in the nature of capital investment, such as plant and machinery, fixtures or premises, are allowable as tax deductible expenses incurred in the production of income. The irony is: whilst the cost of repair of machinery, fixtures and premises is allowed tax relief, the cost of servicing and repairing the human body as the basic factor of manpower is disallowed. The cost of repairing the human body could be in the form of hospitalization or outpatient charges. For hospitalization, and I stress hospitalization only, the charges can be extremely high, particularly if the stay is for a prolonged period or the hospitalization involves complicated surgery or other medical procedures. It would seem a good idea to also allow hospitalization charges to be tax deductible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, hospitalization charges for the public sector employees
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are being taken care of by the Government. However, they still have to pay 20% and 50% of the ward charges, respectively, for themselves and their families. In the private sector those who are in the employ of companies are to a certain extent also being covered by their employers. Again, this is not to the full extent but subject to certain limits. There is yet a third group of people in the private sector, namely, those who are self-employed. They have to pay fully for their hospitalization charges. Would it not be fair also to allow hospitalization expenses for curative purposes for this group of people to be tax deductible?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we welcome the tax concession in respect of the care of aged parents as provided in the Budget Statement but it is far from adequate. Much emphasis has been given of late to encourage the three-generation family. As such, there will be an increasing number of people who have to take care of their aged parents. Should these aged parents incur hospitalization expenses, it would be an added incentive to our young working population to support their aged parents if tax relief can be claimed for hospitalization expenses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I would like to make is that, in the matter of tax relief, due emphasis must be given to the promotion of the physical well-being of human resource. Whilst for the care of the aged, such a tax relief will constitute another incentive for our young working population to look after their aged parents. This move will be in line with our Government's policy to foster closer family ties in a three-generation or even a four-generation family and, in rare cases, a five-generation family.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This added tax relief hopefully may also influence patients to seek treatment in private hospitals, thus relieving the pressure on our public hospitals. Sir, in making this proposal, two questions came to my mind. First, can we afford such a tax relief? I think the answer is yes. Secondly, will there be, as a result, an increased consumption of our hospital services? The answer is no. Certainly Singaporeans, or for that matter Asians in general, do not look forward to hospitalization. It is something to be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> avoided. Moreover, even with this tax relief, a taxpayer in the 20% tax bracket, for example, still has to pay for the bulk of the hospital bills, i.e. 80%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that there will be difficulties with implementation but such difficulties should not preclude consideration of this proposal. Rather they should be successfully overcome as this Government has done with almost all the difficulties ii has been confronted with.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are able to have such a painless budget together with several tax concessions because our people have worked hard under an able leadership to build a strong economy. With more hard work and further upgrading of skills, we will have a sustained economic growth and a healthier state of finance such that the Hon. Minister would in due course consider this proposal of individual tax relief for hospitalization expenses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement.
  <br>5.45 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Boon Heng (Kebun Baru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the duty of an elected government to bring about a better life for the people. For over two decades, this Government has continually sought a higher standard of living for each and every citizen. The results of its actions are visible, tangible and measurable. 70% of our population live in decent low cost HDB flats. There is a place in school for every child, Everyone who wants to work has a choice of jobs; there is no unemployment. Real incomes have steadily increased. Our workers can afford luxury items as they enjoy a higher standard of living.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who aspire to form the government would do well to study how this has been achieved, rather than engage in rhetoric. Words alone do not create wealth; action does. The result of this Government's actions is a matter of public record. Only a confused mind with a ragged vision and distorted arithmetic can fail to see the social and economic progress of our people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity that the democratic system occasionally throws up aberrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Aberrations notwithstanding, we will continue to pursue a yet higher standard of living for the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are willing to listen critically, the Budget Statement by the Minister for Trade and Industry is a statement of concern for the continued well-being of Singaporeans. The restructuring of our economy is essential to free us from the bind of low-wage industries and to allow us to maximize the potential of our workforce. Higher incomes are linked to higher output through higher skills.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Trade and Industry has stressed once more that manpower training and development is a decisive factor in the restructuring of our economy and in achieving the objective of a higher-skilled and better paid workforce. This year, the first of three objectives of the Budget is to increase the supply of skilled, technical and professional manpower needed to facilitate the restructuring and upgrading of the economy.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting this, the provision for the Ministry of Education has been increased substantially by 45.6% over fiscal year 1981. This expenditure will provide more opportunities for those who are still in school through more places being created in the tertiary, vocational and training institutions. This investment will result in a better qualified younger workforce. We must ensure the highest return from this investment by ensuring that the curricula of courses conducted by these institutions are updated in order to equip the students with the knowledge and skills relevant to the technologies of the 1980's and beyond, The curricula must have a general base to enable the graduates to apply their knowledge in different sectors of industry and to build on what they are taught. We must recognize that the pace of technological advancement is so rapid that no one can assume that the knowledge or skill acquired in our educational institutions will be adequate for a life-time career. We must impress on our students that it is necessary to constantly upgrade their knowledge and skills, to keep abreast with
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the latest technological advancement. Failure to do so is to risk technological obsolescence. When our students leave the training institutions with the right attitude towards knowledge and skills, they will be able to adapt to the continual upgrading and restructuring of our economy as we seek yet higher levels of achievement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the investments now made for the education of the younger generation, we expect that those entering the job market for the first time will have little difficulty provided we are able to attract investments with higher technological content.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those already in the workforce, the problems and prospects are somewhat different. Their ability to cope with the technological content of the new types of jobs in a restructured economy will be constrained by the education that they have received and the training that they may have been provided by their employers. We must be concerned that the educational level of our present workforce is relatively poor. According to the Report on the Labour Force Survey of Singapore 1980, 11.3% of the workforce have never attended school, 13.8% have no qualifications (below PSLE) and 32.6% attained primary education only. Therefore, no less than 57.7% of our workforce have primary education or less. How will these workers be able to adapt to higher technologies? We can help them make the change by providing them with another opportunity to acquire a basic education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers should play a leading role. More companies should be encouraged to follow the examples set by Telecoms and the Port of Singapore Authority in providing training opportunities to those who have unfortunately missed a basic education. This is one of the best ways to foster company loyalty. Unfortunately, training is not generally included as an integral part of company corporate policy. True, there are employers who do provide comprehensive training and have co-operated with Government or EDB institutions. The majority, however, have no manpower development plans. This is the primary
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cause of the low utilization of the Skills Development Fund.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite typical for a new employee to be given a brief and cursory introduction or training programme before he is put on the job. Thereafter he is expected to pick up as he works. Our employers do not seem to realize that this practice is wasteful and an inefficient utilization of manpower. It is important for employers to look at continual training as a means to obtain the best out of the workforce. When training becomes a pan of corporate policy, there will be a positive improvement in work attitudes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to note that there are plans to upgrade the skills of existing workers on a wider scale through the establishment of an Institute of Continuing Occupational Development. I hope the Minister will take this opportunity to elaborate on these plans, with particular reference to the following points:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Will the Institute carry out a study on manpower requirements, and will the projected demand for specific types of skills be made known? Such a projection would greatly assist those in the workforce to pursue relevant courses in upgrading their skills.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Will the Institute provide a range of courses tailored for workers of different educational levels?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What provisions will be made to facilitate attendance by existing workers who would at the same time have to continue to support their families? Will the problems of shift workers also be taken into account?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) As there is an inherent anxiety among older workers over their ability to acquire new skills, will the Institute give this category of workers special attention? Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since manpower training and development is a decisive factor in the restructuring of our economy for a higher skilled and better paid workforce, it is important that the Institute of Continuing Occupational Development be established as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Motion.

  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Bernard Chen (Clementi):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in his annual Budget Statement, the Minister for Trade and Industry made the following reference, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'One recurring feature of Budget statements in recent years is that each year the statement has warned of difficult times ahead, and each year our economy has grown strongly.'
  <br>
  <br>Hon. Members of this House will recall that year in and year out the Finance Minister, and of late the Minister for Trade and Industry, came into this Chamber and painted gloomy pictures of worrying times ahead but yet concluded that Singapore had after all survived and had another good year, Singaporeans seem to get used to painless budgets and forgetting that this happy state of affairs has not been brought about by accident.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, underpinning this happy state of affairs are three major long-term economic policies which the Government has embarked upon since early independence. The first of these is economic diversification. Since the 1960s the Government has consciously and deliberately decided to widen the economic base and venture into industrialization, tourism, provide a range of services in finance, transport, communications, services which our workforce can provide better than the others. Economic diversification gives us the strength to withstand the ups and downs of the world economy. It helps us to weather the storms, be they in the United States, Europe or Japan. It created job opportunities for us, for all Singaporeans, and most important, to minimize retrenchment in different sectors affected at various times, as jobs which became surplus in these sectors were absorbed by those which were having boom conditions. Economic diversification has contributed to overall improvement in the growth of our Gross Domestic Product and therefore increasing the size of our economic cake. It is a matter of maximizing our growth potentials and not only to either grow at the specific rate or to grow at a high rate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, throughout the years, in response to world changes, the Government has also actively pursued a policy of economic upgrading and in the last several years a restructuring of the economic base. We have begun to swing away from
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> labour-intensive to capital-intensive industries, from low skills to high technology industries. This economic transformation, including upgrading and restructuring, will get us away from protectionism in precisely those industries that we have been carrying in the 60's and 70's. It enables us to open new and more stable markets for our high technology products which make fuller use of the skills of our people. Most important, it makes the best use of our limited labour supply by providing employment which will optimize individual skills and upgrade their potentials in order to enjoy a higher income.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, and this is an invisible process as opposed to economic diversification and economic upgrading, is the Government's relentless pursuit to inculcate a proper work attitude and the need for high productivity amongst our workforce to support the major economic strategies necessary because of the structural changes not only in Singapore but, more important, in the industrial world. The workers, as a consequence, have responded in full measure to the Government's policies, especially in the last three years when all of us had to go through a difficult period of adjustment in keeping with the wage correction policy outlined by the Minister in his Statement, It has also generated a full tripartite coordination amongst Government, employers and our workers, supported by the unions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question arises as to what would have happened if these policies had not been effected or that the ingredients were not present to ensure the success of these policies. The Singapore economy would have swung like a yo-yo together with the world. If the world recesses, we would also recess. If the world booms, we will boom together with the inflation. The long-term effect is that we will be priced out of the international market because of our limited labour supply and low skilled products with which we cannot fully compete with our neighbouring countries where human resources are more abundant. If our economic growth cannot be sustained, the economic cake will shrink and we will no longer be in the happy situation of talking about providing 4- or 5-room flats for our citizens. We would be hard pressed
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to build one-room flats. We can forget about social programmes on which so many Members of the House have been talking about. In short, we would have been in dire circumstances indeed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event, Singapore succeeded because the Government has been able to adopt a far-sighted perspective or the prospects for Singapore, especially in being able to read danger signals way ahead of time. This has been backed up by an equally enthusiastic response from our people who have placed their trust and confidence in the Government in the hope that with the long-term policies that have been suggested for implementation, if they are a little more patient, in the end all Singaporeans will benefit. This trust and confidence in the PAP Government has been more than reciprocated by the PAP Government, as evidenced by the return of the PAP Government to Parliament ever since independence. Much more important also is the fact that both Government and the people are prepared to face difficult problems, unpleasant at times, painful at times, and that both Government and the people are flexible enough to change with the world-changing circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lessons of the last 15 years have taught us that never should we assume that economic prosperity and, in its wake, social progress comes by accident, like "manna from heaven", as the Bible says, free for the asking. We should all bear in mind that the economic success and social advancement in Singapore has been brought about by deliberate, painstaking efforts in planning, in keeping people informed and in putting confidence in them in their ability to perform. It is a total sum game in which the Government and the people together determine for themselves the destiny that they hope one day they and their children will enjoy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future economic prospects in the 1980's, apart from those painted by the Minister in his Budget Statement, are all too plain for us to see. Those of us who read international newspapers will know that the world is on the brink of a severe recession and the situation is likely to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> deteriorate. Singapore, as usual, is not sheltered from this. But the policies that we have in the past would stand us in good stead. All we need is to make sure that the three basic ingredients that we have put into the enlarged economic cake will continue to be in ample supply. First, the ability of our Government leaders to read danger signs and prepare ourselves accordingly: Second, our people should continue to place their trust and confidence in the Government, something which they have done in the last 17 years, and to respond by puffing their shoulders to the wheel, to work hard and to improve their work attitude. And more important, the third ingredient, to be ready to accept short-term sacrifices in return for long-term gains for themselves and for their children. With these ingredients there is no question that our economic cake will get bigger and bigger and then all citizens will be able to take a bigger share in the fruits of their labour.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to join all the PAP colleagues in giving my full support to the Minister for Trade and Industry for presenting his annual financial policy for the coming year.
  <br>6.08 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I should, first of all, like to thank hon. Members for their generous compliments and for the interest which they have shown in the Budget. Judging from the numerous comments and suggestions which have been made in this House over the last two days, Backbenchers must have gone through the Budget with a fine tooth-comb.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have brought up points or questions which lie more properly within the province of particular Ministries. Such matters do not strictly belong to a debate on the financial policy of the Government and I shall deal with them only in so far as they impinge on Government's general policy. I hope that Members will raise these questions or comments again at the appropriate time in the Committee of Supply, when I am sure my colleagues in the Cabinet will be pleased to answer them in detail.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For convenience, I shall divide my answers into two parts. The first part will deal with the economic policy of the Government and related issues. The second will deal with the taxation policy of the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Alexandra mentioned that some businessmen had expressed disappointment with the Budget because they had apparently expected more incentives or concessions to stimulate business, and he wondered if I had considered the views and suggestions, which were made to me during my pre-Budget discussions, to be, as he said, not very appropriate. In general, I found the discussions to be useful in that it enabled me and my officials to obtain direct feedback from the sectors concerned. Incidentally, to dispel any doubt on the part of the Member for Anson, I did not meet only with the Secretary-General of the NTUC. The NTUC delegation comprised union leaders and representatives who had direct contact with the workers in the factories and on the shopfloor. As might be expected, much of the discussion at these meetings did not relate specifically to tax changes but were concerned with the general business and social environment and issues which were of importance to each particular group.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some suggestions, for example, reduction in corporate tax, had a venerable history. I am sure that they must have been put forward year after year to successive Ministers who have been in charge of the Budget. The difficulty, of course, is that if we reduce corporate tax we will have to finance Government expenditure by raising income tax which, I am sure, would be unpopular with Members and their constituents. And if we do not raise income tax, then Government can only obtain adequate revenue to finance its expenditure by pushing up property prices and thereby profiting from the high premium on Government land sales, as in the case in Hong Kong. Again, this has its economic disadvantages. On the whole I am of the opinion that our rate of corporate tax at 40% is reasonable and is not unduly onerous to business. The tax burden on companies in Singapore is among the lowest of the countries in this region. Where
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> certain sectors of our economy require special assistance, we have a range of tax incentives and concessions, for example, accelerated depreciation, pioneer status, investment allowances, special concessionary rate of 10% for offshore income which reduce the tax burden on companies. These are sufficient for the time being.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other suggestions brought up by the business groups involve highly technical matters, for example, problems relating to section 44 of the Income Tax Act which deals with resident companies and the use of tax credits to encourage repatriation of foreign income to Singapore. Such suggestions require very careful study to work out the economic consequences of any changes. However, I would assure the Member that these suggestions will not be simply put into cold storage but will be further studied and perhaps, at a suitable time, they will turn out to be very appropriate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems of trade protectionism and the importance of increasing Singapore's trade were raised by the Member for Alexandra and the Member for Chong Boon. Their comments are indeed timely. With deepening recession in our traditional markets, trade protectionism will be one of the greatest dangers which will face Singapore in the 1980s as the developed countries seek to erect tariff walls and quotas around their own markets in a mistaken attempt to protect domestic jobs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Trade presently provides export promotion services to local manufacturers and exporters. These services include the organization of trade fairs and trade missions to promote Singapore products in overseas markets. The Department also maintains a network of overseas trade offices in New York, Los Angeles, Japan, Rotterdam, and Jeddah to assist local manufacturers in obtaining more business contacts in these countries. However, due primarily to constraints in staff recruitment, the Department has not been able to carry out its export promotion services as vigorously as we would like.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Chong Boon has suggested that this is now the right time for us to undertake a bold initiative to embark on
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> a new export drive. He has urged the Government to reassess the need for a high-powered trade promotion agency such as a Trade Development Board. He will I am sure be pleased to know that this matter has been under active consideration by my Ministry over the last several months and the Department of Trade has been discussing the setting up of a Trade Development Board with the various Chambers of Commerce and the Singapore Manufacturers Association. I hope that we will be able to come to a decision on this matter before the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to the Member for Alexandra for his pertinent comments on tourism in Singapore. Both the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board and my Ministry are aware of the problem of rising room rates and the rising cost of food and shopping in Singapore, As for hotel room rates, I believe that it is unwise for the Government to interfere and institute price controls. What we have done is to encourage and facilitate the construction of more hotels. By 1986, there will be an increase of more than 10,000 hotel rooms. Hotel room rates should begin to stabilize before long. Nevertheless, his suggestion that we should undertake a thorough study of our tourist sector is a good one. Although we know that shopping is one of our main attractions for tourists in Singapore, it will be necessary for STPB to keep track of the changing tastes and attitudes of the tourists who come to Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Chong Boon has spoken at length on the need to conserve energy because the present oil glut may not last very long. I am sure that on that point we are all in agreement with him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board has recently set up an Energy Conservation Centre to advise consumers on energy conservation measures and to explain how to conduct energy audits and demonstrate efficient energy use. This centre is open to the public during normal working hours and is located in the PUB Building
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the PUB has established an Energy Conservation Division to coordinate energy conservation efforts of both
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the public and the private sectors. Since its formation in December 1981 the engineers of this Division have visited and have carried out energy audits of hotels, shipyards and industries to advise on energy conservation measures and the implementation of a systematic energy management programme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB is also working very closely with trade and manufacturers' associations to promote energy conservation. The Energy Diagnosis Bus mentioned by the Member for Chong Boon and which is already implemented in Japan and Canada, works on the same principle as the assistance currently being provided by the engineers of the PUB. As Singapore is much smaller than Japan or Canada, the PUB will have to study whether such an approach is of value in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB is also continually striving to improve its operational efficiency and to measure its performance by comparing itself with other public utilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB's generating efficiency has improved considerably over the last decade. In 1971, efficiency was 29.9%. In 1980, it has increased to 35.4%. Last year, efficiency rose to 35.7%. In comparing improvement in efficiency over the period 1971-1980, Singapore has improved by 5.5 percentage points, against 3.3% for Hong Kong and 0.2% for Japan in the period 1971-1979.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of the efficiency improvement is best illustrated by looking at the cost of electricity. If the PUB had remained at an efficiency of only 29.9% in 1981 instead of 35.7%, the PUB would have to pay S$155 million more in fuel costs. Singapore's electricity system is monitored with the aid of computers. This enables the PUB to optimize its system operations in order to achieve better efficiency. In addition, power stations are being modified to enable the use of various grades of oil. This will give the PUB the flexibility to take advantage of price differences in the various grades of oil and, in so doing, to save on fuel costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members, including the Member for West Coast and the Member for Geylang Serai, have raised queries on the
  <br>

  <br> operations of the Skills Development Fund. From the outset of its operations, the SDF has actively sought to reach out to companies, especially the small and medium-sized ones, through their trade and industry associations. The SDF Secretariat organizes regular talks to explain the various SDF assistance schemes to the members of these associations. The SDF is accessible to all companies and firms which are registered and operating in Singapore. They can be from any sector of the economy. Grants are based on the individual merits of each application.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no bias towards manufacturing or production-oriented training. In fact, companies in the non-manufacturing sector received 56% of the total training grants awarded as at the end of last year. There is also a separate technical committee for this sector to assist the SDF Council in the administration of the Fund.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the multi-national corporations were quick to come forward with applications for grants in the initial stage, our local companies have now responded very well. Local companies received 65% of the $57 million awarded in training grants as at December 1981. They also make up 70% of the recipients of the interest grants for mechanization. The third grant scheme, the Development Consultancy Scheme, is solely to assist local companies in obtaining external expertise to help upgrade their business operations and their training plans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last October, the SDF Secretariat initiated a wide-ranging dialogue with the two Coffeeshop-Owners Associations on upgrading possibilities and financial support from the Fund. The two Associations now plan to commission a study on the impact of the increasing affluence of Singaporeans on their business and possible avenues for their adaptation and upgrading. I assure Members that the study will be generously funded by the SDF under its Development Consultancy Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the SDF has now got on to a good footing after a somewhat slow start, there are still a number of areas of misunderstanding and shortcomings. Many
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> employers still view the Fund as a refunding operation to simply reimburse the levy collections to them. The specific economic restructuring objective of the Fund is lost in the employers' criticisms at the accumulation of funds or the slow dispensation of grants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kebun Baru has commented on the unsatisfactory state of continuing training in Singapore. I believe the basic problem is that in Singapore there is insufficient senior management's commitment and involvement with staff training and development. Many chairmen and managing directors of companies simply delegate this task to their personnel managers or to their administrative managers without giving them the necessary commitment or support. More often than not, these well-meaning executives are not equipped with the knowledge or the expertise to carry out the total training function in their companies. As a result, they fall back on random selection of short courses for piecemeal training of some staff members. Aggravating the situation is the mushrooming of such short courses, many with short or more diluted training content. The SDF has nevertheless supported some of these courses when they meet special training needs of the employees or when they represent first-time training efforts of small employers. However, employers must be cautioned against over-reliance on such courses as they will not equip the employees with in-depth knowledge and skills for business upgrading or restructuring.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training infrastructure in Singapore is weak. There is a limited availability of good training programmes and a shortage of experienced trainers and training administrators. Senior management executives are also not familiar with the key aspects of the training function, The SDF is making a special effort in meeting these areas of need. More training-the-trainer programmes and courses on staff training and development are being organized, and these will be generously funded.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Leng Kee and the Member for Whampoa have dwelt on the pros and cons of Singapore aiming for a high growth rate under present economic circumstances and their positions are
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> somewhat different. I have discussed this subject at length when I spoke at the University in December last year and I shall not repeat the arguments in detail. It suffices for me to say that I am in the unusual and happy position of being able to agree with both Members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, the crux of the issue is Productivity; whether we can through more capital investment (including the use of industrial robotics as mentioned by the Member for Kampong Kembangan), expanded manpower and skill upgrading programmes and whole-hearted cooperation between workers and management, achieve our targetted productivity growth of 6-8% per annum for this decade. If we can make the leap to sustain high productivity growth, then we will be able to grow at 8-10% per annum as advocated by the Member for Leng Kee but without incurring the problems of an overheated economy and increased inflationary pressures, as has been graphically described by the Member for Whampoa. If, on the other hand, our economic restructuring effort fails and we are reduced to obtaining economic growth through the production of more and more low-skilled, low value-added goods, then we will, of course, have to import more and more foreign labour with ultimately disastrous consequences for our economy and our society. The task that faces all of us, whether we are politicians, civil servants, private sector employers, or ordinary workers, is how to make ourselves more productive in our work. Then we will have a good rate of economic growth, low inflation and steadily decreasing reliance on foreign labour. This is the economic challenge that faces us in the 1980s.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are a small and open economy, we are vulnerable to imported inflation. However, I would like to assure the House that the Government is not sitting back and doing little to control inflation. In fact, the control of inflation is one of the Government's primary concerns.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prices of goods and services are at present being monitored by a special Committee on Profiteering and Inflation, whose members are drawn from various
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government departments and Ministries. The Committee meets regularly to monitor the inflationary situation. The Committee pays special attention to essential commodities such as rice, sugar and other food items. When the price of pork began to rise in the latter part of last year, the Committee decided that the most effective way to ease the shortage of supplies would be to allow imports of pigs from farms in Malaysia and Thailand which could be certified as disease-free. As a result of the action taken, the price of pork has since begun to decline to more tolerable levels.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee will continue to keep a close watch on prices and our machinery is sufficiently effective for us to do this task without the necessity for me to have regular conversations with housewives. The primary aims of this Special Committee are to:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) seek cheaper sources of food and other essential commodities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) prevent price-fixing and other restrictive trade practices by businesses and trade associations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) develop a more effective consumer education programme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have observed that prices continued to go up until January this year because of Chinese New Year, but last month our Consumer Price Index showed its first decline. Rice, pork, fish, eggs, vegetables and sugar were cheaper in February than in January. I am confident hat this trend will continue and that our inflation rate for 1982 will be considerably lower than last year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Minister for National Development, will be speaking in detail in the Committee of Supply on Government's land policy and its effect on property and construction prices, At this point I should just like to say that conditions in the first half of 1981 were somewhat unprecedented with a construction boom coinciding with a drying up of workers from our traditional sources and a temporary shortage of building materials as a result of curtailment of supplies from our regular overseas suppliers. The Ministry of National Development has taken steps to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> see that building materials will be in plentiful supply in Singapore this year, and with more mechanization in the construction industry plus expanded training programmes, we can look forward to more stable prices for flats and houses in the next few years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa has commented on the effect of exchange rate and money supply policy on the inflation rate in Singapore. On the whole, the Singapore dollar appreciated by about 8.6% against a basket of currencies weighted according to the proportion of Singapore's retained imports. In 1981 the Singapore dollar appreciated 28% against the pound sterling, 17% against the Deutsche Mark, 13% against the HK$, 11% against the Yen and 3% against the Swiss Franc.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in 1981, the US$ remained fairly strong against most major currencies as a result of the high US interest rates. However, the Singapore dollar, in fact, strengthened even against the US$. In managing the exchange rate of the Singapore dollar, the Government has to take into account not only the impact of external monetary developments, especially large capital inflows on the liquidity of the domestic system and domestic inflation rates, but it also has to consider the adverse effects of the appreciation of the Singapore dollar on the competitive edge of Singapore's exports of goods and services. As a result, there was a lower growth in domestic money supply in 1981.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money supply (M1) rose by 12% in 1981. The increase was on the low side when compared with the nominal GDP growth rate of 15.8% in 1981. There were some large capital inflows into Singapore during the last quarter of 1981. To stabilize the Singapore dollar exchange rate, more money and foreign exchange market intervention was conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. This gave rise to the higher rate of increase of money supply during the period. However, this was corrected in January 1982 when money supply grew at a more normal annual rate of 13.5%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 23% of the increase in bank loans went to the building and construction industry. This was due to the continued
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> expansion of that industry, which recorded a growth rate of 17% in 1981. However, it is somewhat a guess to say that loans given to professional and private individuals (16% of the overall increase) and financial institutions (20%) were mainly used for speculative purposes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an open economy like Singapore, the link between the increase in our money supply and our inflation rate is tenuous at best. Money supply, in fact, increased sharply in those years when we had the lowest inflation rates. For example:
  <pre>

              Inflation   Percentage Increase

     Year        Rate       in Money Supply



     1975        2.6             18.6

     1976       -1.9             18.1

     1977        3.2             10.5

     1978        4.8             11.6

     1979        4.0             13.1

</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go on to other matters, I would just like to make one clarification regarding a point made by the Member for Whampoa. He has mentioned the sum of $1,720 million which he said was loaned to the Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore (PCS). I would just like to clarify that this sum of money included loans given as lines of credit to DBS, the Ship-Financing Scheme as well as the Capital Assistance Scheme for the Construction industry for FY 1982. The amount which was loaned to the PCS was actually $152 million.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with an Establishment matter before I pass on to the taxation policy of the Government. The Member for Khe Bong and the Member for Ang Mo Kio have raised the issue of the salary revision for Divisions II, III and IV officers consequent on the recent salary revision for the Administrative and Professional Services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to inform them that the Ministry of Finance has received proposals from the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE) for a new Collective Agreement to cover Division IV officers. These included proposals to revise salary scales for Division IV. Most of the claims for the new Collective Agreement have been settled and the claims on revision of salaries for the Division IV grades are now under discussion. If the Ministry of Finance and the AUPE can come to agreement on these by the end of this month, the salary
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> revisions for the Division IV grades could also be implemented on 1st April, 1982.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Collective Agreement for Daily-Rated grades expired at the end of last year. The unions representing the Daily-Rated grades are expected to submit their claims very soon for a new Collective Agreement, including claims for wage revisions. Following receipt of these claims the negotiations can start. How soon the wage revisions for the Daily-Rated grades will be implemented depends really on how soon the unions can submit their claims and how soon the Ministry and the unions can come to agreement on these.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Divisions II and III, as well as Division I, services, the salaries of which have yet to be revised, the Ministry of Finance expects that all these can be finalized by the end of June, barring no unexpected delays. Implementation will, however, depend on how soon agreement on the proposed revisions can be reached with the unions where the proposals are subject to claims by or negotiations or consultation with unions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New salaries which have been settled with the trade unions for any scheme of service will be brought into operation without waiting for other schemes. But it will not be possible to backdate these new salaries to 1st April, 1982. A basic Establishment principle is involved, namely, that new terms and conditions of service should be effective either on the date of agreement and approval or on the first of the month following approval of those terms and conditions. To change this basic principle is to invite complications in future salary revisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed reservations concerning the tax changes proposed in the Budget. Before I comment on the reasons behind these tax changes, I think that it will be useful to inform Members about the general thrust of Government's taxation policy. It is an unhappy but unfortunately inevitable aspect of modern life that death and taxes are the only two certainties in a person's life. Unless Government is going to bankrupt itself by issuing ever-increasing amounts of public
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> debts to meet recurrent expenditure, taxes are a necessary source of revenue for Government to finance its outgoings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax revenue constitutes some 73% of Government's total revenue. The tax revenues go to finance Government expenditure, to provide social and economic services as well as basic infrastructure and development projects. As the scope for Government services expands, the expenditure must also increase and the increased expenditure can only be covered either by broadening the tax base, increasing the rates of existing taxes, or introducing new taxes. By and large, I believe that the most equitable way is to expand the tax base rather than to increase the tax burden of existing taxpayers or, worse still, attempting to obtain more and more tax from a smaller and smaller base of taxpayers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax has always been the mainstay of our tax revenue forming just over half of total tax received. Corporate taxes contribute some 76% of the total income tax collection. There are two reasons for this: firstly, income tax for individuals has been reduced substantially over the last few years, and secondly, the success of our financial and economic policy has led to higher economic growth which has, in turn, resulted in higher collection of corporate income tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of our income tax rates for individuals is still steeply progressive in nature. Those who earn more pay more, those who earn less pay less. And many people pay no tax at all. The number of individual taxpayers in the files of the Income Tax Department comprise only 50% of our workforce. For the Year of Assessment 1981, the Income Tax Department had, up to December 1981, completed assessments in respect of 445,000 individual taxpayers and the total income tax assessed was $587 million. There were 69,000 taxpayers, with a chargeable income of less than $1,000, paying the lowest marginal tax rate of 4%. The total tax collected from these 69,000 individuals, who represent 16% of the tax base, was $820,000 or 0.14% of the total tax collection. On the average, each of these individuals paid $12 in tax or $1 per month. In contrast, 12,300 taxpayers had a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> chargeable income of $50,000 or higher. Their marginal rate of tax was 34% or higher. These 12,300 taxpayers, who constitute 3% of our tax base, paid a total of $316 million in tax, or 54% of the total tax collection. On the average, each of these individuals paid $26,000 in tax. It is thus a complete distortion of the facts to imply that our income tax puts an unduly heavy burden on those who are not well-off.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, however, not swing to the other extreme and increase our tax rates to such an extent that individual incentive to strive and excel is extinguished. Our tax system must reward effort. Experience in a number of developed countries has shown that where personal income tax is set at exorbitant rates, workers' attitudes, initiative and incentive to work deteriorate and this contributes to the disintegration of the social and economic framework of those countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I will say a few words about tax reliefs. These are not to defray the full cost or expenses of supporting a wife, children or aged parents. They are meant basically as an indication of the Government's inclination and policy decisions. I do not think it is right that we should regard the tax relief of $1,000 for a wife as an amount which we think is enough to support a wife.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also a number of tax suggestions which have been made by the Member for Kaki Bukit. He has proposed that contributions by RC members for community development projects should be tax deductible. The Member for Thomson has also suggested that hospital fees or expenses for an individual's aged parents should be tax deductible. As I have said, we have got to be careful about increasing the tax reliefs as otherwise Pandora's box will be opened and there will be no end to the number of reliefs which can be claimed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemption for residential properties from estate duty of $600,000 or the full value of any one residential property (whichever is the higher) has drawn comment from a number of Members. Presumably they feel that this exemption will unduly benefit the rich and create a loophole through which Government may
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> lose considerable revenue which could be obtained by levying estate duty on the estates of those who die leaving behind valuable homes worth say, $3 or $4 or $5 million. Let us consider some of the facts regarding the collection of estate duty. During the last few years there were on the average some 12,000 deaths each year and, roughly speaking, about 2,700 cases each year were referred to the Income Tax Department for the purpose of estimating the estate duty. Not all of these cases which were referred are liable to estate duty, and it is interesting to note that, notwithstanding the increasing affluence of our society, the total number of cases liable to estate duty has fallen steadily over the last few years, ranging from 754 in 1977 to 581 in 1980.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the purpose of giving specific exemption for residential properties is to ensure that every family should own its own home and, if the breadwinner should unfortunately die, then the widow and her children should not have to sell the family house in order to pay estate duty. This is why the exemption limit has been increased over the last few years to keep pace with rising property prices. Based on the increased prices of property in 1981 when townhouses, semi-detached houses, even some flats, cost more than $600,000, we would have to raise the limit this year, say, to $800,000 or even to $1 million. This could have been made an annual concession by the Minister at each Budget debate. Looking further ahead, the question which we should ask ourselves is whether it is wise for Government to play a game of "catching up" with the property market and increase the exemption limit each time the property market goes up. On this basis, logically, if the property market should go down then the exemption limit should be decreased as well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, how much estate duty does Government actually receive in respect of estate duty on large estates where the main asset is an expensive residential property? The answer, perhaps not surprisingly, is insignificant. For the whole of 1981, for example, the Income Tax Department had only one case of an estate where the value of a single residential property exceeded $600,000 and even
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> then the amount in excess of $600,000 was by a relatively small amount. Perhaps this may be because the unfortunate taxpayer happened to die at the wrong time of the year. I think the hard fact of life is that, whatever be the limit which is set, whether it is $600,000 or $800,000 any taxpayer who can afford to own a home of, say $2 or $3 million should be shrewd enough to work out either by himself, or with the help of his tax advisers, a suitable tax plan so that on his death the value of his house does not come within the ambit of estate duty. So since the Government is unlikely to lose what it will not get in the first place, why not go back to the original reason for the exemption for residential properties and make sure that the family of the deceased will not have to sell the family home in order to pay estate duty when the breadwinner dies? This is what we have ensured by the concession given in the Budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have also commented that the decision to exempt CPF contributions from income tax and estate duty will not be of much benefit to the ordinary worker. Now, unlike bank deposits or POSB deposits, contributions to the CPF are mandatory. It does not seem to me to be fair, first of all, to compel a person to contribute to the CPF and then to tax him on his contribution not only during his lifetime but also when he dies. The concession on CPF contributions is, therefore, to correct an inequity. I would assure the Member for Ang Mo Kio that before proposing this concession, I consulted the Income Tax Department and they have assured me that they are fully capable of drawing up rules to plug the type of loopholes which he has mentioned. Knowing the Income Tax Department, I am sure we can have full confidence in them. Life insurance premiums, on the other hand, are not mandatory and, I think, do not merit such generous treatment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the comments made by the Member for Anson. In his speech he has claimed that the concept of p"caring society" was first put forward by his Party in 1976. Such a claim reminds me of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> story of the rooster who noticed that whenever it crowed every morning, the sun would rise, and then proceeded to deduce that its crowing was the cause of the sun's daily rising.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then went on to claim that, contrary to what was stated in the Budget Statement, the lower income groups did not enjoy any rise in real income and that he believed that, for many of them, real income actually declined last year. He based his claim by subtracting the inflation rate of 10% for foodstuffs and the additional CPF contribution of 4% from the rise of 14% increase in nominal income of our manufacturing sector workmen.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am truly astonished that a person, who presents himself as an alternative leader of the government, does not know the most elementary principle of economics, i.e. that you cannot subtract oranges from apples and get lemons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last three years, the NWC has recommended wage increases in the form of a fixed quantum plus a percentage. Last year it was $32 plus 6 to 10% and a further merit increment of 2%. The fixed quantum was intended precisely to benefit the lower income group. A $32 increase for someone earning $200 per month represents a 16% increase. Taking into account the additional percentage component of the recommended wage increase, the total wage increase for the lower income group was well over 20% for each of the last three years. A survey, conducted by the National Wages Council, shows that 90% of all firms, covering 96% of all employees in Singapore, had implemented the NWC first tier award.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the Member is focusing on the lower income group, he should take this wage increase of 20% instead of the 14% which represents the average for all workers, the high income as well as the lower income group. 20% subtract 10% (for inflation taking the rate for foodstuffs) and 4% (for increased CPF contribution) which as pointed out by the Member for Punggol still belongs to the worker, still leaves at least 6% for real income growth for the lower income group.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to more serious matters. The Member for Anson has said that he will not support the Budget because the fruits of Singapore's economic growth have not been equitably shared with the workers. This is a grave allegation and would be an indictment against any government if it had any validity. It is thus all the more deplorable for the Member to seek to deceive this House and the general public by making a statement which, he must know, is totally untrue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I request the Clerk of Parliament to distribute an Annex (Cols. 1027 - 1028) which contains some statistics showing how the common man has fared under the PAP Government in the 21 years since the PAP came to power. [Copies distributed to hon. Members]. Table 1 shows per capita GNP, private consumption and Government expenditure on social services for the years 1960, 1970 and 1981. The figures have all been adjusted for inflation at 1981 prices and are, therefore, comparable. Members will see that the per capita GNP has risen from $2,649 in 1960 to $10,801 in 1981, an increase of over four times in 21 years. During the same period private consumption per capita rose from $2,266 to $6,317, an increase of about three times.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1982/19820316/19820316-HA-0411027.htm">Annex - DATA ON STANDARD OF LIVING INDICATORS (Cols. 1027 - 1028)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government expenditure on social services (i.e. health, education, welfare services, etc.) is a good indicator of the level of spending which Government has incurred to provide social benefits for our population. This has risen many-fold in the last two decades. The statistics show that per capita Government expenditure on social services rose from $191 in 1960 to $1,209 in 1981, an increase of over six times. These figures have been adjusted for inflation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic electricity consumption per capita is also a convenient indicator of the level of affluence in a society. In Singapore, this has risen from 109 KW-hour in 1960 to 447 KW-hour in 1981, again an increase of over four times. On a more mundane level, if we use as our measure the ability of Singaporeans to acquire consumer comforts like television sets and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> telephones, Table II shows that Singaporeans have benefited tremendously over the last 20 years. In 1963, when television was first introduced to Singapore, our population was 1,646,000 and there were 30,838 TV sets in the whole of Singapore, i.e. one TV set for every 53 Singaporeans. Although our population had grown to 2,443,000 by 1981, the number of television sets in Singapore had grown to such an extent that last year there was one TV set for every six Singaporeans. No wonder people no longer go to our community centres to watch television. They can now do so in the comfort of their own homes and, most likely, record on videotape their favourite Hongkong serials.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in 1960, there was one telephone for every 27 Singaporeans whereas in 1981 the ratio was one telephone for every three Singaporeans. The provision of public transport facilities has also shown a similar improvement. In 1960, for every bus in Singapore there were 1,230 Singaporeans whereas in 1981 each bus served, on the average, 352 Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most dramatic indicator of the improvement in the standard of living of the ordinary man is shown in our public housing statistics. In 1960, 9% of our population were living in HDB flats. All were rented. None were owner-occupied. By 1981, 69% of our population were living in HDB flats, 25% were rented and 44% were owner-occupied.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of actual number of houses and flats including the public and the private sectors, I have not been able to obtain comparable figures which go back as far as 1960, but I am able to give the House some figures which contrast the situation in 1970 as against 1981. Between 1970 and 1981, the number of bungalows, semi-detached and terrace houses increased from 39,676 to 43,538, an increase of just under 10%. The number of private flats increased from 10,008 to 16,321, an increase of about 63%. The number of HDB flats, however, increased from 120,138 to 337,198, an increase of some
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 180%. And we are going to build a further 290,000 flats for our citizens by the end of this decade. This is why for FY 1982 we have set aside a total of $2,253 million or one-third of the entire development budget for public housing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me contrast our housing situation in Singapore against that of a fairly similar city state, i.e. Hong Kong. About 40% of the Hong Kong population is housed by the Hong Kong Housing Authority as compared with 70% of our population in Singapore being housed by the HDB. Most of the Hong Kong housing are on rental, and the rental charged by the Housing Authority varies. The older flats which were built earlier and which have communal toilets, not communal kitchens, are rented out at a low rental while the newer flats with its own toilets are rented out at a higher rental. The Hong Kong Housing Authority also has its own home-ownership scheme and sells its flats at its new towns at HK$480 per square foot. If we convert this into Singapore dollars, we will see that the Hong Kong government is selling flats at S$172 per square foot compared with the HDB selling its 3-room new generation flats at S$36 per square foot. The majority of the flats provided by the Hong Kong Housing Authority are of sizes between 11 to 20 square metres whereas the average HDB flat has a size of 70 square metres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hong Kong government is building at a density of about 2,500 to 5,000 persons per hectare as against the HDB's density of 500 to 1,000 persons per hectare. Because of the smaller flats in Hong Kong, people are living in extremely crowded conditions. The average size of a Hong Kong flat is about 2.2 to 4 square metres per person as against 15 square metres per person in an HDB 3-room flat. Our HDB flat is three to six times bigger than the average Hong Kong flat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are the broad statistics which record what is so patently visible to everyone in Singapore but which the Member for Anson refuses to see. Because of this Government,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore today is a much better place for all Singaporeans to live.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> The Singaporean today has a job, he has a roof over his head and he enjoys good social amenities. And his children, irrespective of whether he is well-to-do or poor, have equal opportunities in obtaining the highest education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a period of full employment and rising wages, the Member for Anson has conveniently set himself up as the champion of the rights of the workers. May I ask what cause the Member was championing during the period of the 1960s when there were riots in the streets and when there were high unemployment rates and when there were bleak economic prospects for the working man. Then the Member was conspicuous by his silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I was in Government service.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> The Government's economic and taxation policy has always had, as its primary aim, the generation of wealth and then its distribution throughout the whole population in a fair and equitable manner. What the Government has not done is to follow the destructive policies suggested by the Member for Anson, i.e. to carve out in an arbitrary and ultimately self-defeating manner shares in an economic cake which is steadily becoming smaller. That is the road toward eventual collapse in the economy as can be seen in those countries which were unfortunate enough or foolish enough to follow the policies advocated by the Member for Anson.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regrettably, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson did not speak much on the Government's taxation policy yesterday as he had run out of time. However, he did speak at length on this subject during the debate on 3rd March on %he Income Tax (Amendment) Bill and I presume that his views have not changed. In that debate, dwelling on the burden of taxation on our workers, he suggested that instead of looking after the rich, the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government should raise personal reliefs so as to benefit the less well-to-do.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raising, of personal reliefs is not desirable because it shrinks our tax net. If personal reliefs are increased, for example, by $1,000, then our tax base, which as I have indicated comprises only half of our workforce, would be reduced by a further 69,000 individuals. Each of these individuals would save, on the average, $12 in tax. Of course, $12 is $12 and a saving is a saving. But surely it is more important to these Singaporeans that they should get their HDB flats and that their children should have ample opportunities for education rather than that they should save $1 per month in tax?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the Member is suggesting that Government should reduce its revenue by shrinking our tax base or drastically lowering tax rates to the level prevailing in Hong Kong. This will, as a matter of fact, help our businessmen, particularly those in the financial sector, to compete more effectively against their counterparts in Hong Kong. But then if he has read Milton Friedman, he will know that the social and housing benefits which are currently enjoyed by our population would have to be reduced to the same levels as in Hong Kong. Is this what the Member is seriously suggesting?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or perhaps is he advocating that we should squeeze the rich to enhance Government revenue. The dire consequences of such a foolish policy can easily be seen in the case of countries like Britain. Suddenly, you find that capital will melt away like an ice cream on a hot day. Talent and expertise will emigrate and we shall all be sharing poverty instead of riches.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should, in fact, try to ensure that as many persons as possible in Singapore, including the self-employed hawkers and taxi-drivers, come within the income tax net, even though the actual amount of tax they pay may only be nominal. Everyone will then be aware that, in this life, nothing is for free and the social and economic amenities which we enjoy have to be paid for.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson may not have realized
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that the raising of personal reliefs is regressive in nature, i.e. the tax savings are not distributed in an equitable manner. If we raise personal reliefs by, say, $1,000, then those who are paying the lowest rate of tax of 4%, would have a tax saving of at most $40 while those who are paying the highest tax rate of 45% would enjoy a tax saving of $450 - more than ten times that of those who are in the lowest tax bracket. This is surely an odd and convoluted way of achieving the Member's objective of penalizing the rich to benefit the poor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all Members for their constructive suggestions and I assure them that they will be considered by my officials. [Applause].
