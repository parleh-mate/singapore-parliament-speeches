<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime</b>

<b>Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am asked by the

Prime Minister to reply to this question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since June 1959, the total number of

applications  for allotment of land  at  Kampong

Ayer  Gemuroh Malay Settlement received  is  23.

Prior  to  that date, the number of applications

applications to date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that allotments of land to the

applicants will be made during the course of the

year.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

is  it  possible for the Parliamentary Secretary

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FOR FISHERMEN AND FARMERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the

Minister for National Development what does  the

Government propose to do to assist fishermen and

farmers in Singapore and its surrounding islands

to increase their income.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, as in most

countries, the life of the fisherman is  a  most

difficult  and  hazardous one. In  the  case  of

Singapore,  the situation is further  aggravated

by  the fact that Singapore's coastlines do  not

contain  much  fish, and also  during  the  past

years, due to over-intensive fishing, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



catch  has  become smaller and smaller  year  by

year. To improve the catch of our fishermen,  it

is  necessary  for  them  to  take  up  deep-sea

fishing  and  seek  new  fishing  grounds,   for

example,  in the South China Sea or  the  Indian

Ocean.  This is not an easy task, because  deep-

sea  fishing requires both capital and technical

skill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other problems facing the fishermen;

for  instance, the exploitation by the middlemen

and  unscrupulous  moneylenders,  the  lack   of

capital to buy the necessary gear and equipment,

the   poor  living  conditions  of  the  fishing

villagers,  the lack of jetties where  fishermen

can land their catch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the many problems which are

receiving    Government's   consideration.    At

present,  we  can  only do whatever  we  can  to

assist  these fishermen. For instance,  we  have

tried  to improve the living conditions  of  the

fishermen  in  the  Southern  Islands.  We   are

proposing to construct a jetty at the 18th Mile,

Jurong  Road, for fishermen to land their catch.

The  situation cannot improve appreciably  until

our  fishermen can also go to the Federation and

Indonesian waters to catch their fish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, neither is the solution of the farmer's problems in an island like Singapore an

easy task. The main problems of the farmers are,

briefly,  the  shortage of  land,  the  lack  of

cheaper  fertilisers and seeds, the need  for  a

better  marketing system which will  reduce  the

exploitation  by  the middlemen,  better  credit

facilities and the lack of real co-operatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These problems cannot be overcome at present

due  to  various difficulties. We are attempting

to  do whatever we can to help the farmers.  For

instance,  we  are carrying out  experiments  to

obtain better strains of pigs and chickens,  and

experiments in pig-stuff and fertilisers. We are

also  providing better veterinary  services  for

pigs  and chickens, offering a ploughing service

at  cheaper cost and converting more prawn ponds

from Singapore's swamp land.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As the majority of

the fishermen comprise many nationalities, could

the   Minister  explain  whether  there  is  any

special  programme whereby they can be  assisted

by way of giving them materials or cash?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, we are putting

out programmes to help the fishermen both in the

island of Singapore and the Southern Islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$800,000 has been provided to help farmers and

fishermen. A part of this money will be spent on

promoting  the welfare of these two sections  of

our community. Out of the $800,000, $200,000 has

been  earmarked mainly to help the Malay section

of our population living in the Southern Islands

and  in other parts of Singapore. We are not  in

favour  of giving cash subsidies to any  section

of  the  population,  because  we  honestly  and

sincerely  believe that the people of  Singapore

can  look  after themselves and they  would  not

welcome any help from the Government in the form

of cash.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): It seems that this

programme  will be encouraged by the Government.

With  regard to assistance in the form of loans,

could the Minister state what length of time  is

allowed  for  the  money to be  repaid  and  the

interest to be charged on such loans?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I am afraid that

the   Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan  did   not

understand clearly the substance of my reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not mentioned that we have decided that

we  shall be giving loans to fishermen.  We  are

only trying to find out the best way in which to

help  the 5,500 fishermen in Singapore with  our

limited funds.

for   Finance   whether  there  are   Government

for the purpose of attending public worship, and

what  action  does he propose  to  take  in  the

matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, it has been the

Government's  policy to allow,  subject  to  the

exigencies  of the service, its Muslim  officers

to  leave between 12 noon and 1 p.m. on  Fridays

to attend public worship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this policy is enshrined in General

Order 140 (d), which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Muslim officers may be given leave by Heads

of  Departments to be absent from office between

12 noon and 1 p.m. on Fridays for the purpose of

attending public worship."



<br><br>It  may  happen, however, that where  all  or  a

majority of the staff of a particular section of

an office are Muslims, it may not be possible to

grant  leave to all of them every Friday without

causing a dislocation of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the hon. Member has in

mind  any  particular  department,  and  in  the

absence of more specific information, I  do  not

propose to take any action in the matter.

<div align="center"><b>ANEKA RAGAM RA'AYAT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Total expenditure up to 29th February, 1960)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for   Culture  what  is  the  total  expenditure

incurred  on  Aneka  Ragam Ra'ayat  up  to  29th

February 1960.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total

expenditure,  consisting of fees  for  artistes,

refreshments  and  transport  for  artistes  and

State equipment, for the period in question  was

$4,823.95.  The figure does not include  special

expenditure during National Loyalty Week. A  sum

of  $3,988.15  was  spent for  the  Aneka  Ragam

Ra'ayat concerts during National Loyalty Week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Member, I am sure, is expecting more

details  and  therefore I  will  give  him  some

details in this respect. The concerts were begun

in  August last year, and up to the end of  18th

February 18 regular concerts and four



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



special  shows for Loyalty Week were  held.  The

average  cost of a show is about $400.  For  the

value  we  get  from  these shows  in  terms  of

stimulation    of   cultural   activities    and

understanding of our various cultures, they  are

very  cheap at $400 a show. This cost  has  been

made  possible  only because a large  number  of

artistes, musicians and dancers and others  have

given their services to these shows without  any

expectation  of reward, except for out-of-pocket

expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aneka Ragam Ra'ayat shows were held weekly

at  the start, but beginning this year they  are

being  organised every fortnight. They are  held

not  only  in the City areas but also  all  over

Singapore,  including the rural  areas  and  the

Islands. They have become very popular and  some

of them have been attended by very large numbers

running  into  tens  of  thousands;  but  on  an

average  we  get  about 2,000  to  3,000  people

attending these shows in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir although I

am  satisfied  with the reply of  the  Hon, the

Minister  for  Culture, I must  point  out  that

these  shows did not visit the Kampong Kembangan

constituency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the

recommendation of His Excellency the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to proceed with this Bill, and I

move,  "That  the  Bill be now  read  a  Second

time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the charges made by the Singapore

Harbour  Board,  the  only  charge  levied   on

shipping  for the varied services  provided  in

our  port has taken the form of Light  Dues  at

very  nominal  rates. These  Light  Dues  yield

approximately $480,000 per annum. This  sum  of

money  is  paid into a special fund called  the

Light   Dues  Fund  and  this  Fund   is   used

exclusively for the maintenance and improvement

of  harbour lights and navigational  aids.  The

present  cost  of  maintaining  the  port,   of

dredging  and  survey,  outside  the  Singapore

Harbour Board, is approximately $1,500,000  per

year.   This, sum  makes  no  provision   for

development or improvement expenditure  to  the

harbour. All these years the annually recurrent

costs  and  cost of development  projects  have

been met from General Revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is well aware of the need to

nurture the port, to improve its facilities and

maintain  efficient administration so that  the

services  provided are highly competitive,  but

with  the  present  need  to  provide  for  the

adequate  overall  development  of  a   rapidly

growing   community,   Government   finds    it

necessary  to provide that the port  user  also

contributes towards the annually recurrent  and

development expenditure of the port.  The  dues

to  be  collected under this Bill will be  paid

into  general revenue until such time as a Port

Authority is set up when the question of paying

the   dues  to  a  fund  administered  by   the

Authority will be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle on the levy of Port Dues

incorporated  in this Bill is  that  ships  and

harbour   craft  which  derive  earnings   from

calling or operating at Singapore or who occupy

a  berth within the port for a period in excess

of  30  days, shall be the only ones which  are

called  upon  to  make  a contribution  towards

maintenance and development of the port.  Ships

which  call at Singapore solely for the purpose

of  taking on board fuel, stores and water will

not  be required to pay Port Dues. These  ships

which  derive  no earnings from their  call  in

Singapore   do,  however,  already   indirectly

contribute  to the economy of the State  to  an

important extent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special protection for the ship repairing

industry has been provided in the Bill. Vessels

which  discharge cargo or disembark  passengers

for  the  purpose of effecting repairs  or  who

call  here  solely for the purpose  of  repairs

shall not be required to pay Port Dues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to encourage the local fishing

industry, Singapore licensed fishing boats will

be  exempted  also from payment  of  Port  Dues

under clause 9 sub-clause (2).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original draft proposals for the scale and

implementation of Port Dues were  forwarded  to

the  Shipowners and Harbour Craft  Associations

and  their views on the subject have been  very

carefully   considered.  The  Bill  now   being

considered incorporates many of the suggestions

of the interested parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of 10 cents per net registered ton

for   ships  working  cargo  or  embarking  and

disembarking passengers is considered to  be  a

fair   charge   and   one  which   takes   into

consideration the fact that the port must  keep

its  charges  to  a minimum  to  survive  in  a

competitive market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rates for harbour craft as detailed in the

Second  Schedule to the Bill are directly  tied

to  the  earning capacity of the craft involved

and are considered to be a very fair charge  on

the  user  as a small contribution towards  the

various  services given in the way of  dredging

and maintenance of sea and river walls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister gave us the cost

of  maintenance of the port facilities as  $1.5

million.  He said that this Bill was introduced

with   a   view  to  recouping  that   sum   of

expenditure. But he did not tell the House  how

much  he expected to collect in the way of port

dues under this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has also told the House that the Government intends to collect

port dues from ships, which stay in the harbour

for  more than 30 days. By that, I take it, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that most of the foreign  ships

and ocean-bound liners will more or less



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



escape  the provisions of this Bill,  and  that

most  of  the craft which will come within  the

ambit  of  the Bill - and, therefore, liable  for

the  payment of dues - will be craft anchored and

stationed  in  Singapore  and  plying   between

Singapore and the neighbouring countries. While

not denying that some dues should be collected,

I think Government should bear in mind that the

port is one of the vital arteries of Singapore,

and before any port dues are charged on vessels

using   Singapore,  particularly  local  craft,

Government should be satisfied that  this  does

not mean putting a certain type of craft out of

business,  or  enhancing the  fees  which  such

craft  have to pay, which might have an  effect

not only on the lives of certain people who use

the sea, but also on the cost of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is interested in creating a

situation  in  Singapore,  which  will  attract

industry. Therefore, it is imperative that  any

taxation  policy, or any policy  such  as  this

followed by Government should be one which will

attract  industry  to  Singapore.  Whether  the

revenues of the Colony are in such a state that

it is necessary -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The State.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker,

Sir. Whether the revenues of the State are such

that  it is necessary to impose these port dues

is  another  matter on which the  Deputy  Prime

Minister has not seen fit to address the House.

From  the very efficient Budget, which the Hon.

Minister  for Finance presented some time  ago,

it  appeared to me that no further taxation was

necessary.  I  think  he  gave  the  House   to

understand  that no further taxation  would  be

necessary.  But  within a  few  months  of  his

statement,  here is another form  of  taxation,

which it is sought to enforce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, those are some of the

observations which I have to make on this Bill.

Clause 7 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All port dues collected under this Ordinance

shall be paid into the Consolidated Fund."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, of course, that the Government is

interested  in  creating a Port  Authority  with

extended powers and an extended area of control.

The  Deputy Prime Minister did say that when the

Port Authority was created, Government would, at

the  time of its creation, consider whether  the

monies collected under this Bill would not  then

become payable to the Port Authority. We do  not

know  when this Port Authority will be  created,

or whether it will be created within the life of

the  Government  or  outside  the  life  of  the

Government. Could the Deputy Prime Minister  say

whether  the  port dues which will be  collected

under  this  Bill  would  be  maintained  in   a

separate  fund  until  such  time  as  the  Port

Authority  is  created, and whether  the  monies

would then be transferred to the Port Authority?

Or whether it is the intention of the Government

that  these  monies  would become  part  of  the

general  revenue  of  the State,  and  need  not

necessarily be used for the improvement of  port

facilities?



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, the Member for Farrer

Park  has made certain observations, and I would

like to correct some of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, may I inform the House that the

imposition of port dues in Singapore  is  not  a

precedent? There are ports in other parts of the

world, which are already charging such dues. For

example,  in  London,  river  tonnage  dues  are

payable at rates varying from 2 pence to 6 pence

per  ton.  In Liverpool, the rates vary  from  1

11/16th  penny  to 9 pence per  ton,  and  these

rates  have recently been increased  by  a  two-

third  per cent. In Southampton, the rates  vary

from 1½ pence to 2½ pence per ton, plus a 20 per

cent  surcharge.  In New York and  other  U.S.A.

ports, the rates vary from 2 cents per ton to  6

cents  per ton. In Rotterdam, harbour  dues  are

payable at varying rates which are calculated on

gross  tonnage  in  cubic  metres  and  on   the

quantity of cargo



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



discharged  and  loaded. In  Antwerp,  the  dues

charged  vary from Belgium francs 5.25  to  2.50

per ton. In Manila, port dues are payable at the

rate of 12.5 centavos per ton or 35 centavos per

ton  full load of cargo discharged or loaded  at

the ship's option.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the present time, harbour craft have

made  no contribution to the cost of maintenance

and  the development of the port, although  they

derive  their livelihood from it. At  present  a

100-ton lighter pays only an annual licence  fee

of  $6.75. Such a craft will now be called upon,

in  addition,  to  pay a port due  of  $150  per

annum.  However,  there is an  analogy  in  that

commercial  lorries  pay licensing  fees,  which

vary  from $132 to $560 per annum, depending  on

their  size.  So we can consider that  the  port

dues   charged  for  harbour  craft  are   quite

reasonable. Moreover, harbour craft do not pay a

heavy-oil  duty  tax to the Customs  Department,

whereas  diesel lorries pay from $450 to  $1,975

per  annum. Sampans and other little  craft  are

called   upon  to  pay  only  nominal   charges.

According  to the Second Schedule of  the  Bill,

they  will  be covered by Class I and Class  II,

and, according to their size, these sampans will

be  called upon to pay either $1.50 per  ton  or

$2.50  per  ton, depending on whether  they  are

mechanically-propelled or not. The charges  they

will  ultimately pay will vary from the  minimum

of  $5 to perhaps $20 or so. But these are  only

annual payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated revenue from port dues, based on

tonnage  figures related to the 1959 Light  Dues

Receipts,  is  as  follows: revenue  from  ships

paying  at  10  cents' rate is  $1,890,000,  and

revenue from harbour craft is $110,000, making a

total of $2 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total expenditure on the port for the

years  1955  to 1959 is $3,958,343. The  greater

part  of  this sum has been devoted to dredging,

about $3,764,665 having been spent on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to come to certain points which the Member

for  Farrer  Park made a moment ago. Ocean-going

vessels  which  call at Singapore  to  discharge

passengers or cargo or to embark passengers or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



load  cargo do not escape paying port dues. They

are   covered  in  the  First  Schedule,   where

paragraph (a) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For every ship entering a port for the purpose

of  loading or discharging cargo or embarking or

disembarking  passengers,  ten  cents  per  ton,

subject to a minimum payment of one dollar and a

maximum stay of thirty days."

<br><br>

Now the second part of the Schedule covers those

ships, which stay in the port for longer than 30

days. The second part of the Schedule reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(b) For every ship occupying an anchorage or

berth within a port -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) for the first period of thirty days - no

payment;"



<br><br>having  already paid once. If they  stay  for  a

period exceeding 30 days they have to pay:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(ii) thereafter at the rate of ten cents per

ton per thirty days.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add, Mr Speaker, that the Minister for

Finance  in  his  Budget  speech  did  give  due

warning to the House that the Government had the

intention  of imposing port dues. I  would  also

like to add, as I have said just now, that up to

date  all expenditure spent on the port has come

out  of  the  Consolidated Fund, it is  natural,

therefore,  that  until the  Port  Authority  is

established,  whatever dues  we  collect  should

justly  and  rightly go back to the Consolidated

Fund.  When  the Port Authority is  established,

which  we  hope will be within the  lifetime  of

this   Government,  a  separate  fund  will   be

created, and the port dues so collected will  be

paid into this fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

the death of His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan

Agong of the Federation of Malaya, and pray

that Your Excellency will be pleased to convey

to the Government of the Federation of Malaya

this Assembly's deep sense of the loss which

the whole country has sustained, and their

profound sympathy with the Raja Permaisuri

Agong and the late Yang di-Pertuan Agong's

family and with the Government and people of

the Federation of Malaya."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In expressing our sorrow over the death of His

Majesty  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong   of   the

Federation of Malaya, we are paying tribute  not

only to a man who was held in high esteem by the

people of the Federation, but also to a man  who

was  called upon to symbolise the continuity and

dignity of a new and developing nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention today to add to the

tributes  already paid to his personality.  This

has  been  done more exhaustively by  those  who

knew  him  well and intimately both as a  person

and as the Head of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only judge him by the manner in which

he  discharged the onerous and exacting task  of

being  the  constitutional Head of a State.  The

role of a constitutional Head is twofold: first,

to symbolise by his acts and demeanour the power

and  dignity  of  the State. The  second  is  to

provide   the   State   with   continuity   and,

therefore, with political stability. Governments

can  change but the State must go on. It is this

permanence  of the State that the constitutional

Head   must  symbolise.  These  tasks  the  late

Paramount Ruler discharged in full measure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to extend the sympathy of

the  people of Singapore to the Raja Permaisuri

Agong,  to  the  late  Yang di-Pertuan  Agong's

family, and to the people of the Federation  of

Malaya  over  the  loss  of  an  esteemed   and

respected Head of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in rising to support the motion before the

House,  I  wish to associate with all that  the

Deputy Prime Minister has said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sudden death of His Majesty the Yang

di-Pertuan Agong came as a great shock  to  the

whole  nation. Malaya was stunned  by  the  sad

news  and there was a deep sense of loss.  Sir,

those of us who had been near enough to see him

at  functions had been struck by his grace, his

charm and his friendliness. He had a smile  and

a  kind word for everyone - the high and the low,

the  rich and the poor, the young and the  old.

And  those of us who had the honour of  knowing

him can appreciate more the deep sense of loss,

which Malaya has sustained through his death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was indeed a good king and during his reign

Malaya  prospered. He was a wise king  and  his

Ministers  and his people revered him.  He  was

imbued  with  a great love for his people.  His

first thoughts were for their well being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many tributes have been paid to him, but

there  is  one  tribute  that  surpasses   all.

Thousands and thousands of Malayans shed  tears

when they heard of the death of their king  and

protector who had been a father unto them.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, with a deep sense

of  loss,  I  rise, together with my colleague,

the Member for Cairnhill, to support the motion

which  has  been  tabled by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Malaya is our close neighbour, and it is appropriate that if our neighbour

suffers a loss, we feel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



the loss also. This is all the more so when  we

realise  that  the majority of  the  people  of

Singapore  have  come from  the  Federation  of

Malaya. Likewise, it could be said here that  a

great  majority of the Members of this Assembly

have  had  their origins in the  Federation  of

Malaya.   Therefore,  with  such  a  state   of

affairs, we must express our deep sense of loss

over the death of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. We

must  express our sympathy with our friends  in

the  Federation  of Malaya if  we  share  their

happiness  or unhappiness. At this moment,  the

people  in the Federation of Malaya are grieved

over  the  loss  of His Majesty  the  Yang  di-

Pertuan  Agong. As close friends we  must  also

share with them in this loss, which we feel  as

deeply as if we had lost our fathers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us pray that God will give his blessing to

His late Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.  To

the Raja Permaisuri Agong and the family of His

late  Majesty, we in this Assembly express  our

condolences.  God alone will give his  blessing

to them.

Malays,  Chinese and Indians lining the streets

to  pay homage not only to his personality, but

also  to  the institutions of State,  which  he

represented at the apex.

this a sad occasion for them all?

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to  move,  "That the Bill be now read a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new clauses which this Bill will introduce

into   the   Legislative   Assembly   Elections

Ordinance can be roughly classified into  three

categories:    first,   some   important    new

provisions;  second, some changes of  a  purely

administrative  nature; and,  third,  some  new

clauses in clarification of existing provisions

in the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill introduces an important

change in the qualification for candidature  of

the   Legislative   Assembly   elections.   Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   with  the   introduction   of

compulsory voting, one of the penalties is  the

removal  of the voter's name from the  register

if   he   does  not  vote.  It  is,  therefore,

anomalous that a person could be penalised  for

not  voting by not being allowed to  vote,  and

yet  he could still legally stand for election.

If  a man has not taken the trouble to vote and

keep  his name on the register, it follows that

he should not be qualified to be voted for, and

we have, by this amendment, carried the logical

changes  which  compulsory  registration   must

introduce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 13 will reduce the overall

period  between the date of the  issue  of  the

writ of election and polling day. In clause  9,

the  minimum  period between the  date  of  the

issue  of Writs of Election and Nomination  Day

will be nine days, instead of 16 days, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



minimum period from the date of publication  of

the  Notices of Contested Election  to  Polling

Day  will be reduced from three weeks  to  nine

days. I would like to draw the attention of the

House  to  the  fact  that  these  are  minimum

periods. The maximum periods remain as they are

on  the  Statute  Book. These  amendments  will

bring our legislation more in line with what is

current   in   other  parts  of   the   British

Commonwealth  and  in the United  Kingdom.  The

only  reason  why the minimum periods  were  as

long as they were originally provided for,  was

that in the early days the Elections Office had

not  sufficiently worked out the procedure  and

the  administrative arrangements necessary  for

conducting   the  elections.  It  was   thought

prudent  that  a  considerable length  of  time

should  be provided for the preparations before

voting. I am glad to say that, partly from  the

experience  we have gained, and partly  through

the   impetus   of  the  new  Government,   the

Elections  Office now feel that they  can  keep

abreast  of  the electoral machinery  in  other

parts of the British Commonwealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the administrative changes, may I draw the

attention  of  the  House to  clause  3,  which

provides for the establishment of more  polling

stations  at  the discretion of  the  Returning

Officer, rather than limiting it as at  present

to  two per polling district? At the same time,

we  are repealing the provision with regard  to

separate polling stations for the exclusive use

of female voters. From the experience gained in

the  Local Government and Legislative  Assembly

elections  over the last three years, Returning

Officers  have  discovered  that  it  might  be

sometimes necessary to have more than just  two

polling stations in a polling division. We have

also decided, from experience, that there is no

need  for  the  provision of  separate  polling

stations for women.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 8 are changes which will allow

the  Registration Officer to transfer the  name

of  a  voter from one register to another, even

though the time for objections has elapsed,  if

it is discovered that he had been wrongly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



placed.  At present, the law does not  allow  a

Returning Officer to correct the register of  a

voter  once  the period allowed for  objections

has  elapsed, even though it is discovered that

he   had   been   classified   in   the   wrong

constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill, which provides for the

preparation  of combined registers of  electors

for  Legislative Assembly and Local  Government

elections, will now be repealed, as there  will

no   longer   be   any   elections   to   local

authorities,  such  as  the  City  Council  and

District Councils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 provides that it will now only be

necessary  for the Minister alone  to  issue  a

notice at least five clear days before the date

fixed  for nomination. At present, it  is  also

necessary for the Returning Officer to make the

announcement. We have considered it unnecessary

to  have this duplication. Henceforth,  by  the

amending  clause  10, there will  be  only  one

announcement  five days before the  date  fixed

for nomination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 is complementary to clause 3 in that

it repeals the second proviso to section 38 (5)

of   the  Ordinance,  since  it  is  no  longer

necessary  to have polling stations established

for the exclusive use of female voters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 19 and 21 will transfer the power to

make  regulations and prescribe forms from  the

Governor in Council to the Minister. This is in

line  with  section 72A of the Ordinance  where

the former Governor in Council's powers to make

regulations  for  the display  of  posters  and

banners  have been transferred to the  Minister

by  virtue  of the Transfer of Powers Ordinance

(No. 71 of 1959).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the clauses in clarification. First, I

would like to draw the attention of Members  to

clauses  11  and  12 and to the  amendments  of

which I have given notice. Under section 27 (3)

as  it  stands at present, a candidate must  be

present  at  the  time  of  his  nomination  to

deliver   a   statutory  declaration   of   his

qualifications  and  a  nomination  paper.  But

section  29  (2) is so drafted that either  the

proposer  or  the  seconder could  put  in  the

nomination paper of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



a  candidate. As the Bill stands at present, it

was the original intention to resolve the doubt

in  favour of allowing the proposer or seconder

to  put  in the papers of a candidate.  Sir,  I

have  had  discussions with my  colleagues  and

with  leaders of the Opposition,  and  we  have

decided  to  resolve  the doubt  in  favour  of

section  27 (3); in other words, requiring  the

candidate  to put in his nomination  paper  and

also his statutory declaration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14, Sir, amends section 35 (1) of the

Ordinance  to make it clear that each Presiding

Officer is supplied only with that part of  the

copy  of  the  register which  applies  to  his

particular  polling place. This is  to  obviate

the possibility that a person's name may appear

in  that  part  of  the  register  given  to  a

Returning  Officer  and  that  more  than   one

Returning  Officer may have  his  name  in  the

register   that  he  has  given.  Theoretically

speaking, there is always the possibility  that

one  voter  might be able to go to two  polling

places  and acquire two ballot papers from  two

Returning Officers. I am not suggesting for one

moment that that had happened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 will amend section 36 (2) and will

clarify  the position of Presiding Officers  or

Senior  Presiding Officers with regard  to  the

voting  facilities for electors. They will  now

be  made responsible only for the provision  of

such facilities in respect of their own polling

station only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, in clause 20, it is now necessary for

the  candidate to inform the Returning  Officer

before 12.30 p.m. on the day of nomination,  of

the  name  or names by which he would be  known

for the purposes of election. There appears  to

be no necessity for the extension of time up to 4.00 p.m. on the day of nomination. Practice in

the  past has indicated that all candidates  at

the  time  of  nomination are in a position  to

decide  by  what name or names  they  would  be

known on the ballot paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4, 6 and 17 are amendments, which are

purely  of a formal drafting nature, and  I  do

not  think  it  is  necessary  for  me  to  say

anything on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

made  mention of clauses 9 and 13 in  regard  to

the   minimum  period  required  for  nomination

papers  to  be  submitted after the proclamation

and polling day after nomination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the two periods mentioned in these two

clauses of 16 days and three weeks were  put  in

when  Singapore had its first elections in 1948.

At  that time, elections were just beginning  in

this  country. Now that we have marched  towards

parliamentary democracy, it is quite right  that

the amendments should take place.

Excellency's recommendation on this Bill, and  I

beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In proposing the adoption of this Bill, the

Government  is  carrying  out  its  promise   as

contained in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech

[Hansard, Vol. 11 No. 1, Col. 9]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"will enact legislation which, whilst

recognising existing polygamous marriages,  will

make it an offence for persons to contract other

than   monogamous  marriages  in  future."



<br><br>The

opportunity  has  been taken to consolidate  the

existing laws relating to marriage, divorce, the

rights  and  duties  of  married  persons,   the

maintenance  of  wives  and  children,  and  the

punishment of offences against women and girls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that every marriage

solemnized  in Singapore after the  coming  into

operation  of  the Ordinance other  than  Muslim

marriages   shall   be  registered   under   the

Ordinance.  The  Bill  requires  that  before  a

marriage can be solemnized, the parties  to  the

marriage   must  either  give  notice   to   the

Registrar of Marriages and:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) obtain from him a certificate for

marriage, or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) obtain a licence from the Minister.



<br><br>The   Registrar  of  Marriages   may   issue   a

certificate for marriage at any time  after  the

expiration  of 21 days and before the expiration

of three months from the date of the notice. But

before issuing the certificate for marriage, the

Registrar of Marriages has to satisfy himself:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) that one of the parties to the marriage

has  been  resident in Singapore at least  15

days   preceding   the   granting   of    the

certificate;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) that both the parties are 18 years or over;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) that if either of the parties is under

21  years old, the consent of the parent or

guardian has been obtained or validly dispensed

with;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) that there is no impediment of kindred or

affinity or any other lawful hindrance to the

marriage; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) that neither of the parties is already

married under any law, religion, custom  or

usage to any other person.

<br><br>

If  the  parent or guardian of the minor refuses

his  consent to a marriage, application  can  le

made  to the Registrar of Marriages and  to  the

High Court for the consent to be dispensed with.

It  is made an offence for a person to compel  a

person  to marry against his will, or to prevent

a  person  who has attained the age of 21  years

from   contracting  a  valid  marriage.  It   is

possible for persons who have valid grounds  for

objection to a marriage to do so by caveat.  The

validity of the objection will be decided by the

Registrar  of Marriages subject to an appeal  to

the  High  Court. It is made an  offence  for  a

person    to    make   false    statements    or

representations in a caveat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, upon being satisfied that there is no lawful impediment to a marriage and that

the  necessary consent to the marriage has  been

obtained or validly dispensed with, may dispense

with the giving of notice and issue a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



certificate  for  marriage  and  may  grant  his

licence for the marriage. The Minister may  also

grant  a  licence where the female party  to  be

married is under 18 years of age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a certificate for marriage from the

Registrar  of  Marriages or a licence  from  the

Minister has been obtained, the parties can have

the  marriage solemnized either by the Registrar

of  Marriages or by any person licensed  by  the

Minister  to solemnize marriages. Marriages  may

be  solemnized by the Registrar of Marriages  at

his  office,  or  by a licensed  person  at  any

place,  for  example, a church, a  temple  or  a

club.  The  Bill does not lay down  any  special

requirements  for  the  solemnization   of   the

marriage except that it requires the parties  to

give  their  consent to the marriage freely  and

before  at  least two witnesses. Marriages  can,

therefore,   if   so  desired,   be   solemnized

according  to  the ceremony of the  religion  to

which the parties belong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a marriage has been solemnized, it must

be  registered. Where the marriage is solemnized

by  the Registrar of Marriages, he himself  will

register  the  marriage. Where the  marriage  is

solemnized by a licensed person, the parties  to

the   marriage  are  required  to  register  the

marriage by giving the prescribed particulars to

a   Deputy   Registrar  of   Marriages.   Deputy

Registrars of Marriages will be appointed by the

Minister and may, for example, be the Head of  a

Church  denomination or the Head  of  a  Temple.

Penalties  are provided for failure to  register

and   for  giving  false  particulars   of   any

marriage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that all marriages

solemnized in Singapore and registered under the

Ordinance  will be monogamous and will  continue

in force until dissolved by death or an Order of

the  Court. The Bill also provides that  persons

who  are  married whether to one or more spouses

on  the  2nd  of March, 1960 (the  date  of  the

introduction  of  the Bill)  will  be  incapable

during  the  continuance  of  such  marriage  or

marriages  from contracting any valid  marriage.

Where  a  person who is married to one  or  more

spouses on the 2nd of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



March, 1960, ceases to be married to such spouse

or  to  all such spouses and thereafter  marries

again,  he will during the continuance  of  such

marriage  be incapable of contracting any  valid

marriage.  Similarly,  where  a  person  who  is

unmarried  on  the  2nd of March  1960,  marries

after that date, he will be incapable during the

continuance of such marriage of contracting  any

other marriage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date, 2nd March 1960, has been chosen so

as to prevent people from contracting polygamous

marriages  between the date of  introduction  of

the  Bill  and  the  date  of  the  coming  into

operation of the Ordinance. The Bill applies  to

persons who are resident in Singapore and to all

persons  who are domiciled in Singapore but  are

resident   outside  Singapore.  The  Bill   also

provides that such persons who, on the  date  of

the  coming into operation of the Ordinance, are

lawfully  married  in  Singapore  and   in   the

Federation  of  Malaya under any law,  religion,

custom or usage, shall, if such marriage has not

been  registered  under the  provisions  of  any

written law in Singapore or of any enactment  in

the  Federation of Malaya, apply within one year

of  the date of the coming into operation of the

Ordinance   to  have  the  marriage  registered.

Failure  to  do  so  is  made  an  offence,  and

provision is made for the settlement of disputes

relating to the existence of such marriages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions of the Bill re-enact,

with  amendments,  provisions  of  the  existing

Ordinance  in Singapore. The rights  of  married

women  in  regard  to their property  and  their

person  are  set  out  in  this  Bill.  The  law

relating   to  the  maintenance  of  wives   and

children  has been amended to give  the  wife  a

right to maintenance in certain cases, and  also

to  give  the  Court the discretion  as  to  the

amount  of maintenance to be given to legitimate

and  illegitimate children alike. The provisions

of  the  existing  law for  the  enforcement  of

maintenance orders, by the making of attachments

of  earnings orders to be served on and complied

with by the employers of the persons ordered  to

pay maintenance, are re-enacted and extended  to

maintenance orders made by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



the  High  Court  in  divorce  proceedings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

provisions  of  the  existing  law  relating  to

divorce  are also re-enacted, but the  Court  is

given jurisdiction to grant divorce in the  case

of  marriages  registered under  the  Ordinance,

including   customary  or  religious   marriages

celebrated  before the coming into operation  of

the Ordinance. The Court is also given powers to

exercise jurisdiction in certain cases where the

wife  is  resident  in Singapore,  although  the

husband  is  not  domiciled  in  Singapore.  The

grounds  for  divorce, nullity of  marriage  and

judicial  separation remain the same as  in  the

existing law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the existing law relating to offences

against  women and girls is re-enacted, but  the

provisions of the law have been strengthened and

the   punishments  for  the  offence  have  been

increased. It can be hoped with confidence  that

the  Women's Charter will not only maintain  but

will  also increase and safeguard the rights  of

women. It is felt that, because of the wide  and

far-reaching implications of the Bill, it should

be  referred  to  a  Select  Committee,  and   I

therefore shall propose, when the Bill is read a

Second time, to move that it be so referred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  regarding  the  Women's  Charter

which  was introduced by the Minister for Labour

and  Law  at the last Assembly sitting,  with  a

view  to  improving the lot of women, I  support

the  motion  of the Minister. This  Charter,  as

drafted  has incorporated some of the provisions

of   a   number  of  Ordinances.  It  has   also

incorporated  the  opinions  of  the  people  of

Singapore.  It  has also adopted  those  of  the

existing laws in China, which have some  merits.

Therefore,  I believe the Minister has  improved

this   Bill,   which   is  applicable   to   and

practicable  for  the people of Singapore.  This

Bill, I believe, will receive the support of all

sections of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental principle of the Women's Charter

is   to   enable   women  to  have  their   rights

safeguarded by legislation, and to give people far-reaching stability in marriages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marriage system provides for monogamy to

enable  both  the husband and the  wife  to  enjoy

equal  status  in  their  matrimonial  life.   The

previous  evil custom will vanish with the  coming

into operation of this Charter The passing of this

Women's Charter will not only enable women  to  be

safeguarded  in law but will also  bring  about  a

revolutionary  change in society  on  a  practical

basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the House, I wish to point out

that  the  fundamental principle of  this  Women's

Charter is twofold. The problems of women are  the

result of an unreasonable society. Men take  women

as  pieces of merchandise. The inhuman feudalistic

system  has deprived women of their rights.  In  a

semi-colonial  and semi-feudalistic  society,  the

tragedy  of women was very common. Men could  have

three   or   four  spouses.  Men  are   considered

honourable, but women are considered mean. It  was

common  in  those days to regard having  one  more

female   in   a  Chinese  family  as  being   very

despicable.  Women in our society are like  pieces

of meat put on the table for men to slice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P Government has made a promise. We

cannot  allow  this inequality in  the  family  to

exist in this country. We will liberate women from

the  hands  of the oppressor. With the passing  of

this  legislation, women can contribute their part

to the country. Our country has now obtained self-

government.  To  safeguard the  stability  of  our

parliamentary democracy, we must first of all have

internal  stability. We must put  our  society  in

order.   Only   then   can   we   safeguard    our

parliamentary   democracy.  On  the   whole,   the

matrimonial system plays a very important part  in

the  social  order.  There is a  Chinese  proverb,

which  says  that if every family has  matrimonial

harmony,  then  we  can control the  country.  The

people in the old days abused marriages. They took

to marriages as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



schoolboy  would  take to playing.  The  rich  had

their way with marriages. This created disorder in

the  society,  and  the women  rose  against  this

unreasonable social system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore under the colonial government,

marriages  were  given a feudalistic  aspect.  The

ideals behind marriage were not respected. In this

new  society there are many people who  have  many

wives.  To the rich people, their wives are  their

property.  But  to  the  poor, things  are   very

difficult.  These  are due  to  the  bad  marriage

system  and it also affects our society. In  order

to show respect for marriage, we must have a sound

marriage system. Of course, to depend only upon  a

law  to  get  rid of all these bad  practices  and

customs  is  very difficult, because marriages  in

Singapore have not been put on a proper basis  for

many  years. It takes a very long time to  educate

the people to regard marriage in the proper light.

Only  then  can we have a good and sound  marriage

system.  Only  then can we solve  the  problem  of

marriages  and the relationships between  men  and

women.



<br><br>4.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  principle of one man  one  wife  is  an

excellent  one,  and  I  wish  to  compliment  the

Minister  for  Labour and Law for his  attempt  to

implement  this  principle  through  the   Women's

Charter.  I am glad to hear that he is  trying  to

maintain and increase women's rights. If  all  the

men  in  Singapore have the same concern  for  the

welfare  of  women, probably we will  not  need  a

Women's  Charter; probably it will be the men  who

will  be  the meat on the table to be sliced,  and

become merchandise to be purchased! However,  Sir,

the   question   is,  does  the  Women's   Charter

implement this principle of one man one  wife?  If

so, are the clauses in the Charter the best method

of  implementing it? Instead of restricting a  man

to  one  wife, the Charter makes it legal for  the

man  who  has  got more than one wife  before  2nd

March,  1960, to have as many wives as  he  likes,

provided he has not missed the boat by 2nd  March,

1960!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fact which I find difficult to understand

is  that,  while  one  clause  compels  people  to

register their marriages - it even imposes a fine up

to  a maximum of $3,000, or a maximum period of  3

years' imprisonment - in another clause (clause  32)

it  gives  no  legal  effect to the  registration.

Clause 32 states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing in this Ordinance or rules made

thereunder shall be construed to render  valid  or

invalid merely by reason of its having been or not

having   been   registered  any   marriage   which

otherwise is invalid or valid."

<br><br>

Sir,  if it does not give extra legal status, then

why  compel a man to register his marriage? I also

feel,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that this Bill  does  not

deserve  the  name  of "Women's  Charter".  To  be

worthy  of  that  name, a Women's  Charter  should

uplift  the status of women not only in one field,

but  in  all fields, such as political,  economic,

social,    legal,    civil,    educational     and

professional.  This Charter only  deals  with  the

civil  rights of women. It merely touches  on  one

aspect of the economic right, and that is property

right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A problem which has been worrying women ever

since  1948  is that of equal pay for equal  work.

This  has  not  been touched on at  all.  Thirteen

countries   in  the  world  have  rectified   that

principle  and  have  made  it  law.  The   United

Kingdom,   unfortunately,  have  been  unable   to

implement totally this principle of equal pay  for

equal work because of economic circumstances.  But

they  are doing it step by step and they  hope  to

implement   it  completely  by  1965.  A   Women's

Charter,  I feel, should at least take  the  first

step  towards the principle of equal pay for equal

work,  even if it is not able to implement totally

the principle.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr  DEPUTY  SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy)  in  the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Indonesia has a woman Minister for Social

Affairs and a woman Minister for Labour. India has

a  woman  in  the Cabinet, a woman member  on  the

National Planning Commission, a woman delegate  to

the  United Nations. She is not only on one of its

Commissions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



but she is also a delegate to the General Assembly

of  the  United Nations. This woman has  now  been

elected  President of the General Assembly.  India

also  has an Ambassador to the Court of St. James.

The Philippines has a woman member in the Cabinet,

a   woman   Ambassador,  a  woman  Consul-General,

several  women  Judges of the Supreme  Court,  and

prosecuting attorneys. Scores of women,  Sir,  are

holding   very   high  political,   judicial   and

administrative posts in many Asian countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Sir, may I ask how many women are

holding   such   high  posts  in  the   judiciary,

administrative or Governmental departments? Why is

there  not  even  one woman Minister  amongst  the

Ministers? Probably the answer is that  the  women

in   Singapore   do  not  possess  the   necessary

qualifications.  If  this  is  true,  should   the

Women's  Charter not provide education  for  girls

and women so as to equip them for such high posts?

If  the  Charter is worthy of its name, should  it

not  provide opportunities for women so that  they

could rise to such posts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the U.N.E.S.C.O. Conference held in Paris

on   3rd  and  4th  of  November  last  year,   78

representatives     of     50     non-governmental

organisations recommended the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enforcement of compulsory education for girls

where it exists and its institutions where it does

not yet exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special assistance for girls' education in the

form  of scholarships and grants. Organisation  of

vocational guidance and increase in the number  of

girls'  vocational schools especially  adapted  to

the  needs  of  modern  society.  Organisation  of

seasonal courses in certain areas or of travelling

schools.  Use  of audio-visual aids  as  temporary

substitutes  for  schools. Use  of  propaganda  to

change parents' attitude to inspire girls to  want

an  education  and to favour women's participation

in  various professions, especially in the  higher

echelons."

<br><br>

Sir,  I realise that not all those recommendations

are  adaptable to conditions in Singapore,  but  a

Women's  Charter  should make  some  provision  to

improve the education of women - (a) to prepare them

for holding the high posts which they deserve, and

(b) to prepare them for showing the responsibility

that they should show, and also to enable them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



to  make  wise use of the rights that  have  been

granted  to women. I believe the hon.  Lady  from

Delta has stressed the importance of education. I

associate  myself with that statement.  Education

for women is very important, as they represent 50

per  cent of the population of Singapore; and  if

the  Government wishes to have contributions from

them,   they   certainly  must  have   sufficient

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point in the Charter, which may cause

some  confusion, Sir, is the expression "lawfully

married  under  any  law,  religion,  custom   or

usage".  Sir,  this so-called Chinese  custom  or

usage in marriage ranges from a grand ceremony of

12  days  to a simple burning of two candles  and

three joss-sticks. The burning of two candles and

three joss-sticks does not necessarily constitute

a  wedding. Sometimes this is a daily practice of

obeisance  in some homes. Would it  not  then  be

possible  for  the  man,  who  has  picked  up  a

prostitute from a brothel and has lived with  her

for  a short time, to be forced into marriage  by

this prostitute, because he has gone through this

act  of burning two candles and three joss-sticks

probably  as a daily obeisance? But,  as  I  have

said, it could also sometimes be interpreted as a

wedding  ceremony.  Moreover,  Sir,  is  it   not

possible  that  this  prostitute  may,  if   this

Charter is passed and her marriage registered, be

granted  the same legal status as the  honourable

and  legal first wife and be given the same right

to  the man's property as the legal wife? Surely,

it is not the intention of the Charter to protect

prostitutes and mistresses at the expense of  the

honourable legal wives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another confusion which the Charter might create

is  in cases such as this, Sir. Let us take a man

who  marries a Chinese girl here. Let us  say  he

went through the 12-day grand ceremony. After  30

years,  he  goes  to Europe and marries  a  young

European   girl.  He  naturally  registers   that

marriage. Now, this Charter says he must register

his  other marriage or marriages. As far as  that

Chinese wife



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



is concerned, she is still the legal wife. As far

as  the  public is concerned, she  is  still  the

legal wife, and on the death of that man, she  is

entitled to claim part of his property. If she is

registered  today, she may be forced  to  go  and

live  with the second wife. If she does not, then

after three years the man can claim desertion and

divorce  her.  She thus loses all  her  right  to

claim his property. Moreover, would the fact that

her   marriage  has  been  registered  after  the

registration of the marriage between her  husband

and that other young girl in Europe make her, who

was   married   30   years  ago   and   by   whom

grandchildren  have  been born,  a  second  wife,

because  her  marriage has been registered  after

her  husband's  marriage with the European  wife?

Granted    that   this   legislation    legalises

illegitimate  children - which  is  a  good   thing

because  children should not suffer for the  sins

of  their parents - I do hope that the Minister  (I

am  sure he is capable of doing it) will  find  a

better way of helping these illegitimate children

in  getting out of this situation and helping the

women without penalising or making the first  and

legal  wife  suffer.  They have  suffered  enough

mental torment and social humiliation already.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another boomerang, Sir, which might

hit  the  women  if this Charter  is  passed.  At

present, no court of law will grant a decree  for

divorce  on  a marriage which has been solemnized

by  a  national  custom, no  matter  whether  the

husband  marries or keeps 10 wives.  Even  if  he

deserts  her and does not live with her,  on  his

death  she  could claim his property and  in  the

public  eyes  she  is still his wife.  She  still

holds  that prestige provided she is not  married

to  another man. Now, she is required to register

her marriage and, as I have mentioned before, she

might be forced to go and live with the secondary

wives,  otherwise the charge of  desertion  after

three years might make it possible for the man to

divorce her. Is this not a boomerang on the first

wives?  If  this  Charter is passed,  Sir,  I  am

afraid the mothers in Singapore will have to wear

sack cloth and go into mourning - to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



mourn for the death of a mother's privilege and  a

mother's right. If any mother dares to threaten to

disown her son or daughter who is over 20 years of

age, if he or she marries a person she disapproves

of,  clause  35 makes her liable on conviction  to

three years' imprisonment or a fine of $3,000,  or

both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this does not only deprive a woman of a

mother's  right  but also of her human  right.  It

would not be inappropriate, Sir, to describe  this

Charter as the rich women's charter, as they  seem

to  be  the only people who could possibly benefit

by it. By registering her marriage, whether she be

the  first, second, third or tenth wife,  provided

she  has  been  a wife before 2nd March,  1960,  a

woman  will  strengthen her  claim  on  the  man's

property.  As  far  as  the  poor  man's  wife  is

concerned,  she has no property to claim.  Neither

is  there a likelihood that her husband will  take

another   wife,  because  he  already   finds   it

difficult  to  feed  his  one  wife  and   several

children, and another woman would not want  to  be

his second wife just for the sake of starving.  It

is  the rich man's wife who lives in fear that her

husband  would  indulge himself in the  luxury  of

having  more than one wife. But poor  or  rich,  a

woman  will  be  required to spend nearly  $20  in

registration fees, photographs, her own transport,

her  husband's  transport and  transport  for  the

witnesses. Probably this is only a fleabite to the

rich woman, especially when the bait of inheriting

a  big  property is in view. But to a poor family,

it  might  mean  a  month's pocket-money  for  the

children,  or  a  month's  market  money  for  the

family.  Why should the poor children be  deprived

of  their  pocket money, or the poor housewife  of

her  market  money so as to enable  the  wives  of

millionaires   to  strengthen  their   claims   on

properties?  Why should the poor be exploited  for

the benefit of the rich? Why should they sacrifice

a  day's  earnings to queue up at the Registration

Office  and  spend nearly $20 just to  enable  the

wives  of  millionaires to inherit a fortune?  Why

should  a  poor  couple who are probably  over  80

years  of  age,  go  through the inconvenience  of

travelling perhaps 10 miles and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



queuing up for a whole day for the benefit of  the

millionaires'  wives? Who is the  Women's  Charter

supposed  to cater for? The poor masses of  women,

or  the  handful of rich men's wives?  I  suggest,

Sir,  that  registration for those married  before

the  2nd of March be made optional. Those who feel

that  they are going to benefit by it can register

their  marriage. The Minister, I know, is  capable

enough  of  inserting clauses into the Charter  so

that  those  men  who  refuse  to  register  their

marriages when they should do so would not  escape

registration. The poor to whom it can  only  be  a

burden  and  nothing  else should  be  spared  the

ordeal.   However,  if  Government  insists   that

registration for those who were married before 2nd

March  be  made  compulsory,  then  may  I  humbly

suggest that the registration fee be just a  token

payment of one dollar instead of, I believe it  to

be (at present) $14, that the identity card number

be  used  for identification purposes instead  of

photographs, so that a poor couple will  not  have

to  go  into  unnecessary  expenditure,  and  that

registration  be decentralised so  that  the  poor

people   can  walk  to  the  registration  centres

instead  of  travelling  several  miles?  As  many

centres  as possible should be organised  so  that

the   poor  people  need  not  waste  their  day's

earnings queuing up to register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter in its present form not only

deprives  the honourable first and legal  wife  of

her privileged position as the wife, not only does

it create some confusion by contradictory clauses,

not  only does it exploit the poor for the benefit

of  the rich, not only does it rob a mother of her

prestige  and  rights, but it  is  in  itself  too

insufficient  to  be worthy of  the  name  of  the

Women's Charter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest, Sir, that it be referred to a

Select Committee, because the principle of one man

one   wife  is  a  very  important  and  essential

principle,  and  its  implementation   will   make

history.  We  should  therefore  ensure  that  the

dignity and prestige which the Charter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



deserves  is not destroyed by rushing  it  through

without first ensuring that all avenues have  been

explored to make it as near perfect as possible.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I rise in support of the principle of one man

one  wife  as embodied in the Women's  Charter.  I

personally  do  not  believe that  any  reasonable

person  could oppose the idea that one man  should

have  only  one wife. The People's Action  Party's

stand  on this matter has had the full support  of

the  people of Singapore, as this was one  of  the

election issues of our Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  that  this Bill is introduced primarily  for

the  purpose  of  regularising the  position  with

regard to monogamy. I believe that all the Members

in  this  House  support  the  idea  of  monogamy.

However,  there  is a very big difference  between

believing  in  an idea in a rather vague  sort  of

way,  and  making legal provisions  to  regularise

such beliefs. In Singapore, it is unfortunate that

the situation arises in which any marriage, unless

it is conducted under Christian rites or under the

provisions of the Civil Marriage Ordinance, can be

regarded    as   a   polygamous   marriage.    The

transitional problems that arise out of legalising

monogamy are therefore legend and varied, and  may

indeed   lead  to  certain  unavoidable  or   even

sometimes   somewhat   amusing   situations.   For

instance,   in   attempting   to   implement   the

provisions of monogamy, it is necessary to require

all  married people whose marriages have not  been

conducted  under  Christian  rites  or  under  the

provisions  of  the  Civil Marriage  Ordinance  to

register.  Every married man (unless his  marriage

has been registered) would be required to register

his  wife or wives, and thus the amusing situation

arises,   as   mentioned   by   the   Member   for

Mountbatten, wherein the Government, in attempting

to  legalise monogamy, has actually legalised  the

existing polygamous marriages in the case  of  the

married man with more than one wife.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that there

are   many   other  similar  transitory   teething

problems  which the Bill as it is has created.  In

committing  the  Bill to a Select  Committee,  the

Government  is  ready  to listen  to  constructive

proposals  as  to  how  to avoid  such  transitory

difficulties. On the principle of the  Bill,  Sir,

of  one man one wife the Government is irrevocably

committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the principle of the Bill without

reservation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  it may seem strange  that  we  men

should  rise to speak for a Charter that seeks  to

prevent the wandering encroachments of the male. I

am  saying  this,  Sir, not  merely  to  gain  the

affection  of my wife but as a general  principle,

which all decent-thinking men should follow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally recognised that women, though

the  equal  of  men  in many respects,  are  still

physically  much the weaker sex. Women  are  still

too  exposed to the economic and moral  forces - or,

shall  I  say,  the immoral forces - in  this  cruel

world  of  ours. Accordingly, it becomes necessary

for  society  to seek provisions to protect  these

women  from  the  clutches of  certain  men.  They

especially  need  the protection of  a  Government

which  is  working towards a more equal  and  just

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. stand on this, Sir, is too well known

to need repetition, it is in the Five-Year Plan. I

would  like  to point out, however, that  although

many have mouthed platitudes about the rights  and

equalities of women, it has become the duty of the

P.A.P.  Government  to implement  what  a  lot  of

people have talked about so much. It has been left

to  the P.A.P. to take up the cudgels on behalf of

the women, pioneer their just cause, treat them as

true  equals,  and  enshrine this  equality  in  a

concrete and tangible form, in what we have before

the House today - the Women's Charter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Sir, may I answer a couple of

points  raised by the Member for Mountbatten?  She

said  a little while ago that women have not  been

given the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



opportunity  for  higher education  so  that  they

might  be better equipped to perform higher duties

like  Ministership  or fill higher  posts  in  the

Government. Surely, everybody knows that education

in  this country is free, that everybody can go to

any  higher seat of education to equip himself  or

herself so that ultimately every person will  have

an  equal chance. In view of our present policy of

giving  equal treatment to all the streams and  to

males  and females, surely that would be a  proper

answer to the Member for Mountbatten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned a little while ago about

registration and how it would make this Charter  a

rich  woman's Charter because the poor woman would

have  to  spend  a  lot of money going  about  and

ultimately  wasting a lot of time and  spending  a

lot of money which she might not be able to spare.

Perhaps  the Member for Mountbatten is a  bit  too

quick  in  prejudging the issue. Surely she  knows

that today we are only talking about the principle

of  the  Bill and that the actual running  of  the

registration  of  marriages  will  ultimately   be

decided  upon after due consideration. Surely  she

is  not trying to teach the Government what to do.

The P.A.P. Government knows more than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Like what?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, it will no longer be

necessary now for women to fight their own battles

all alone. The whole weight of the State machinery

will  be  brought  to  bear on  those  anti-social

elements who seek to enslave women to their  whims

and  fancies. Only too often, Sir, do we  hear  of

stories  and unfortunate cases where a  mother  of

several children is left destitute and to fend for

herself  and  her  children  by  some  errant  and

irresponsible  husband;  or  where  an   expectant

mother  finds out all too late that she  has  been

led   up  the  garden  path,  that  her  so-called

marriage with the man is not legally binding,  and

that  she has been tricked into the position of  a

subservient,  clandestine  mistress.  The  Women's

Charter will help to rectify all these anomalies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in spite of all this in the Charter,

there will still be women who will be weak and who

will  be  greedy enough to succumb to  temptation;

and  there will be women who will lead men astray,

though  this  in  most  cases  is  not  absolutely

necessary. However, as our country is just on  the

threshold  of  a  new era and will  need  all  the

energy and help from all quarters - male as well  as

female - in the gigantic task of nation building, it

might be advisable for those who are blessed  with

more zest and vitamins in their system than may be

good  for  them,  to  re-channel  their  exuberant

energy   into  other  socially  useful  and   non-population    increasing   types   of   productive

occupations.  The  practice of the  noble  art  of

sexual sublimation will serve as a shining example

to  our  future generations and will also  lighten

very  much  the  burden  of  the  Family  Planning

Association. It is a long cry, Sir, from primitive

communism  and  polygamy  as  had  been  practised

throughout the ages in various parts of the world.

Customs   die   hard,  but  in   all   progressive

countries,  the  one  man  one  wife   system   of

marriages  is  the  recognised  social  order.  In

embodying this principle in the Statute  Book,  we

are merely reflecting the current and modern views

of  society. The Women's Charter has become an all

in one and a one to one Women's Bill of Rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what the Member for Mountbatten has

intimated,  I will even go so far as to  say  that

this  Women's Charter, which is before  the  House

today,  will  find, as various other  charters  in

other parts of the world have found, the same kind

of  place - that  is,  as a permanent  monument  and

milestone -   in the history of social struggle  for

the betterment of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Charter wholeheartedly.



<br><br>4.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe many

men  support  many  things for many  reasons.  The

Member  for Queenstown supports this Bill.  So  it

seems  he  still wants to retain the affection  of

his wife! That is a good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



reason,  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can think  of

no  better  reason for supporting this Bill  than

that advanced by the Member for Queenstown. I  do

not know how many of the Members in this Assembly

are  placed in the position where they could have

taken  more than one wife if they had wished  to.

Speaking for myself, I am in the position where I

can  only  take  one wife, which I  have  already

done. So the implications of the Bill, in so  far

as  I am personally concerned, do not affect  me.

Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, perhaps, I am in a

better  position  to look upon  this  Bill  in  a

completely objective and detached manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of one man one wife and, if I may

say  so, one woman one husband, is acceptable  to

all  of  us. But what some of us on this side  of

the  House  are  worried about is the  manner  in

which this Bill has been drafted and whether some

of   its  provisions  are  really  in  the   best

interests  of both men and women as such.  As  it

says in clause 3, this Bill is designed to "apply

to  all  persons resident in Singapore and  shall

also  apply to all persons domiciled in Singapore

who  are  resident outside Singapore." Therefore,

the  scope  of  the Bill is to take  in  everyone

living in Singapore, be he a Singapore citizen or

otherwise; and also to take in Singapore citizens

or  people  who  are domiciled in  Singapore  and

living  outside. There is a further provision  in

sub-clause  (2)  of  clause  3  which  says  that

certain  provisions "of this Ordinance shall  not

apply  to any person who is married under, or  to

any  marriage solemnized or registered under, the

provisions  of the Muslims Ordinance, 1957."  The

Minister  has  made a statement  that  this  Bill

shall  in  no  way  affect any Muslim  living  in

Singapore. I am going to suggest to the  Minister

that, as drafted, it does take in some Muslims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bill

affects   all  persons  resident  in   Singapore.

Therefore,  the  Federation  Muslims  living   in

Singapore  come within the ambit of  this  Bill,

because sub-clause (2)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



of  clause 3 exempts only Muslims who are married

under  the  provisions of the Muslims  Ordinance,

1957.  Federation  Muslims,  married  under   the

Muslim  laws in the Federation and who come  into

Singapore   are   apparently  affected   by   the

provisions  of  this Bill. What the  consequences

are is not as intended by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Deputy Speaker, the point I wish

to  touch  upon  is clause 45.  This  clause  and

clause  166  are  the  two  clauses,  which   can

probably  be called the Women's Charter,  because

every  other provision (except for the  provision

which  says "No person shall marry more than  one

wife  after  the  2nd day of March")  is  already

contained in the existing provisions of  our  law

in  this  State. Therefore, clause  45  is  worth

reading out to Members of this House, because  it

is  really the meat of the Bill. Clause 45  reads

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) The solemnization of marriage creates a

conjugal union between the husband and wife  and

they  thereby  mutually bind themselves  to  co-

operate  with  each  other in  safeguarding  the

interests  of  the  union  and  in  caring   and

providing for the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The husband and the wife shall have the

right  separately  to  engage  in  any  trade  or

profession or in social activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The wife shall have the right to use her

own surname and name separately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The husband and the wife shall have equal

rights   in   the  running  of  the  matrimonial

household and in the ownership and management of

the family properties."



<br><br>Now, let us examine clause 45, sub-clause by sub-clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) The solemnization of marriage creates a

conjugal union between the husband and wife". The

Women's Charter is not going to create that. When

a  man and a woman join together in matrimony, be

it  holy  or otherwise, it does create a conjugal

union.  So  we  really do not  need  the  Women's

Charter to tell us that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and they thereby mutually bind

themselves  to  co-operate  with  each  other  in

safeguarding  the interests of the union  and  in

caring  and providing for the children."  I  will

admit  that this goes beyond the law  as  it  now

exists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



The  law,  Mr Deputy Speaker, as I understand  it

now,  is that once a marriage takes place,  it  is

not  only the right and privilege, but it is  also

the duty of the husband to look after his wife and

his  children. The legal liability to maintain the

wife and children fairly and squarely rests on the

shoulders  of the husband and on no other  person.

But  the  Bill,  in  seeking  to  create  equality

between man and woman in marriage, allows  the  wo

man  to  share  the  financial  responsibility  of

looking after both herself and her husband and her

children.  Does  the  Government  really  want  to

change the law in that respect? If this Bill  goes

through as it is, that will be the net result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (2):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The husband and the wife shall have the right

separately to engage in any trade or profession"-



<br><br>that is the law as it now exists, but something

has been added to the clause, which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"or in social activities."



<br><br>This  apparently is some new right to be conferred

on  the women of Singapore - that after this Charter

has  been  passed, they are going to have complete

equality  in  so  far  as  social  activities  are

concerned. What these "social activities"  are  it

is  difficult  to  know. As I understand  it,  Mr

Deputy  Speaker, "social activities" might mean  a

number of things. It might mean the mahjong table;

it  might  mean the dance floor; it might  mean  a

number  of things in which the wife will  socially

amuse herself. Any activity, which provides social

amusement to any person, I understand, is a social

activity.  Therefore, if the wife  wants  to  play

mahjong  at  8 o'clock at night, she  says,  "Look

here,  darling, I am off to a game of mahjong."  I

am  afraid  the  poor husband will then  be  quite

helpless  to  do  anything about it,  because  the

Charter  says complete equality of rights  to  the

mahjong  table.  That, as I look  at  it,  is  the

interpretation    of   the   expression    "social

activities". Perhaps the Minister might have  some

other interpretation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (3) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wife shall have the right to use her own

surname and name separately."

rights in the running of the matrimonial household

and  in the ownership and management of the family

properties."



<br><br>This  is  more serious. Quite frankly, Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  I  do  not quite follow the  meaning  of

this. The implications of this sub-clause could be

very  drastic. Some of the phrases used  are  such

that  they  cut  across the  whole  conception  of

property  and operation of the law of property  in

Singapore.  "The husband and the wife  shall  have

equal  rights  in  the running of the  matrimonial

household" - now what exactly does that mean?  I  do

not know, but it could mean a number of things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Half the bed!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Well, it could mean half the bed, Mr

Deputy  Speaker. It could mean many other  things.

The  law as it now stands is that in so far as the

matrimonial  household is  concerned,  it  is  the

husband that is the master. He is the guardian  of

his children. He is by law obliged to maintain the

matrimonial household according to the best of his

means  and according to his status. If it  is  the

intention that a person has equal rights, then  it

must  also  mean equal duties? Does it mean  then,

after  this  Charter has been passed,  that  women

will become financially liable in equal shares? If

that  is  the intention, I wonder what  the  women

opposite and behind me think of it!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . . and in the ownership and management of

the family properties." "family properties" is not

defined. "family properties" is a phrase which  is

not  known in our system of law. Therefore, it  is

very  difficult  to know what it  is  intended  to

mean, because the succeeding clauses, particularly

from clause 47 onwards, keep on talking about  the

separate property of a married woman.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



Any  property  that she has before  marriage,  any

property that she gains by virtue of her work,  or

profession,  or  business,  remains  her  separate

property, and the man cannot touch it. So it is  a

bit  difficult to understand how "the husband  and

wife shall have equal rights in the running of the

matrimonial  household and in  the  ownership  and

management of the family properties". Perhaps  the

Minister has an explanation. If he has, I shall be

obliged  for  it,  but  at the  moment  I  see  no

explanation  for  it, and I do not  know  how  the

Courts  are going to interpret the phrase  "family

properties".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clause, which, I think, is part and

parcel of the Women's Charter and which, in  fact,

really  puts this Bill beyond the existing law  is

clause  166. This clause provides for transitional

provisions regarding those gentlemen who have been

fortunate  enough - or  unfortunate  enough - to  have

married  more than one. This clause says that  all

such  persons must register their marriages within

a  year  of  the  coming  into  operation  of  the

Ordinance.  As  drafted, Mr Deputy  Speaker,  the

obligation to register not only lies on the  male,

but also on the female. So if the female wishes to

have  her marriage registered, she may do  so.  If

she does not do it, then of course she herself  is

liable  to imprisonment for three years  or  to  a

fine not exceeding $3,000. This, of course, is the

other end of the Charter, which gets her round the

neck.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the Minister has agreed that this Bill

should  go to a Select Committee, because  my  own

view  is  that, while supporting the principle  of

one  man one wife, and one woman one husband,  the

conceptions  in this Bill with regard  to  "family

properties"  and matrimonial household"  are  such

that  they  should be carefully  examined  in  the

Select  Committee  with  a  view  to  finding  out

whether they do not cut across, or are in conflict

with, the existing provisions of the law as we now

know it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last matter on which I would like to touch,

Mr Deputy Speaker, is this. Long before this Bill

reached the hands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



of the Members of the Assembly, we, the Members of

the  Assembly, read the full details of this  Bill

in  the  Press.  How the Press got  hold  of  the

provisions  of the Bill I am not in a position  to

say.  The Minister might be able to tell the House

how it was that, in breach of the privilege of the

House  to look at the legislation first, the Press

was  able  to get hold of the provisions  of  this

Bill long before the Members were able to.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, as one of the women of Singapore,  I

gladly  agree  with  the  stand  adopted  by   the

Government when moving the Second Reading of  this

Bill,  which is to raise the status of and  obtain

rights for the women as we have promised. Most  of

the  provisions in this Bill are the same as those

in  existing laws. In principle, we fully  believe

that  the  Bill will suit the people,  because  it

takes care of their welfare. The P.A.P. Government

has  promised  to fulfil the people's  desire  for

improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the beginning of the many steps, which

we  will take towards solving women's problems. In

the  past  people have exploited women.  From  the

eighteenth  century, women's  problems  have  been

discussed  again and again. After  two  centuries,

these  problems are still fresh in  the  minds  of

many  people. Although for a long time in  history

we  have  tried  to solve women's  problems,  they

still  remain  to be solved. The reason  is  this.

Women's problems are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



easily  solved. It is very difficult to solve  all

these  problems just by passing a Bill. Only after

other  social problems are solved can the  women's

problems be solved. In a society where people  are

exploited,  it  is very difficult to  solve  these

problems. Only after a socialist society has  been

established  can women's problems be  solved.  The

P.A.P. Government is trying its best to help solve

these  problems. These problems are,  among  other

things,  economic, educational and moral in  their

nature. The solving of these problems is only  the

first  step  taken  towards  solving  the  women's

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore and in the Federation of Malaya, it

is  very  common to see villagers,  both  men  and

women, going out to work early in the morning  and

coming  home  late in the evening. They  are  very

busy. Women are very important in the life of  the

family. They take a direct part in laborious work.

They work together with the men, and they help  to

shoulder   the   family   responsibilities.    The

important  thing  for them is  how  to  share  the

fruits  of  their  labour,  irrespective  of   the

problems  of distance and transport. We  must  let

them enjoy the fruits of their labour and not  let

them  be exploited by middlemen. They must not  be

restricted  by  conventional  rules  and  customs.

Although their intellectual standard is low,  they

must try to improve themselves every day. What  we

have  to  do is to see that they are not exploited

again,  and that they must not be deprived of  the

facilities  of education. I give this example  not

with  the  idea of saying that village  women  and

other  women workers want to have greater  respect

shown  to them, but in order to show that  women's

problems are closely related to other problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some women want equality with men, but they do

not  take  part  in laborious work,  nor  do  they

cultivate  their abilities and their talents.  The

mere  passing  of  a  law cannot  change  people's

attitude  towards them. It is useless  to  improve

the   society   if   the  women   cannot   improve

themselves. I want to tell the House  that  we  do

not  face  these  problems realistically - in  other

words,  if we do not change our social system  but

only pass a single law in order to solve the pro-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



blems  of women or to raise their status  - then  it

will be completely useless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to tell all women that if we do not play

a positive part in the work of changing the social

system,  but to depend on a single Bill  to  solve

all  their problems, then the result would be that

they  would be looked down upon by others. We want

a  socialist  society to exist. This is  what  the

people of Singapore want. But before this aim  can

be achieved, we must help ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must again say that I agree with the Second

Reading  of the Women's Charter Bill, because  the

introduction  of this Bill shows that  the  P.A.P.

Government has the will to help women.  The  women

themselves must, therefore, work hard.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>

<b></b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, with the tabling of the

Women's  Charter Bill in front of us, I  feel  the

wives  in Singapore will give a smile and will  be

happy  now  that  their  welfare  is  safeguarded.

Although  there are certain quarters who say  that

the  Women's Charter is incomplete, on the grounds

that  it  excludes education, economic  and  other

provisions,   I   feel  that  with   the   present

democratic  government which we have in Singapore,

there  are, in fact, no restrictions on women.  To

any extent that the women would like to achieve in

the  fields of education or in other spheres, they

can  now  do  so.  If there is any restriction  on

women going to the University, I am quite positive

that this Government will introduce legislation to

free  them  from such a restriction. There  is  no

restriction whatsoever imposed on women. Hence, in

this Women's Charter Bill, there is no mention  of

the  provisions, which were enumerated by  Members

on the Opposition side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is our experience to date that the cause of women's suffering is marriage. There

is  a  saying  that a married man  will  give  two

things. If the women do not experience hell,  they

will  experience heaven, because there is no  law,

which will guarantee the freedom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



or  the  rights of women. It is only the  men  who

taste the good things in life. Therefore, with the

enactment  of this Women's Charter Bill,  it  will

not  only be the men who will be in a position  to

obtain all the privileges, but the women also will

be able to obtain the privileges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what we have heard just now, it has

hitherto  been the fate of women to be ignored  by

the  men, because if the women, who give birth  to

the children, are deserted by their husbands, then

they have to shoulder the responsibilities without

any  recourse to the proper authorities  to  fight

for  their rights. Hence I think the women  should

be  proud  today because of the enactment  of  the

Women's Charter Bill which we are debating now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on principle, there is no human being who practises humanitarianism who will not

support the principle of one-man one wife. I think

those  who do not support the principle of one-man

one wife, that is, a monogamous marriage, have the

intention  of marrying at a later date  more  than

one  wife.  During the debate on this Bill,  there

are  people who have asked about the stand of  the

Muslim  Members  on the Government  side  on  this

Bill.  Mr Speaker, after a thorough investigation

into  the religious beliefs practised by the  non-

Muslims,  we  find  that there is  no  mention  of

monogamous  marriages.  Without  interfering  with

these religious beliefs, we wholeheartedly support

this  principle  of  a monogamous  marriage  being

implemented in Singapore. At the same time,  there

may  be  people  who wish to take unto  themselves

more  than  one  wife,  by  converting  to  Islam,

because  Islam  permits polygamy.  It  is  not  my

intention to go deeply into these matters, because

the  Muslims Ordinance is the subject of study  by

the  Select Committee, which has not yet completed

its  deliberations.  However,  I  would  like   to

emphasise,  firstly, to the new  generation  that,

according   to  the  Islamic  law,  a   polygamous

marriage  is  not encouraged. On the  other  hand,

Islam  encourages  its devout followers  to  marry

only  one  wife. This has been underlined  in  the

Holy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



Koran  in  the fourth chapter, third verse,  which

permits  a man to take unto himself more than  one

wife  but with certain specific conditions.  I  am

quite sure that if the men are sincere and hold on

to  their  Islamic  concepts,  they  will  not  go

against this rule. Among other things, this  verse

permits  polygamy. It permits, a man to take  more

than  one wife on condition that "if ye fear  that

ye  shall  not  be  able to  deal  justly  ...then

(marry)  only one". So, Mr Speaker, I  feel  that

not  only  in  other religions  but  also  in  the

Islamic  law, a certain stiff condition is imposed

on a man who wishes to take unto himself more than

one  wife. This condition does not concern  money,

but it is concerned that equity and justice should

be meted out to the wives. It means that if we buy

a  red  baju  for one wife, then we  have  to  buy

another  red baju also for the other  wife.  I  am

citing  this  as  an example. Similarly  in  other

matters, if we give 50 per cent of our love to the

first wife, we must give the other 50 per cent  to

the  second  wife.  But this  kind  of  equity  or

justice cannot be fully practised, in spite of the

fact  that  you  are  anxious  to  carry  it  out.

Therefore,   although  the  Islamic  law   permits

polygamy,  if  the  question is considered  deeply

enough, it will be found that the law itself  does

not  encourage polygamy. It has been stressed that

men cannot mete out justice to more than one wife.

So, Mr Speaker, I think this decision will not be

in  contradiction  to  any religious  beliefs.  We

should not smile because we do not come under  the

provisions of this Women's Charter, which  we  are

debating  today. Mr Speaker, I think  it  is  the

responsibility  of the man to see  that  his  wife

does   not  take  unto  herself  another  husband.

Similarly,  the  husband  should  not  take   unto

himself another wife, thus disappointing his first

wife. In other words, a crisis does not arise only

as  a  result  of  material causes,  but  it  also

results  from other factors. If we are not  happy,

we  will grow thin. Then there will be unhappiness

in  the home, thus bringing about chaos. With  the

principle of one-man one wife, I think the society

in Singapore will live in peace and harmony. Those

who desire



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



women  to  be at their whims and fancies  will  be

controlled by this Charter. This Charter will also

affect  the millionaire who cannot see a beautiful

woman  without desiring to take her  for  a  wife,

although he may have been married. So, he must now

decide  which beautiful girl to take as  his  wife

before he marries her. Under this Women's Charter,

we  cannot marry one girl today and, when  she  is

old,  discard  her  and marry  another  one.  This

Women's  Charter will safeguard women's rights  so

that  they  can live in peace and harmony  in  the

house. When this is achieved, the children will be

well cared for and looked after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Farrer Park touched on Federal citizens of Muslim faith who are

married  in the Federation and who have come  down

to  Singapore. I have stressed just now  that  the

marriages of Islamic people are controlled by  the

Muslims  Ordinance, which is still under study  by

the Select Committee, and very soon we will be  in

a position to know how things stand. The enactment

of  this  Women's Charter will not interfere  with

any section of the community. It is enacted in the

interests of peace, prosperity and well  being  of

the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I am a hundred  per  cent  in

support   of  the  Women's  Charter.   The   women

population in this country is nearly half  of  the

total population. In other parts of the world they

also  make  up  half of the total  population.  In

other  countries the legislators dare not overlook

the  rights  of  women. We the P.A.P.  Government,

claim  to be a Socialist Government. The principle

of  socialism  is to treat all alike, irrespective

of race or sex. In other advanced countries, women

are  in a position to enjoy an equal share of  the

fruits of their labour. We can say that they  have

achieved real liberation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Singapore, although we enjoy a modern

way  of  living  with modern facilities,  we  lack

proper  legislation  to safeguard  the  rights  of

women.  What is more sickening is that some people

are  still inclined to have feudalistic ideas. Day

and   night   these  people  think   of   marrying

concubines. Others never



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



treat women as human beings but as playthings.  We

have  seen a small section of the people - they  are

petty  merchants - who take too  much  advantage  of

their  establishments, which employ women workers,

and  who eventually make these women workers their

concubines.  Such things do happen. They  are  not

rare.  Once  the  Charter is put  into  operation,

those having this ulterior motive will not be able

to  achieve  their aims, and the idea of  marrying

concubines can no longer exist in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we in this Assembly who are debating the

Charter  believe that thousands upon thousands  of

women outside heartily hail the Charter. They wish

that  this  Charter will soon be approved  in  the

Assembly.  Even  the Strangers'  Gallery  in  this

Assembly is crowded with people, many of whom  are

women who have come here to hear the debate on the

Charter.  Among  them  are  the  wives   of   some

Opposition  Members. They have come  here  to  see

whether their husbands are honest and faithful  to

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the Women's Charter is to deal with

the immediate problem of women's rights in matters

regarding  marriages. As to their other rights,  I

think the Government will make provisions for them

step  by step. This means that the time will  come

when women will be able to enjoy equality with men

in all respects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Mountbatten expressed

her  regrets  about  the Bill because  it  is  not

provided  therein  that  women  will  enjoy  equal

opportunity   for  education.  We  understand   in

Singapore  at present that almost every  woman  is

able  to  receive an education. If the  girls  can

prove  their worth, I think their parents will  be

pleased  to lift them up. We can see for ourselves

that there tire many women taking courses of study

in  local  Universities, and  that  many  even  go

overseas  for  further  study.  Therefore,  in  my

opinion,  the argument put forward by  the  Member

for  Mountbatten  is invalid. Further  there  are

many high administrative posts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



in  the Government service held by women officers.

Therefore, in order that this Charter be  approved

by  the Assembly, I support the motion that it  be

referred to a Select Committee.

cheongsam   walking  and  exposing  her  beautiful

calfs?  This  Women's Charter will no doubt  bring

about  discipline in the morals of the  people.  I

fully understand those matters, which might result

in  the  break-up of my family and a  disgrace  to

society. Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that if we  try

to  clap with one hand, there is no noise. We must

use  both  hands. So in the case of a  man  and  a

woman. Who will then be at fault? Is it the man or

the  woman who is to be blamed? Who is encouraging

men  to  marry more than one woman? Why are  women

prepared  to  accept men who are already  married?

Therefore, we must go slowly and carefully in this

matter, because, as a follower of Islam, I do  not

wish  to  interfere with the rights of  the  other

communities  who  are friends  of  the  Malays  in

Singapore.  There  is  mutual  respect  among  the

different communities in Singapore. I believe  the

Parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



Secretary who spoke just now will agree with me on

the  reasons  for the polygamous marriages,  which

took place in Arabia. Muslims took unto themselves

more  than one wife in ancient days. Many  of  the

women were widows. The reason for the men in those

days  taking more than one wife was to stop  these

widows  from going into prostitution. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that is the point I would like to bring home

to  the  Member who touched upon the stand of  the

Muslim Members of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not oppose the Women's Charter, because it

will be referred to a Select Committee. Sir, I  do

not   deny  that  we  must  pay  tribute  to   the

Government for introducing this Charter. There  is

provision  therein which will safeguard the  moral

rights  of  women,  so  that  they  will  not   be

victimised  or treated as chattels. As a  follower

of  Islam,  I would like to stress that I  respect

the  findings of the Government without  affecting

the  Islamic law of this country. However, as  has

been  explained  by the Member  for  Farrer  Park,

there  are many provisions in this Charter,  which

could perhaps be misinterpreted in relation to the

Muslims  Ordinance, 1957. I hope that the Minister

concerned  will  be in a position  to  explain  in

detail  whether  the provisions  embodied  in  the

Women's   Charter  are  related  to  the   Muslims

Ordinance,  1957.  This is the question  that  has

been worrying me. I myself am not in a position to

know whether the Women's Charter is related to the

Muslims  Ordinance,  1957.  However,  I  hope  the

Minister  concerned  will  be  in  a  position  to

clarify  explicitly the position, so as to  remove

all  doubts, which may exist in the minds  of  the

people of Islamic faith.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, unmarried Members of the  House  do

not  wish to pick a quarrel with husbands who  are

more  experienced than them. After all,  bachelors

should  not  rush  in where married  men  fear  to

tread.  We  all learn from experience, and  it  is

therefore to be expected that some husbands become

wiser men from their experience, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



some  husbands become sadder men! The wise husband

tonight  will support the principles of the  Bill.

It  is  a  foolish husband who opposes this  Bill,

because  if he goes home tonight he will  have  to

face the consequences!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not only out of gallantry to the female sex but also out of political

conviction  that the P.A.P. Government  today  has

introduced  the Women's Charter. Just  before  the

elections, we announced our election programme. In

the  "Tasks Ahead" (Part I), we said that as  part

of  our  Five-Year  Plan we  shall  work  for  the

emancipation of women. In this booklet, we said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women who form nearly half of our population

have  an  important part to play in  our  national

construction. In the first instance  in  order  to

emancipate  them from the bonds of  feudalism  and

conservatism  a monogamous marriage  law  will  be

passed. Such a law however will not apply in those

cases   where  there  is  a  conflict  with  their

religious beliefs."

<br><br>

Today,  we  are fulfilling that promise  which  we

made last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A traveller once wrote of his impressions as he

moved  from West to East. He described that as  he

went  from West to East he found that the position

of  women  became lower and lower.  In  the  West,

women  were  placed on a pedestal; in  the  Middle

East,  women were kept in purdah, and in the  East

women became beasts of burden. Sir, it might  have

been  true  forty years ago when the man travelled

in  his journey from the West to the East.  It  is

true  that we take the female sex for granted  out

in the East. It is equally true that, in the past,

girl  babies  were at a discount in China  and  it

used to be the past practice that girl babies were

disposed  of  by  drowning. Times have  moved  and

conditions  have changed, and it is equally  right

too  that  we  in Singapore should  recognise  the

deficiencies and the unequal treatment, which  are

meted out to the opposite sex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will this Charter affect the women of

Singapore? Sir, this Charter will not affect those

who   are  already  married  under  the  Christian

Marriage   Ordinance   or   the   Civil   Marriage

Ordinance. We have taken it for granted that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



those women who are married under these Ordinances

will  be  fully  conscious of  their  rights - their

rights of divorce if their husbands were to commit

adultery,  or if they were to take unto themselves

another  wife. It is because many of  those  women

who are married under these two Ordinances are the

English-educated that we fail at times to see that

there  are thousands of other women who  have  not

received  any  formal education and who  have  not

been married under any of these Ordinances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past we cannot change, but it is the future

that  we  must protect. It is the future of  those

unfortunate women who may have been inveigled into

a hasty marriage that we must protect. But I would

say  this:  that the Bill alone will  not  stop  a

married man from keeping a mistress. That  is  not

possible. What is more important is that our women

should  achieve the economic independence to  make

their lives secure; that is basic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill places certain restrictions upon the

happiness  of a married family, but  in  order  to

ensure  that  this Bill will work, it  is  equally

important, too, that our women should realise that

if   they   were  to  marry  solely  for  economic

security,  then  that Bill, or  whatever  Marriage

Ordinance  under which they marry, is as  valuable

as  the  piece  of paper on which it  is  printed.

Basically,  the  security of  women  can  only  be

attained   if   their  economic  independence   is

assured, and conditions of work are the same  both

for women as well as for men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has gone into some

detail into the clauses of the Bill. I would  like

to  say  that it is more important that we  should

distinguish between the principles of the Bill and

the administrative acts necessary to carry out the

provisions  of the Bill. It may be  true  that  in

this Bill there are certain clauses, which can  be

improved upon. We say that we are receptive to any

ideas or suggestions, which can be put forward  to

improve such clauses. Therefore, the Minister  for

Labour and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



Law  has stated that he is willing to commit  this

Bill  to  a  Select Committee and to  receive  any

suggestions  or memoranda so that all these  ideas

could be incorporated to make the Bill perfect.



<br><br>6.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a husband,

I  say that the law of one-man one wife should  be

upheld  by  every  right-thinking  person.  As   a

father,  I say that the happiness of the home  can

only  be  achieved if there is one mother and  one

father.  To those of us who believe that from  the

happiness of the home will spring the happiness of

the  country, it is but right that one man  should

have one wife. I say this, Sir, with all humility.

Many  a  time  have I said that it is  always  the

women  who suffer most. It is but right that there

should  be laws enacted to protect women from  the

inhumanity  and inequalities perpetrated  by  some

wrong-thinking men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having said that, Sir, I will try to

examine  in  what way the P.A.P. can  justify  the

claim  that  they are fighting for the  rights  of

women,  and that this Women's Charter is indeed  a

charter  for  women.  It  is  strange,  Sir,  that

according  to the reckoning or estimation  of  the

P.A.P.   Government,  wives   are   classed   with

prostitutes  in one law. That is their estimation.

Surely  there  could  be a law  for  wives  and  a

separate  law  for  the protection  of  women  and

girls.  Why should wives be put on the same  plane

with  prostitutes in the law? I cannot  understand

that. They say that it is only through such a  law

that  women will have their just rights. It  would

seem that women have had no such rights until  the

P.A.P. came into power. It would mean that  women

had no equal rights for education, for appointment

in  Government service, for almost all the  things

that  they are enjoying now until the P.A.P. came

into  power.  And  so, during the  elections  they

thought that with 50 per cent of the voters  being

females, they would do a grand thing and put out a

bait to the women, "If you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



vote  us  in, we will see that you are protected."

But  let us examine this proposed law and  see  in

what way women are protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when the newspapers gave an almost word-

for-word report of this Bill, first wives of  rich

men were jubilant and gleefully said, "Ha! ha! See

that  woman there? She is no more. I am the  first

wife."  What does this Bill say? That  that  woman

shall   be  of  an  equal  status  and  shall   be

registered as the wife! Poor misguided  wife!  She

laughed too early! She did not try to examine what

that  law provides for her. If she had, she  would

have  felt despondent, at least before such a Bill

ever came out, she could have had the pleasure  of

looking  at  the  second wife of her  husband  and

saying, "You so-and-so." But today after this Bill

comes  into force, would she dare to do  it,  when

that  woman can say, "I have as much claim on that

man  as  you  have. And the P.A.P. Government  say

so."



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What has the S.P.A. done?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is not a question of

legislation. We cannot regulate the life of a  man

and  his wife by legislation. It is education, it

is  training, it is upbringing. It  is  the  home

environment. It does not mean that, if we were  to

tell a man before he steps into the home after his

work  just to kiss her, that his family life would

be  a happy life. It cannot be laid down that way.

Marriage is a contract - that is quite rightly  said

here. But it is a contract which demands from both

parties  understanding of  what  life  means;  the

understanding that one must give to the other, and

not what one must take as much as one can from the

other.  That  can never be legislated,  no  matter

what  government  is in power. That  can  only  be

brought  about  by  education.  And  that  can  be

brought about easily by mothers who look after the

children and tell them, "This is the thing that is

expected of you. When you grow up, when you marry,

this is what you should do." It is not for the law

to say that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again, the P.A.P. say that it is by

registering   a  marriage  that  the   wife   gets

protection.  But,  as the Hon, the  Deputy  Prime

Minster  says,  even though the man registers  his

marriage,  there  is nothing to prevent  him  from

keeping  a  mistress outside. The only restriction

on  him is that he shall not have another woman of

equal  legal  status. That is all. So  it  is  not

because  the law says, "Thou shall love thy  wife"

that a man will always love his wife, it cannot be

done  that  way.  I have been married  many,  many

years,  and I know that we have ups and  downs  in

married  life. But it always comes down  to  this,

Sir:  if there is real understanding, even  though

marriage  demands sacrifice from  both,  life  can

always  be  happy. Yet they say, "With  this  law,

women  can  indeed  be free from the  inequalities

perpetrated  by men." But what are they  protected

from?  What I can say is that under clause  45  it

has  been  brought up that a woman  shall  have  a

legal  right  and  a  legal  claim  on  the  man's

property.  Can  the law prevent a man,  before  he

dies, from saying to his wife, "Here you are. Take

all  this  that  I  have. I will  just  give  that

miserable house to you in my will." Where then  is

the  protection  for the wife  whose  marriage  is

registered?  All  this is just  trying  to  dangle

something in front of the women and make them say,

"It  is  a  wonderful Bill!" Women, I am sorry  to

say, and I am sure the men will have to admit  it,

are  so  easily misguided, if men know how to  use

sweet words. Just like this: "Vote us in and  thou

shalt  only have that husband to thyself." What  a

bluff! Sir, it says here  - and I will go through it

clause  by clause if I may. The most important  is

clause 166, the gist of which says that every  man

and  woman who have been married in Malaya  before

the  2nd of March, 1960, under any written law  in

the  State  must register. If my grandfather  were

still  alive,  he  might have to use  his  walking

stick just for the pleasure of saying, "Please,  I

am  married. All my children are legitimate." Must

you ask an old man to go there and register? Or  a

man  having  three wives. How do you want  him  to

register  with  the wives? If  he  has  a  special

preference



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



for  the  third wife, he will bring her along  and

register. Three days later, he might register  the

second  wife,  and  finally, if he  remembers,  he

might  bring  his first wife. What  protection  is

there  for the first wife? And again, if the first

wife  has  been  so angered and  so  hurt  by  the

husband, who has two other wives, would that first

wife  willingly  say  to the  husband,  "Come  on,

darling.  Let  us go and register and  be  married

again."  She might spit at the man and  say,  "Get

out of my house! I will not see you." How then can

you  effect the registration of marriage  of  that

man   and  the  first  wife?  Where  then  is  the

protection for the woman? It is nothing  but  just

this carrot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 (2), Sir - I have been trying to read it

and  trying  to  understand  it.  If  I  read   it

aright - and  I think I am right and it is  for  the

Minister  to prove I am wrong - clause  4  (2)  says

that  if I have one wife and subsequent to 2nd  of

March  1960, I cease to be married to her, then  I

can  marry again under any custom before this law.

And  that is all right. But I cannot marry another

woman  up to the date of that marriage to  replace

my  wife. That is quite right. But then if  a  man

were  to  have three wives, then under  this  sub-

clause  (2) of clause 4, he can say to one of  his

wives,  "Ah,  you  are a bit too  old.  Get  out!"

Subsequently he ceases to be married to that wife.

Then  he  can, Sir, under this sub-clause, replace

this  wife  with another one, so that he  has  his

full  complement of three. That is what  this  law

says.  He  can  still have his full complement  of

three.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Change the law!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am glad that the Hon. the

Deputy Prime Minister has said that you can change

the  law.  I am glad that in this particular  case

the  Opposition has pointed out the error  on  the

part  of  the Government. Yet the Government  says

that  it  is  looking after the interests  of  all

women!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solemnization of a marriage in front of the

Registrar is, of course, a solemn affair, and  the

procedure requires both parties to give notice  to

the Registrar of an intention to marry. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



Government knows that there are so many people in

Singapore  today  who do not understand  English,

and  yet  these  people have to  give  notice  in

English.  And under clause 18, a person  has  the

right to enter a caveat in case he feels that  he

has  some objection to any proposed marriage. But

if  he does not understand English, how could  he

go  to the notice board and read and try to  find

out  whether  his  son, or his  daughter  or  his

nephew  is  proposing to get married  to  another

person?  Or  how can a woman find  out  from  the

notice  board that her husband is now  trying  to

get   married  again  under  this  law?  I  would

suggest,  Sir, that it would be very  helpful  to

the  people if other languages could be used, not

only English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some inconsistencies in the Bill,

and I will not touch on them because the Bill  is

going to a Select Committee. But I would like  to

touch  on the principles while I am here.  Clause

23,  sub-clause  (7)  - this  is  the  solemnization

procedure. The couple appear before the Registrar

with  two credible witnesses. The Registrar  then

says  something and the parties shall  answer  in

the  affirmative. But further down,  because  the

ceremony  is  a  solemn one, it is required  that

each  party  must make a solemn declaration.  And

here  again it is in English. But sub-clause  (7)

says,  so  long as someone explains  to  the  two

contracting   parties  in   the   language   they

understand, that should be enough. They need  not

have to make the declaration in the language that

they  understand. Surely it is the  intention  to

make  it a solemn affair, to make it binding,  to

make  both  parties  feel that  that  is  a  very

important  event in their lives,  and  that  they

should be called upon to make the declaration  in

the language that they understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has touched on clause

32.  This  is a bit complicated, and  I  find  it

difficult to understand when a marriage is  valid

and  when it is not valid. It does not mean  that

it is valid if it is registered. It can mean that

although  it  is  registered  it  can  still   be

invalid. And what is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



purpose of registration? If after registration it

does  not make it valid, other processes have  to

be  gone  through  before one can  claim  that  a

marriage  at the Registrar's office  is  a  valid

marriage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now clause 39 says that a couple can get married

by  a person who holds a licence. He need not be

the  Registrar or a Deputy Registrar.  But  then

under  clause 39 (1) , Sir, it is an  offence  if

that  person knowingly solemnizes the marriage - I

read paragraph (c) Sir -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"after the expiration of three months from the

date  of  the  notice  of marriage  given  under

section 13 of this Ordinance,".



<br><br>What  is required under the Bill is that a couple

proposing to get married shall give notice to the

Registrar. The Registrar shall put up the  notice

on  the  notice board for at least three  months.

But if the Registrar is satisfied, after 21 days,

that that marriage shall take place, he can,  but

before  the expiration of three months,  issue  a

certificate  for  marriage. So if  the  Registrar

were  to  issue a certificate for marriage,  say,

about  80 days after the date of the notice,  and

the  couple  had  to  make arrangements  for  the

marriage  to  take place, and  the  date  of  the

wedding  exceeded the three-month limit,  how  is

the  poor person who is licensed to solemnize the

marriage  to  know that he will be committing  an

offence  if  he solemnizes it because  the  three

months'  period  has expired?  I  think  what  is

necessary  for  the man who holds  a  licence  to

solemnize the marriage is that it should be  only

necessary  for  him to receive a certificate  for

marriage. So long -

most  important  clause of this  Bill  which  the

public  are  concerned about  is  clause  166 - the

compulsory registration of marriages, which  were

not  performed under any written law.  They  feel

that this law, if it is going to achieve anything

is  only to protect those women who are the wives

of  rich  men  or  men  with some  property.  The

majority  of married couples in Singapore  belong

to   the  poorer  class  of  people.  There   is,

therefore,  no  question  of  property  involved.

There  is,  therefore, no question  of  the  wife

wanting to claim the property of the husband when

the  husband dies. In cases of this kind, in poor

families,  when the husband dies, the  wife  will

have  to pawn something that she has in order  to

have  the  husband buried. Therefore, Sir,  there

should  be  no compulsion about registration.  To

those  women who feel that they should have their

rights  protected, it should be open to  them  to

bring their husbands along and register. There is

no  need for a poor farmer to bring his poor  and

aged  wife to the Registry just for the  pleasure

of  having a marriage certificate. To them  their

marriage  is  not only legal, it is also  sacred.

That  piece of certificate is not going  to  make

them  any  the happier. Therefore, I  would  urge

upon  the  Government to drop  this  question  of

compulsory registration. But if they do insist on

compulsory  registration, then  it  is  necessary

that  the fee should be a very small one so  that

everybody can afford it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is in this clause no grace given to a

married  couple to register if a man is  sick  in

bed  and could not get out of bed within one year

to  have his marriage registered. Or if a man  is

away  from the country on business, on study,  or

on  something  else, and cannot be back  in  time

within  one year to have his marriage registered,

then  he is going to be punished. I submit,  Sir,

that  there should be a proviso whereby cases  of

this kind can be given grace.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I had not intended to speak on  the

motion,   but  after  having  endured  for   some

considerable    time   the   irrelevancies    and

trivialities from the Member for Cairnhill -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Hon, the

Minister  should decide what the Speaker  himself

ought to decide, and that is, whether or not  the

matters are irrelevant or trivial. Perhaps if the

Minister will continue the debate on the  general

merits  and  principle of the Bill,  he  will  be

relevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, I merely intended

to make the point that I was moved to making this

speech  as  a result of the remarks made  by  the

Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of his speech, it was clear to

me  that  the Member for Cairnhill was  suffering

from  a peculiar kind of obsession, and that  is,

how  the  Bill would affect the status  of  first

wives vis-a-vis secondary wives, in the course of

his  address, he referred to this problem  on  no

less than three occasions. First, he thought that

the first wives who might have considered getting

some   benefit  from  the  Bill  would  be  sadly

disillusioned, because all wives would be treated

equally  under  the Bill. Then he  expressed  the

view  that the man may want to register only  one

of the younger wives and neglect the older wives.

And finally, even when he came to the question of

the language used, he was concerned lest the wife

who  could  not read English would be  unable  to

find  out what the intentions of her husband were

in regard to taking another wife.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill must have been

moving  for a long time in polygamous circles  to

be   so  well  acquainted  with  social  problems

confronting such families. And, of course, as  we

all  know,  his  Party has the  support  of  many

millionaires who are habitually maintaining large

families  with several wives. But it is  not  the

purpose of the Women's Charter to give protection

to wives or the first wife or families of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



millionaires. If this problem is still exercising

the mind of the Member for Cairnhill, perhaps  he

can  move a private Bill designed to protect  the

interests of first wives of millionaires. But the

Women's  Charter tries to bring about  more  than

just monogamous marriages. In other parts of  the

Bill,  there  is  a procedure  set  out  for  the

regulating of disputes, for the protection of the

rights  of  children,  and for  divorce.  By  and

large,  this  does represent a major  advance  in

social legislation, not only in this country, but

perhaps in the whole region of South-east Asia. 1

do  take grave objection to the reference by  the

Member  for Cairnhill that this Bill is  no  more

than  the carrot dangled before the donkeys. This

may be -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Member for

Cairnhill  went so far as to refer  to  women  as

donkeys.  I  think he just said  it  was  carrot-dangling.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

implication  was fairly clear, particularly  when

he   strengthened   his  illusion   by   symbolic

gestures. However, Mr Speaker, I do want to make

the  point  that  in introducing  this  piece  of

legislation,   the  P.A.P.  Government   is   not

carrying   out  a  vote-catching  manoeuvre.   We

promised  this legislation to the electorate  and

we  were  moved  to  do so by deep  and  profound

convictions  as to how a good society  should  be

regulated.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?



<br><br>6.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must confess that

the  Member for Tanglin has gone up very high  in

my estimation on his performance this evening. We

have  heard words of wisdom flowing from the lips

of  his  colleagues, and although he  is  usually

attracted  by  such  debates,  he  has,  on  this

occasion, thought fit -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is true that I have been

away from this Chair for some time, but I have  a

list  of  Members who spoke and I cannot see  the

name of the Member for Tanglin on my list. I do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



not  think  that  the conduct of the  Member  for

Tanglin warrants remarks of that nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> But he has hitherto got himself

involved in such debates, so I actually  have  to

compliment him on the great sagacity which he has

shown this afternoon in remaining silent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during this debate, we have

heard  from the Members opposite that this  Bill,

far  from being the Charter that it claims to be,

is  just a fake and a sham, just a gimmick on our

part - a  carrot  that we dangle before  the  women

electorate  of  the State. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we

have  heard  the  Member for Mountbatten  express

great  distress that there was no  expression  of

our  belief that women should get equal pay  with

men,  that  women  should have  the  same  social

advantages   as   men.  We  can  understand   her

distress, since everybody knows that she  is  the

Chairman of the Pan-Pacific Women's League, which

is  an agency of the United Nations. But in  that

situation  she  has lost sight of  the  important

thing that this Bill really does for the women of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that the greater

majority  of  the  population  in  Singapore  are

Chinese and that, by their personal law, they are

able   to  contract  polygamous  marriages.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this Bill is making a  very  great

change  in  the  personal lives  of  the  greater

majority  of  our citizens. It marks  a  complete

break from the past and it is a big step forward.

And  it  is  just for that reason  that  we  have

thought it important that we consider this  piece

of  legislation as something outside the ordinary

stream of legislation that we consider it to  be,

in  the real sense of the word, a Charter for the

women of our State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have considered this to be

a Charter for these reasons: One, that it makes a

great  change in the personal law of the  greater

majority  of  our citizens; the next  thing,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, is that this Bill seeks to place on

one  common  register  all marriages  which  take

place  in  our State. Hitherto, there  have  been

marriages,  which  have  been  registered  on   a

special register governing the registration of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



Christian  marriages. There have also been  other

registers  for  monogamous marriages  which  have

been   contracted   under  the   Civil   Marriage

Ordinance. We propose in this Bill, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  to  bring  on  to  a  common  register  all

marriages in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the laws affecting women and

children   are   spread  widely  throughout   our

legislation,  and  it  needs  the  training   and

experience of a lawyer to find one's way  through

that  mass  of legislation. We thought that  this

would be an excellent opportunity to collect  all

such legislations together, to improve on them as

far  as  we  can, and then put them in  this  one

compendious    and   comprehensive    piece    of

legislation which we have thought fit to call the

Women's Charter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been a lot of

criticisms on various clauses in this Bill.  They

arise  not because there are faults in this Bill,

but  because the Members opposite have not  given

this  Bill the attention that it really deserves.

Let  me  deal with the criticisms that have  been

made of the various clauses of this Bill. Let  me

take what the Member for Mountbatten has said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has expressed great surprise that although

under  clause  166  of this Bill  all  polygamous

marriages  which have taken place before  2nd  of

March  are  required to be registered why  is  it

then that clause 32 provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing in this Ordinance or rules made

thereunder shall be construed to render valid  or

invalid  merely by reason of its having  been  or

not  having  been registered any  marriage  which

otherwise is invalid or valid."



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, it would be quite impossible

for  any  legislation  to  provide  that  when  a

marriage   is  registered,  it  must  necessarily

therefore  be  a valid marriage; and  that  if  a

marriage is not registered, then it follows  from

that  that  it  is  not  a  valid  marriage.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, touching on this point, it looks as

if  the  Member  for Mountbatten  has  failed  to

understand  clause  166 of  this  Bill.  In  that

clause it is clearly stated that where there is a

dispute  as to a marriage, then that dispute  can

be  referred to the Registrar for a decision; and

if the party is still dissatisfied, then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



he or she can take the matter further to the High

Court  for a decision. Mr Speaker, Sir, we  have

written  those provisions into the law to provide

for  a  case  like this, where,  say,  a  husband

brings   a  wife  to  be  registered  under   the

provisions of this clause. It may turn out  that,

in  fact, he is not married to her. A case  might

also  arise  where a man might bring  his  second

wife  to  be  registered. The  first  wife  might

challenge  the marriage of the second wife.  Both

these  cases  could  be  challenged  under  these

provisions of the law, so that in either case, if

there  has been a challenge and if the matter  in

dispute has been decided by the Registrar in  the

first  instance, or by the High  Court  Judge  on

appeal,  then  there would have been  a  decision

made as to the validity of each marriage. This is

provided for in clause 166. So that is the reason

why  we have found it necessary to provide  that,

unless  the procedure that is open to the parties

when  there is a dispute under the provisions  of

clause 166 is followed, registration as such does

not  under  clause  32  in  any  way  affect  the

validity or invalidity of a marriage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Mountbatten

also  mentioned the case of a man who is  already

married under Chinese customary law leaving  this

country  and  going abroad and marrying  a  young

European  girl.  She asked,  what  would  be  the

position of the principal wife in that case?  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  if that should happen,  this  law

itself  would  safeguard  the  position  of   the

principal wife. All that she has to do is to  get

herself  placed on the register and she  will  be

recognised   as   that  man's  wife   under   the

provisions of clause 166.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Mountbatten

also referred to clause 35 of the Bill. She says,

"Woe  betide  all mothers here in Singapore  once

this   clause   becomes  law.  They   will   lose

possession  of all their daughters  and  you  can

expect the worst once this clause is enacted into

law."  Let  us look at this clause, Mr  Speaker,

Sir. What does it say? It says:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any person who uses any force or threat-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to

compel a person to marry against his will; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to prevent a person who has attained the

age of twenty-one years from

contracting a valid marriage,



<br><br>shall  be guilty of an offence and shall be liable

on conviction to [penalties]."



<br><br>What  is wrong with that clause? Should it not  be

enacted  as  law  that any person  who  forces  or

threatens any person to marry against his  or  her

will  should be subject to penalties? Surely  that

is  a  reasonable proposition. It does not deprive

mothers  of  the  custody of their  daughters.  It

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any person who uses any force or threat-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to prevent a person who has attained

the age of twenty-one years from contracting

a valid marriage,



<br><br>shall be guilty of an offence...".



<br><br>If  a  daughter is 21 years old, she has  got  the

right  to decide her own future. This law provides

for  parental consent in the case of marriages  of

minors  who  are between the ages of  18  and  21.

Clearly, the Member for Mountbatten has shown that

she   has  not  taken  the  trouble  to  read  the

provisions of this Bill. If she had done  so,  she

would  never  have  made that suggestion  to  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been suggestions

that,  as a result of clause 166, the position  of

principal  wives  is going to  be  depressed,  and

mistresses, concubines and prostitutes  are  going

to  reap  the benefit from this legislation.  Sir,

surely that could not be submitted to be so by the

Members  opposite  if they had  really  taken  the

trouble  to  read this Bill. I have  explained  to

them just now that under clause 166, it is already

provided that where the parties appear before  the

Registrar  and  if  there is  any  dispute  as  to

whether they were, in fact, married, that issue of

fact  can  be tried by the Registrar. If they  are

still  dissatisfied  with  the  decision  of   the

Registrar,  it goes to the High Court  on  appeal.

All that is provided for in this legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Mountbatten started talking

about  the  fees,  and  soon.  She  said,  in  all

sincerity,  that she believed that the  Government

was going to charge a fee of $20. I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



know  where she got that information from. We  are

still considering these matters. These are matters

of  detail, but I am very surprised to  know  that

she  has  a  fixation in her  mind  that  the  fee

charged is going to be $20.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will go on to consider the

objections of the Member for Farrer Park.  He  has

taken exception to one clause of the Bill - clause 3

(2).  He says that the exemption here only applies

to Muslims who are married under the provisions of

the  Muslims  Ordinance, 1957,  implying  that  it

would be possible under this Bill for Muslims, who

are  not  married  under the  provisions  of  that

Ordinance, to contract a marriage under this Bill.

Mr Speaker,. Sir, if he had taken the trouble  to

look  at clause 16 of this Bill, he will find that

before any marriage can be solemnized, it will  be

necessary for the parties to produce a certificate

of   marriage.  It  is  stated  there   what   the

conditions are before a certificate of marriage is

issued.  One of the conditions there is that  they

must swear a declaration to the effect:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that neither of the parties to the intended

marriage  is  married under any law, religion,

custom  or usage to any person other  than  the

person  with whom such marriage is proposed  to

be contracted:".

<br><br>

If   a  Muslim  who  was  married  not  under  the

provisions of the Muslims Ordinance but under  the

provisions  of  the Muslim law in  the  Federation

comes  here  and tries to contract a marriage,  he

would  have to swear a declaration that he is  not

already married under any law, religion, custom or

usage. If he makes a false declaration, then he is

subject to penalties for doing so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park has

said  that  he  has  given this  Bill  very  close

scrutiny  and  he has decided now that  there  are

only  two  new  clauses  in  this  Bill.  He   has

mentioned  that these two new clauses are  clauses

45  and 166. Sir, we of the P.A.P. Government  are

not people who try to hide things from the public.

With  this  Bill  we  have taken  the  trouble  to

publish  a  comparative table showing the  sources

from which we have obtained the various clauses of

this Bill. If the Member for Farrer Park had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



taken  the trouble to count the clauses here which

we have acknowledged to be new, then he would have

found that they all add up to 13 new clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, he has dealt particularly with

clause  45.  He says that clause 45  is  making  a

radical  change in the law and is unknown  in  any

legislation. I would advise him that clause 45  is

taken  from the Swiss Civil Code and it  has  been

considered by eminent jurists before. And he says,

"Look  at clause 45 (1). Now everybody knows  that

the duty of a husband is to maintain his wife. And

here  it  says  that  the  duty  for  caring   and

providing  for the children is now placed  on  the

shoulders of both husband and wife." Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  it is true, in our experience, that  when  a

husband  is unemployed or is unable to  work,  the

duty  of maintaining that home falls on the woman,

particularly if she is able to work and she is, in

fact, working. What is wrong with that? As far  as

the  duty of the husband to maintain his  wife  is

concerned, we have strengthened the law,  so  that

if  the hon. Member had only taken the trouble  to

look  at clause 62 of the Bill, he would have seen

the  way in which we have strengthened that  duty.

We have said that if a husband has ill-treated his

wife  and  his children and he has been  convicted

for  doing so; if he has deserted his wife; if  he

has  neglected  to provide reasonable  maintenance

for her and his children; if he has treated her or

any  of  his  children with cruelty; if  he  is  a

habitual  drunkard; or if he is living in adultery

with  another  woman; he would then be  liable  to

maintain  his  wife.  Under the  present  law,  as

everybody  knows,  before  a  woman  can   get   a

maintenance order against her husband,  she  would

have to prove her case; and if the husband says to

the  Court, "In spite of what has happened,  I  am

prepared  to  take her back," the moment  he  does

that,  then  she  is  deprived  of  an  order   of

maintenance. Now we have changed the law here.  We

have given her an absolute right to maintenance in

these circumstances. Surely we have not in any way

changed  the  duties in matrimonial relationships.

The hon. Member does not follow clause 45 (2) when

he asks, "Why should it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



be  that  the husband and the wife shall have  the

right  separately  to  engage  in  any  trade   or

profession or in social activities?" Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  he  asks, "Well, what do "social activities"

mean?"  Now  if  a  wife wants to  play  rnahjong,

surely   the  playing  of  mahjong  is  a   social

activity.  I  suggest  that is  just  a  frivolous

argument.  Although  the  husband  and  wife   are

associated  in  a  matrimonial  home,   they   are

individuals   and   therefore   they    can,    as

individuals,  engage  in trades  and  professions.

They   form  a  family  unit  and  they  are  also

associated as a family unit in society.  All  that

this  provision says is that it would not be right

for  a  husband to place restrictions on the  wife

taking  part in social activities. What  is  wrong

with that? That would be a very sensible thing  to

introduce in a Bill like this, particularly  in  a

Chapter, which deals with the rights and duties of

husband and wife.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member says that, as clause 45 (3)

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wife shall have the right to use her own

surname and name separately."



<br><br>he has no quarrel with that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes on to clause 45 (4) and he says that

that introduces a novel provision of law. The sub-

clause reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The husband and the wife shall have equal

rights in the running of the matrimonial household

and  in the ownership and management of the family

properties."

<br><br>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the Member  for  Farrer  Park

obviously   does  not  pay  due  regard   to   the

provisions of clause 48 of the Bill. Clause 48 re-enacts  what is the present law, that  whatever  a

woman  has which belongs to her before she marries

continues to be her separate property on marriage,

and  that  after marriage, if she engages  in  any

trade or occupation or employment and acquires new

property,  that  property which she  has  acquired

after  marriage  shall  continue  to  be  her  own

separate  property. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  there  are

situations  where a husband and wife  can  acquire

family  property, and it would not  be  right  for

either  of them to regard it as property which  is

their  own  and distinct from the family property.

That is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



sort  of  thing that this clause deals  with.  Mr

Speaker.  Sir, this is the sort of criticism  that

we have from the Front Bench opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has also not treated

the  provisions of this Bill in the way that  they

ought  to  have been treated. He has  charged  the

Government  with  introducing  legislation,  which

will  enable prostitutes to be classed in the same

category   as   married  women.   Surely,   as   a

responsible  member  of the  community,  he  could

never have made such a charge if he had taken  the

trouble  to read the provisions of this  Bill.  He

has said that education, and not law, will achieve

the  purposes  that we have in mind. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, why was it necessary then that we should have

these  provisions in clause 166? Are we trying  to

inflict  hardship on our women? Are  we  going  to

make  things more difficult for them?  If  we  are

going  to introduce a law governing monogamy,  the

only way that we can introduce it and be sure that

there is monogamy is to provide, at the same time,

a   system   of  registration  for  all   existing

marriages.   We   have  heard   the   Member   for

Mountbatten  say  that  the  polygamous  marriages

which  have taken place under local Chinese custom

are of various kinds. She has referred to some  as

"joss-stick  marriages" and she has called  others

more important marriages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we legislate that from the

2nd  of  March any person who has previously  been

married  cannot take unto himself a  second  wife,

and   merely  legislate  it  in  that  way,   what

guarantee have we that there would be monogamy  in

our  State?  It  is  always a disputable  question

whether  a person who has been married to four  or

five  wives  under the local Chinese custom  would

consider  those marriages to be binding marriages.

A rich man with four or five wives might, if he is

not  required  to register, very well  contract  a

marriage under this law. He may say, "Well,  I  do

not  regard those marriages as marriages  at  all.

They were joss stick



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



marriages." We cannot have that situation  happen.

I  do  agree, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it  would  be

necessary  for  us  to  make  provision  for   the

registration of these marriages in such a  way  as

not  to cause any hardship to the community.  That

is  a  matter  of detail, which the Government  is

looking into very seriously now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the period of grace referred to by

the  Member  for  Cairnhill. We realise  that  the

period of one year may be too short a period. That

is why we have thought it necessary that this Bill

should be referred to a Select Committee, so  that

provisions  like this could be looked  at  with  a

view to improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has

also  referred to clause 4, sub-clause (2) of  the

Bill.  I really fail to understand what difficulty

he  has  seen in this clause. All that the  clause

says  is that on the 2nd of March, say, a man  has

been married under local Chinese custom to one  or

more  spouses.  Then after that date  he  suddenly

ceases  to  be  married  to  any  such  spouse  or

spouses. And if he contracts a marriage after that

date,  then  that  marriage will be  a  monogamous

marriage.  That is all that it says, and  that  is

what  it  must say. It is as simple as  all  that.

What is the difficulty? It is so reasonable and so

logical  and  so  sensible that I cannot  see  any

difficulty  in  it  myself.  One  cannot  see  any

difficulty  unless one wants to see the difficulty

in this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 23 (7). This is the form of the

marriage ceremony. The Member for Cairnhill  finds

difficulty  in understanding why it  is  necessary

that  if the parties do not understand the English

language,  it  will be necessary for  the  English

language to be interpreted to the parties. Is this

a  difficulty?  If  these declarations  and  these

forms  are  to  be used, it will be  necessary  to

explain  them  fully to those who  participate  in

this  ceremony  in  the language they  understand.

That is all that it provides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park

asks  me to explain to this House why it was  that

long  before this Bill was introduced to the House

(the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>

words  are  "long before") he had read  the  main

provisions  of this Bill in the local newspapers.

If  he  had  only taken the trouble  to  look  at

clause 4 (1) he would have read the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every person who on the 2nd day of March, 1960,

is  lawfully  married under  any  law,  religion,

custom  or usage to one or more spouses shall  be

incapable,   during  the  continuance   of   such

marriage  or  marriages of  contracting  a  valid

marriage under any law, religion, custom or usage

with  any  person  other  than  such  spouse   or

spouses."

<br><br>

Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill was introduced on the

2nd of March. Those newspaper reports appeared on

the  1st  of March. This Bill makes it an offence

for  any  person  who was already married  under,

say,  Chinese customary law, to marry again after

the  2nd  of  March. It was necessary that  great

publicity  be  given to this fact,  because  this

Bill  is  making a very important change  in  our

law.  The  operative date was the date  on  which

this  Bill  was  introduced into the  Legislative

Assembly,  and it was necessary, therefore,  that

advance  notice  of  that be  given.  It  is  the

practice  in  this Legislative  Assembly  not  to

publish details of Bills unless and until  copies

of the Bill are first circulated to hon. Members.

But  in  this  case,  it was quite  an  important

announcement and it was very necessary  that  the

public  should  have had advance  notice  of  the

fact.   And  the  advance  notice  was  the   day

before - not  "long  before",  as  the  Member  for

Farrer Park stated here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these are matters, which I

would   otherwise  have  dealt  with  in   Select

Committee,  but  I  have  been  forced  into  the

position  where  I have had to  deal  with  these

representations, when the principle of  the  Bill

is  debated. I would say again, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  if  they had considered this Bill to  be  a

very  important  Bill, then they would  not  have

adopted  the attitude they had adopted when  this

Bill  was  under  debate. In the  past,  we  have

introduced  other Bills and have been accused  of

springing     surprises    on    them - introducing

amendments  just  before  the  Bill  was  to   be

debated. But in this case, the Bill has  been  in

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



possession since the 2nd of March, and they  have

had  ample  time  to study it. And  if  they  had

really  taken the trouble to read this  Bill  and

understand  it,  I am sure they  would  not  have

dealt  with  it in as light-hearted a  manner  as

they had done this afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with due respect, I would say

that  the  Government do not claim that they  are

perfect  and that they are introducing a  perfect

Bill. But we are trying very hard to do something

for  the  people of Singapore. We are  castigated

and  are  said to be dangling carrots before  the

electorate.  But  we have been in  politics  only

very recently. The Members opposite, Mr Speaker,

Sir, have been in politics for quite a long time.

Now,  if  they had any regard for the  rights  of

women,  they  would have done this on  their  own

before.  Because  of  their  past  neglect,  they

jumped  upon  us just now. We are  interested  in

doing  what they had failed to do. I do say,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that this Bill  is  an  important

piece of legislation. It will do for the women in

our  community what no other piece of legislation

can  do. It is no use thinking in terms of  high-sounding  phrases  in  legislation  if  the  most

important thing is not done first, and  that  is,

if  a  woman who is the mistress of her home  and

queen of her home is made to share that home with

another  woman.  If  that  is  so  and  if   that

situation  is  allowed to continue, Mr  Speaker,

Sir, it is meaningless and sheer nonsense to talk

about  the rights of women. And I do say that  we

are, in fact, asking the House today to approve a

very important piece of legislation which we can,

in  all  modesty, claim to be a charter  for  the

women of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is complementary to

the    Criminal   Procedure   Code    (Amendment)

Ordinance,  and seeks to provide for the  hearing

and determination of appeals from convictions  by

the High Court sitting without a jury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the Court of Criminal Appeal

Ordinance only provides for appeals by any person

convicted on a trial before the High Court with a

jury,  under Chapter 21 of the Criminal Procedure

Code.  The  proposed amendments to the  Ordinance

extends the provisions of the Ordinance to  cases

where  the person has been convicted on  a  trial

before  the High Court without a jury.  The  Bill

also   amends   the  Court  of  Criminal   Appeal

Ordinance to provide for a reference of points of

law to the Court of Criminal Appeal in case of an

acquittal  by the High Court in the  exercise  of

its  original criminal jurisdiction,  and  for  a

reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal  of  an

appeal  on  the grounds of public interest  where

the   High  Court  has  upheld  or  reversed  the

decision  of  the  subordinate court.  These  new

provisions  are taken from the Federation  Courts

Ordinance, 1948.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill was referred to and was supported by

the  Singapore Bar Committee, but since the  Bill

was  published, it has been represented that  the

proposed  new section 19B of the Ordinance  might

cause  hardship to an accused person,  as  it  is

possible  that  he  may  be  acquitted   by   the

subordinate  court, have his acquittal  confirmed

by  the High Court, but nevertheless be convicted

and sentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a person is acquitted on a trial before

the  High  Court, there is no appeal against  the

acquittal. It is proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



in clause 5 of the Bill that in such a case there

should  be  a reference to the Court of  Criminal

Appeal  on the question of law. But the Court  of

Criminal Appeal will in such a case have power to

deliver  a merely declaratory judgment. A  person

who is acquitted on a trial by the High Court  is

therefore no more in jeopardy. On the other hand,

the  person  who  is acquitted by  a  subordinate

court might have his acquittal set aside not only

by  the  High  Court but also  by  the  Court  of

Criminal  Appeal.  It  is considered,  therefore,

that  the  person  who has been acquitted  by  an

order  of  a  subordinate court and of  the  High

Court   on   appeal  should  not  be  liable   to

punishment by the Court of Criminal Appeal,  even

though such acquittal is set aside, and I propose

to move amendments to this effect in Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

the  status  of the University of Malaya  has  so

declined  that the Government is not  willing  to

give  the  University the same rights  as  it  is

giving to the Trades Union Congress in Singapore;

that   is,  the  right  to  nominate  their   own

representative  on the Adult Education  Board.  I

wonder  whether the Government realises that,  by

doing so, it is going to give a slap in the  face

of  the  University of Malaya, and it will  be  a

shock to those who believe that the University of

Malaya   should  have  the  right   to   nominate

whomsoever  it  will to represent itself  on  any

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope, Sir, that the Government appreciates

the  importance  of  the  issue.  Otherwise,  why

should there be this difference in procedure with

regard  to the appointment of a member  from  the

University  of  Malaya  and  two  members  to  be

appointed  by  the Minister on the nomination  of

the  Trades Union Congress in Singapore? On  what

basis  is the Singapore T.U.C. considered  to  be

more  responsible  and  more  reliable  than  the

University of Malaya?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue which is very, important in the

eyes  of the public concerns the autonomy of  the

University   of   Malaya.  In  every   democratic

country, which is a free country, a university in

that   country   is  always  considered   to   be

autonomous. Therefore, not to give the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



University  of Malaya the right to  nominate  its

representative  will  give  credence  to  reports

circulating   that  because  the  Government   of

Singapore gives large subsidies to the University

of   Malaya,  therefore,  the  autonomy  of   the

University  is  going to be impaired,  and  there

will  be  more  and  more  interference  in   the

appointments  and promotions of  members  of  the

staff  of  the  University.  If  this  particular

paragraph  is  not  amended, Sir,  it  will  give

support to the report that, in the opinion of the

present   Government,   the   autonomy   of   the

University  of Malaya is but a myth.  Sir,  I  do

hope  that the Government will think it over and,

in order to silence the criticisms and remove the

fears of the people who are concerned about  this

autonomy  of  the University, it will  allow  the

same rights to the University of Malaya as it has

allowed to the Singapore Trades Union Congress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not know whether it will be

convenient  for  hon. Members to  deal  with  the

second  amendment as well. It  appears  to  be  a

similar  amendment to paragraph  (g).  If  it  is

convenient,  then, perhaps, the hon.  Member  for

Tanglin  could touch on the second  amendment  as

well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the second

amendment  is  somewhat similar. It involves  the

Nanyang  University. Here again, Sir, the Nanyang

University  has  not  been  given  the  right  to

nominate  its own representative for  appointment

by  the Minister for Education. I hope it was due

to  an  oversight, because recently the  Minister

has  denied that he wishes to control the Nanyang

University.  Sir, if that assurance is  to  carry

weight  with  the public, then it is  only  right

that the nominees to the Board should be made  by

the  Nanyang  University and  the  University  of

Malaya themselves.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has been moved as an amendment

in  page A2, lines 26 and 27, to leave out  "from

among  the  tutorial staff" and  insert  "on  the

nomination".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

left  out, be left out," and in the debate Members

will   be   permitted  to  range  over  the   next

amendment, that is, in page A2, lines 29  and  30,

to  leave out "from among the tutorial staff"  and

insert "on the nomination".



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we turn to

the Official Report of the Select Committee on the

Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa Bill on which the

hon.  Member  for Tanglin served as a  Member,  we

will  find  that  he  was  unable  to  forget  the

conditioning  of  his own mind over  a  period  of

time. It is unnecessary for me to repeat all  that

was  said  by him and my reply on the question  of

nomination,  and whether the nominee is  a  rubber

stamp.  I  think  a  lot  depends  on  whether   a

particular person serves as a nominee of  Colonial

Government or as a nominee of a popularly  elected

Government.  The hon. Member for Tanglin  has  had

the  experience  of being a rubber  stamp  in  the

past - and  a very battered one at that.  Those  who

are   prepared  to  serve  as  nominees  under   a

popularly elected Government would consider it  an

honour to serve as such, because the new popularly

elected  Government,  as  representatives  of  the

people,  have  a  high regard for their  standing,

their  integrity and their capability  to  produce

work for the Government. Therefore, far from there

being a smear that they are rubber-stamps, it  is,

on the other hand, a compliment to them because it

shows that they are men of stature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin now raises the question

of  the autonomy of the University of Malaya. Only

a few days ago, the Prime Minister had to say that

the University of Malaya is still unfortunately  a

Colonial  university. Let it  also  be  said  that

there  are  many people holding high positions  in

organisations  existing today who  really  do  not

deserve to be on them. That is why it is necessary

for  this  new Government to decide on nominations

and  not  to  leave that to the tender mercies  of

such  organisations. In practice, it will  be  the

case  of  the  Minister consulting  the  principal

executive officer of the institution concerned, be

it the University of Malaya or Nanyang University.

It is quite clear that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



the  present Government of Singapore considers  it

necessary, in the case of Nanyang University, that

there    should    be   thorough   reorganisation.

Therefore,  it  is  deeply  regretted   that   the

proposed amendment from the Member for Tanglin  is

not  acceptable to the Government side.  In  fact,

all  we  need say is this: there is an old saying,

"Old  dogs  are unable to learn new tricks."  What

has  been  put  forward by  the  hon.  Member  for

Tanglin  is just a repetition of what was said  in

Select Committee, and it failed to convince us. If

today  there  have  been slight changes  here  and

there, it is a case of the barking dog, which does

not bite.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think those expressions are

completely out of order and uncalled for. The Hon.

Minister, I think, does know that when Bills  have

gone through Select Committees, there is provision

in  our  Standing  Orders  for  recommittal  to  a

Committee  of the whole Assembly where it  is  not

just   a   matter  of  seven  Members  considering

amendments,  but  it is a matter  of  51  Members.

Therefore, the Member for Tanglin is perfectly  in

order  in raising the same topic, which he  raised

in the Select Committee, albeit he failed to press

through his amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was only

asking for the same right for the two universities

as  had been given to the Trades Union Congress in

Singapore. I shall be grateful, Sir, if  the  Hon.

Minister   will  explain  why  the  Trades   Union

Congress should be given the right to nominate its

own representative and the University should not.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the Trades

Union  Congress  is  not a university.  It  is  an

organisation to which all the various trade unions

from  all  sections  of life are  affiliated.  The

University  is  one body without any affiliations,

and  it  is easy for the Minister to nominate  one

member  to represent the University. In the  field

of    trade   unionism,   if   we   nominate   one

representative from a particular trade  union,  it

may    cause   dissatisfaction.   Therefore,   the

nomination comes from the Trades Union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



Congress. Since we consider that the Trades  Union

Congress represents all trade unions in Singapore,

we   give  it  the  tight  to  nominate  its   own

representative  from  its  affiliated  bodies   to

represent the workers on the Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I do not like

to say it, but I have to. May I ask the Government

whether  the Trades Union Congress has been  given

that  right because the Secretary-General  thereof

is a Front Bencher?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. To start off with, the remark

is  completely irrelevant. It is completely out of

order. Therefore, I ask the hon. Member to keep to

the  point  of his amendments, and not  embark  on

irrelevancies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, if it is important that at

the  present  stage nominees from the Universities

must be nominated by the Government and not by the

Universities,  I  think there  is  no  purpose  in

putting  down here that one member to be appointed

by the Minister should be among the tutorial staff

of  the  University  of Malaya in  Singapore,  and

another  member  to be appointed by  the  Minister

from   among   the  tutorial  staff   of   Nanyang

University  in Singapore. We may as well  have  it

clearly stated that two members would be appointed

by  the Minister from the educational bodies. That

would  cover  the same point. But the  moment  the

Universities  are mentioned, naturally  one  would

expect  that they would be accorded the  right  to

nominate  their  own  representatives.   That   is

natural and logical.

Some  of  the assets were contributed  by  private
