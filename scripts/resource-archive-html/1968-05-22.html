<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide a

supplementary  estimate of $300,000  to  meet  the

administrative  expenditure  of  the   new   Bases

Economic Conversion Department which has been  set

up early this year. This department will provide a

central  point  in the Government  machinery  with

which  the  British Government can liaise  in  all

problems  relating to the run-down of  the  United

Kingdom bases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bases Economic Conversion Department will

have,   as   its   main  functions,   to   conduct

negotiations   with  the  British  Government   on

mitigatory  aid  to overcome the  effects  of  the

rundown  of  the British bases, and on the  taking

over of lands and other assets relinquished by the

British   Services.  The  department   will   also

negotiate  with the British Government  and  other

interested  parties  on  the  conversion  of   the

facilities, such as the naval dockyard, air  bases

and   workshops,   to  civilian   management   and

commercial use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department has also been entrusted with the

responsibility  of  organising the  training,  re-training  and  possibly  re-deploying  of  workers

discharged from the bases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supplementary estimate of $300,000 to be

provided  will  cover  the  1968  expenditure  for

Personal   Emoluments,  $160,000;  Other   Charges

Annually  Recurrent, $92,510;  and  Other  Charges

Special Expenditure, $47,490. The amount has  been

advanced  from the Contingencies Fund in  view  of

the   urgency  to  establish  the  Bases  Economic

Conversion  Department. The  Supplementary  Supply

Bill  is to clear this advance in accordance  with

clause  (2)  of Article 87 of the Constitution  of

Singapore.

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute of Southeast Asian Studies will be

the  first of its kind to be established  in  this

part of the world. It will be a centre of research

into the history, the people, and the cultures  of

Southeast Asian countries. The Institute will have

no  teaching  functions and will  not,  therefore,

duplicate the work of the existing institutions of

higher  learning.  Its  functions  will  be   pure

research and nothing else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide the research material a library will

be  built up which will eventually be one  of  the

best   in   Asia   on  Southeast  Asian   affairs.

Internationally  known authorities  on  South-east

Asia,  both  local  and  from  overseas,  will  be

appointed as research fellows of the Institute  to

conduct research. Local graduates of promise  will

be  sent to established centres of Southeast Asian

Studies  in  overseas  universities  to  do  post-graduate degrees before joining the staff  of  the

Institute.  In  this  way it  is  hoped  that  the

Institute  will become a repository  of  scholarly

information   on  as  well  as  a   generator   of

analytical studies of Southeast Asian affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research activities of the Institute will

increase  our understanding of our neighbours  and

help  us to play our role more effectively in this

part of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to establish the Institute as an

autonomous body governed by a 24-member  Board  of

Trustees.  The Chairman, the Deputy  Chairman  and

four members are to be appointed by the President.

Three other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



members  are  to be appointed by the President  on

the  nomination of such professional bodies as the

President  may consult. Other members  are  to  be

appointees  of  the  Chambers of  Commerce,  local

foundations and universities with the Director  of

the Institute as an ex-officio member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will, therefore, represent a wide

spectrum  of  interests:  academic,  professional,

commercial, charitable and governmental.  It  will

be  invested  with  all  such  powers  as  may  be

necessary to enable it to carry out its functions,

including  the  power to approve  the  budget  and

research  programme of the Institute. The  day-to-day  administration of the Institute will  be  the

responsibility of a ten-member Executive Committee

headed  by  the  Director who will  be  the  chief

administrative   and  academic  officer   of   the

Institute. Three members of this committee will be

appointed  by  the Board of Trustees from  amongst

its own members. Three other members will be staff

members   of  the  Institute  appointed   by   the

Director, and the remaining three members will  be

appointed by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for Government grants-in-aid to

be made by the Minister to the Institute from time

to  time.  It  is hoped, however, that substantial

financial aid will be forthcoming from foundations

and   from   private   individuals.   Accordingly,

provision  is  made  for  all  donations  to   the

Institute to be exempted from income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Bill.

Singapore is in the centre of Southeast Asia.  All

along  we  have  been in close  contact  with  our

neighbouring   countries   in   all   fields    of

activities,   such   as   trade,   communications,

shipping    and   aviation.   These   neighbouring

countries have been making use of this place as  a

most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



convenient  transit  centre.  We  occupy  a   most

important position in Southeast Asia. But we  also

realise  that Southeast Asia is a very complicated

area. The Vietnamese people are suffering from the

ravages of war. Other countries are also suffering

many  calamities. They have different  historical,

political  and social backgrounds. The  people  of

these  countries  have different faiths,  beliefs,

creeds,  customs  and  traditions.  In  order   to

understand the religious, cultural, political  and

social  backgrounds  and  the  conditions  of  our

neighbouring  countries and their  people,  it  is

necessary  to  set up the Institute  of  Southeast

Asian  Studies which can make a thorough study  of

all  these  matters. The emphasis in international

relationships  at  present  is  on  regional   co-operation, either political or economic. It is  in

their  mutual interest if they seek  a  wider  and

higher  level of co-operation. The setting  up  of

this  Institute, therefore, is very necessary  and

timely at this juncture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my memory does not play me false, I recollect

that  our  scholarly Minister  for  Education  has

mentioned earlier in this House about the  setting

up  of such an Institute as is now envisaged under

this  Bill. If action had been taken earlier,  the

Institute would already have been set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to ask the Minister a few

questions.  What work has this Institute  done  so

far?  Has the Government allotted any sum of money

to  the Institute to carry on with its work? Where

is the Institute and who is responsible for it?



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  would seem to be many factors in favour  of

setting  up  an  agency  like  the  Institute   of

Southeast Asian Studies which this Bill  seeks  to

establish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be fair to say that our well-being, if

not  our survival, is related, to some extent,  to

the  destiny  of the countries in  the  region  of

which (to quote a most recent document) we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



the  fulcrum. It is to our advantage to  encourage

systematic  garnering of more  and  more  critical

knowledge of the countries around us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate for us to conduct regional

studies  in  the way we propose to do. Singapore's

strategic location makes it an eminently desirable

and suitable spot to become not only a centre, but

the   Centre   for  Southeast  Asian  Studies.   A

successful Singapore Institute of Southeast  Asian

Studies will certain1y reflect favourably  on  our

national prestige, where previously we have had to

note  the  existence of South-east  Asian  Studies

centres  in  exotic  places  like  Yale;  Harvard:

Washington - Washington, Missouri; Canberra; Hull;

and   London  where  I  believe  South-east  Asian

Studies comes under the generous umbrella  of  the

School of African and Oriental Studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good to envisage numbers of scholars, not

only  from the region, but also from the Far West,

that  is, from Europe and perhaps Africa and  from

the Far East, like San Francisco on the west coast

of the United States, coming to Singapore to share

their  knowledge. But there is also the  practical

advantage  that spreading knowledge of the  region

will  result  in  more people with  lay  interests

wanting  to come to Singapore and to this  region.

And  they  will come here, Sir, not  to  seek  the

flesh-pots by which, alas, tourists are  only  too

frequently beguiled, but to seek repast of a  more

intellectual kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other interesting and possibly

profitable  by-products. With improved  and  wider

knowledge  of  the  region,  there  may  also   be

knowledgeable  interest in  the  possibilities  of

investment and economic development in the region.

Political  and  international decisions  in  other

countries  may  also derive from a  more  informed

public opinion. There is some testimony to the sad

condition of uniformed public opinion about South-east  Asia  in far-away countries. Too often  have

our  emissaries abroad been asked if Singapore  is

situated in South China.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now mention one or two points relating to

the  development  of  the  proposed  Institute  of

Southeast Asian Studies. If initially the director

of  this Institute be a visitor to this region,  a

pundit so to speak from abroad, in other words, an

expatriate,  could we initiate steps  as  soon  as

possible to ensure that we have a director who  is

indigenous    to   the   region,   preferably    a

Singaporean?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make this point because I feel, and this

feeling  has been to some extent substantiated  in

conversations  with  one  or  two   people,   that

scholars  in  this region would be more  ready  to

establish rapport with somebody whom they feel may

be   more   spiritually  sympathetic  with   their

aspirations.   Whether   we,   in   our    prudent

objectivity, like it or not, there are  people  in

the region whose sense of nationalism has been  so

exacerbated by their experience of recent  history

that  they  even carry the fear of so-called  neo-colonialism into the academic sphere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to make is that this

Institute could also provide opportunities for the

study  of  languages in the region. I notice  that

the   erection,   equipment  and  maintenance   of

libraries  feature  in  the  provisions   of   the

Institute.   This  would  certainly  involve   the

acquisition  of  local materials,  however  poorly

organised  the local book trade of the region  may

be. In fact, this aspect may make the problems  of

translation into a lingua franca more urgent. I am

sure  the very latest devices will be used in  the

rapid  study  of local languages. Presumably,  the

erection  of  laboratories mentioned in  the  Bill

would refer to language laboratories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another point is the possible extension of

the  resources  and  facilities  of  the  proposed

Institute to a wider audience than that consisting

only    of   professional   scholars   and   their

ancillaries.  Perhaps some of the members  of  the

general  public  in Singapore,  who  are  suitably

inclined,   could  benefit  from  the  Institute's

activities  -  perhaps  through  seminars,  public

lectures, lecture

courses  and the like. The general adult education

potential of the Institute should not be ignored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the publishing of books and other

publications features among the provisions of  the

proposed  Institute. But a layman like myself  may

find  deterring the presence of footnotes, learned

annotations, and similar rubrics which  formidably

characterise  the work of scholars.  It  would  be

useful  if  books popularising area studies  could

also  be  forthcoming, with the contents of  these

books  not  in  any  way losing  in  accuracy  and

scholarship   by   the   simplicity    of    their

presentation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, and as a relevant corollary to all I have

just  said, could encouragement be given  to  area

studies   being   actively   extended    in    our

universities?  I  say  this  because  recently   I

received  an  enquiry  about  the  possibility  of

someone  following a programme of area studies  in

the   University  of  Singapore   in   a   certain

discipline.  I  shall not mention  the  discipline

concerned because of the fear of having to make  a

reference   to  a  specific  department   in   the

University.  I  found that area studies  were  not

conducted in this particular discipline. Relations

between  the Institute and our universities  would

be  more productive if area studies are encouraged

as much as possible in our universities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to underline my support for this

Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much as I appreciate the

establishment  of an Institute of Southeast  Asian

Studies,  my appreciation is imprecise. There  has

been  an  inadequate amount of  publicity  of  the

possibilities of this Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the explanatory statement appended to the

Bill  and from the tenor of the whole Bill,  I  am

supposed to be persuaded into believing that there

is  abundant research to be done on Southeast Asia

and on all matters



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



appertaining to Southeast Asia. I not  only  hope,

but  I can even believe that there is. But what  I

feel  is  important is that the research  intended

should  be  contemporary in nature. It  should  be

research  into  fields  of  knowledge  which   are

directly  relevant and contributory to'  the  many

facets  of  our  national growth at  this  crucial

stage of our history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Institute will produce findings

which  can  be  translated into  added  verve  and

vitality  for  our society and not  only  findings

which  are  meant  for  the  academician  and  the

pedagogue.

Asian Studies Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the interest and initiative taken by

the  Member  for Sembawang in speaking  on  almost

every Bill that has come to this Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> One matter Mr Teong missed was to

Sir,  that  he  was speaking on the issue  without

referring  to the contents of the Bill.  He  asked

the-Minister for Education whether the  Bill  will

involve  the  Government in  any  extra  financial

expenditure. If he had read the last two sentences

in  page  9  of  the Bill, he would have  got  the

answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the Institute of Southeast

Asian Studies Bill will serve as an impetus and  a

guide  to  those who have been looking forward  to

the  establishment  of such  an  Institute  to  do

research into the various aspects of this  region.

The establishment of a research centre, especially

a   centre   to  study  the  problems  confronting

Southeast Asia, is, vital for Singapore. Singapore

realises  her  significance in the region  and  is

taking  cautious  steps to  promote  regional  co-operation. Such an Institute not only provides  an

academic research centre



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



for our intellectuals but it also helps to resolve

the  problems of Southeast Asia by coming up  with

methods and answers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my maiden speech in this House I touched

on the problems of this region. I pointed out that

Southeast  Asia has all along been the  centre  of

attraction of the world. This is not because  this

area  is  rich and strong but because it has  been

recognised  and considered as one of  the  weakest

areas  in  the  world. As we  know,  most  of  the

countries  in  this  region  are  newly   emerging

countries. We are all classified either within the

economic  scope  of under-developed  countries  or

developed  countries.  Southeast  Asia  has   been

looked  upon  as  a region which is  not  able  to

mobilise  its political and economic resources  to

bargain with the more advanced countries or  super

powers  on  an equal footing. One can hardly  deny

that  all  these  factors were  created  by  human

beings   in   past  decades  when  the   political

situation in the world was entirely different. Now

that  most  of  the  newly emerging  countries  in

Southeast Asia are struggling to achieve  progress

and  the  ultimate aim of equal  status  with  the

advanced countries in the world, we must find ways

and means to counter these prevailing factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the problems confronting the countries

in  Southeast Asia? What are the factors hampering

the  progress of countries in this region? How can

these  problems be solved? What measures are ideal

to  solve these problems? All these questions  can

be  closely  studied by a critical examination  of

the  nature  of  the conflicts and  disputes  that

occur  in our midst if we have a Research  Centre.

Hence  the  establishment  of  the  Institute   of

Southeast  Asian Studies which will  shoulder  the

task of enlightening us with a clearer picture  of

the  problems in this region in the crucial 1970s.

If  one  speaks on the problems of Southeast  Asia

without pointing out the root or complexity of the

problems  and  the methods to solve them,  one  is

just  being impractical. We must find out the true

facts of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



problems and the fundamental factors causing  such

problems  before  we  can  solve  them.  In   this

respect,  Sir,  I  am  of  the  opinion  that  the

establishment of the Institute of Southeast  Asian

Studies   will   be  able  to  make   an   immense

contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look into the historical background of the

newly  emerging countries of Southeast  Asia.  One

struggle  comes  after another.  These  struggles,

whether  of a bloody or peaceful nature,  have  no

ultimate  aim.  These occurrences  in  a  country,

whether  of  an  advantageous or a disadvantageous

nature,  will certainly influence the economy  and

the  social pattern of another country because  we

are  all  situated  within  the  same  region  and

surrounded by the same waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the countries in Southeast Asia have gone

through  similar stages when struggling for  their

independence.  We  were  all  once  upon  a   time

colonies of the big powers. We all fought  against

colonialism to achieve independence. Nevertheless,

it   would  not  be  untrue  to  say  that   after

independence some countries still carry on on  the

same  basis as their former colonial masters  did,

with their direct experiences of societies in  the

west.   Some   countries  have  even   turned   to

dependence  on guarantees from the big powers  for

survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the midst of these complexities, it is

essential   to  study  all  affairs  and   matters

appertaining  to Southeast Asia.  In  this  multi-racial  region,  besides having gone  through  the

same  struggle for political independence as other

countries, we too have similarities in the  social

structure, behaviour of people, culture, religion,

etc.  So  if differences of interests which  arise

within  this  region  are unresolved,  they  could

ultimately threaten the peace and progress of this

region.  On  the  basis  that  the  countries   in

Southeast Asia are inter-dependent on one  another

in   this  new  era,  each  country  must  develop

regional  initiative in economic co-operation  and

mutual assistance and understanding. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



establishment of such an Institute emphasises  the

importance  we  place on our own  region  and  the

importance   of   understanding   our    immediate

neighbours.     Through     participation     with

intellectuals, scholars, teachers, etc, of  other

countries  around  us, we are  able  to  know  our

neighbours  better  and they  will  understand  us

better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, co-operation is a necessary ingredient for

progress.  You  may agree with me  that  with  the

establishment of this Institute, we are  paving  a

more   radical   approach  towards  cultural   and

educational  co-operation with countries  in  this

region.  Although  the establishment  of  such  an

organisation will involve the Government in  extra

financial expenditure, I consider this expenditure

to be necessary if we are to become more vital and

creative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I am happy to note that in clauses

16 and 17 of the Bill, the Board is given power to

accept gifts on behalf of the Institute, and it is

also provided that gifts to the Institute shall be

exempt  from income tax. I am confident that  such

provisions in the Bill will encourage more aid and

assistance  from the general public to ensure  the

success of this Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking at this Bill, I am confident that it

will  receive acclaim and support from  those  who

are  interested in problems concerning our  nation

and Southeast Asia.



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad

that  the proposed Institute has evoked among  our

Back-benchers such a lively interest in  Southeast

Asian  affairs. This awareness that the  countries

around  us  have a bearing on our development  and

our   survival,  certainly  augurs  well  for  our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to reply in detail to all the

comments  made by Members of this House,  as  they

are all in support of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



the  Bill  to  establish this proposed  Institute.

However, a number of questions have been raised by

the  Member for Sembawang and I propose to  answer

some of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of the Institute has been appointed

and  he will assume duty probably from the 1st  of

July  this  year.  He  is Prof.  Harry  J.  Benda,

Professor of History, Yale University, and now con

currently  Acting Director of the Southeast  Asian

Studies   Programme   in  Yale   University.   The

University of Singapore has lent the Institute one

of   its   large  bungalows  within  its  grounds.

Alterations and additions are being carried out to

this bungalow and work is expected to be completed

in  the  first  week of June.  This  will  be  the

temporary home of the Institute until it moves  to

the  three  top  floors of the new  University  of

Singapore  library building which is  planned  for

completion  in  roughly  two  years'   time.   The

Government has set aside a sum of $262,000 in this

year's Budget to expand the Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong has raised the point that

the  Director should as far as possible be a local

man.  I  am sure the Government is quite alive  to

this  problem.  If a suitable local  candidate  is

available he will be appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the area study programmes to be carried

out  in  our universities, 1 am sure the  Minister

for  Science  and Technology will look  into  this

problem.  Now  that  there is  leadership  in  the

University of Singapore, I am sure there will be a

revival of research activities in Southeast  Asian

affairs in the university.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Ong Pang Boon].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1) of section 5 of the 'Singapore

Telephone Board Ordinance provides that the  Board

shall  consist  of (a) a Chairman,  (b)  a  Deputy

Chairman  and (c) five other members, or  a  total

membership  of seven members. The Bill now  before

the  House seeks to amend this subsection  in  the

Ordinance  in  order  to increase  the  number  of

members  of  the Singapore Telephone Board  (other

than  the Chairman and Deputy Chairman) from  five

to seven, or a total membership of nine members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past two years there has been quite a

substantial increase in the Board's activities  to

cope with the rising demand for telephones. It was

originally  estimated that for the 5-year  period,

1966-1970,  there would be an average growth  rate

of  8  per  cent, or nearly 30,000 direct exchange

lines  would  have  to be installed  to  meet  the

public's  demand for telephones.  But  the  actual

number of direct lines installed during the  years

1966  and  1967  was 5,800 and 8,400 respectively,

which  gives an average rate of growth of  12  per

cent  over  two years, or 50 per cent higher  than

the  original estimated rate of growth  of  8  per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the present waiting list for telephones

is  2,400,  and with the Government's  development

plans  being further accelerated, the  demand  for

telephones  must therefore increase still  further

and  the  Board has no alternative but  to  revise

upward its plans again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet this increasing demand, the Board has set

aside $15.6 million for development this year, and

another  $16 million for next year, thus making  a

total  of  over $31 million for the two  years  on

development programmes and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



capital  expenditure  in building  new  exchanges,

laying new cables and installing new equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the new 50,000 exchange lines now under

construction   at   the   junction    of    Exeter

Road/Devonshire  Road to meet the rapidly  growing

hotel  and business sector along the Orchard  Road

area,  the  Board has plans to erect  another  two

exchanges in the near future, one in the  Crawford

area  and perhaps another small exchange to  serve

the Ama Keng area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in the Board's activities,

there  has  been a corresponding increase  in  the

duties  and responsibilities of the Board members.

It  is  considered that the business of the  Board

has   reached  a  stage  to  warrant  an  enlarged

membership, which is the sole aim of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the

Bill moved by the Minister which seeks to increase

the  membership of the Board from  seven  to  nine

members.   It   is  time  that  we  enlarged   the

membership of the Board so that it would  be  more

efficient in achieving the objectives as  outlined

by  the President in his speech in this House.  As

explained by the Minister for Communications,  the

work  of the Telephone Board is increasing day  by

day and this Bill is necessary for the development

of telephone communications in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, besides increasing the membership of the

Board,  the Minister should also pay attention  to

the  interests  of  the Board workers.  He  should

appoint   another  representative  of  the   Board

workers  to sit on the Board. At present there  is

only  one  representative  of  the  staff  of  the

Telephone Board sitting on the Board. If one  more

representative is added, I am sure the workers  of

the  Telephone Board will have more confidence  in

the Board. They will co-operate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



in achieving their objective of being more

efficient  and thus improving the economy  of  the

Republic.  With  the  introduction  of   the   new

Employment Bill, there will be doubts and fears in

the  minds  of  the workers. Therefore,  with  two

representatives  of the staff members  sitting  on

the  Board,  the  interests of the S.T.B, workers

will be ensured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to draw the attention of the

Minister  to the need for erecting more  telephone

booths in the Republic. He should give this matter

his  serious consideration. There have  been  many

applications for the erection of telephone  booths

in  the  rural  areas,  but  they  have  not  been

entertained. Applications for the installation  of

telephones in private premises have also not  been

entertained due to lack of facilities.  There  are

areas  with  cables  but  without  appliances  and

equipment. There are also areas -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member is straining the

rules  of  relevance to bring what  he  is  saying

within the ambit of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): There is

another  matter  to which I hope  members  of  the

Board will give serious attention. I hope they can

formulate a policy on the use of public telephones

in  booths  in  the  interests of  maintaining  an

efficient service. At present a person can  use  a

public  telephone by paying ten cents and  he  can

speak  for  as long as he likes. There are  booths

where  people  make use of the  phone  for  hours,

especially  when  two  lovers  are  talking.  This

prevents others from using the telephone,  and  it

can be serious if the matter is important or there

is an emergency. In order to prevent the misuse of

telephones in booths, I suggest that a time  limit

be  imposed  on  the  use of  the  telephone.  For

example, on paying ten cents a person can use  the

telephone for only 10 to 15 minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the increase in the

membership  of the Board from seven to  nine,  the

Board should be able to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



think of more facilities which can be given to the

public  and  see  to  it that these  will  not  be

misused.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker,, Sir, of the

present  seven members on the-Board there  is,  as

stated   by  the  Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan,

already one representative from the N.T.U.C. I  am

afraid that his request for an additional workers'

representative is not acceptable' to  me  because,

in  my view, one workers' representative should be

more  than  adequate for the purposes of  workers'

representation. In fact, I found  to  my  surprise

that  although  the Singapore Telephone  Board  is

such  a  large corporation with a capital  of  $20

million  and  a  general reserve of  $25  million,

there is not even a Ministry representative on the

7-member Board. So I have decided that of the  two

new  members who will be sitting on the  Singapore

Telephone   Board,  one  will  be   a   Government

representative who will keep an eye on  the  large

funds   that   are   being   disbursed   in   this

organisation.  All  the' other  members  are  non-Government members, and I think it should  be  so.

This  very  important  organisation,  which  comes

under  the  general heading of Telecommunications,

is  a  monopoly at present, because  there  is  no

other  competing telephone company  to  offer  its

services  to  the public. I would like-members  of

the  public  to participate in the supervision  of

this organisation and I look forward to appointing

a   non-Government   member  -   perhaps   another

accountant  or  an economist -  to  serve  on  the

Board. This will have to be done very soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the request to increase the number of

telephone   booths,  this  matter   is   receiving

attention. All requests from the Urban  and  Rural

Services Committee come up for consideration.  But

I  wish  to  state that there are over 750  public

telephone booths throughout the island  and  I  am

given to understand that they are frequently used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Many of these telephones are out

of order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to broaden the scope of library

material so as to include not only books but  also

audio-visual  and  primary sources  material.  The

National  Library  collection will  henceforth  be

considerably  expanded with  the  new  sources  of

library  material. Thus the total collection  will

better reflect the Republic's creative output  and

heritage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discharging its responsibilities on the

national  level,  the  National  Library  of   the

Republic  will concentrate its efforts in planning

for  all  types of library services so as to  give

every citizen an opportunity to read and to ensure

that  the nation's entire creative output will  be

recorded and preserved for future generations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Library will also provide up-to-date

information  for  research workers  and  business,

industrial and other sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an international level, the National Library

will   play  an  important  role  by  facilitating

library  loans to and from other nations  and  the

exchange of library material with other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also provision in the Bill for the

National Library Board to make recommendations for

the  training of library staff. The general object

of  this  Bill  is  therefore to ensure  that  the

National Library will give better services to  the

people of Singapore.

it  will  be  seen that this Bill and three  other

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has been under consideration for a long

time  and its provisions have been discussed  with

members  of  the  Hindu  Advisory  Board  and  the

Secretary  of  the  Muslim  and  Hindu  Endowments

Board. The advice of the Attorney-General has also

been  obtained on the detailed provisions  of  the

Bill,  and  the  present  Bill  incorporates  such

suggestions as are reasonable and in keeping  with

the scheme and purpose of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is as indicated in the

explanatory  statement, to  set  up  a  new  Hindu

Endowments Board to look after Hindu religious and

charitable endowments and to take over such  Hindu

endowments as are at present administered  by  the

Muslim and Hindu Endowments Board appointed  under

the  Muslim  and Hindu Endowments Ordinance.  With

the  enactment of the Administration of Muslim Law

Act,  1966,  which will come into operation  soon,

the  Muslim and Hindu Endowments Board will  cease

to have any control over Muslim endowments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, in the main, re-enacts the provisions

of  the Muslim and Hindu Endowments Ordinance  but

omits references to Muslim endowments. Certain new

provisions,  however, have been included.  I  will

now   touch  on  the  more  important   of   these

provisions in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill provides that no person

shall be appointed a member of the Board unless he

is  a Hindu and a citizen of Singapore. This is in

keeping with our new status as an independent  and

sovereign  country. The same clause provides  that

members  of  the Board are to be appointed  for  a

period of three years and will be eligible for re-appointment.  But no member may be  appointed  for

more  than  two consecutive terms. At  present,  a

member  appointed  to the Board  can  continue  to

serve on the Board until he is removed by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



Minister  or  resigns  or dies.  A  limitation  of

appointment to a maximum of two consecutive  terms

will  enable  new members to be brought  into  the

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill stipulates the conditions

under   which   the  Minister   may   revoke   the

appointment  of  a  member of  the  Board  if  his

conduct  is, in the opinion of the Minister,  such

as  to  bring, discredit upon the Board, or if  he

becomes  unable to carry out his duties  properly,

or  if the Minister considers it desirable in  the

public  interest  to revoke the  appointment.  No

such  conditions are provided for the  removal  of

any   member   of  the  Board  in  the   existing

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 of the Bill requires members of the

committee  of management, appointed by  the  Board

with  the'  approval of the Minister to manage  an

endowment,  to  be  citizens  of  Singapore.  Such

members  shall  be appointed for'  two  years  and

shall be eligible for re-appointment. But again no

member  shall  be  appointed  for  more  than  two

consecutive terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 of the Bill empowers the Board to raise

funds  by  means  of' voluntary  subscriptions  or

contributions  for the performance of  its  duties

and  the-discharge  of  its obligations.  No  such

power exists in the existing Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 of the Bill makes it necessary for the

Secretary  of the Board to exhibit a copy  of  the

annual  report and accounts of the Board  in  each

temple  administered by the Board. Hitherto,  such

reports  and  accounts are  required  only  to  be

published   in  the  Gazette.  As  the  Government

Gazette may not be readily available to all Hindus

attending  their  temples, the exhibition  of  the

annual  report and accounts at the temple premises

will enable those Hindus who attend the temples to

know the activities of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 of the Bill expressly prohibits the

Board   or   any  committee  of  management   from

permitting any temple administered by the Board or

property belonging to any endowment to be used



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



for  political  purposes.  This  provision  is  to

ensure that activities in temples administered  by

the   Board   will  not  give  rise  to  political

controversy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

strongly support the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the coming into being of this Bill, all

property belonging to Hindu endowments was  vested

in the Muslim and Hindu Endowments Board which was

set  up  in  the  British colonial era.  With  the

passage  of  time,  we found  discrepancies  as  a

result  of the changed conditions in the Republic.

We  naturally  need some changes. I consider  this

Bill  to  be  very desirable. The Hindu Endowments

Board will be set up to administer Hindu religious

and  charitable  endowments. The  members  of  the

Board  must  be  Hindus as  well  as  citizens  of

Singapore.  No member, however, can  dominate  the

Board's affairs for a prolonged period, unlike  in

the  past  when  a certain group of members  could

dominate   Hindu  affairs  with  their  autocratic

policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of the Bill, every member is

allowed  to serve on the Board for not  more  than

three years. This is more democratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Minister for Social Affairs for

bringing this Bill into this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Inche Othman, I take it that you do

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this Bill is to incorporate

the  Singapore  Council  of  Social  Service.  The

Council,  which is a registered society under  the

Societies  Ordinance, was established in  December

1958  to  co-ordinate the work  of  all  voluntary

welfare   organisations  in  Singapore.   It   has

contributed much in welfare work in the  past  ten

years of its existence, especially during times of

fire,  flood, and other calamities. In recognition

of  its past services and the planned expansion of

its  future activities, including the construction

of  the Singapore Social Service Centre, the  time

is  now  opportune  to incorporate  the  Singapore

Council of Social Service by legislation so as  to

accord  it the status due to it. This is  provided

for in clause 3 of the Bill. Since the Council  is

already  a  going concern, clause 5  of  the  Bill

provides  for the transfer of all its  assets  and

liabilities to the new corporate body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill provides for the composition

of   the   Council   which   shall   comprise    a

representative each of the 83 organisations as set

out  in  the  Schedule  to  the  Bill.  These   83

organisations  are  already  represented  in   the

existing  Council. Power, however, is provided  in

clause 6 (2) of the Bill for the Minister to amend

the  Schedule on the advice of the Council or  the

Board   of   Management  so  as  to   enable   new

organisations  that  may  be  established  to   be

represented   in  the  Council,  or  delete   such

organisations  which  shall cease  to  operate  as

welfare  or charitable organisations. Besides  the

representatives of the 83 organisations as set out

in  the Schedule to the Bill, clauses 7 and  8  of

the Bill allow for two additional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



members in the Council as representatives  of  the

associate members and two ex-officio members,  and

they  are the Director of Social Welfare  and  the

Head  of the Department of Social Work and  Social

Administration, University of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects of the Council which are set out in

clause   10  include  the  coordination   of   all

voluntary   welfare   activities   in   Singapore,

improvement  of  standards  of  welfare  work  and

encouragement  of  welfare  work  in  fields   not

covered  by  Government, initiation, organisation,

assistance  in schemes of social service,  raising

and administering funds and goods entrusted to it,

as  well as advising Government on legislation  in

fields of social welfare work or in furtherance of

the  objects of the Council. In carrying out these

objects, power is provided in clause 10 (2) of the

Bill  for  the Council to acquire and  dispose  of

property, to receive monies and donations in kind,

and to carry out such business as will further the

objects of the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is also provided in the Bill for the

setting  up  of a Council of Social  Service  Fund

into which all monies received and raised shall be

paid.  The  management of the  Council  of  Social

Service is invested in a Board of Management,  the

composition of which is provided in clause  13  of

the  Bill,  which comprise a President, two  Vice-Presidents,  a General Secretary, a Treasurer  and

11  other elected members including two ex-officio

members  - they are the Director of Social Welfare

and  the Head of the Department of Social Work and

Social Administration, University of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses of the Bill are of a minor

nature governing the procedure of meetings of  the

Board, setting out subscriptions which each member

organisation shall pay as subscription  per  year,

and  the dissolution of the Council only by an Act

of Parliament.

Social Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

fully  support the Bill introduced by the Minister

for  Social Affairs. It is introduced in  time  to

cope  with the social welfare services which  will

be limited in expansion because of the increase in

defence  expenditure  in the  approaching  crucial

years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Social Affairs has promptly

taken  appropriate and practical steps to maintain

and   enhance  the  reputation  that  the   social

services in Singapore are acknowledged to  be  the

best  in  the whole of South-east Asia. I am  sure

that  all Members of the House will agree with  me

in my appreciation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, the Singapore

Council  of Social Service was in existence  as  a

voluntary  organised body formed  by  some  social

workers and civic-minded citizens who saw the need

to  co-ordinate  whenever and where-ever  possible

the  work of voluntary welfare bodies and to avoid

duplication of their activities. In addition, they

tried to encourage efforts in fields not presently

covered  either  by  voluntary  workers   or   the

Department of Social Welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the existing Council has done

good work. Let me mention here one commendable and

most  striking  example. On 13th  February,  1959,

when  the Tiong Bahru fire rendered 5,000  persons

homeless,  the  Council undertook  the  tremendous

task  of  raising $700,000 within a month for  the

relief of the homeless. There were other fires and

floods  from  time  to time.  In  each  case,  the

Council was able to raise funds and obtain  relief

for the victims at short notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the praiseworthy welfare work

done by the Council and other voluntary bodies  in

Singapore is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



matter of great credit to the good people who  are

engaged   in   this   work.   They   deserve   our

appreciation and thanks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Social Affairs has correctly

timed the introduction of this Bill to incorporate

the  Singapore Council of Social Service. It  will

undoubtedly  help to strengthen  and  perfect  the

existing voluntary organisations or welfare bodies

and will further benefit the people of Singapore.



<br><br>3.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to say a

few words in praise of the objects which this Bill

is   intended   to  achieve,  in  particular   the

promotion and publicity of voluntary welfare work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many words of approbation have been uttered in

this  House  in  respect of  various  efforts  and

ventures, but not enough, in my opinion, has  been

uttered  in respect of voluntary efforts.  I  take

this opportunity to express my appreciation -  and

I  can quite certainly say the appreciation of all

Members of this House - of the efforts of all  the

voluntary workers in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the value of the effort, is not only in the

function  of its contribution, but more  important

still  in  its  exemplariness of concern  for  the

welfare of one's community and country. It  is  an

effort  generated by the altruism which I  believe

is  a  common human component of all our  peoples,

and the House should give more recognition to this

altruism  and accord it the commendation  that  it

deserves. I am sure that the Council, as envisaged

in   this  Bill,  will  succeed  in  co-ordinating

voluntary  efforts  and  improving  standards   of

social activity and thereby I hope it will succeed

in  publicising its efforts and attracting more of

the disinterested benevolence of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I notice that an unfortunate omission

has  been made in this Bill, that is the provision

declaring that this is a council or institution of

a  public  character for the purpose of  exempting

from income tax donations made to it. I would like

to  believe,  Sir,  that  this  Bill  contemplates

exempting donations to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



this  institution from income tax. This  has  been

omitted  from this Bill. Perhaps when the Minister

sums up he can enlighten us on this matter.



<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng temporarily in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This is a very

good  Bill which deserves our support. I  give  my

full support to it. I hope the Member for Nee Soon

will  not  say that he cannot support  it.  In  my

view,  this Bill should have been introduced  much

earlier,  so  that all the voluntary organisations

in   Singapore  could  become  members   of   this

statutory  body  in  order to improve  the  social

services  of our Republic. But it is not too  late

to introduce this Bill and we welcome it now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to

associate  myself with the last  two  Members  who

spoke  in support of this Bill and in appreciation

of  the services rendered by the various voluntary

organisations  and  their  contributions  to   our

nation. For example, these organisations have made

great  contributions in organising relief for  the

victims  of outbreaks of fire and other  kinds  of

calamity.   They   do  this   in   a   spirit   of

unselfishness  and a sense of public-spiritedness.

It is because of their contributions that the less

fortunate members of our society are able to enjoy

some  of the comforts of life. They have thus  the

hope  and  the  will  to  continue  earning  their

livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that the Singapore

Government  is  always interested in  the  welfare

services  of  the  country. For example,  we  have

given  a  lot of money by way of public assistance

to  the  less fortunate members of our society.  I

remember that in 1966 the sum allotted for  public

assistance was about $9.6 million. In 1967 it  was

about  $7  million. This money  was  disbursed  to

people  who were suffering from chronic  diseases,

particularly those who suffered from tuberculosis,

and to the unemployed. At the same time, we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



also  set up homes for the aged to look after  old

people  and also homes for children to look  after

the helpless children of our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this goes to show the socialist spirit of our

Government  and the humanitarianism  that  we  are

seeking  to  establish. As  a  centre  for  social

services,  the  Government has  a  great  responsi

bility,  particularly in view of  the  accelerated

withdrawal of the British troops by 1971. We  will

be  faced with two problems, namely, economic  and

defence.  Under these circumstances,  we  will  of

necessity require more voluntary organisations  to

step  up  their activities and thereby assist  the

Government  in  carrying out social  services  and

also  help  solve the problems relating  to  these

services. It is my earnest hope that the  well-to-do  and  rich members of our society will be  more

interested in social services. I appeal to them to

be  more  generous in their contributions  to  the

social  services  of Singapore  so  that  all  the

voluntary organisations and the Singapore  Council

of  Social Service will have more money  to  carry

out social service work.

which  is regrettable. In clause 6, which  relates

to  the constitution of the Council, there  is  no

provision   for   a   representative   from    the

contributions to the welfare work of our Republic.

But  there  is  no provision in this  Bill  for  a

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, those who were Members of the

last  Parliament will recall that this Bill, which

is  being  re-introduced, was read for  the  First

Time  on  25th  January this year, but  lapsed  on

prorogation of Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a consequence of the success

of   our  housing  programme  in  re-housing  over

400,000 people in modern housing estates, many  of

the  older areas of the city have become available

for redevelopment. In fact, redevelopment of these

areas  has  been  proceeding  satisfactorily.  The

Government,  however, considers it important  that

there  should be maximum private participation  in

our  urban  redevelopment programme. To this  end,

private  development  tax  concessions  have  been

approved  for  development  projects  in  some  20

designated  areas in the city. These  provide  for

exemption  of property tax on vacant  land  during

the  period  of  construction  and  reduction   of

assessment rates from 36 per cent to 12  per  cent

over  a  period  of 20 years on  completion  of  a

project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax concessions by themselves will not, however,

bring  about  development if the landlord  or  the

owner  of  the  land is unable  to  obtain  vacant

possession  from  his tenants where  such  tenants

take  advantage of the protection against eviction

afforded  to  them  under  the  Control  of   Rent

Ordinance  to demand exhorbitant sums as  a  price

for   surrendering   vacant  possession   to   the

landlord.  In  some instances, the landlords  have

refused  to pay such excessive sums as a  premium,

as  it  were,  for the development of their  sites

and,  as  a  result, development has  been  unduly

hampered and delayed in some areas which are  ripe

for redevelopment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the law now stands, there

are   serious  setbacks  in  the  way  of  private

investors   who   genuinely   want   to    promote

development in Singapore, and the Bill now  before

this  House  is designed to encourage and  promote

development  in  the  private sector  by  enabling

landlords  of  premises,  which  are  at   present

protected and controlled by 'the Control  of  Rent

Ordinance,   to   recover  possession   of   these

controlled  premises for development  purposes  on

payment  of  a  reasonable  compensation  to   the

tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is the intention to refer this Bill to

Select Committee in order that full



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



benefit  of  public  views,  particularly  on  the

compensation  rates proposed, can be  obtained,  I

shall merely touch on certain salient features  of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides, inter alia, for the Minister

to  designate certain areas in Singapore that  are

earmarked   for   development.   A   landlord   of

controlled premises in a designated area may apply

to  a  Board,  called  the "Tenants'  Compensation

Board", for an order to recover possession of  his

controlled  premises. The Board,  before  granting

the  application,  is required to  satisfy  itself

that  the landlord has a genuine intention as well

as  the financial means to develop the area,  that

this  plan for development has been approved by  a

public  officer appointed by the Minister for  the

purpose, and that he would compensate dispossessed

tenants  and sub-tenants. If the Board grants  the

application, the landlord would have to  give  his

tenants at least three months' notice to quit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the Board in arriving at a fair and

just  assessment of compensation,  the  Bill  lays

down as guide lines minimum limits of compensation

to  be  awarded which will vary according  to  the

nature  of  the  user of the controlled  premises,

that is to say, whether commercial or residential.

It  is  considered that the formula that has  been

adopted  offers  a satisfactory approach  in  this

matter.  It is not claimed to be a perfect formula

that  will  provide  a ready  answer  to  all  the

situations that the Board will be confronted with.

If there is such a formula, we have been unable to

devise it. The merit of the formula that has  been

adopted  in  clause 7 of the Bill is  that,  apart

from its simplicity, it does confer upon the Board

a great deal of flexibility in its determinations.

Only  experience  gained in the  working  of  this

proposed legislation will show whether the formula

adopted will assist the Board in carrying out  the

main  objective of the Bill which is,  as  I  have

said,   the   promotion   and   encouragement   of

development  in  the  private  sector  in  certain

designated areas in our Republic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I state at this stage that

any  alternative proposals to the Select Committee

on  the compensation provisions as well as on  any

other  provisions in this Bill, will  be  welcomed

and will receive very careful consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tenants' Compensation Board's order for

recovery of possession of controlled premises  and

an   award  of  compensation  will  be  final  and

conclusive  and  will also be enforceable  against

unauthorised  persons  on the  premises;  but  the

interests of tenants and sub-tenants are protected

by  a  provision which imposes a duty on the Board

to   advise   all   interested  parties   of   the

proceedings before the Board, enabling  them  thus

to be heard before the Board prior to the granting

of  an  order  for  the possession  of  controlled

premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a landlord fail to compensate or fail to

complete  development within the period laid  down

in  the  Bill,  the  Government  may  compulsorily

acquire the controlled premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statment to the Bill outlines in

a general way the various provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend this Bill to Members as a useful

measure that should contribute to the planning and

development of the city area and at the same  time

have  the  long-term  effect  of  adding  to   its

aesthetic attractions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in

full  agreement with the spirit of the Bill as  it

is  designed  to encourage and promote development

in the private sector in Singapore. It is the duty

of every loyal citizen to co-operate and assist in

the development of Singapore and, if need be, even

to  make sacrifices. But such sacrifices should be

made  to benefit the State and not any section  of

the  community. In this respect, may  I  draw  the

attention of the House to two aspects of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premises affected by the Bill are those that

were   built  before  January  1947.   Under   the

protection of the Control of Rent Ordinance  (Cap.

242), the rents of these premises are considerably

cheaper  than those of premises of a similar  type

built  after  the war. They are, in fact,  cheaper

than Housing Board premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum compensation of eight years' rent for

commercial  premises  and  six  years'  rent   for

residential premises provided in clause 7 (1)  (a)

and  7  (1) (b) is anything between one-fifth  and

one-tenth of the current market value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, therefore, seems to benefit the

landlords immediately. My main concern is for  the

poor  sub-tenants who live in cubicles or in small

units  which they rent from sub-tenants  of  chief

tenants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you will

agree that it is difficult, if not impossible,  to

expect  these sub-tenants to get to see the  terms

of tenancy made between the landlord and the chief

tenants at the time when they accepted their  sub-tenancy.  In  any  negotiations  for  compensation

resulting  in  awards granted by  the  Board,  the

landlord,  according to clause 9 (1) (a) ,  is  not

liable to pay compensation to a sub-tenant if  the

tenant  has  sublet the premises contrary  to  the

terms  of  his tenancy. It seems to me  that  this

clause  penalises the poor and ignorant sub-tenant

while, in fact, it was the chief tenant who  ought

to   be   penalised  for  breach  of  his  tenancy

agreement. Moreover, the chief tenant will get the

Board's  award  while  the  poor  sub-tenant   may

possibly  be evicted in accordance with  clause  4

(6) of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I urge this House to consider the

Bill  with  the utmost care while encouraging  and

promoting development in the private sector. Steps

should  be  taken  to ensure that  the  burden  of

sacrifice,  if  sacrifice  has  to  be  made,   is

equitably shared by all parties concerned and  not

borne solely by the poor tenants and sub-tenants.

<br><br>4.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,I have no doubt that this Bill has a lot  of

salient  points  in its favour, and  most  of  the

landowners who genuinely believe in development of

their  properties  must  hail  this  as  one  step

forward   in   the   development   of   Singapore.

Personally,  I believe such a Bill has  long  been

overdue.  However, I understand that it is  better

late than never.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government has managed in a relatively

short  space  of time to re-house a fifth  of  our

population  in modern housing estates,  and  I  am

sure  this is quite a record in the world.  Yet  a

good  number  of  our people are still  living  in

congested  squalor in many of the  privately-owned

residential  premises or even shophouses  in  many

parts  of  our  city. I understand most  of  these

residential  premises are leased to tenants,  many

of  whom exploit the shortage of accommodation  by

sub-letting  as much space as is humanly  possible

to  other  tenants.  These  sub-tenants  are  thus

compelled  to live in almost sub-human  conditions

and  surroundings. These houses  are  therefore  a

constant  risk  to human lives in  terms  both  of

health and fire. Sir, I am as sorry for these sub-tenants as for the owners of such properties. They

are  victims of the Control of Rent Ordinance. The

law  protects the principal tenants from  eviction

and an increase in rents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Bill, although very commendable, may

yet  prove to be a boom to the principal  tenants.

So  far,  these  persons  have  enjoyed  very  low

rentals  and  thus saved a fortune. Many  of  them

have acquired another fortune by subletting to  as

many  persons  as  possible. Now  these  principal

tenants  have  the prospects of  getting  a  third

fortune,  namely, compensation for vacating  their

rented  premises. Surely there must be a limit  to

so   much  good  fortune  being  given  to   these

principal  tenants.  Why must  the  landowners  or

property owners be at the losing end all along the

way? The Bill expects these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



owners to develop the properties out of their  own

funds.  I  do  hope, therefore, that the  Tenants'

Compensation Board, when formed, will bear in mind

the  loss  of reasonable income by the owners  for

many  years. The amount of compensation calculated

must  be based more on what the owners can  do  in

the  development  of Singapore than  on  what  the

tenants   hope   to  extract  from   society.   If

compensation  is to be paid to a principal  tenant

who  has  sublet  the house to others,  then  this

compensation   should  also   be   proportionately

parcelled out to the sub-tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see in clause 7, sub-clause (1) (a), (b)

and  (c) ,  that a minimum compensation is stressed

in  relationship to controlled premises. Surely if

stress is made on a minimum compensation, it would

be equally fair if a possible maximum compensation

is  also stressed so as to cut down demands  to  a

sensible amount. Otherwise, where is the limit  to

demands by unreasonable tenants?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister why only certain areas

will  be  designated? How are these  areas  to  be

earmarked?  Is  it by reason of  the  age  of  the

areas, congestion, squalid conditions, ugliness or

tourist  attractions? If these  are  the  reasons,

then  practically the whole city of Singapore must

be designated for re-development.



<br><br>4.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I also wish to express my support

for  this  Bill,  especially  the  provisions   to

establish the Tenants' Compensation Board and  the

payment of compensation to tenants before recovery

of controlled premises. This Bill should have been

introduced  earlier. It is introduced  only  today

but I feel that it is still not too late yet. Past

experience  shows  that  many  people  wanting  to

recover  their  property  and  premises  exercised

stringency  in  the amount of compensation  to  be

paid.  Thus,  tenants normally refused  to  accept

such compensation. They demanded more compensation

and the owners refused to give in to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



their demands. In the end, it usually resulted  in

fights and court cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would say that the Minister is

judicious in introducing certain provisions in the

Bill  which  will benefit many of our  people  and

which   will   solve  many  of  our  housing   and

development problems. In my opinion, many  of  our

streets  have to be extended and many  dilapidated

houses should give way to development in order  to

modernise our city. This Bill will enable this  to

be done, so I must support it.



<br><br>4.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the introduction of this Bill in itself is  a

reflection  of the vast social changes  that  have

taken  place in Singapore, especially in the field

of housing and of which we can be justly proud.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, the systematic control of rent was

introduced   in  many  countries  in  the   world,

especially  in  Europe. As a result  of  the  vast

social upheavals that took place in the two  World

Wars, it is in fact a reflection of the degree  to

which we have mitigated these effects in Singapore

that we are able to move a Bill of this nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are, however, a few

issues  of a fundamental nature involved  in  this

Bill upon which I would like to dwell. They relate

mainly to the functions and powers of the Tenants'

Compensation  Board.  These  powers,   which   are

provided in this Bill, will be much more extensive

than  those  conferred  on the  Rent  Conciliation

Board  set up under the Control of Rent Ordinance.

Under  normal  circumstances, such  functions  and

powers would have been exercised by the High Court

which  should be the proper body for administering

a  statute  affecting the very serious rights  and

liabilities of litigants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, examples of these wide judicial

powers are -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the power to grant orders for the recovery

of possession of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlled premises under clauses 4 (3) and

11 of the Bill;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the power to enforce execution of the Board's

order under clause 4 (6) of the Bill;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the power to award compensation under clause

6 (12) which will far exceed the powers of a civil

District Judge;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) orders of the Board cannot be challenged

either  by  appeal  or by prerogative  writs

even  where  there have been blatant  errors

of  the  law  or  even where the  Board  has

acted ultra vires.



<br><br>Even  in the case of the lesser powers exercisable

by  the  Rent  Conciliation Board, the Legislature

had wisely seen fit to make the proceedings before

the  Board judicial proceedings. I would  strongly

recommend  that, in view of this, section  8  (4),

(5),  (6),  (7),  and (8) of the Control  of  Rent

Ordinance ought to be adopted as parts of clause 6

of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to draw attention to clause 6

(10)  of  the Bill which intends to allow  a  non-qualified person to appear before the Board. I  am

not  a protagonist of a closed-shop policy insofar

as lawyers are concerned. But having regard to the

gravity  of  the issues which would be before  the

Board  and the need to make the Board observe  the

principles  inherent  in judicial  proceedings,  I

would  suggest  that all persons appearing  before

the  Board  should  be  practising  advocates  and

solicitors. They are not only capable of assisting

the  Board  in  a judicial manner,  but  are  also

subject to disciplinary proceedings if they should

fail  to observe the rules of professional conduct

and    the   regulations   applicable   to    such

proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 (3) of the Bill seeks to define the

expression  "commercial purposes" and "residential

purposes".  The  Bill  has  overlooked,  it  would

appear,  cases  where controlled premises  may  be

used both for commercial and residential



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



purposes.  It  is, therefore, suggested  that  the

House  should consider how compensation should  be

awarded  in cases where the premises are used  for

these mixed purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One views with concern the provisions of clause

15  (3) of the Bill making the order of the  Board

not  only final but beyond challenge of any appeal

or  prerogative  writs  even  though  the  Board's

judgment may be tainted with error in law or  made

in lack of jurisdiction. I feel that this proposal

should  be deleted and the provisions of  sections

11,  12  and  13 of the Control of Rent  Ordinance

should be substituted in its place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above this, I would support the intent

of  the  Bill  which  I think  is  timely  if  the

economic  development  of  Singapore  is  to  move

apace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the wake of city development and

the   British   withdrawal  from  Singapore,   the

introduction  of  this Bill  is  very  timely  and

necessary. With the passage of this Bill  I  think

many  developers will be able to take part in  the

Government's urban renewal programme. In the  long

run  this Bill will bring about a better and  more

aesthetic  looking  city.  It  will  resolve  many

problems,  such  as  the  congestion  in   certain

streets  and  areas.  There  will  also  be   more

employment opportunities and economic growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can say that the persons who drafted this Bill

have  done  their best to look after the interests

of both land-owners and tenants. But some people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



consider that the compensation stipulated  in  the

Bill  to  be  paid to tenants and  sub-tenants  is

rather  low.  Take, for instance, the  case  of  a

three-storey building. If the premises come  under

the  Rent  Control Ordinance, then the rent  would

normally be not more than $150 per month.  If  the

premises  are used for residential purposes,  then

under  the Bill the tenant can only get a  minimum

of  150  times  12 times $6, namely,  $10,800.  If

there   are  three  tenants  occupying  the   same

building, then each household will be getting only

$3,600.  That is not too bad. But, in fact,  these

premises would normally have been in existence for

quite  a long time and not many people are staying

in  the  same building. So each household will  be

getting only a very meagre sum as compensation. In

addition  to  this, they will have to  move  house

within   a  short  time.  So  there  is  a   great

difference  between the benefit they  can  get  as

compensation and the loss they will have to  incur

and the inconvenience suffered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my calculation, the situation is

like  this. If the law is put into effect, I  hope

the  Tenants'  Compensation  Board  will  consider

every case with sympathy and consideration and not

stick  always to the minimum rate of compensation.

Moreover,  the sub-tenants and sub-sub-tenants  in

the building should be given due consideration. We

all  remember that during the years of the  Second

World  War when there was a housing shortage  many

chief  tenants  made  use of  the  opportunity  to

exploit their sub-tenants and extract money out of

them.  They disregarded the Rent Control Ordinance

and other relevant laws, if any.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the law in existence up till now, no

protection  whatsoever  is given  to  sub-tenants.

Although  according  to  the  proposed  Bill  sub-tenants  may get some compensation from the  chief

tenants, many members of the public think that the

protection  and the benefits given to  sub-tenants

under this Bill are not sufficient. I feel that in

stipulating  the compensation to be given  by  the

Board to the chief tenant, consideration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



should also be given to the amount of compensation

to be given to the sub-tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the amount necessary for the

development  of  premises,  the  Bill   does   not

stipulate a maximum. It is therefore not  possible

to assess the position. But the Bill provides that

when an application is made for the development of

premises,  the  owner has to  prove  that  he  has

sufficient  funds to develop the site and  furnish

the   necessary  funds.  This  is  what  the  Bill

stipulates. But this is not very clear and I  hope

that   when   the  Bill  is  referred  to   Select

Committee, a more definite picture on this  matter

can  emerge and more clear cut provisions will  be

put into the Bill. I hope also that the Board will

be given a clear picture in regard to this matter,

especially  when  there is no appeal  against  the

final decision of the Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I merely wish to bring up a small point. I am

sure  the  Minister is well aware that  there  are

tenants,  or more precisely occupiers,  who  enjoy

physical occupation of the controlled premises and

pay  their  rent under the names of  the  previous

tenants from whom they have taken over the tenancy

right.  There are, of course, cases of assignments

or  transfers  effected without the knowledge  and

consent  of  the  landlord.  But  there  are  also

instances  of  occupiers  who  are  relatives   or

surviving   members   of  the  deceased   tenants.

According to the provisions of clauses 10, 11  and

12  of  the  Bill, I presume - and I  stand  to  be

corrected,  Sir  -  that such  occupiers  will  be

classified  as trespassers and that they  will  be

paid  only ex-gratia payments. It would  be  gross

injustice  to treat these occupiers as trespassers

simply   because  they  do  not  have  a   tenancy

agreement with the landlord in their own names.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would request the Minister to look into

this   problem   and   introduce   some   remedial

provisions  to  protect  the  interest  of   these

occupiers.  Notwithstanding what I  have  said,  I

support this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  no complaint against the intent of the Bill.

The  objectives  attempted by  it  are  worthy  of

support  by  both the landlords and  the  tenants.

There  is no doubt that Singapore needs very rapid

development. There is even less doubt that one  of

the  major causes retarding development  has  been

the  operation  of the Control of  Rent  Ordinance

which, for over 20 years, has pegged rents at such

unrealistic levels so that slums remain slums. The

existence of the Control of Rent Ordinance for  so

long  has  also resulted in abuses and  inequities

being  deeply entrenched and interwoven  into  our

social  and  economic system. Therefore,  while  I

applaud  the  Government  for  the  bold  move  to

rectify an ancient ill, I must, at the same  time,

sound a note of caution as to the possible adverse

repercussions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many tenancies of rent controlled premises have

changed  hands  many times and,  quite  frequently

with the knowledge and connivance of the landlord,

at  very  high premiums. For instance, it  is  not

unknown that certain premises along the busy parts

of  North Bridge Road have changed hands with  tea

money  paid out as high as $100,000. If  the  last

tenant  who  paid this huge sum  of  money  for  a

tenancy of the premises is evicted, it will  be  a

very    difficult   problem   for   the    Tenants

Compensation  Board to determine the right  amount

of compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is required to award a fair and

reasonable sum, but this sum will not be less than

eight  years' rent paid for the premises. Assuming

that  the  Board  has found it  a  fact  that  the

landlord  has taken tea money -and this is  always

very  difficult to prove, although  it  is  highly

inconceivable that any landlord would have allowed

a  change of tenancy if his palm were not  greased

with  money,  is the Board in a position  to  take

into  account  the  landlord's share  of  the  tea

money? If not, will not the landlord get an unfair

advantage? Even if the Board can take into account

the landlord's share of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



tea  money,  it can at best take into account  the

last  tenancy  transfer, as it is highly  unlikely

that  earlier tenants can be traced or, if traced,

will volunteer information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many instances, the tea money paid by the last

tenant, partly to the landlord and partly  to  the

previous  tenant, represents a sizable investment,

and probably almost his entire capital will, as it

were,  be  gone and replaced only fractionally  by

the  Board's award. How many such businesses owned

by  such tenants will be adversely affected  I  do

not pretend to be able to guess. But I should like

those charged with declaring an area as designated

for development, or with the onerous duties of the

Board, to bear in mind that brand-new shopping and

business  premises will mean very  little  if  the

businesses  that are expected to occupy  them  are

made  bankrupt  by  the process  of  building  the

premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I make these observations fully conscious of

the  provisions contained in clause 7 (2)  of  the

Bill,  which  allows the Board to give  regard  to

goodwill,  probable loss of income, disruption  of

business, cost of removal, etc. The basic fact  is

that if the award comes anywhere near the tenant's

expectations,  the need for this  Bill  would  not

have  arisen because the tenant would have already

come  to  an agreement with the landlord. But  the

very nature of this Bill is to enable the landlord

to  recover  premises which  he  cannot  do  under

existing conditions.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

feel in all sincerity that the Government must  be

commended  for  this  very sensible  Bill  on  the

recovery  of  possession  of  controlled  premises

designed  to encourage and promote development  in

the  private  sector in Singapore. The  Government

has,   of  late,  placed  much  emphasis  on   the

introduction  of  incentives  to  accelerate   the

industrial   and  economic  development   of   our

country. This Bill for the recovery



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



of  possession  of  controlled  premises  is  very

constructive,  being fair, flexible and  providing

adequate protection to both landlords and tenants.

How  I wish that the proposed new labour laws  are

as constructive and encouraging as this one!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all obstructions to the progress of our

society  must  be  removed in an intelligent  way.

Squatter  areas, illegal and other forms  of  land

occupation   which   are  not  only   economically

unproductive  but  also  socially  and  physically

unhealthy,  must  make way for new  and  healthier

social  and economic development. But such changes

must be made with the least possible hardship  and

in  the  most  fair and equitable  manner  to  all

classes of people, be they capitalists or workers,

landlords or tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is in this Bill an elaborate list of

provisions to ensure that a landlord claiming land

must  have  a  sincere intention  to  develop  the

property. There is a heavy penalty - which is  the

compulsory acquisition of the controlled  premises

by  Government - should a landlord after  recovery

of  the  premises fail to complete its development

within   a   prescribed  period.  The   safeguards

provided  in  this  Bill  against  abuses  by  the

landlord are indeed quite complete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also heartening to note that fairly

adequate   provisions  have   been   proposed   to

compensate tenants affected by this Bill. I  refer

to  the  proposed  establishment of  the  Tenants'

Compensation  Board,  the minimum  payment  of  at

least  six years' and eight years' rent to evicted

tenants   of  residential  and  business  premises

respectively.  And there are also  provisions  for

compensation  for loss of goodwill, disruption  of

business,  etc. I am, however, quite  ignorant  of

the basis upon which the Government has arrived at

the  decision  to pay a minimum of six  and  eight

years' rent to tenants of residential and business

premises  respectively. I  will  be  glad  if  the

Minister  for  Law  and National  Development  can

enlighten me on this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of evicted tenants, may I

suggest  that these persons be given  priority  to

move  back to their original area of residence  or

business,  if such is possible, after  development

of  the  area has been completed? There  are  some

who,  I  believe, for good reasons would prefer  a

temporary  rather than a permanent uprooting  from

their original area of tenancy. Certain areas, for

example,   are   strategic  areas   for   business

operations enabling lower transportation costs and

within  convenient reach of many other  facilities

if  these amenities still exist after development.

There  is no reason to deny priority to those  who

originally enjoyed them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further wish to suggest a more comprehensive

procedure  to  deal with claims  from  tenants  of

business   houses.   Such   claims   may   involve

substantial amounts and can be highly complicated.

As  such,  I do not feel that the rulings  of  the

Tenants'  Compensation  Board  can  adequately  do

justice.  To be fair, it is my contention  that  a

dissatisfied tenant should have option  to  appeal

to a higher authority, preferably to a civil court

of law. This will certainly act as a counter-check

to  the  rulings of the Board and justice will  be

more fully ensured.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it that there are no other

Members who wish to speak. Mr Barker.



<br><br>5.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, it is obvious from the number of

Members who have spoken that this Bill has aroused

great interest. Most have spoken in favour of  the

Bill but have criticised various clauses. I do not

propose  to  deal with all criticisms  today.  The

Bill  is  going  to  Select Committee.  In  Select

Committee, we will not only receive the  views  of

Members  of  this  House but, what  is  even  more

important,  the  written  representations  of  the

public. And if landlords or tenants wish to appear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



before the Committee, they will be most welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps I can here deal with some of the

salient points raised by hon. Members. One or  two

Members   are   not  very  conversant   with   the

provisions of the Control of Rent Ordinance. These

are,  I  am  afraid, rather complicated provisions

and even some lawyers do not understand them. Many

hon.  Members were concerned with the position  of

the  sub-tenant or the sub-sub-tenant.  Under  the

Control  of  Rent Ordinance, the landlord  of  the

premises is the landlord of the principal  tenant.

But  the principal tenant is the landlord  of  the

sub-tenant. And the sub-tenant is the landlord  of

the  sub-sub-tenant, and so on.  But,  of  course,

there  are  persons who are, in legal terminology,

trespassers and some are merely licensees. I  will

not bother hon. Members with the legal definitions

of who is a tenant and who is a licensee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem here has been to find a quick method

of evicting tenants, sub-tenants, sub-sub-tenants,

licensees  and  trespassers by  paying  those  who

deserve compensation a reasonable compensation and

allowing  the  landlord to rebuild as  quickly  as

possible. In law, the trespasser is in a very weak

position.  He trespasses. He should not be  there.

Why  should  he be paid? A licensee, on reasonable

notice,  must  vacate. It is only when  a  tenancy

exists that the protection of the Control of  Rent

Ordinance  comes into force. These are all  rather

complicated  problems. And it is no  use  evicting

only  tenants and sub-tenants without  getting  an

order  against  licensees and trespassers  because

then  you  will  have to go to the High  Court  to

evict trespassers and licensees. It will be a long

time  before you get judgment in your  favour  and

there can be appeal after appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Member for Bukit Panjang, who is a lawyer

himself  and  who understands these problems,  has

made  many  important points. He is worried  about

the  order  of the Board being a final  order.  He

wants  an appeal at least on a question of law.  I

would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



agree  that,  as far as the amount of compensation

is concerned, there should be no appeal as in land

acquisition cases. But when there is an  issue  as

to  whether a man is a tenant or a licensee  or  a

trespasser, then the Board may slip up. But  these

are  matters which the Select Committee  can  deal

with.  I am sure the legal profession itself  will

make representations, if not similar then somewhat

on  the same lines as have been made by the Member

for Bukit Panjang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for compensation, in my opening speech I said

that  the formula was not a perfect formula and  I

would  be happy if any Member in this House  could

suggest  or devise a perfect formula. Roughly,  we

work  on  the  lines that reasonable  compensation

would  be  somewhat equivalent to  the  tea  money

which is being paid in Singapore for a transfer of

the  tenancy  or for the surrender of  possession.

But,  obviously,  even the  amount  of  tea  money

varies.  You  pay  more  tea  money  for  business

premises than for a residence. Hence eight  years'

rent   for  business  and  six  years'  rent   for

residential premises. But this will vary not  only

from  business to business but also from place  to

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Joo Chiat wants to know why we do

not declare the whole island a designated area. To

do that would raise even a bigger howl. I think it

would  be  best  that  we proceed  cautiously  and

designate only certain areas as a start,  probably

the  area within a mile of Raffles Place.  I  say,

"for a start" and, then we go on. The areas to  be

designated will be designated by the Minister but,

of  course, on the recommendations of his planners

and  other  urban renewal experts. When the  Board

first  starts to sit, we do not want to  flood  it

with so many applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Anson,

who  is not here, raised certain questions of  law

as  to  why  sub-tenants who under  the  principal

tenancy should not have gone into the premises are

barred    by    this   Ordinance   from    getting

compensation; for even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



under  the Control of Rent Ordinance, the landlord

can  recover possession of the premises  from  his

principal  tenant if under the principal  contract

of  tenancy,  subletting  is  prohibited  and  the

principal  tenant  sublets. It  is  a  contractual

obligation  which, if broken, gives  the  landlord

certain remedies. If I let out my house to you  on

condition  that you do not let it  out  to  anyone

else,  and  you  do,  well, you  are  looking  for

trouble. And so is that somebody else who takes it

from you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think I need say much

more  except  that  I should  put  on  the  Select

Committee  Members of this House  who  have  shown

such great interest in the Bill.

to  patents  is  contained in the Registration  of

United Kingdom Patents Ordinance (Cap. 181)  which

provides  for  the registration  in  Singapore  of

patents  granted  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Such

registration   confers   privileges   and   rights

relating to the invention similar in all respects



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



to  those conferred by the issue of the patent  in

the   United  Kingdom.  There  are,  however,   no

provisions  in our Ordinance to require  patentees

to  work their inventions in Singapore. There  are

also  no  provisions empowering the  Registrar  of

Patents  in Singapore to grant compulsory licences

for  the making, using, exercising and vending  of

patented  inventions in Singapore. The  result  is

that  owners  of patents registered  in  Singapore

have  in  most  cases not bothered to  work  their

inventions  in  Singapore.  This  is  particularly

evident  in  the field of patented  medicines  and

drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for patented medicines in Singapore,

therefore,  can  only be met by importation  which

has caused a substantial loss in foreign exchange.

An   analysis  of  major  patented  pharmaceutical

products purchased by private consumers shows that

there  would  be a saving in foreign  exchange  of

about  $2  million per year if local manufacturers

are   permitted  to  manufacture  patented  drugs.

Important   drugs,   which  if   manufactured   in

Singapore  can be made available at  lower  costs,

are being imported and sold to local consumers  at

higher  prices.  In order to make  available  such

drugs  to the public at reasonable prices  and  in

order  to  develop our pharmaceutical industry,  a

system   of   compulsory  licensing  is   urgently

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A compulsory licence is an authorisation given by

a  competent authority to a person other than  the

owner  of  the  patent  to  make,  sell,  use  and

exercise  the  patented product  even  though  the

beneficiary  of  the  compulsory  licence  has  no

authorisation  from  the  owner  of  the   patent.

Although  the laws of many countries  provide  for

compulsory licences, in actual fact, the number of

cases  in which these provisions have been invoked

are relatively few. This is no indication that the

system of compulsory licences has not attained the

main  objective  for which it  was  created.  This

objective is to cause the working of the patented



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



invention in the country. If the owner of a patent

does  not work his invention or hesitates to grant

contractual licences on reasonable terms, the mere

fact  that  the  law  empowers  the  granting   of

compulsory  licences for the  manufacture  of  his

invention  will  usually  induce  him   to   grant

licences by contract on reasonable terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill in clauses 3 and 5

empowers   the  Registrar  of  Patents  to   grant

compulsory  licences  in respect  of  the  making,

using,   exercising   and  vending   of   patented

inventions  concerned with food or medicine  or  a

surgical  or curative device and also  on  certain

grounds  -  in  respect of classes  of  inventions

listed  in  the  Schedule to the  Bill.  Clause  5

however  provides  that the  Registrar  shall  not

grant  a  licence in respect of a  patented  food,

medicine  or  surgical or curative device  if  the

patentee   satisfies  him  that  he  has   already

established  or is about to establish an  industry

in Singapore for the making of such food, medicine

or surgical or curative device.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar is empowered in clause 7 to revoke

a  patent  under certain circumstances  two  years

after  he has granted a licence to manufacture  in

Singapore  the  invention  to  which  the   patent

relates.   These  provisions  are   necessary   to

encourage   the  commercial  working   of   recent

inventions  in  Singapore  and  will  benefit  our

industrialisation  programme.  The  Minister  will

have power to add to the list in the said Schedule

as and when required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 10, the Registrar is empowered, where

the  patentee and the licensee are unable to agree

on  the amount of the royalty or compensation,  to

determine  the  amount of royalty or  compensation

payable to the patentee under a compulsory licence

but  such royalty or compensation shall not exceed

ten  per cent of the net ex-factory sale price  in

bulk of the patented article.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that the rights conferred

by a patent shall not be deemed to be infringed by

the  making,  importation or obtaining  by  or  on

behalf of the Government of any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



patented medicine or drug for distribution or  use

in  any  dispensary,  hospital  or  other  medical

institution  maintained by or  on  behalf  of  the

Government or otherwise specified by the  Minister

by notification in the Gazette. The patentee shall

be   notified  by  the  Government  as   soon   as

practicable of such making or user and in  default

of  any  agreement  between the patentee  and  the

Government, the Registrar may determine the amount

of   royalty  or  compensation  payable   to   the

patentee,  but such royalty or compensation  shall

not  exceed  five per cent of the  net  ex-factory

sale price in bulk of the patented article.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appeal lies against any decision of the

Registrar  to  an Appeal Tribunal to  be  presided

over by a Judge of the High Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must emphasise that it is not

the purpose of this Bill to deprive any person  of

his  rights  under a patent. Its main  aim  is  to

secure that inventions whose exploitation would be

of  economic benefit to Singapore are commercially

worked locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to provide for the

extradition  of  fugitives - in other  words,  the

surrender of a fugitive criminal by one  state  to

another  in  which he is liable to be punished  or

has been convicted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be of interest to Members if, before

moving on to the historical background of the  law

of  extradition  that is at present  in  force  in

Singapore,  I  say a few words on the  theoretical

basis  of  this  law. In theory no  state  can  be

called  upon to enforce through its tribunals  the

penal laws of other states, or to try a person for

an  offence alleged to have been committed  beyond

its  frontiers, if a man commits a crime in China,

you  do  not try him in Singapore, and vice versa.

The principles of the independence and sovereignty

of   each   country  militate  against  any   such

obligation. It has, however, for a long time  been

recognised  by various states that it  is  not  in

their interest to afford refuge to criminals  from

other  countries. On the contrary, it is in  their

interests  to  return  the fugitive  criminal  for

trial  and  punishment to the state in  which  the

offence was committed or in which the criminal was

convicted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involving, therefore, as it does the extension of

the  criminal jurisdiction of one state beyond its

own  territorial  limits into  those  of  another,

extradition   forms,  at  the  present   day,   an

important    and   integral   part    of    Public

International  Law,  and is as  such,  apart  from

international  comity,  generally   regulated   by

mutual  arrangement or treaty between the  various

states.  Most  states  in the  modern  world  have

extradition laws in force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these few remarks, I will now survey the

historical  background to the existing extradition

laws in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Laws have been derived from two English

Statutes  -  the  Extradition  Act,  1870,   which

applies  to  extradition to foreign countries  and

the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, which applies to

extradition  among  Commonwealth  countries.  Both

these Statutes have outlived their usefulness. Not

only  is  their  continued existence  incompatible

with  the  independent  and  sovereign  status  of

Singapore  but also, since they belong to  another

age,   they  fail  to  take  into  account  modern

concepts  that have now become part of extradition

laws in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



Commonwealth. For example, they do not provide for

a  state to refuse extradition of a person who  is

to  be charged with or surrendered for a political

offence   or   for  an  offence  of  a   political

character. Apart from anything else, it is clearly

right and proper that Singapore should now be able

of  its  own  accord  to  enter  into  extradition

treaties  with foreign states though the  treaties

already made by the United Kingdom and Malaysia on

behalf  of Singapore will continue to apply  until

such  time  as  the Government decides  that  they

should cease so to apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Commonwealth countries there will

be  no necessity to enter into bilateral treaties,

for a common scheme for extradition was agreed  to

at  the Commonwealth Law Ministers Conference held

in  May  1966,  in London at which  I  represented

Singapore. It was agreed at that meeting that this

common  scheme  should apply to  all  Commonwealth

countries and is to be included in the legislation

of  each  country; though this does  not  preclude

modification  of  the general  scheme  in  certain

circumstances. The common scheme, which  has  been

written  into this Bill, is significant  since  it

incorporates a revised list of agreed extraditable

offences,  which  will have application  not  only

with  regard  to extradition as between  Singapore

and   other  Commonwealth  countries,   but   also

(subject  to  treaty)  as  between  Singapore  and

foreign states. For the sake of clarity, I  should

mention at this point that the distinction that is

made  in  the  United  Kingdom  Acts  between  the

expression "extradition" as applying to  surrender

of fugitive criminals among independent states and

the   expression  "fugitive  offenders"  as  being

restricted  to  cases  of  surrender  as   between

different  parts of the British Commonwealth,  now

disappears. Indeed, as the Bill makes  clear,  the

provisions  dealing  with  surrender  to   foreign

states  follow  much  the same  pattern  as  those

dealing with surrender to Commonwealth countries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Members will notice that the

United  Kingdom Acts to which I have referred  are

repealed  by  this proposed legislation.  It  will

further  be  observed that the Malaysian  Warrants

and  Summons  (Special Provisions) Act,  1965,  is

also  repealed. The reason for this  is  that  the

same  ground  is covered by Part  V  of  the  Bill

dealing  with  extradition to and  from  Malaysia.

This   Part  provides  a  simple  and  expeditious

procedure  for  the  return of fugitive  offenders

from  Singapore  to Malaysia. It is  the  sort  of

simplified   procedure  as  between   neighbouring

countries that was envisaged in the common scheme.

Malaysia  in  its Commonwealth Fugitive  Criminals

Act,   1967   (No.  54  of  1967)   has   included

corresponding provisions. These provisions provide

for  Magistrates  to  issue  or  endorse  warrants

rather  than the more complicated "requisition  to

Minister"  procedure laid down  for  surrender  of

fugitives   to   foreign  and  other  Commonwealth

countries.  They also extend to a wider  range  of

offences  than is the case with foreign and  other

Commonwealth countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement to the Bill describes

in   some   detail  the  nature  of  the   various

provisions  in  the Bill and I do not  propose  to

elaborate on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would, for the information of

Members, mention that enabling legislation  giving

effect  to  the  common scheme  has  already  been

enacted  in  the  United  Kingdom,  Australia  and

Malaysia - there may well be others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a very

interesting  Bill and I must commend it.  For  the

first  time in a very long while, we have  a  Bill

which  is  really well drafted. Over the ages  all

over  the world two principles have contested with

each   other  for  final  expression.   Both   are

civilised principles. One, of course, is  that  no

state must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



allow  its  territory to be used as  a  haven  for

common criminals. The second one, especially after

the   French  Revolution,  is  that  no  political

offender  should be extradited. Even to  this  day

the  battle between these two principles  has  not

been  finally resolved. I am glad to note that  we

have  made  adequate provisions in  this  Bill  to

safeguard   political  offenders   who   come   to

Singapore and find haven here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are, however, a few

provisions  which  I  would like  to  consider  in

detail,  at least for the purpose of rationalising

the  faults.  We have three clauses -  clause  26,

clause  37  and clause 45 of the Bill.  All  these

three  clauses  deal  with  an  order  made  by  a

magistrate for committal. If the committed  person

is  not happy with the order of the magistrate, he

has got two different types of redress. Clause  37

deals  with  Malaysia. It lays down  that  if  the

committed  person is not satisfied with the  order

of  the  magistrate he can make an application  to

the  High  Court.  It is a very simple  procedure.

Whereas clause 12, dealing with a foreign country,

and   clause   26,  dealing  with  a  Commonwealth

country, lay down that he can bring the matter  up

in  the High Court by way of habeas corpus proceedings.  I  do  not  see  logically  why  we  should

maintain  this  difference in this  Bill.  If  the

procedure  in  clause 37 is the more rational  and

simple,  then, of course, it should apply  to  the

other  two clauses as well. Or, on the other hand,

if  the habeas corpus procedure is a simpler  one,

then, of course, it should be made to apply  to  a

Malaysian  offender  as well.  It  may  not  be  a

fundamental point, Mr Speaker, Sir, but  I  think

it  will make for clarity and symmetry in the  law

if this can be rationalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 45 gives the Minister the power to vary

the Schedules of this Bill and I am very concerned

with  the  First  Schedule  which  lays  down  the

various  offences  for which an  offender  can  be

extradited. What I am concerned with  is  that  in

making a variation, we should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



make  sure  that  a  person  who  is  already   in

Singapore,  having committed an offence  which  is

not covered by the Schedule, should not be brought

under  this  purview merely by  a  change  in  the

Schedule itself. These are the small points  which

I really want to discuss, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make one other point. I notice

that in this Bill and in one other Bill, there  is

an index laid out. I notice that most of the other

Bills  that  have  been brought before  Parliament

from time to time do not have an index at all. Can

I  make  a  suggestion, Sir? In future, all  Bills

should have indexes like this because it makes  it

simpler for reference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Tang See Chim and other hon. Members:</b>  Hear,

hear!



<br><br>6.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did say in my

opening speech that Part V of the Bill deals  with

extradition  to and from Malaysia and  provides  a

simple and expeditious procedure for the return of

fugitive offenders from Singapore to Malaysia.  As

the  Member for Bukit Panjang well knows, we  were

not   very  long  ago  a  part  of  Malaysia.  For

historical reasons, we are more closely  connected

with Malaysia than with other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as foreign countries are concerned, it is

not  so  easy to come to some extradition  treaty.

Hence the difference between the procedure for the

extradition   of  fugitives  from   Singapore   to

Malaysia  and  those to and from Commonwealth  and

foreign  countries. The procedure for  extradition

as between Commonwealth countries was agreed to at

the  London Law Conference which I mentioned.  The

procedure  for  extradition between Singapore  and

Malaysia has been agreed to between Singapore  and

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Schedule, the Minister has powers to

vary it. But here again



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



the  list  of  offences  that  are  specified   as

extraditable  offences as far as the  Commonwealth

is  concerned, was again agreed to  after  a  long

argument  at the London Law Conference.  It  forms

part of a common scheme which has been adopted  by

the  Commonwealth countries subject to  variations

or modifications as each country chooses to adopt.

There  has been one difficulty, which is this.  If

you commit the offence of murder in Singapore, you

are  liable  to  be  sentenced to  be  hanged.  As

Members well know, the United Kingdom have got rid

of  capital punishment perhaps to suit  their  own

local   social  conditions.  Our  conditions   are

different.  They want a discretion  - a  discretion

not  to  return  persons  who  commit  murder   in

Singapore and run to the United Kingdom. They  say

that  it  is  against their social  conscience  if

these   offenders   are   returned   because,   on

conviction,  they  are liable to  be  hanged.  Our

argument is that the crime is committed here.  And

surely the punishment to be meted out should be in

accordance  with  our laws, not theirs.  I  merely

raise  this matter because, as between  country  A

and  country B, there may be modifications to  the

scheme.  Some countries may not choose  to  return

offenders   for   certain  offences.   Hence   the

provision  enabling  the  Minister  to  vary   the

Schedule.  But I give the hon. Member my assurance

that  we will not vary the Schedule in respect  of

crimes  that have already been committed in  order

to fix someone who has done it and is about to run

away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill was introduced in the last Parliament

but has since lapsed in view of the dissolution of

Parliament on 8th February, 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes a number of significant amendments

to   the   Medicines  (Advertisement   and   Sale)

Ordinance, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past few years, the Ministry of Health

has  been  receiving numerous complaints regarding

undesirable  advertisements  appearing  in   local

newspapers  concerning  medicines  or  unqualified

persons  claiming  cures  for  a  wide  range   of

conditions,   from   sexual   weakness,    chronic

sterility, menstrual disorders to kidney diseases,

etc.   In   general,   these  advertisements   are

deceitful, misleading and are calculated  to  dupe

the uninformed and gullible members of the public,

so that they can part with their money to purchase

these  so-called "miraculous cures" for all  their

ills. Existing Ordinances for the control of  such

advertisements,     namely,     the      Medicines

(Advertisement and Sale) Ordinance, 1955, and  the

Indecent  Advertisement Ordinance (Cap. 142),  are

inadequate and prosecutions under these Ordinances

have    proved    difficult   and    unsuccessful,

particularly  as advertisers have  got  round  the

restrictions by using homonyms and synonyms, or by

claiming  to advertise medical skills  instead  of

medicines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has given very careful consideration

to  this  problem  before this  present  stage  of

proposing an Amendment Bill to this House. As  far

back  as  1962, a Committee was formed to  examine

the problem and suggest

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To study the current undesirable and unethical

"cures" and "advertisement of cures", and to

suggest measures of control.'



This  Committee  made certain recommendations  for

control. Subsequently, in 1966, the Committee  was

resuscitated under the same Chairman, Dr Gwee  Ah

Leng, with the following terms of reference:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To study the current unethical, dishonest and

undesirable    advertisements    pertaining     to

treatment,  cures, and to the medical,  skills  of

unqualified  persons  and to suggest  measures  of

effective control.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unanimous conclusions of this Committee

extended   the  recommendations  of  the  previous

Committee by reviewing and adding to the  list  of

diseases prohibited for general advertising and by

recommending  a  general ban on all advertisements

pertaining' to medical skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also made certain recommendations

for   the  effective  control  of  labelling   and

importation  of  drugs which are being  separately

dealt  with  by  the  Controller  of  Imports  and

Exports as they relate to his control measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the Committee's report have been

distributed  to Members of this House through  the

Clerk of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to elaborate on the Bill, clause

by clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 sets out the short title and

commencement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends section 4 of the Ordinance by

substituting a Schedule in place of  the  list  of

conditions  and diseases mentioned in  respect  of

which  advertisements are prohibited. The Schedule

may  be  amended by notification in  the  Gazette.

This arrangement is obviously less cumbersome than

having    to   amend   the   Ordinance    whenever

circumstances make it necessary to amend the list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 creates a new section aimed at

prohibiting  advertisements  relating  to  medical

skill or service. Medical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



practitioners of the Western school are  forbidden

to   advertise  by  their  ethics  and   this   is

controlled   by  a  disciplinary   body   of   the

profession  itself, namely, the Singapore  Medical

Council. The Chinese Physicians' Association  have

also  officially  declared  its  stand  in  public

against advertisements by medical practitioners of

the  Chinese school. However, in their case,  they

are  handicapped by lack of a disciplinary  board,

The amendment in this new section will, therefore,

reinforce the hand of medical practitioners of the

Chinese  school who will now be able to see  their

stand  reinforced  by law. This  prohibition  will

financially affect a number of publications in the

Chinese medium, but public interest must supersede

private  interest, however much we may regret  the

loss of income to these establishments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 5 of the Ordinance so

that the prohibition of advertisements on articles

relating  to  abortion  is  extended  to  prohibit

advertisements  referring  to  medical  skill   or

service relating to abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, which amends section 6 of the

Ordinance,  is  consequential  on  the   preceding

sections.  It  tidies up the  references  made  to

various  prohibitions so that these are  correctly

referred to. As part of the tidying-up process,  a

new  subsection is added to provide for  reference

to  the new prohibition of advertisments referring

to  medical  skill or service within this  section

which sets Out provisions as to offences under the

preceding sections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 7 of the Ordinance so as

to  clarify that where the required disclosure  of

composition of a medicine is written in a language

other  than  the English language, such disclosure

must be made in the English language as well as in

any other language that may be used in addition to

the English language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 creates a Schedule of diseases and

conditions in respect of which advertisements  are

to  be controlled. This Schedule reviews the  list

of  the  various diseases and conditions mentioned

in section 4 of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance.  The  list is now extended  to  include

insanity,  menstrual disorders,  sexual  function,

infertility, impotency and frigidity. The study by

the Committee under Dr Gwee Ah Leng has indicated

that the diseases and conditions mentioned in  the

Schedule  constitute the happy  hunting-ground  of

those  unscrupulous advertisers who  seek  to  get

rich  quickly  by  preying  on  the  anxiety   and

desperation  of the unfortunate victims  of  these

diseases and conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are a number of parties likely to be

interested in the proposals contained in the Bill,

such    as   doctors,   physicians,   pharmacists,

dentists,   importers  of  drugs  and  advertising

agencies, it has been decided that the Bill should

be  referred to a Select Committee if  the  Second

Reading  is approved, so that wider 'consideration

might be given to the suggested amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as my predecessor in the Ministry of

Health has stressed, may I say that we owe a  duty

to  the  people of Singapore to protect them  from

the  unscrupulous exploitation of the  quacks  and

others  of  the  kind who make money  out  of  the

sufferings and despair of those who are not  in  a

position  to  judge wisely. These amendments  will

translate a universally accepted principle in  the

medical code of ethics into a provision of the law

of  the land. I am confident that hon. Members  of

this  House  will  give  their  support  for   the

enactment of this proposed legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Semi)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of this Bill in Parliament, we

will   be   able   to   control  effectively   the

advertising of certain medicines in newspapers and

other publications.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we go through the pages of

the   Malay   newspapers,   we   find   ridiculous

advertisements of medicines which claim to be able

to  turn  an old man into a young man and  an  old

lady  into a virgin. How is this possible? I  have

read  an  advertisement in a Malay  newspaper  not

long ago about a certain medicine which claims  to

be  able to increase the sexual potency of men. It

claimed  that if a male person took that medicine,

he would be like an elephant who had gone wild. If

this  claim is correctly made, I feel that such  a

medicine  is very dangerous. If every male  person

in  Singapore  were  to take this  medicine,  what

would happen to our female population? I have also

come  across an advertisement in a newspaper about

a  certain kind of medicine called Ma'jun which is

supposed to turn old ladies into virgins. If  this

claim  is  justified and all our female population

were  to take this medicine, what would happen  to

our  male population? However, these medicines are

not as effective as they are claimed to be. On the

contrary,  they affect the health of those  people

who  take  them.  I feel that the  newspapers  and

other     publications    which    print     these

advertisements do so purely with a  profit  motive

and  without  consideration  for  the  welfare  of

members of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I support this Bill.



<br><br>6.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for

some  time  now, certain so-called and self-styled

"medical   practitioners"   have   wantonly    and

unethically claimed to cure and treat all kinds of

illnesses - in particular female ailments, such as

overdue   menstruation  -  and  they  have   often

procured  illegal abortions as well. In the  past,

these  quacks and street pedlars used to stand  at

street   corners  announcing  their  presence   by

beating  gongs and playing music from their  vans.

They  then  orate to the people present about  the

miraculous qualities of the medicines they peddle.

By  such  means,  these rogues and vagabonds  were

able to sell whatever oil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



they were peddling as a miraculous cure for broken

bones.  To  my  surprise, I also found  they  were

selling plain 'Aspro' pills as pregnancy pills and

as cures for sterility and so on. However, by such

means,  they could reach only a limited number  of

people  who happened to be attracted by the  music

from  their  vans and gongs and who fell  prey  to

their  oratory. But now these pedlars  and  quacks

have  become  wiser. In order  to  reach  a  wider

section  of the public, they now use the Press  to

advertise  their  wonderful  medicines  and  their

nonsense.  These  malpractices,  therefore,   have

become  a  real  menace to  our  society.  It  is,

therefore, opportune that this Bill be  passed  to

control such malpractices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these pedlars and quacks have already

unscrupulously  exploited  and  cheated  a   large

section  of the general public. Not only  did  the

susceptible victims lose large sums of money, but,

in  fact,  their diseases were made worse  by  the

treatments and drugs. In some cases I believe  the

results were fatal. Such cases are the talk of the

town. In fact, too many of our good citizens  have

fallen   into   these   traps   because   of   the

advertisements claiming these miraculous cures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our innocent public need protection and it

is  our  responsibility and duty to see that  they

are  protected as fully as possible. The Medicines

(Advertisement  and  Sale)  (Amendment)  Bill   is

undoubtedly welcomed by all. On the other hand, it

is very much regretted that it was not passed long

ago.  It  should have been brought to  this  House

much  earlier.  Nevertheless, with this  amendment

Bill,   it   is   hoped  that   unscrupulous   and

unprincipled  drug  pedlars  will  be  dealt  with

accordingly, so that our innocent citizens will be

protected and no one will be deceived by unethical

medical advertisements and swindled by quacks  and

medical pedlars.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  in support of this Bill.  When  our

ancestors  came from different parts of the  world

to this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



small  island,  they  brought  with  them  various

methods of treating all kinds of ailments. We have

still   some   people  here  who  practise   these

traditional  methods. Of course,  there  are  some

methods which are effective. But with the progress

of  time  we  should replace them with the  latest

medical  methods  to  treat  the  sick  among  our

people. Some people who fall ill just buy any kind

of  medicine  for treatment without going  to  the

hospital    for   proper   care.   When    people,

particularly those who have to work all  day  long

fall ill, they hope to be cured in the fastest and

quickest  way. They therefore resort to ready-made

medicines  and fall victim to medical  quacks  and

pedlars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when we turn the pages of the local

Chinese newspapers, we can see advertisements  for

medicine on every page. I have three copies of the

latest   editions.  All  these   are   large-sized

advertisements and we can see all sorts of  things

in them.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member please identify the

three papers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Nanyang

Siang  Pau,  2nd of May, 1968. In this edition  we

can   see  advertisements  publicising  "cure-all"

medicines for various diseases. For instance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If you want to think of bearing children, come

to  us.  We are specialists in promoting fertility

and  infertility. If there is no  efficacy,  money

will be refunded in full.'



<br><br>And  so  on.  Sir,  the  advertisements  are  very

attractively  worded. Some quacks have  their  own

ready-made medicines for sale and distribution  in

the  market. Some of these are advertised  in  the

newspapers  as having been patented and registered

with  the Government. As a result, ignorant people

are  misled into believing that the Government has

approved  and  recognised the  medical  skills  of

these  quacks. Hence, these quacks have their  way

with  the  public.  Consequently,  the  Government

earns a disreputable name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we continue to allow these unscrupulous and

good-for-nothing quacks to have their way with the

public, maybe one day, Mr Speaker, we will see in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



the     newspapers    more    shocking     medical

advertisements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before us will, therefore, exercise some

sort  of  control over these pedlars of  medicines

and  quacks. Of course, this Bill will not  affect

all  those  who  are professionally  qualified  in

medicine.  At  present, the best  way  to  control

these  quacks  is to deny them the opportunity  to

advertise  their  products in the  newspapers  and

thus mislead the poor people. We must educate  the

people to the efficacy of modern medicine. At  the

same time, however, we must exercise some sort  of

control  over medical advertisments which  mislead

the public. That is why I support this Bill. It is

by  legislation that we can control these  medical

advertisments.  This is only one  way  of  dealing

with  the quacks. There are other ways to  control

and  regulate  their activities.  I  do  not  know

whether  the  Minister  for Health  will  consider

setting  some  sort  of  official  examination  to

legalise some of the Chinese qualified Sinsehs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as the only medical Member in this House, although

seemingly  incognito,  and  as  a  member   of   a

profession  that  requires  no  advertisments,   I

cannot resist the temptation to say a few words on

this  amendment Bill. The original  Ordinance  has

been  in existence for some years, but somehow  it

has  proved  to  be inadequate. It  has  too  many

loopholes, and all sorts of savoury and Un savoury

advertisments    on   medicines   and    so-called

professional  skills are able to  find  their  way

into   the  newspapers,  to  the  profit  of   the

advertisers.  Such  fanfare  is  not   worthy   of

detailed mention in this House or even to fall  on

the ears of hon. Members. Suffice it for me to say

that  the advertisers are either gods or fakes  in

what  they so blantantly claim to be able  to  do.

Illnesses  of any description, fatal or otherwise,

are  practically guaranteed to be cured. Appetite,

digestive   or  reproductive,  can  be   improved,

increased



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



and  strengthened.  I presume, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

looking  at  such advertisements in  some  of  the

daily  papers,  one must have the impression  that

the advertisers are either leading the readers  up

the garden path or they are trying to promise them

elixirs of life. Most of our citizens must  surely

have    developed   a   sufficient    degree    of

sophistication to ignore or laugh at such  medical

claims.  Unfortunately,  quite  a  number  of  our

citizens  happen to be gullible enough to  swallow

these  advertisements, hook, line and sinker,  and

put  their hard-earned wages and even their  lives

into the hands of these smart manipulators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore time for the Ministry of Health

to plug up any loophole in the existing Ordinance.

The  amendment Bill seems to me to be  doing  just

this. I therefore support it.
