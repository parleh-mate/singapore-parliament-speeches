<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, at yesterday's sitting I spoke for

almost  half an hour and, therefore,  I  have  not

much left to say today. I would, however, like  to

touch on what the Member for Sembawang has said in

this  House.  He has criticised the administrative

procedures  of the Immigration Department,  saying

that  they  cause  delay. If my memory  serves  me

right, I recall that the Member for Choa Chu  Kang

-  he  is now the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for Finance - raised a question relating

to  immigration  when the House was  debating  the 1968  Budget.  Now  the Member  for  Sembawang  is

raising  the same issue. So I will fry  some  cold

rice for him to enjoy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this matter, the Immigration Department has

already taken measures to improve the services for

tourists  so  as  to facilitate their  entry  into

Singapore. Tourists, therefore, need not  have  to

go  through cumbersome procedures before they  can

visit  Singapore for a few days, because they  can

obtain visas quite easily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourists from Indonesia stopping over in

Singapore  will have things made easier for  them.

On  arrival at our airport, passengers with  valid

passports are issued with visas for two months  so

that   they   may  enjoy  their  trip  here.   The

Immigration Department is doing all this  to  make

things  easy  for the tourists. This will  promote

tourism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for tourists coming by ship, we have also

facilities  to  enable  them  to  come  here  more

easily. Some people who stay in Sembawang and  who

find  it  too far to go to the Immigration  Office

might have asked the Member for Sembawang to raise

this matter in Parliament.



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the start

of my speech. I would like to invite the attention

of  all  hon.  Members  to  a  Government  Gazette

Subsidiary Legislation Supplement published on the

10th of May and numbered 35 of 1968. At pages  285

to 296 thereof are set out the responsibilities of

the Prime Minister and other Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only change in the Ministry of National

Development is in respect of the Registry  of  Co-operative Societies which has been transferred  to

the  Ministry of Social Affairs. Money Lenders and

Pawnbrokers  have  also been  transferred  to  the

Ministry  of Social Affairs. They were  previously

with the Ministry of Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies and the Registry of Business Names have

also left Law for the Ministry of Finance. But the

major  change, as far as the Ministry  of  Law  is

concerned,  is the transfer of the Port  Authority

to  the Ministry of Communications, as it is  felt

that  the Port and the Department of Marine should

appropriately  come under the same  Ministry.  The

problems of the reorganisation of the Dockyard and

the containerisation complex at the Eastern Lagoon

are  now  put  on  the  lap of  the  Minister  for

Communications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board, which was formerly

under  the  Ministry of the Deputy Prime Minister,

is  now back in the Ministry of Law, and questions

in  this  House  with regard  to  gas,  water  and

electricity should now be directed to me. However,

I  am  happy  to  be able to report that  frequent

blackouts are a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



thing  of  the past in Singapore and  that  it  is

unlikely that we will have water rationing in  the

near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is significant that the

consumption of water in Singapore has now exceeded

the 100-million gallon mark. We are consuming over

100  million gallons of water a day. But  we  have

new  schemes  and  we  have  had  new  schemes  to

increase   the  water  supply.  Members   may   be

interested  to know that when water rationing  had

to be imposed in the year 1963, Singapore only con

sumed  about 65 million gallons a day.  Today  the

consumption has increased by more than 35  million

gallons per day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose to speak both on the Ministry of

Law  and  National  Development.  As  far  as  the

Ministry of Law is concerned, I shall start  first

with  the laws of Singapore and give the  House  a

short  resume  of  events as they  might  help  in

setting out the present position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1963, Singapore had its own

Constitution,  and  laws  made  up  of  Ordinances

passed  by  the  Legislature, such  parts  of  the

English  Common  Law and certain English  Statutes

that  were made applicable to Singapore before  we

joined  the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. Whilst

we  were part of the Federation, on account of the

distribution of legislative subjects  between  the

Central   and  the  State  Legislatures,   certain

existing laws that came within the purview of  the

Central  Government were repealed and at the  same

time   laws   were  extended  in   the   name   of

"uniformity"  to  Singapore  even  in  regard   to

matters   where  the  ipsissima   verba   of   the

legislation was in no way different, as  evidenced

in  the Trustees Ordinance, or where the substance

was identical, as in the Internal Security Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a spate of subsidiary legislation made

by   the   Central  Government  and  extended   to

Singapore,  some  of which were again  substituted

for  those  which were already in  existence.  The

Attorney-General's Chambers (or the State Advocate-General's  Chambers as it then was) had been  hard

put to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



keeping  abreast with the changes of  these  laws,

especially  in certain instances where  copies  of

the  Federal Ordinances that had been extended  to

Singapore   in   place   of   existing   Singapore

legislation  had not been made available  even  to

departments of state that were concerned with  the

administration of these Ordinances. Such  was  the

state of the laws that when banishment proceedings

were   taken   under  the  Federation   Banishment

Ordinance  which, except for one or two procedural

requirements,  were  exactly  the  same   as   the

Singapore  Ordinance,  the first  of  these  cases

actually resulted in the banishee succeeding on  a

writ  of  habeas  corpus. The police,  not  having

copies  of the Federation Ordinance, had proceeded

under  the  repealed provisions of  the  Singapore

Ordinance  and, in doing so, had failed to  comply

with  certain  peremptory procedural  requirements

that were in the Federation Ordinance but were not

in the State legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as if to add to the confusion, on the 9th

August,  1965,  came the separation  of  Singapore

from the rest of Malaysia. Although the Separation

Agreement  had  provided for the  continuation  of

laws  then existing until such time when they were

changed  by  Parliament in  Singapore,  this  only

added  to  the difficulties which both  the  legal

profession   and   those   concerned   with    the

administration   of  justice  in  Singapore   were

already faced with. The work of unscrambling  laws

that had been extended to Singapore by the Central

Government then began.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had then in 1965, as we do have now, such

portions  of  the  Federal  laws  that  had   been

extended  to Singapore existing side by side  with

Singapore statutes that had been left undisturbed.

In  some cases, the extension of these laws by the

Central  Government in relation to  Singapore  had

reversed the Singapore Government's policies,  as,

for  example,  the  Public Authorities  Protection

Ordinance  of the Federation of Malaya.  Singapore

had,  before it joined Malaysia, removed from  its

statute books a similar Ordinance giving



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



the public authorities the privileged position  of

being protected from civil litigation for acts  of

negligence if these suits were not brought  within

the  period  of  one year of the cause  of  action

arising.  Accordingly, when  we  separated  as  an

independent  Republic from the rest  of  Malaysia,

this Ordinance had likewise to be removed in order

that  we  could  return  to  the  status  quo.  In

December   1965,   the   Republic   of   Singapore

Independence  Act  was  passed  with   retroactive

operation   to  the  9th  August  of  that   year.

Singapore then became a Republic with effect  from

the  9th  day of August, 1965. But we had perforce

to  continue  with the Singapore Constitution  set

out  in  the  Order  in  Council  dated  the  16th

September, 1963, a Constitution drafted and  meant

for the State of Singapore as a component part  of

the larger Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution as it then was had obvious

lacunae. Accordingly, all these provisions dealing

with   such   subjects  as  had  been  exclusively

assigned to the Federal Legislature that had to be

adopted    with   such   amendments   that    were

incompatible  with  Singapore  as  an  independent

Republic  had to be so amended as to  accord  with

the  constitutional changes that had come to pass.

The  Independence  Act of 1965,  as  hon.  Members

know,   accordingly  adopted  as   part   of   our

Constitution    the   whole   of    the    Federal

Constitution,  save  in regard  to  those  matters

which  had been provided for in the original State

Constitution.   Consequent   upon   our   becoming

independent,  no less than 25 Acts  of  Parliament

were  passed during the remaining months of  1965.

In  1966,  a total of 57 Acts were passed  and  in

1967  another 43 Acts were passed. Many  of  these

Acts  were far-reaching in their effects upon  the

life and economy of the nation. Little wonder that

members  of the legal profession themselves  found

it  hard to keep abreast with these changes,  some

of  which were necessitated by the very change  in

our  constitutional progress towards independence.

In   order  to  make  this  task  easier  for  the

profession   and  for  those  charged   with   the

responsibility of administering the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



law,  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers  reprinted

some  of  the more important Ordinances which  had

been  subject to such amendment. No less than some

30  of our laws have been thus brought up to date,

including the State Constitution itself. At  about

the  same  time,  a  Law Revision  Commission  was

appointed, charged with the task of rewriting  the

laws and bringing them up to date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, the last time die laws of

Singapore were subject to such a revision was some

15 years ago; the task then took no less than five

years to complete. Special mention may perhaps  be

made  to  the Legal Profession Act which now  sets

out  the basis of legal education and of admission

to  the Bar in Singapore. The disciplinary control

of  members of the profession had been left almost

entirely   to   the  Society  of   Advocates   and

Solicitors.  Even  this Act has  been  subject  to

amendments and will be in the course of this  year

subject  to  further amendments at the request  of

members of the Bar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught up with the more momentous changes which

had  to  be  brought about and which  had  claimed

priority over other changes, our courts have  been

left  to carry on within the legal framework  that

had  been  laid  down when we  were  part  of  the

Federation  of Malaysia - hence the  existence  of

procedures   and  terms  that  now  would   appear

somewhat  anachronistic.  The  existence  of   the

Federal  Court  in Singapore is a  clear  example.

Though in practice the Federal Court, which is the

Court of Appeal in Singapore, is presided over  by

the  Chief  Justice with two other Judges  of  the

High Court in Singapore, and the practice since we

seceded  from the Federation of Malaysia has  been

that  only  Singapore Judges sit  in  the  Federal

Court  in  Singapore, the strict legal basis  from

which  the Court draws its jurisdiction and powers

is  still  the  Federal Courts of Judicature  Act.

Steps,  however,  are now being taken  to  correct

this anomalous situation in the law. Right at this

moment,  a  change in the system of the courts  is

being   thought  out  and  legislation  is   being

prepared.

Members  will be interested to know  that  a  Bill

will soon be introduced to provide for a Court  of

Appeal  in  place  of the Federal  Court  so  that

strict law may accord with practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members may or should remember that towards

the  end  of 1966 the Report of the Constitutional

Commission   headed  by  the  Chief  Justice   was

presented to this House. I then told the House  in

a  Ministerial  statement that the Government  had

accepted  the  Report in principle  and  would  be

introducing a draft Constitution embodying most of

the  recommendations  of the Commission,  save  in

regard  to one or two matters such as the creation

of  the Ombudsman, the idea behind the creation of

which  would be fully subscribed to but which  we,

however,   regard  as  somewhat  premature.   This

important  epoch-making charter will be introduced

in the course of the next few months and certainly

at  the  very latest by the end of this  year.  In

order  that the views of as wide a section of  the

people  of Singapore as possible may be canvassed,

the  Draft  Constitution will be  sent  to  Select

Committee.  In the making of our Constitution,  it

is  indeed the desire of the Government to  ensure

that the people of Singapore should be given every

opportunity to air their views so that it  may  be

said  that  the people have given unto  themselves

these  guiding  principles of social  justice  and

equality amongst men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now propose to deal with

other  departments of the Ministry of  Law  -  the

Land  Office and the Registry of Deeds.  The  Land

Acquisition   Act  was  passed  by  the   previous

Parliament on the 26th of October, 1966, and  came

into operation on the 17th of June last year.  The

major innovation in the Act is that an appeal by a

person  aggrieved by an award of the Collector  of

Land Revenue, which previously used to lie to  the

High   Court,  now  lies  to  the  Appeals   Board

consisting  of  a Commissioner of  Appeals,  or  a

Deputy  Commissioner  of Appeals,  either  sitting

alone or with two assessors,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



depending  on  the quantum of the  award  appealed

against.  Before this Act came into  operation,  a

total of 261 appeals or objections had been lodged

and  were  awaiting disposal. This number  covered

objections going back to acquisitions carried  out

in  1953  and  to accumulations from 1964  arising

from  the  suspension  imposed  on  the  Collector

precluding him from referring appeals to the  High

Court under the provisions of the Land Acquisition

(Amendment) Ordinance. 1964, which came into force

on  the  11th  June, 1964. After the  coming  into

operation of the Land Acquisition Act, a total  of

97 old appeals were brought forward for disposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Board was formally constituted and

two  Judges  of  the  High  Court  were  appointed

Commissioners of Appeals on 17th June,  1967,  and

on  the  same  date,  12  persons  were  appointed

members  of  the panel as provided for under  Part

III  of  the  Act.  Since its  constitution,  five

appeal  cases  were  dealt with  by  it.  Of  this

number,  the  Board in four cases awarded  against

the  Collector, requiring the payment of a sum  of

about   half   a  million  dollars   by   way   of

supplementary  awards. The Board  awarded  against

the  appellant  in  one  case.  Three  cases  were

withdrawn and six were settled out of Court  since

the  coming  into force of the new  Act.  Some  22

cases are likely to be settled out of Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a tremendous amount of research and work is

involved  in the proper preparation of  an  appeal

case for presentation to the Appeals Board. Delays

may  occur  when, in the midst of such preparatory

work, appellants make overtures for settlement out

of  Court, or the Collector, on completion  of  an

appeal case, considers that the difference  is  so

marginal  that the appellant may wish to  consider

settlement out of Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to introduce certain amendments to

the  Act  with  a  view to incorporating  into  it

certain   provisions  of  the  former  legislation

relating to the recovery of costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Commissioners of the Appeals Board has

since retired and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



consideration is being given to the possibility of

appointing  a  permanent  Commissioner  with   the

requisite status of a High Court Judge. This will,

of  course,  be dependent on a number of  factors,

not  least  of all the availability of a  suitable

person with the requisite qualification and  know-how.  It is desirable also to consider steps which

will  alleviate the position caused by the  recent

and the pending retirement of High Court Judges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Land Titles Strata Act of

1967  was  first introduced in its  Bill  form  in

1966.  The  Act  mainly deals with  the  issue  of

certificates  of titles to flats,  the  management

and  maintenance of such flats and common services

relating  thereto by a Management  Corporation  of

which  all the flat owners are members.  This  Act

was  passed  in  1967 and brought  into  operation

today. It requires every housing developer of  any

new  development  of flats to lodge  in  a  strata

title plan showing the location of the sub-divided

building comprising the flats sold or to  be  sold

to  the  members  of  the  public,  and  also  the

approximate dimensions of each flat and the common

property,  including the staircases  and  passages

and  any  ground or floor space. The  share  units

which  each owner of the flat is entitled to  must

be also shown on such plan. Each owner of the flat

will  under the Act be entitled to a share in  the

land  on which the sub-divided building comprising

the  flats  is erected proportionate to his  share

unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no provision under the common law

for  the vesting of titles in the land should  the

sub-divided building become seriously  damaged  or

demolished.  There  are  provisions  in  the   Act

governing    damaged   or   destroyed   subdivided

buildings.  Owners of all flats dealt  under  this

Act    should,   therefore,   benefit   from   its

provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easements which would necessarily be created for

flats  and the transfer or lease of flats such  as

easements of support or shelter and protection and

easement for passage of water, drainage and  other

services are spelt out in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



Act. This will leave no doubt in the minds of  the

owners of flats of their rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of the Act, the purchaser

may  be granted a freehold title to a flat and not

only  a  leasehold title as under the common  law.

Proposed  mortgages would also be in a far  better

position with special provisions being set out  in

cases  where sub-divided buildings are damaged  or

destroyed. It is hoped that longer-term loans will

be  available  to intending purchasers  of  flats.

Thus    indirectly   flat   ownership   is   being

encouraged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now turn to the Ministry

of National Development which is, as Members know,

mainly  concerned with housing. Sir,  the  Housing

and Development Board has had considerable success

in  implementing the public housing policy of  the

Government.  Yet far from resting on its  laurels,

the  Board has been looking into various ways  and

means  of  improving  the  amenities  in  existing

housing   estates  and  the  layout,  design   and

construction  of  new  housing  estates.  For  one

thing,  with  the  success of the  home  ownership

scheme,  the demand is for better types of housing

though  still at low cost to be designed for  sale

to  those  of  our citizens wishing to  own  their

homes.  In line with Government's policy  to  make

Singapore  the cleanest and the greenest  city  in

Southeast  Asia, there is every need for increased

efforts  to  beautify the many housing estates  by

tasteful  landscaping and the better  planting  of

trees,  shrubs and flowers in the open areas.  The

experience  gained in designing and  planning  the

earlier  housing  estates will contribute  towards

the improvement of layouts of new housing estates,

and  our  architects and planners will  take  into

consideration  the fact that notwithstanding  low-cost housing our tenants will eventually be owning

more and more cars. Thus traffic circulation is of

importance and generous provisions may have to  be

made  in  the  new towns for community activities,

children's   playgrounds  and  other  recreational

amenities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board does not think

in  terms of its immediate programme which is well

in  hand.  In addition to providing the  planning,

supervision, construction and management  and  the

maintenance  of existing and new housing  estates,

it  must do the spade work and investigations  for

the  next  two  5-year periods. For instance,  the

Board   is   now   planning  the   lay-out,   land

acquisition  and  clearance for  the  new  housing

estates  to be built in Telok Blangah in  1970  to

1975 and also looking into the development of  new

towns  likely  to be constructed after  1975.  All

this   planning  and  investigation  will  be   in

addition  to  its  present  work  in  constructing

public  housing in Jurong. Toa Payoh,  Queenstown,

Tiong   Bahru,  Alexandra,  Kallang   Basin,   St.

Michael's  Estate, MacPherson and other areas.  In

planning and executing projects of this magnitude,

it is necessary for me to remind hon. Members that

in  the  process  of  land  acquisition,  squatter

clearance,  resettlement, earth-works, road  works

and   other   civil  construction  work,   certain

inconvenience and disturbance must be caused to  a

certain number of people. But bearing in mind that

hundreds  and  thousands of people are  likely  to

benefit  from  these operations, it is  perhaps  a

very low price to pay, but even so the Housing and

Development Board has been instructed to  exercise

every   care   and  consideration  and,   wherever

possible, to cause the minimum of inconvenience to

our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East Coast reclamation project is one case in

point.  Members  may  recall that  the  Government

could have decided with some savings to adopt  the

conventional  method of earth moving  which  would

result  in  hundreds of lorries shuttling  up  and

down  carrying full loads of earth some  of  which

would  spill  over on to our roads,  at  the  same

time,  stirring  up  considerable  dust  nuisance,

causing traffic congestion and frustration, not to

mention  creating a noise nuisance to disturb  the

population for many years. Instead, the Government

decided on the most sophisticated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



method  of  earth moving, involving  huge  bucket-wheel  excavators  and  more  than  six  miles  of

conveyor belts to excavate and transport the earth

noiselessly,  with  little dust nuisance,  traffic

congestion  or  other inconvenience being  caused.

Yet,  in  spite of all these efforts, because  the

programmes  have to be completed  according  to  a

rigid  time schedule and the work has to go  on  a

three-shift basis, there have been some complaints

by residents around the Bedok area that the bucket-wheel  excavators were disturbing them from  their

sleep, even though such excavators made less noise

than ordinary bulldozers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the design of public housing, the Housing and

Development  Board  has  been  investigating   and

experimenting with new forms of tower blocks which

would  provide a new appearance and better privacy

for  the  tenants.  If costs permit,  these  tower

blocks  will  have the ground floor free  for  the

recreation  of  tenants and  their  children.  The

first of these new blocks of housing accommodation

will  be  constructed in the next few  months  and

will be ready for occupation or sale in 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now come to urban renewal. On

this subject, the Government has already completed

the  first  blocks  of  urban  renewal  flats   in

Crawford  N.  1 and Outram Road S.  1  areas.  The

construction of urban renewal projects will go  on

with  greater vigour. New projects will be carried

out  within  the  centre of the  city  which  will

indicate  to  the  private  sector  the  line   of

thinking  that has been adopted by the  Government

in its urban renewal policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new projects will involve a departure from

the  traditional  way of building  row  houses  or

shophouses  with  16  to  20  feet  frontage.  The

thinking is to concentrate on heavy investment  on

properly planned and comprehensive development for

the   construction  of  shopping  complexes   with

literally  hundreds  of arcaded  shops  under  one

roof,  with pedestrian malls for easier  shopping,

and  with  easy parking facilities at basement  or

ground  level. This will improve the amenities  in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



city  centre,   provide   much   more   pleasant

surroundings     for     pedestrians,      greater

manoeuvrability for traffic, and increase  parking

facilities  for  motorists. The  Government  would

very  much  like  to  see this  type  of  thinking

permeating  into  the  private  sector  so   that,

instead of thinking in terms of redeveloping  just

two  or three shophouses, private investors  would

join  forces  and  go  into much  bigger  shopping

complexes within the city. These are the  portents

for  the future and it is hoped that with the  co-operation   of   the  private  sector,   we   will

eventually be able, not only to change the skyline

of  Singapore,  but  also  to  improve  pedestrian

shopping amenities and, in the process, change the

older  areas of the city by replacing the existing

two- and three-row houses and shophouses with high

rise  prestige  buildings  incorporating  all  the

facilities  expected for the  central  area  of  a

modern city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may go back to the East

Coast  reclamation, Members may be  interested  to

know that the work of reclaiming land from the sea

from Bedok to the Singapore Swimming Club will  be

completed in the middle of next year. The progress

has been very satisfactory and the work is well in

advance  of  schedule. The amount of earth  washed

away  by the sea has also been less than expected.

The  second stage will be the reclamation from the

Singapore  Swimming Club right up to  the  end  of

Tanjong Rhu. This will mean the transportation  by

conveyor-belt of some three million cubic yards of

earth.  This additional work is expected  to  take

five  or  six months, so that by the end of  1969,

the  whole stretch of the shore from Bedok to  the

end of Tanjong Rhu will be reclaimed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much investigation work has also been done with

regard  to the next phase of the reclamation  work

which  involves the filling up of  the  sea  along

Nicoll  Highway and the Esplanade. Some 200  acres

of  land can be reclaimed from this portion of the

sea  using earth from the Telok Blangah and Siglap

areas.  The difficulty here is that the  conveyor-belt system cannot be used because the route



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



cuts   into   the  road  network  of  the   city.

Conventional methods may have to be adopted, which

means   the   process  will  be  slow   and   much

inconvenience  will  result.  The  engineers   and

technical  staff of the Housing Board are  looking

into   various  alternatives  to  carry  out  this

project  which  will cost about $20  million.  One

solution  that has been suggested is to work  only

at nights when the roads will not be so heavy with

traffic.  Another alternative is to use boats  and

barges,  but  this will result in double  handling

and higher costs. Whatever the difficulties, it is

necessary to implement this project, if more  land

is  to  be  reclaimed  and  the  proposed  coastal

highway is to be completed as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the participation of the private

sector in our urban renewal efforts, I am happy to

say  that the sites along the "Golden Mile", which

met  with little response when the first 14  sites

were made available by public tender in the middle

of  1967, have now aroused the interest of various

developers  and  hoteliers.  In  line  with   this

policy,   my   Ministry  has  drawn   up   special

procedures  to expedite the granting  of  planning

approval  and  to  waive  development  charges  in

respect of good class tourist hotels. Briefly, the

new  procedure  involves the  elimination  of  the

cumbersome  and unwieldy process of rezoning.  For

the next three years whilst this new procedure  is

in  operation, special consideration will be given

to  applications for the development of good class

tourist hotels. No development charge for rezoning

or  change  of use will be levied in any  approved

hotel project. But in order to ensure that genuine

development  commences at an  early  date  and  to

discourage  the  speculative type of  development,

the  Government  will require  the  payment  of  a

refundable  deposit  in  respect  of  every  hotel

application.  The progress of every hotel  project

will  be reviewed every six months so that if  the

construction  work  is  in  compliance  with   the

conditions  in  the  planning approval,  then  the

deposit will be completely refunded at the end  of

12 months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry hopes that the private sector will take

full advantage of this new procedure during the next three

years in order to enable the present hotel shortage to be

overcome. Hon. Members will be interested to know that as at

30th, April, 1968, there were 23 tourist class hotels with

1,694 rooms in Singapore. Planning approval has been granted

for the development of 28 other hotel projects involving

either new construction, alterations or amendments to

existing buildings. All these approvals, if implemented,

will result in a further 6,000 rooms or more, but some of

them are clearly speculative in nature and the developers

perhaps have no intention whatsoever of  implementing the

projects. But with the new procedures that have been

introduced, speculation will be drastically reduced and in

the next few years or so, it is hoped that Singapore will be

able to meet the demands of all tourists for better class

hotels. Of the 28 projects approved, only four new hotels

(the Mandarin, the Hilton and Ming Court in Orchard Road and

the Lion City Hotel in Tanjong Katong) are under

construction and on their completion will add a further

1,431 rooms to meet tourist demands. Another seven extension

or conversion projects are also being actively pursued which

on completion will produce another 1,500 rooms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now go on to the Public Works

Department. Over the last few years, there has been

considerable activity in the construction of public roads,

drainage and sewerage extensions. All these are necessary to

keep pace with other construction and development. Not only

will existing roads be widen and road junctions or

intersections grade separated, multi-level traffic

interchanges and flyovers be provided, but there will also

be new highways to be constructed to ensure a smoother flow

of traffic. Sewage works will be carried out to provide

modern sanitation to many suburban areas. Flood alleviation

schemes will be implemented to relieve some of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



worst areas of the island from being flooded every time a

heavy shower coincides with a high tide. Here again hon.

Members will appreciate that in all these public works which

entail land acquisition, resettlement, squatter clearance,

the digging up of roads and considerable amount of earth-

works, much inconvenience to the public and disruption of

traffic must be caused. It is expected that many people will

express their grievances. There will be many complaints and

so will may of those affected by resettlement grumble about

the inadequacy of our compensation schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are but the normal difficulties any public

authority will have to face in a period of very rapid

construction and development. It will be too much to expect

that no person will be dissatisfied when hundreds of

families are required to move away from places where they

have been living for many many years. But one only has to

look into the records of the Resettlement Department to see

how many families have been resettled satisfactorily. In the

majority to resettlement cases, there has been best

improvement in their standards of accommodation, whilst many

have found new jobs and benefited from the changed

surroundings. These are sufficient evidence and indications

for us to conclude that the minor inconvenience that is

caused, far from being something that should cause us

concern, would rather in the long term be recognised as the

change that brought about the improvement in the livelihood

of the families who have previously been used to living in

the slums.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I will deal with

comprehensive city planning. Notwithstanding all the

housing, reclamation, urban renewal and public work projects

that I have mentioned, the Government must think further

ahead in terms of the more efficient use of our very limited

land resources, of  the greater efficiency of our public

roads network, and of the more economical utilisation of our

scarce financial resources. To achieve all these, a better



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



and more flexible comprehensive planning concept must be

devised which can result in the creation of a city with all

the amenities one would expect of a highly civilised centre

with more efficient control of private development to

provide the necessary improvements and extensions to cater

for a population of three to four million before the end of

the century. I say three to four million advisedly, because

even now the population projection provided in the early

1960s when the rate of increase was above four per cent is

being lowered to near 2.3 per cent. Hence, instead of having

a population of four million in 1990, we may probably only

reach 3¼ million. This is indeed heartening because more

time will be available for us to plan for a better city to

cater for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State and City Planning Committee, which has been

set up with the assistance of the United Nations Special

Fund will be looking into this long-term problem of city

planning and will probably come up with some solutions for

better land use and development control and for more

realistic planning concepts for the development of the

future of our city. It is also entrusted with the

responsibility of doing studies, surveys and projections

which will provide for comprehensive development of our

traffic and communications network to ensure that we will be

able to  keep abreast of our traffic problems. As the city

has been built up over the last 150 years and some areas

would not be so easily amenable to drastic change, the need

for some form of mass transportation to enable a large

number of  workers to get to town as quickly and

economically as possible cannot be over-looked. This will

mean expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars on a

system of either surface railways, mono-rails or underground

railways or some form of rapid transportation to shuttle

large numbers of people from the places of their residence

to their places of work. Sir, all these are problems that we

will have to face and study in greater detail in the years

to come.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, my Minister has

asked me to speak on the services rendered by my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of question on Primary Production services

have been raised, particularly by Members of Parliament from

rural constituencies. I am happy that they are concerned

with the work of the Primary Production Department as the

department is responsible for agriculture and fisheries

development and provides services to farmers and fishermen

in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol, in referring to that part of

the President's Speech concerning the continued provision of

services and advice to farmers in order to increase

production and to reduce cost, stated that he would like to

know how this was to be done. But he immediately followed

this question by enumerating a number of measures which, in

effect, answered his own question!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some criticism have also been made by Members against

the Primary Production Department. While there is still much

work to be done, there is always room for improvement. The

record of work since the inception of the department in 1960

and the services it provides to the farming communities as

well as the role it plays in helping the farmers to solve

their problems are familiar to many people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng temporarily in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention to indulge in enumerating the

achievements of the department, but it is well known to the

farming communities, and I have no doubt also to Members of

Parliament from rural constituencies, that the Primary

Production Department has established in recent years 11

agricultural stations and centres in the rural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



areas   to   provide  services  such  as   poultry

inoculation,  treatment  of  livestock,  ploughing

service,  sale  of veterinary drugs,  insecticides

and  fertilisers, stud-boar service and artificial

insemination  of  pigs, distribution  of  improved

breeds  of  piglings and chicks to farmers,  plant

protection  service,  training  of  farm   youths,

conducting talks with groups of farmers  in  their

villages,   publication  of  a   monthly   Primary

Production Bulletin and booklets and pamphlets  to

disseminate information, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the change of circumstances since Singapore

became   independent,  our  aim  is   to   further

intensify  and diversify agricultural  development

within  the  limited land areas which are  at  our

disposal  as well as to develop rapidly  off-shore

and  deep-sea  fishing.  The  development  of  the

agriculture and fisheries sectors is necessary  to

generate employment for the large numbers of young

people coming into the employment market each year

to supplement the Government's effort in providing

jobs  through industrialisation. Such  development

is  also necessary for the economic well-being  of

Singapore. Our effort in agriculture and fisheries

development will be in four directions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we shall provide training for our youths

in  intensive  agriculture,  horticulture,  animal

husbandry  and  fisheries to equip them  with  the

skill in these fields of economic activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we shall introduce new methods and

scientific techniques in intensive agriculture and

fisheries,    including   the    development    of

agricultural and fisheries processing  industries.

We  will  also carry out research in these fields.

With advanced and modern techniques of production,

our  farmers  and  fishermen should  produce  more

efficiently and turn out agricultural produce of a

high  quality.  This  will enable  us  to  compete

effectively in markets outside Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we shall induce capital investment into

the  agriculture  and fisheries  sectors  so  that

agriculture and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



fisheries    in   Singapore   can   be   gradually

transformed  from  their  present-day  subsistence

form  of  farming  and fishing, into  economically

viable and profitable enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we shall develop and cultivate oversea

markets   for   our  agricultural  and   fisheries

products to increase our export earnings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these aims, a number of projects have

already  been  implemented and  others  are  being

planned.  Among the projects recently implemented,

a   $9  million  Pig  and  Poultry  Research  and.

Training   Institute  in  Sembawang  with   United

Nations  assistance  is being  established  and  a

Fishing  Training School costing $8 million,  also

with United Nations assistance, is being built. We

have  constructed a Veterinary Laboratory  costing

$250,000  to improve animal health and to  produce

vaccines  for preventive inoculation in  order  to

minimise  losses from livestock diseases.  We  are

implementing an intensive farm improvement  scheme

to  encourage orchid production for export and  to

investigate   into   the   production   of   other

horticultural   products.  A  Regional   Fisheries

Research  Department  under  the  Southeast  Asian

Fisheries  Development Centre to  explore  fishing

grounds  in  this  region and a  Fishing  Port  at

Jurong  to stimulate fisheries development are  in

the  process of being established. We will improve

the Van Kleef Aquarium and will carry out training

and  research  in aquarium fish  so  that  we  can

encourage  increased production  of  tropical  and

aquarium fish for export to oversea countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking into financial loan schemes for

agriculture  and fisheries projects and  examining

various  incentives  to attract  participation  of

private  capital  in these fields.  We  have  been

trying  to  bring the producers and  exporters  of

agricultural  produce together so that  supply  to

oversea markets can be maintained, quality can  be

guaranteed and prices can be competitive. We  have

constructed   a   modern   Abattoir   and   Animal

Quarantine Station at Jurong so that livestock is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



not   only   sold   on-the-hoof  to   neighbouring

countries,  but  can also be exported  to  markets

further afield after canning or processing. We are

making a feasibility study of the different  forms

of  factory  farming and the adoption  of  flatted

farms for livestock production in order to achieve

the maximum economy of land use in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New measures and new methods always involve

changes, and changes are not universally liked  by

people,  particularly those with vested  interest.

We  have encountered considerable resistance  from

fish  merchants  against the Jurong  Fish  Market.

After  more  than a year of effort in  persuasion,

explanation  and  discussion, the  fish  merchants

have   now  finally  agreed  to  move  to  Jurong.

Similarly,   there   is  considerable   resistance

against  the  new abattoir. There  are  three  old

abattoirs  in  Singapore; the sheep  abattoir  and

cattle  abattoir in Jalan Besar and a pig abattoir

in  French Road. In these abattoirs there has been

a  great  deal of malpractice and corruption.  The

hygienic  standards  as well as  the  slaughtering

method  are  not  acceptable  to  many  countries.

Consequently,  our canned meat and processed  meat

cannot   be   exported.  The  new   abattoir   was

constructed  with the objectives of improving  the

slaughtering  facilities,  raising  the   hygienic

standards    and   eliminating   corruption    and

malpractices  so  that  Singapore  meat   can   be

exported   to   other  countries.  However,   many

butchers do not like it. Voices have been  raised,

complaints  have been made and rumours  have  been

spread about the new abattoir. Unfortunately, some

misinformed  persons,  including  the  Member  for

Jurong,   take   up  their  cause  without   first

examining  the  issues involved.  The  Member  for

Jurong  complained that the new abattoir  was  not

suitable  for  Singapore  and  that  the  rate  of

slaughter  is  much slower than that  of  the  old

abattoir.  I  wonder  if he has  visited  the  new

abattoir  and the old one to see for  himself  the

different  working conditions! He is well  advised

to  pay  a  visit to these places if  he  has  not

already done so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, the design and construction

of  the new abattoir, which cost $5.8 million, are

based on modern technology and up-to-date concept.

The  same  type  of abattoir has been  in  use  in

Europe,  the  U.S.A.,  Russia,  Japan  and  China.

Secondly,  while the sheep and cattle sections  of

the  new abattoir are now operating smoothly,  the

pig section has not been started.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>3.52 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machinery has been undergoing testing and

newly-recruited workers are undergoing training. I

do  not know from where the Member for Jurong  got

his idea that the new abattoir is inefficient even

before  it  is put into full operation. Basically,

it is simply a question of whether we are prepared

to  accept new ideas and adopt new technology,  or

can  we  afford to stick to out-of-date  practices

and stagnate?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is natural that when a new system is being

operated and new machinery is being used, teething

troubles are inevitable. Like the running-in of  a

new car, a little time is required to get used  to

the  steering  wheel  or the  new  gadget  on  the

dashboard.  The seat must be adjusted or  a  screw

tightened. We welcome constructive suggestions and

are  prepared  to  discuss with anybody  any  real

problem and genuine grievances so that together we

can  work out solutions to the satisfaction of all

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have raised the question of

safeguarding our fishermen against piracy. This is

not   a   unique  problem  for  Singapore.  Piracy

frequently   occurs  in  the   waters   of   other

countries.  I have no doubt that the  Ministry  of

Defence  and  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  are

doing  what they can to deal with this problem  to

protect Singapore's interest. Apart from the  fact

that there is less fish to be caught in near shore

waters  around  Singapore,  small  fishing   craft

operating  in  these  waters  are  easy  prey  for

pirates.  My  Ministry  is  working  towards   the

development  of bigger and faster fishing  vessels

which could go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



further  out  to  sea  to  fish  in  international

waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of prices for agricultural produce

really  depends  on supply and demand.  There  are

different and complex forces operating in  a  free

market.  It would be unwise for the Government  to

interfere in a free marketing system unless  there

is  evidence  of dumping. I do not know  what  the

Member for Jurong had in mind when he raised  this

question.  Singapore, being a  small  island,  has

easy communication between the rural areas and the

markets  in  the  city, and the producers  in  the

rural  areas know the prevailing market prices  of

agricultural  produce in the city.  Moreover,  the

number  of  buyers or collectors  of  agricultural

produce  is  large and compete very  keenly  among

themselves. Under these circumstances, it  is  not

as easy for the middlemen to exploit the producers

as  in  a situation where there are only very  few

collectors  of  agricultural  produce  in  remote,

isolated  rural  districts. If a producer  is  not

satisfied  with the prices, it is not  beyond  his

ability  to send his agricultural produce  to  the

market  and  sell it himself. This,  in  fact,  is

happening  in  Singapore. The producers  may  also

form themselves into co-operatives or associations

to  deal with their marketing problems. But, first

of  all,  there  must  be co-operation  among  the

producers   themselves.   They   must   take   the

initiative and my Ministry will be very  happy  to

help  any group of people who is willing  to  help

themselves.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, sports today is not merely recreation. It  is

too  important for us to treat it as  such.  In  a

way,  the sports arena has become another  testing

ground  for rival countries to try to score  "one-up"  against one another. For supremacy in  sports

is  indication of potential power in other spheres

too.  This is borne out by the fact that  the  two

superpowers of the world



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



are  also the leading nations in sports. It is not

a coincidence, to be sure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just why is sports so important that we should

have a separate division in the Ministry of Social

Affairs to look after it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is one of the best ways of

inculcating  intrinsic values such as  initiative,

perseverance, agility, endurance, courage and team-spirit in our younger generation. We want all  our

youths  to  possess  these  qualities  which   are

essential  for  our national survival.  To  ensure

this,  all activities in sports should be properly

co-ordinated and guided, and hence the setting  up

of the Sports Division is the first pre-requisite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we also realise that sports can play a

useful  role in uniformed organisations,  such  as

the Armed Forces, the Police, the Vigilante Corps,

as  well  as the multifarious voluntary  uniformed

youth movements, if it is properly introduced, not

just  as a recreation, but as a basic part of  the

training programme. For the training of all  these

young people, the various games serve to diversify

the pattern of training within the units. Although

uniformity  is an essential feature  in  uniformed

organisations,  the  introduction   of   different

sports  does  help to give the joy of variety  and

show  these young people that there is also  scope

for   individual  differences  apart  from   group

similarities.  This does not, however,  mean  that

individual  interests should supersede  the  group

interests,  but rather that the former  should  be

used for the promotion of the latter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, sports can help to inculcate a sense of

dedication   and  loyalty  to  the   nation.   The

sportsman is taught to be dedicated and  loyal  to

his  team.  This  is  his first  lesson.  When  he

represents  the national team, his dedication  and

loyalty   is   therefore   to   the   nation.   As

representing the nation is the highest honour  any

sportsman can hope for, he will be constantly  and

consciously  striving  for this  rare  honour  and

glory. Hence, the process of training and striving

for  a  higher  plane  of achievement  is  also  a

manifestation  of dedication and  loyalty  to  the

nation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, sports provide training in leadership.

As  a nation whose survival depends on the quality

of  her  people, we need to have leaders  who  can

organise,  think  and inspire others  to  give  of

their best. It is my belief that such leaders  can

be  trained  and produced in the field of  sports,

especially  if they are directly involved  in  the

administration  and  organisation  of  any  sports

body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to make is that, through

sports,  we  can help to build a united  Singapore

which  transcends  the  religious,  language   and

communal barriers. It is our declared intention to

harness  this important aspect of sports. We  have

in  the  past  expressed our disavowal  of  sports

clubs  organised  solely on a clannish  or  racial

basis. We appreciate the need for a certain amount

of   exclusiveness  in  a  club,  but   let   this

exclusiveness  be  not  on  clannish   or   racial

grounds.   The  constitutions  of  the  registered

sports bodies do not provide for exclusiveness and

hence  the  policy of many clubs  with  regard  to

membership and membership drive should be changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is too much confinement

of  certain  sports to certain  racial  groups  in

Singapore. This is even apparent in the  different

games  played in the schools of different language

streams.  For example, the Chinese school students

excel  in  basketball, the Malay schools in  sepak

raga and the Tamil students in cricket and hockey.

This  tendency of "preferential confinement"  must

be  stopped  if  we are to produce  a  homogeneous

generation   as  regards  outlook,  interest   and

identity.  Apart from this, integration of  sports

activities  among  the  different  races  of   our

society also ensures that talent in every game can

be  easily  spotted, for one can never be  certain

that  a  Malay cannot be a good basketball player,

or a Chinese a good sepak raga player.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to touch on our image in the

field  of  international sports. Frankly speaking,

we  have  not  yet found a place  on  the  map  of

international sports, and we are very  far  behind

in the scene of Asian sports. However, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



do  compare  favourably  with  our  neighbours  in

Southeast Asia, as our success in the recent  SEAP

games testifies. This is a good start anyway for a

small  and newly independent nation. Here, I  must

mention that our success in the SEAP games was due

to  the  timely  formation of the National  Sports

Control  Board, which has already won praise  from

all quarters, both at home and abroad. By adhering

strictly  to  the  policy of  sending  only  those

athletes  who  have reached the  minimum  standard

requirements  for international meets,  the  Board

has  been able to ensure a degree of success which

is  in proportion to the size of the contingent as

well as the amount of money expended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned earlier that the sports arena

has  become the focal point of all nations.  Hence

we should also try to build up a good image in the

arena  of  international sports, for  our  friends

abroad measure us as a nation by the behaviour and

conduct of our sports representatives. It is clear

that few people would like to trade with a country

which  produces  ill-mannered sportsmen.  However,

our policy on international sports should be based

on  quality  and  integrity rather than  quantity.

This  is  also  cheaper and within  the  financial

resources of a small nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, 1 should like to stress that

organised  sports  is indeed very  expensive.  The

Government is doing all it can to help  raise  the

standard  of  sports in the Republic.  The  Sports

Division  of  the Ministry of Social  Affairs  has

helped to raise very substantial amounts of  money

to  send  national  teams  abroad  to  compete  in

international  meets.  Professional  coaches  have

also been employed to help raise the standards  of

soccer,  basketball  and badminton.  More  coaches

will  be  brought  in  for other  games  as  well.

However, with its enormous commitments to defence,

education, health and social welfare, there  is  a

limit  to  which the Government can  help.  It  is

therefore  imperative that the help and assistance

that sports-lovers, philanthropists and commercial

firms have been giving for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



the promotion of sports in the Republic should  be

further  increased. For it is only through all-out

support  from all fronts that we can ever hope  to

put Singapore on the map of international sports.

<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson

has  asked  about public assistance given  by  the

Social  Welfare Department and has suggested  that

the  rates  of assistance be raised. Hon.  Members

will surely realise that since the People's Action

Party  Government came to power in June 1959,  the

rates  of  public assistance have  been  increased

twice.  The  first increase was in September  1959

when the rate paid to the head of a household  was

increased  from $15 to $16 a month  and  the  wife

from  $8  to $10 a month. The second increase  was

made  in  January  1962 when the  rate  of  public

assistance was increased further from $16 to $21 a

month.  The  present public assistance  rates  for

families eligible under this plan are as follows:

<pre>

                                            Per month



         Head of household                     $21



         Wife                                  $10



         Every dependant above

           the age of 16 years                  $8



         Every dependant under

           the age of 16 years                  $5

</pre>



<br><br>As these rates are the highest in this part of the

world, there is no intention to increase these

rates any further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By increasing the public assistance rates, which

is  not  in  the interest of taxpayers, recipients

will   be  encouraged  to  rely  forever  on  this

assistance.  This will defeat the purpose  of  the

assistance  which  is aimed at  giving  relief  to

those who are unemployed, and with dependants,  to

overcome  their difficulties for a limited  period

only  until they secure employment. Last year  the

Social Welfare Department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



paid  out  $7.6 million for public assistance  and

T.B, relief. This is slightly more than  half  of

the  amount allocated, which is $14 million  under

the   estimates   for  departmental   expenditure.

Therefore,  any  increase in the rates  of  public

assistance  will  bring about an increase  in  the

public  assistance votes and this will leave  less

money  to  be  spent on other responsibilities  in

welfare services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that public assistance recipients will

not rely permanently on this assistance, a special

team  was formed in April 1964 with the object  of

carrying out investigations from time to time  and

reviewing  the  financial  position  of   families

receiving assistance. As a result of work  carried

out  by  this special team and the improvement  in

our   social  conditions  and  economic   position

brought  about by Government's long-term planning,

the  number of recipients of public assistance has

considerably  been reduced from  28,800  in  April

1964 to 17,000 only in April 1968. The amount paid

for  public  assistance has  also  decreased  from

$962,000 in April 1964 to $492,000 in April 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson also referred to training

allowances received by dependants of recipients of

public assistance who are serving in the national

service. A dependant of a recipient of public

assistance is allowed to keep his training

allowance, up to an amount of $25. Any amount in

excess of this will be considered when public

assistance to his head of household is reviewed.

Indeed it is appropriate that if a dependant is in

receipt of a military training allowance, he will

not be eligible for a dependant allowance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as the representative for Tiong

Bahru, I would like to express my full support for

the Prime Minister's motion thanking the President

for  his speech delivered in this House on the 6th

of  May.  The President's policy statement clearly

points out that the Government will have to  adopt

effective measures to meet the problems that  will

arise in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



new  situation  in the next five  years.  We  have

reason   to  believe  that  with  its  experience,

achievements and capacity to resolve  problems  in

the  past  nine  years,  the  present  Government,

together with all the Members of Parliament,  will

be  able  to  find ways and means to  achieve  the

three  objectives as outlined in  the  President's

Speech, and we are confident that it will overcome

all difficulties and challenges. The first and the

second  objectives relate to defence and  economic

growth.   Members  of  Parliament   have   already

expressed their views on them. So I will now touch

on the third objective, namely, the enhancement of

national  consciousness of the problems that  will

come upon us in the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the political situation in our

country   has  been  changing.  Before  1954,   we

experienced  a  period of colonial administration.

In  1959,  Singapore  achieved a  self-independent

status  and later on it joined Malaysia. In  1965,

Singapore  was separated from Malaysia and  became

an  independent  Republic.  These  were  political

changes  in  our history and, in the same  period,

there were changes too on the international scene.

We,  as  citizens  of Singapore,  should  pay  the

closest  attention to these changes as there  will

be  more  changes in this region in three to  five

years'  time. No one can be sure of whether  there

will  be  any drastic changes around us  going  to

take  place.  So in the coming crucial  years,  we

must  avail  ourselves  of  every  opportunity  to

ensure  our independence and survival. This  every

citizen  should  perceive.  In  particular,  those

civil  servants  who  are in charge  of  executing

Government policies, should pay more attention  at

all  times  to the actual spirit of the Ordinances

and  Acts.  It is in that spirit that they  should

faithfully carry out the policies laid down.  They

should  also  discard  their  rigid  and  dogmatic

attitude   in   their   work.   Otherwise    their

inflexibility   will   usually   give   rise    to

misunderstanding   of  their  disregard   of   the

purposes  and actual spirit of the Ordinances  and

Acts.  Unnecessary explanation will have time  and

again to be repeated. In this way, efficiency in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



the  administration  of the Ordinances  and  Acts

will be affected and the purposes may not be fully

achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for instance, early this year,

the   Citizens'  Consultative  Committee   of   my

constituency  made a request to the  General  Post

Office  to  install a post-box  in  Jalan  Membina

Housing  Estate, which was recently  developed  by

the  Housing and Development Board. In view of the

fact that there are now about 20,000 residents  in

this area, the installation of a post-box was very

necessary. But the request was turned down on  the

ground  that  no  new post-box should  be  set  up

within  a radius of one mile from any branch  post

office.  In  the old neighbouring housing  estate,

there is a branch post office and a post-box.  But

I  would like to point out that there is no direct

communication  with this housing  estate.  So  the

branch  post  office is not of  much  use  to  the

residents of Jalan Membina. At the request of  the

Citizens'  Consultative Committee, I went  to  the

General  Post  Office  and,  after  studying   the

problem  with  the  officer  concerned,   it   was

realised  that the problem could easily be  solved

by  removing  one pillar post-box  from  Henderson

Road to the entrance to Jalan Membina without  any

cost,  because  the pillar post-box  in  Henderson

Road  was  not  being used very much  -  about  20

letters  a day were thrown into it. When this  was

done,  it  benefited the people  living  in  Jalan

Membina  and  also in Bukit Ho  Swee.  This  is  a

trivial  matter but it goes to show  that  if  the

officer concerned had given further thought to it,

much time and trouble would have been saved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to mention another incident.

This  was  the eviction of a tenant of  a  Housing

Board  flat. The Members for Jurong and Ulu Pandan

quoted  the case of a coffee-shop owner  in  Tiong

Bahru who committed suicide by jumping down from a

multi-storeyed  flat. They spoke in  a  forthright

manner  and  with a sense of justice. However,  we

know  from  the Press that the housing authorities

are  giving sympathetic consideration to this case

and I hope that there will be a reasonable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



solution.  Therefore, I will not dwell further  on

this  case.  But 1 would like to quote  a  similar

case of an old lady occupying a Housing Board flat

who  was  asked  to  vacate because  a  number  of

teenagers were found playing mahjong in her  flat.

She  went  to  the  Housing Board authorities  and

pleaded  for  another chance.  She  threatened  to

commit  suicide  by  jumping down  from  a  multi-storeyed flat if her plea was not heeded. But  she

was met by a very rigid and harsh officer - though

a  good  officer - who was not moved by her tears.

He told her, "It is no business of mine whether or

not you jump down from your flat, but you have  to

quit?'  Sir, I agree in principle with the  strict

measures  taken  against  flats  being  used   for

illegal purposes, but eviction is the most  severe

measure that can be taken by the Housing Board. If

the  premises  are used as gambling  dens  or  for

other ignominious or illegal purposes, eviction is

justified.  But,  Sir, those youngsters  who  were

found  playing  mahjong are the old neighbours  of

the  old lady. They were playing mahjong just  for

the  fun  of it. This old lady who was accused  of

allowing  her premises to be used by a  number  of

youngsters for mahjong, it was found that she  did

not  have  even  a  proper mahjong  table  in  her

premises.  This  would  show  that  she   had   no

intention of turning her premises into a  gambling

den.  The  playing of mahjong in a  Housing  Board

flat  should be regarded as a very minor  offence.

So we should have compassion on this old lady, who

committed   the  first  offence.  The  authorities

concerned did not even give her another chance  or

a  first  warning. Was it not very harsh treatment

of the old lady who was asked to remove?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the illustrations given, we can see what

sort  of  attitude civil servants have. They  lack

patience to look into and study complaints by  the

public.  They should be more aware of the problems

lying  ahead of our nation. They should  also  re-examine  the  attitude that they have  adopted  in

their  work and towards members of the public.  If

they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



stick foolishly to their daily routine, they  will

fail  in  their responsibilities and in trying  to

solve the national problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of defence, my

view  is that, in addition to giving our nationals

military training and teaching them how to  handle

military  equipment, we should teach  them  to  be

patriotic, particularly as Singapore has  attained

its  independence only not long ago.  We  can  see

very  clearly,  from history - even  recently,  in

fact  - that in the struggle for survival,  it  is

not so much the military equipment that matters as

the ideological training - given to the people. In

this  respect,  I  feel that we should  teach  our

people to be patriotic. This will spur them on  to

make personal sacrifices in the national interest.

Therefore,  in  addition to instruction  given  in

military training and teaching our soldiers how to

use  their  weapons, we should teach  them  to  be

patriotic so that they will be able to  put  up  a

better performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to make the people

more  aware  of  the problems that will  face  our

nation  in  the next few years, our  teachers  too

must  be  made  conscious of  these  problems.  We

describe  teachers as engineers of the  soul,  and

this  is  a very apt description of the importance

of  the  role  they play. So it is necessary  that

they  should be conscious of the problems that  we

are  now facing, because they are charged with the

responsibility of educating our younger generation

who will provide our future leadership. Therefore,

our  students should be given proper  guidance  in

nurturing  a  sense  of  patriotism  and  national

consciousness.  The  teachers  should  strive  for

improvement  all the time in order  to  raise  the

qualitative aspects of our education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a saying, "What is

dyed black will be black and what is dyed red will

be  red." So the kind of young people we will have

in  future  will depend on the sort  of  education

that  we  now give them. At the present moment  we

are  stepping  up  extra-mural activities  in  the

schools, but the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



time  spent on them by the teachers is inadequate.

I  hope  our  teachers will devote more  time  and

energy to their students' extramural activities so

as  to produce a robust and rugged society in  our

next generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to inculcate a spirit

of national consciousness in the students, we have

military  and police training in the cadet  corps.

We  should not have quantity alone. We should also

have  quality  in  our  training.  We  should   be

concerned not so much with the form but  with  the

content  of  the  training we are  giving  to  our

children.  In my view, our youth must realise  the

importance of national consciousness. It  is  only

with the spur of patriotism that our children will

be able to build a robust and rugged society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Ministry of Culture has a great

part to play in the field of public education. For

example, the contents of the television and  radio

broadcasts   must   be   imbued   with    national

consciousness.  The publications in  our  National

Library  and  the exhibits in the National  Museum

should also have items which will inspire national

consciousness and patriotism. It is only when  our

people  have the feeling of patriotism  that  they

will be able to solve all problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have also noted that only ten per

cent  of the school population per year reach  the

matriculation level, and of this figure only about

five per cent are admitted to the universities  or

other   institutions  of  higher  learning.  These

undergraduates   are  in  a  somewhat   privileged

position.   They  receive  special  training   and

education.  Naturally after  they  have  graduated

they  should be able to serve their country better

by  solving  our national problems and  overcoming

difficulties,  and  making a concerted  effort  to

build  a more prosperous multi-racial society.  As

the  Prime Minister has said in moving the motion,

Singapore  is  what it is today  because  we  have

above average intelligence, diligence, skill, know-how and expertise. Undoubtedly, our graduates have

the  honour of being in possession of such  talent

and expertise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



But  from what we can see at the present juncture,

there  are certain disappointing features  amongst

our graduates. Some of them are still living in an

ivory  tower.  They are least concerned  with  our

national affairs. Today if we try to get graduates

who  are really interested in our national affairs

and  are dedicated to our country, I am afraid the

number will not be very great. In fact, we can see

very  few  graduates  serving  on  the  management

committees  of the various community  centres  and

the Citizens' Consultative Committees. In my view,

while we are reorganising our secondary education,

we   should   also   consider   reorganising   our

universities. We should then be able to produce  a

generation   of  graduates  who   are   not   only

specialists  in their field, but are  also  imbued

with   a  sense  of  national  consciousness   and

patriotism  so  that  they would  be  prepared  to

dedicate themselves to society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish now to touch on the

question  of  adult  education.  At  the   present

moment,  the Adult Education Board is running  two

types  of  classes, the language classes  and  the

secondary  evening classes. All these classes  are

biased towards academic subjects. Now that we  are

industrialising  and  are  trying   to   introduce

technical  subjects into our education system,  we

see that the work of the Adult Education Board  is

not  adequate  in  this  respect.  The  Board   is

financed by public funds and the students  of  the

Board  are either young workers or people who  are

unable  to get places in schools. In my view,  the

adult   education   classes  should   teach   more

technical  and  vocational subjects than  academic

subjects.  In this way the graduates of the  Adult

Education Board will be able to play their part in

industrialisation. In the day-time they  have  got

their  own  jobs.  Two  or  three  years  ago,   I

understood that these part-time teachers would  be

replaced by full-time teachers. But I do not  know

why  this has not been done. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it

cannot  be  denied that the Adult Education  Board

has made outstanding achievements in the field  of

adult education. But in order to consolidate  what

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



been  achieved and to fall in with the  change  in

secondary  education,  the Adult  Education  Board

must have its own staff of teachers. This will not

only help to promote the growth of adult education

but  it  will  also help to solve our unemployment

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last week when the Member for

Joo  Chiat  spoke in this House, he advocated  the

abolition  of communal schools and the Member  for

Kampong  Chai Chee yesterday also voiced the  same

opinion  in support. I fully agree with what  that

they have said. In order to create a society and a

nation which transcends all racial differences, we

must  make a start in this respect in the schools.

But  I  do not agree when they say that there  are

communal  schools in our Republic. At present  the

schools,  in  whatever stream  they  are,  do  not

discriminate   against  any  student   on   racial

grounds.  It is possible for a Tamil to  go  to  a

Chinese  school to study and for a Chinese student

to  go to a Malay school to study. However,  I  do

not deny that in the Republic parents tend to send

their  children  to the schools  where  their  own

mother  tongue  is  being used as  the  medium  of

instruction. This is mainly due to the  fact  that

the policy of second language teaching has got  to

be  more practical and its implementation has  not

been  adequate.  That  is why  the  Government  is

trying to improve the standard of teaching of  the

second language in all schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum to the President's Speech various

effective  measures  have  been  clearly  outlined

which  the Government will adopt to put the second

language to maximum use as a medium of instruction

in  our schools. This is to enable our students to

become  bilingual  so  that they  will  have  more

opportunities    for   further    education    and

employment.  It is only through the  promotion  of

bilingualism  in our schools that it  is  possible

for  the  students  to  break  down  the  language

barrier  and  thus be able to mix together,  study

together and live together.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, let us strengthen our administrative

arm  and  achieve the great objective  of  nation-building. According to the speech delivered by the

President,  it is obvious that the Government  has

adopted various measures to deal effectively  with

the  problems that are confronting us. I now fully

support  the  motion  in the  name  of  the  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I deal with one or two

aspects  of the policy of my Ministry as  outlined

in  the  Addendum  to the President's  Speech  and

elaborate on them and perhaps reply to some points

raised by some hon. Members in this debate, I wish

to  speak  on  the  present cholera  situation  in

Singapore.  I am sure hon. Members of  this  House

will be keen to hear me on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After four cholera-free years, a single case of

cholera was discovered on the 17th of April, 1968,

in  a 66-year old male Chinese who lives at Lorong

3,  Geylang. Hon. Members will remember  that  the

17th of April, 1968, is only a day after I assumed

office   as   Minister   for   Health.   To    the

superstitious minded, this may be an  omen  or  an

augury  perhaps  ill  or good,  depending  on  the

stars,  of  the things to come during my  term  of

office  as Minister for Health. Perhaps  the  hon.

Member  for  Anson,  who is  an  expert  in  these

matters, can tell us what the stars foretell.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, for myself and my Ministry, we  look

at  this in the light of cold logic as a challenge

that  lies ahead of us to wrestle out a successful

solution  not only of making Singapore  clean  but

also  to  maintain  it as such.  Dirt,  flies  and

mosquitoes are all too evident and we do not  need

hon. Members or members of the public to remind us

of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although to date there are four

cases  of  cholera, I wish to assure hon.  Members

that there is no cause for alarm. The position  is

under  control. My officials tell  me  that  after

studying  the pattern of the outbreak, an epidemic

spread of the disease



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



is  most  unlikely. However, to ensure that  this

does  not  occur at all, stringent  measures  have

already been taken in and around the places  where

the four cases have occurred. Of course, for these

measures  to be effective we need the maximum  co-operation of the members of the public who live in

each  such  area. In this respect hon. Members  in

whose constituencies these areas happen to be  can

do  a  lot to set the lead. The residents in these

areas  need to be advised that there is  no  cause

for alarm so long as they scrupulously observe the

simple  rules  of hygiene of washing  their  hands

before  they  handle any eatables,  boiling  water

before they drink it, washing any cut fruit  which

had been left exposed before eating it and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now give hon. Members

some facts concerning the outbreak. The four cases

of cholera have occurred in four different places.

They are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first case occurred on 17-4-68 to a 66-year

old  odd  job  wood-worker  living  at  Lorong  3,

Geylang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second case on 4-5-68 to a 39-year old store-keeper with the Port of Singapore Authority living

at Jalan Minggu (Thomson Road Estate).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third case on 6-5-68 to a 9-year old school

boy living at Peng Ghee Road, Kampong Chai Chee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth case on 7-5-68 to a 68-year old car

washer living at Verdun Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All patients have recovered. The pattern of the

outbreak   has  similarities  with  the   previous

outbreak  of  1963 - 1964. There was  initially  a

latent  period between the first case  before  the

others occurred. All were isolated cases: no  link

was discovered between any one of the cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bacterial strain of the present outbreak is El

Tor Inaba.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common feature is the attack on the old and

insanitary living conditions of the patients.  But

the  small number of cases and the lack of a  link

between cases rule out water-borne infection.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



Indeed,  it  is  unlikely that the  disease  will

develop  into  any  proportions  because  of   our

extensive   safe   water  supply.   The   sporadic

occurrence without a detectable pattern  indicates

the transmission by carriers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is fortunate that the outbreaks will not

be   of  epidemic  proportions  the  presence   of

carriers  (none detected in the present  outbreak)

means  that  small outbreaks of the  disease  will

occur  sporadically indicating the endemic  state.

Eradication  in  the  circumstances  is  extremely

difficult.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also stress the important fact that

Singapore is an open international port. Every day

thousands  of people come in and out of  Singapore

not  only from the surrounding areas but also from

every nook and corner of the world. I am told that

another great port, the port of Rotterdam, has its

occasional outbreaks of cholera.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Singapore, as hon. Members know, is

an  extremely attractive and desirable  place  for

people  of  the surrounding economically depressed

areas to come to and, if possible, to settle  down

in. Our immigration authorities have been hard put

to  it to deal with the ever-increasing number  of

illegal immigrants into Singapore. I am told  that

in  recent months some 300 illegal immigrants  had

to  be deported back to the place where they  came

from.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Fair

enough!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> But what about the unknown

number who have managed to slip in undetected?  We

can therefore expect quite a number of carriers of

the cholera bacteria to have come into Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant authorities in my Ministry have been

keeping a strict check on the international health

certificates  of every traveller that  comes  into

Singapore.  But whom we have no control  over  are

the  illegal  immigrants that have  been  slipping

into  Singapore.  However, I assure  hon.  Members

that  strict vigilance will be maintained. In  the

long term, eradication of the disease can only be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



achieved  if the people are scrupulously clean  in

their  habits  and the standard of  sanitation  is

improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure a question which is uppermost in the

minds  of  hon.  Members is the question  of  mass

inoculation  of the whole population of  Singapore

as  a  measure of control, and whether my Ministry

will  be  launching  such  a  mass  campaign.   My

officials   and  I  have  considered   this   very

carefully  and we have decided that the  situation

at the moment does not warrant such a measure. The

reasons for our decision are as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, although inoculation is one of the

measures of control, it is of minor importance  in

endemic outbreaks. The present outbreak is a small

one  and  represents an endemic  situation  rather

than a build-up towards an epidemic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the vaccination confers at best

immunity of short duration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the cost for the inoculation of our two

million population will be high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, such a mass inoculation campaign will

require   the   turning  of  all  our   outpatient

dispensaries and maternal and child health centres

into  vaccination centres, and this  will  involve

not  only the posting of additional staff to these

centres   but  also  the  curtailment  of  routine

medical  services  in  these  centres  during  the

course  of the campaign, which will take at  least

one to two months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there are complications following

vaccination.  The serious one is  serum  jaundice.

Even  at  a  very small rate of incidence  in  the

mass,  the total number who will succumb  to  this

infection would be significant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation will be carefully watched.

In  any  case, may I assure hon. Members  that  my

Ministry   is   ready  to  launch  such   a   mass

inoculation campaign in the unlikely event of  the

situation  meriting it. We have at the  moment  in

stock  nearly  one million doses  of  anti-cholera

vaccine  and this can be easily increased  by  our

manufacturing some more if we so require.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, vaccination to date has been offered

only because it is required for travellers outside

of  Singapore.  For this purpose, the  vaccination

centre  at  North Canal Road has been enlarged  to

deaf with the additional persons attending at  the

centre.  The Airport Centre deals with  passengers

leaving  Singapore who might have  missed  getting

vaccination certificates before take-off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the third case the Director of Medical

Services,  Malaysia, indicated that more stringent

measures might be taken for travellers across  the

Causeway.   The   Malaysian   health   authorities

vaccinate   every  person  coming  from  Singapore

unless  they  have valid vaccination certificates.

This  has  imposed a strain on their services  and

they  are  running short of supplies and they  had

indicated   that  they  might  either  turn   back

travellers     arriving    without     vaccination

certificates  or quarantine them on  arrival.  For

this  reason a third centre was opened  at  Kranji

Maternal   and  Child  Health  Centre  (l3½   m.s.

Woodlands just south of the Causeway). The  number

of  attendances  at this centre  is  small,  which

probably indicates that the majority of travellers

have   already   been   vaccinated   and   possess

certificates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not proposed, however, to set up a centre

at  the  railway station. From experience  in  the

last  outbreak, railway travellers came just about

time  for  boarding the train and expected  to  be

vaccinated. Since everybody had the same idea, the

rush  created unruly scenes. Passengers travelling

by train should, therefore, take their vaccination

from  the  North Canal Road centre  in  good  time

before travel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now turn to elaborate on

one or two aspects of the policy of my Ministry as

outlined   in  the  Addendum  to  the  President's

Speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, with this outbreak of cholera,

the  environmental aspect of health has become the

more  pressing  problem.  It  is  a  very  complex

problem   particularly  because  the  people   are

involved. To tackle this problem successfully,  an

aggressive   and  concerted  planned   effort   is

necessary. The plan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



must involve the mass participation of the public.

It  is  true that our cleansing services and Anti-Mosquito  Unit  need  further re-organisation  for

better   efficiency  and  discipline.  All   these

efforts,  however, can come to naught  if  certain

sections of the public continue with the  old  bad

habits  of  indiscriminate throwing of litter  and

rubbish and allowing their little children to  use

our public drains as a place for the evacuation of

their   bowels  while  others  continue  to  breed

mosquitoes in discarded empty receptacles  in  the

compounds  of their houses. Therefore, along  with

the  reorganisation of our public health  services

to lick it into shape, it is necessary at the same

time  to  launch  a mass nation-wide  campaign  to

appeal  to  the civic-mindedness of the people  of

Singapore  to  keep  Singapore  clean.  This  will

involve   the   participation  of   thousands   of

voluntary workers who will be trained before  they

go  out  and exhort members of the public  not  to

throw  litter  and so on. In this  mass  campaign,

which will have to be worked out very carefully, I

shall  require not only the sympathetic  but  also

the active co-operation of hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only after this mass health education

campaign  that the new laws will be enforced  with

vigour  to  deal firmly but fairly with the  small

percentage   of   incorrigible   litter-bugs   and

persistent  breeders  of disease-bearing  insects,

like mosquitoes and flies. These new laws are  now

being  very carefully drafted, loopholes are being

plugged in order to make for effective enforcement

against the wrongdoer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cleansing side which is the responsibility

of  my  Ministry,  a  new roster  system  will  be

introduced  to allow the cleansing, the collection

and  disposal of rubbish to be done all  the  year

round irrespective of Sundays and public holidays.

A sustained effort with this two-pronged attack on

this  extremely difficult problem  should  see  us

through to a cleaner and healthier Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other priority problem is the problem of

dental health in Singapore. The poor dental health

of our population was brought into focus when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



new  recruits of our national servicemen underwent

dental examination. These young adults between the

ages of 18 and 21 years did not enjoy the benefits

of   fluoridation  of  our  water  supplies  which

started  in 1958. They had received little  or  no

dental  attention from the school  dental  service

while  they  were in the primary schools,  and  no

dental  treatment other than extraction of decayed

or  aching teeth during their adolescent years  in

secondary schools. Most of them do not visit their

dentists   regularly  mainly  because   of   their

ignorance of dental hygiene. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it

is  important  that our young population  maintain

good  dental  health because lack  of  good  sound

teeth  can  greatly  handicap the  building  of  a

robust constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, to tackle the problem, my Ministry

places  more emphasis on preventive measures,  not

only because they are financially less costly, but

because they are based on the sound principle that

"Prevention is better than cure". The first  thing

that we shall do will be to launch a Dental Health

Education   Programme.  This  will   be   directed

particularly  at  the  school  children.  A   more

specific  and active action plan must be  devised.

For  example, there should be compulsory  brushing

of  teeth by school children as part of the school

curriculum after their physical training  classes.

This  brings me to mind a remark made by the  hon.

Member for Katong who quite cynically said that it

is  all very well to urge school children to brush

their teeth -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Not cynically, Sir,

I hope!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Well, I hope the hon. Member

for Katong will agree with me that he did say that

it  is  all  very well to urge school children  to

brush  their  teeth,  but what  about  those  poor

children  who  do  not possess  a  toothbrush?  My

answer  to this is quite simple. Surely the parent

of  every school-going child can afford to  buy  a

toothbrush in the same way as he can afford to buy

a pair of shoes, which is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



more expensive. I understand that toothbrushes, if

bought  in  bulk, might be obtained  for  only  10

cents  each, which hon. Members know is the  price

of only a glass of ice-water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, whatever preventive measures are

undertaken,  there will remain a large  proportion

of  the  population who missed  being  exposed  to

dental  health  propaganda. For  these  people,  a

dental  care service will be provided. The  dental

care  services  will  be expanded  as  rapidly  as

resources are available. Priority will, of course,

be  given  to  the further establishment  of  more

dental clinics for school children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to deal with some of the points

raised  by  hon.  Members in the  course  of  this

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer to what the Member for Ulu Pandan

said in his usual picturesque manner and with some

vehemence?  He did say some unkind things  of  the

actions so far taken by the Hawkers Department  of

my  Ministry.  He also suggested that  the  Health

Ministry should construct more markets and hawkers

stalls  before they begin to resite  hawkers.  The

Hawkers Department of my Ministry has always  done

its  best to provide alternative sites for hawkers

when  clearing them, if such sites are  available.

But  as  hon. Members very well know, in Singapore

today,  such  vacant plots of  land  suitable  for

hawker  resiting in the crowded areas of Singapore

are  quite  difficult to come by. My  Ministry  is

doing  its  best to tackle the hawker  problem  in

Singapore, which hon. Members know very  well  has

been defying solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the Member for Geylang Serai?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chua, can you estimate how much

longer you are likely to take?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> About two or three minutes

more.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The Member for Geylang Serai

in his speech referred



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



to  some malpractices by some members of the Anti-Mosquito Unit of my Ministry who, instead of doing

their  rounds  of oiling of drains,  etc, in  his

constituency,  sell the oil for  profit.  This  is

indeed a very serious malpractice. But I must  say

with  regret that the hon. Member had not  thought

fit to come and see me about it with the necessary

information so that the culprits concerned can  be

dealt with as they deserve. The hon. Member, being

a  trade  unionist, should know  that  before  any

Government  employee is sacked, there  is  such  a

thing  called  a  disciplinary  enquiry  conducted

under  the  Disciplinary  Enquiry  Code  in  which

evidence  must  be  brought forward.  Unless  hon.

Members and members of the public who witness such

malpractices come forward to provide the evidence,

we can never bring the culprits to book.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Can you not catch them

redhanded?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> If members of the public did

not  see these malpractices, I am quite sure  that

the complaints would not have come in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> If you want evidence, you have

to catch them redhanded?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Lastly, may I turn to the

Member  for Punggol who touched cursorily  on  the

proposed  Abortion  Bill.  The  interesting  point

about  it  is  that  the Member had  categorically

stated that he opposed the Bill even before he had

the opportunity to look at its provisions!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> On a point of

information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chua, are you prepared to give

way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I think the Minister for Health

will  agree with me that I stated that I  reserved

my comments on the Bill until it comes before this

House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The Member for Punggol is

putting  the  cart  before the horse!  He  opposes

first,  and  then says that when he looks  at  the

provisions -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chua, perhaps the Member for

Punggol was limiting himself to the last paragraph

in the Addendum to the President's Speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> May I proceed, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill

will  be placed before Parliament soon and I  urge

hon.  Members to study the provisions first before

they  decide to support or oppose the Bill and  to

be  guided  more  by their reason  than  by  their

emotions  and  prejudices  when  making  up  their

minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I suggest to the Member

for   Punggol  that  he  should  first  study  the

provisions of the Bill before he begins -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The Bill is not out. How can I

study it?

<br><br>5.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, let me echo what has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



been  so vigorously expressed currently both  from

within  and  from without this Chamber,  that  the

years  ahead  for  the people of  Singapore  as  a

result  of  the  British withdrawal  by  1971  are

crucial  in every aspect of life in the  Republic.

They  are  crucial  for us in  terms  of  national

defence  and  security and in economic,  political

and social development. The sacred and trojan task

before  the  Government in  its  present  term  of

office  is  not  only to win the support  and  co-operation  of  the  people in a common  effort  to

surmount   the  difficult  defence  and   economic

problems  that  will  arise as  a  result  of  the

pending  British withdrawal, but also to lead  the

people  of  Singapore towards a national  identity

which is Singapore's own in form and content,  and

to move from a society of migrant people to a deep-rooted  society, with a feeling of  attachment  to

Singapore  and  a  sense  of  national  pride  and

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the difficult years ahead, while our

attention will be focused on the problems and  our

minds  will be diverted towards finding  solutions

to  the problems, we must never lose sight of  our

national   perspective  and,  in  our  eager   and

aggressive  approach to solve our  problems,  find

temporary   solutions  that  would  create   other

problems for ourselves. While I would say that the

policy  of  the  Government  as  outlined  in  the

President's  Speech  and the  Addendum  to  it  is

positive  and imaginative, and inspires confidence

and sparks off a radiant ray of hope in our people

in  the  crucial years ahead, I must, at the  same

time,  point  out  that certain  features  of  the

policy as outlined require re-thinking and care in

their  implementation. I refer to  those  features

pertaining  to  the introduction of  comprehensive

labour  legislation  and to  the  changes  in  the

educational system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government's introduction of the

Employment  Bill,  the fears of labour  have  been

adequately expressed by my N.T.U.C, colleagues  in

this  Chamber. Any mention of the fears of  labour

on  my  part would be mere repetition. However,  I

would like to add that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



I  recognise that for Singapore to prosper it must

encourage  and generate greater economic  activity

to sustain and to improve our industrial growth. I

also  recognise  that to do this capital  must  be

encouraged  to remain in and flow into  Singapore.

This is only possible if the investment climate in

Singapore  is more favourable than that  in  other

countries. In other words, there must be political

stability,  a  good communications  system,  hard-working and efficient labour, an export market for

goods  that  can compete in terms of  quality  and

price with goods of other countries, and a host of

other factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers in Singapore will respond to the new

challenges   ahead  by  giving  of   their   best,

especially when they are made to feel that at  the

end  of  their efforts and sacrifices, the  nation

survives  and prospers and they will  be  given  a

share  of  the prosperity, ownership of homes  and

the  enjoyment of social facilities, such as  free

education, health and all the amenities  of  life.

If  it  is for all these that workers in Singapore

are expected to co-operate with the Government  to

ensure our survival and prosperity, then they will

not  be  found wanting in their co-operation.  But

the  Government must always bear in mind that  the

workers  have  legitimate fears that the  proposed

Employment Bill may have features that could  lead

to management abusing them. Government must ensure

that  this  does not happen. It will be  good  for

Singapore   if   a  situation  can   arise   where

management  and labour can co-operate  for  mutual

benefit. Government must ensure that nothing  that

it   will   do,   especially  in  new  legislation

affecting labour, will harm the long-term interest

of  labour. This is only possible if the  N.T.U.C.

is consulted on all matters affecting labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the changes in the education system in

Singapore, I commend the Government for setting up

a  Cabinet Committee to supervise the planning and

co-ordination of technical and vocational training

on a

national   basis  with  the  object  of   avoiding

duplication of effort and ensuring that  technical

and vocational training would be keyed to manpower

needs and employment opportunities. Not to set  up

this   committee  would  be  to  miss  the   first

essential   step   in   the   massive   structural

reorganisation  of the educational structure.  The

Education  Minister  in  his  speech  earlier  has

mentioned that machinery has been set up to  swing

into   technical   education.  The   Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education  has  also

mentioned that a crash programme will be  launched

to  train craft teachers. My question is, has care

been  taken  before all this is launched?  I  hope

that great care will be taken in the drawing up of

the   curriculum  as  well  as  the  training   of

teachers. We must not produce, at the end  of  the

technical  and vocational training,  human  robots

who  will  merely man our industries  efficiently,

but  we must also produce citizens who are capable

of  feeling and understanding concepts and  values

like  democracy and loyalty to Singapore  and  who

are  culturally equipped to be able to spend their

leisure  hours usefully. There must not  be  over-emphasis  on  the  technical aspect  of  education

without  also the balance of the subjects  on  the

humanities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum, under "Ministry of Education"

section (b) , mention is made of a concerted effort

to  produce  effectively bilingual school-leavers.

This  is  laudable and goes to show that  language

teaching  cannot  be isolated by itself  but  must

form an integral part of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section (c) it is mentioned that there will

be  "increasing emphasis on quality at all  levels

of  education to make up shortcomings in the  past

necessitated   by   the  unprecedented   rate   of

expansion in the school system to provide a  place

for every child. Now that this quantitative target

has  been  achieved, attention will be  turned  to

qualitative   improvement  in   such   fields   as

curriculum  reform, textbooks and  teaching  aids,

teaching techniques,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



teacher  training  and re-training,  examinations,

health  education,  physical  education,  art  and

music,  and  all forms of extramural  activities."

All these, Mr Speaker, Sir, sound pious hopes  to

me. In order to have curriculum reform, changes in

textbooks, improvement in the quality of  teaching

and   so  forth,  careful  research  and  adequate

personnel  are required. I hope that we will  have

the experts. We will spend enough time on research

before  changes  are made on these very  important

aspects of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that teachers at

present  teaching adult education in night classes

are depriving the unemployed of job opportunities.

I  want  to  state here that it  is  not  easy  to

replace these teachers in night classes with those

who   are   unemployed.  The  standard  of   adult

education has got to be maintained. Therefore,  if

these teachers are to be replaced, then some  care

must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  those  who  are

unemployed will be adequately trained to take over

the night classes.

I  first say what subjects I am not going to  talk

about?  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I do  not

intend  to  say  anything  at  all  about  foreign

affairs  because, judging by the  debates  in  the

satisfied  with  the trend of our foreign  policy.

For  those  who  are  nevertheless  interested  in

they  read the Addendum to the President's Speech.

Nor  do I, as Minister for Labour, intend to  deal

with  the  specific points raised by certain  hon.

Members  in  connection with the  proposed  labour

legislation. I understand it was a bit  unfair  on

the  Members because they were discussing  a  Bill

which  they  had not seen. But the Bill  has  been

presented today for First Reading. When  it  comes

up   for  Second  Reading,  there  will  be  ample

opportunities for hon. Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



to  discuss  it at greater length and  in  greater

detail.  What  I  would like to  do  today  is  to

indicate  the  wider  context  against  which  the

Employment   Bill   and  all  other   Governmental

measures  and national policies should be studied,

because  without these broader terms of reference,

I  think  we will be in danger of looking  at  the

trees and missing the wood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in Singapore are fortunate in that

independence has come to us long after most of the

countries in Asia and Africa had achieved  theirs.

We achieved our independence less than three years

ago,  though the decolonisation process  has  been

going  on  for some two decades. The advantage  we

get of being latecomers to independence is that we

can  learn  from the mistakes and achievements  of

our seniors - particularly their mistakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not decrying independence or sneering at the

misfortunes of comparatively older nations, but it

is   a  fact  that  independence,  going  by   the

experience  of the last 20 years, has not  ushered

in  the brave new world nationalists had hoped for

and  had  promised  to  do when  they  fought  for

independence. In many newly-independent  countries

within the region and outside, hope has given  way

to  despair.  The sense of dedication and  purpose

which  characterised nationalist leadership before

independence   has  given  way  to  venality   and

aimlessness. Tribal wars and racial and  religious

persecutions  of  their  own  people  are   marked

features  in the lives of many new nations.  Riots

and  violence  are endemic. And almost  everywhere

their economics are in process of disintegration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the picture is not all one of

unrelieved bleakness and failures. There have been

a  number of achievements in different fields, but

the  overall picture is one of disappointments and

even  disillusionment. I do not want to infer from

this  that the struggles for independence  were  a

ghastly  mistake. The new nations  were  right  to

fight  for  independence because no foreign  ruler

can really promote the welfare



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



of the people. Nor do I think that the nationalist

leaders  who  led  their  countries  into  freedom

lacked  patriotism, courage or even  the  will  to

succeed. If they did not have these qualities they

could  not  have become successful  and  respected

nationalist  leaders  or endured  the  ordeal  and

risks involved in the struggle for freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If many of these countries have made a mess of

independence, it is largely because,  though  they

knew  how to fight for freedom, they did not  know

how  to  consolidate it. This is one of the bitter

lessons  to  be  learned from the post-independent

history  of  new  nations. And we  are  among  the

newest of new nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it would be helpful for us in Singapore

if I listed out some of the major errors which are

responsible  for  the  dismal  state  many  newly-independent  nations find themselves in.  This  is

not  a  very  pleasant exercise but  necessary  if

Singapore is not to find itself in the blind alley

some countries have wandered into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the principal errors was the belief, or

rather  the pathetic fallacy, that all the  evils,

miseries  and  frustrations we  experienced  under

colonialism  derived  wholly  from  the  fact   of

imperial  rule. During the anti-colonial  struggle

the     propaganda    line    was    simple    and

straightforward.   Why   were   we    economically

backward?  The answer was because of  colonialism.

What was the cause of poverty, slums, disease  and

unemployment? The answer was colonialism. Why were

there  racial and religious conflicts? The  answer

was  because of colonialism. Every frustration and

every  shortcoming, we believed, was  attributable

to   colonialism.  Even  today,  long  after   the

colonialists   have   faded   from   the    scene,

nationalist leaders, if they cannot find the right

answer   or  dare  not  give  the  right   answer,

invariably blame it on colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is an element of truth in the answer.

In   so   far   as   a  colonial   power   assumed

responsibility or forced themselves on us for  our

welfare and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



progress, it had to be held accountable in so  far

as it failed to promote the welfare of the people.

In  this  respect,  there is  some  truth  in  the

answer. But it is not the whole truth. Imperialism

or  colonialism  was only one of the  many  causes

responsible for our backwardness. Perhaps it was a

good  and  necessary  strategy  during  the  anti-colonial  phase  of our struggle  for  nationalist

leaders  to  concentrate only  on  the  evils  and

shortcomings of colonialism. Because that was  the

only  way we could mobilise the people to struggle

against colonialism. Any strategist will tell  you

that in a fight you should concentrate on only one

enemy - the principal enemy. At that time, it  was

the  colonial power which was our principal  enemy

because it was the enemy we wanted to get rid  of.

That was the strategy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, unfortunately, after independence the

nationalist  leaders and many of  their  followers

got  caught  in the coils of their own propaganda.

They  believed  and  persuaded  their  people   to

believe that now that colonialism was out  of  the

way,   all   their  problems  would  automatically

vanish.  Colonialism  was  responsible  for  their

poverty,  misery and frustration. Colonialism  had

now  been  eliminated. The real  source  of  their

troubles  had  been  eliminated.  Therefore,  they

argued,   there  should  ipso  facto   be   peace,

prosperity  and brotherhood all round. The  people

expected that they could now enjoy all the  things

that  the richer colonial nations had enjoyed  but

which they had deliberately denied to us. So  they

really  believed that colonialism was  responsible

for all our evils. And now everybody expected that

it should be just the opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first few years after independence - generally from my calculations it is about 10

years  after  independence - it looked  as  though

this   theory   was  right,  that   progress   and

prosperity  could  come  about  automatically.  We

appeared  to be having, with little or no  effort,

all the things that the advanced nations have.  We

made   democratic  constitutions  equal   to   and

sometimes even better than any to be found in  the

advanced countries. We erected magnificent Parliaments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



which  were  even  better  and   more

expensive  than  any  to be  found  in  Europe  or

America.  We  put  up  magnificent  administrative

buildings  and set up bureaucratic machines  which

were  equal  to any in the advanced countries,  if

not in performance, at least in numbers. We put up

magnificent  monuments  to commemorate  real,  but

very often imaginary, heroes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went still further and adopted the styles of

living   and  consumption  of  the  most  affluent

countries. True, this was made possible for only a

tiny  minority of peoples of the new  rulers,  but

this  was very often justified on the grounds that

all great advances must have small beginnings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also adopted social welfare legislation, trade

union  laws  and the more pleasant  and  expensive

features  of well-developed countries even  though

we  lacked  the  highly  developed  economics  and

organisations that made these things  possible  in

advanced countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the first phase - the first few years of

independence  - when it looked as if  the  theory,

"Get  rid  of  colonialism and we move  to  peace,

prosperity and happiness," was right. But we  know

now,  20  years after, that within  a  few  years,

things  turned  sour. The system of  parliamentary

democracy  was  hastily  dismantled  in  the  vast

majority  of  newly-independent  nations  on   the

ground  that it did not suit the national  genius.

Instead  we  had  one-man  saviours  and  military

dictators.  Trade  unions  discovered  that  under

conditions   of  growing  poverty   and   economic

disintegration, workers were prepared to work  for

a  mere pittance, whatever workers' charters might

prescribe.  I would advise hon. Members  to  study

closely  what  has happened to very  powerful  and

very  militant  trade unions  around  the  region.

Recently, I had occasion to meet one respected and

venerable  trade union leader from a  neighbouring

country  in  the  region. I asked him,  "What  has

happened to your trade union?" He said, "No, I  am

in business now."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Does he come from Formosa?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> He said, "There is nothing that

we  can  offer our workers, because things are  so

bad  that people are prepared to work for one meal

a day." You can go on strike - some employers will

be  quite  happy because they can close  down  the

firm for a day and give no wages. In many of these

countries,  even  the  few  factories  that   were

erected  fell  into  disuse and  decay.  The  vast

bureaucratic machines -symbols of modernisation  - hampered  rather than assisted the development  of

the  country.  A number of them eventually  became

machines for organised graft and petty oppression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even then, many leaders in newly-independent

countries   refused  to  accept  the   fact   that

colonialism  was  not the only factor  responsible

for  their backwardness. They dared not  tell  the

people  the  unpleasant truth  that  the  road  to

economic growth and modernisation is one  of  hard

work, sacrifice and dedication, because during the

anti-colonial    struggle,    they    had    said,

"Independence   means   peace,   prosperity    and

progress."  Therefore, they  dared  not  tell  the

people, "Now that you have got independence,  only

hard work, sacrifice and dedication can put you on

the  road  to  happiness." When  things  got  more

difficult and more desperate, some of the  leaders

tried  to assuage the growing resentment of  their

people  by  claiming that though  colonialism  had

been got rid of, the source of their troubles  has

now been traced to a new menace - neo-colonialism.

And   until   very  recently,  even   though   the

colonialists had retired to temperate climates and

the  countries  concerned had been  recognised  as

independent  and free nations and given  seats  in

the  United  Nations,  the anti-colonial  struggle

was,  nevertheless, persisted in  for  many  years

after  that.  Or some of them tried  to  shore  up

their crumbling economic edifice by making regular

pilgrimages  to European and American capitals  in

search of loans, grants or anything that might  be

going free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It never occurred to them - though this thought

is  now  fortunately dawning on the new  breed  of

leaders emerging



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



in  Asia  and Africa and who I think will  be  the

future leaders of Asia and Africa - that the cause

for  their failures and disappointments might  lie

nearer  home  in the illusions and fallacies  they

bred  during  the  anti-colonial  phase  of  their

struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the unpleasant facts we in Singapore must

face   is  that  economic  growth  and  industrial

development  cannot  be  achieved  on  the  cheap.

Industrial  development requires at  all  times  a

sustained   effort,  a  willingness  to   mobilise

savings,  a  readiness to take risks, a propensity

for innovation, a passionate vision of the future,

a  willingness  to  make the  painful  adjustments

required  by modernisation and, most important  of

all,  a readiness on the part of the people  as  a

whole  to  postpone immediate rewards for  greater

gains  in the future. This is the premise on which

we  can  build  genuine  economic  and  industrial

development. If we do not accept this  proposition

as  true, then I think we are wasting time; we are

fooling the people when we talk of economic growth

and  industrial  development. We must  accept  the

fundamental belief that if we want economic growth

and industrial development, we must be prepared to

pay the difficult and heavy price that it demands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are not prepared to pay this price, if we

are  not prepared to accept this as a basis of our

future  policy, then there will be  little  or  no

economic   development.   The   present   leaders,

especially we in Parliament, can, if we like, fool

the  people,  as some leaders in newly-independent

countries  have done, into believing that  we  can

bring  them  prosperity without tears and  effort.

And if we did, then in five or ten years, we would

go  the  way of many independent countries -  into

bankruptcy and despair. Only in Singapore, we have

not  got  the escape hatch that many countries  in

South-east Asia have. We have not got vast  scrub-lands  and  lush jungles to which the dispossessed

and impoverished can flee to scratch some sort  of

living, either by hunting or growing bananas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



and tapioca. Economic collapse or stagnation for a

densely  populated,  nonagricultural  and   highly

commercialised  island like Singapore  means  mass

starvation. The Prime Minister has said repeatedly

that  in one square mile we sustain something like

7,000 people. If our commerce and industry come to

a  halt, the only way 7,000 people can survive  is

by eating one another! We cannot grow anything, we

cannot   plant   vegetables,   we   cannot   start

agriculture. There are about 7,000 people  in  one

square  mile. So for us the price of  collapse  is

total  disaster.  Our  commercial  and  industrial

economy  is such that, like a cyclist, we have  to

keep  moving  in order not to fall  off.  We  must

always be on the move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the time has now come for us - employers,

workers  and the people in general - to develop  a

new  outlook. The old slogans, the old  cries  and

the  old  attitudes of 20 years  ago  have  become

irrelevant to the times as they are today  and  we

are  going  to face totally different problems  in

the  future. Therefore, we have to develop  a  new

outlook, a new philosophy to meet the challenge of

the  new times. For want of a better name, I  will

call   it   the   philosophy  of  development   as

contrasted with the current outlook which  can  be

described as the philosophy of consumption  -  the

outlook  of  the ant which builds  or  the  locust

which  consumes.  It was perhaps  inevitable  that

under  colonialism we should have developed  to  a

high   degree  a  consumption  mentality   without

realising  that in a healthy economy the  capacity

to  consume  should be related to the capacity  to

produce, because when the colonials were in charge

of  Singapore they never talked about development,

for   their   own   interest   and   exploitation.

Therefore,  for us the concept of development  has

never  occurred. The only thing we could think  of

to  make life worth while was to ask -"What can we

consume? How much can we consume?" And that became

the  purpose of life. So under colonial  rule  the

efforts  of  workers  and  trade  unionists   were

directed  towards one objective - to  redistribute

wealth (for that is a way of consuming) by way of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



higher wages and better conditions of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of employers was to extract the

maximum  of profits in the shortest possible  time

and  use  these profits to consume more  and  make

more  profits. This was the basis of our  economic

activity. Consume - whether as workers, whether as

employers, whether as professional men, whether as

civil  servants. We earned more to buy more, built

bigger  houses,  bought bigger cars.  We  observed

standards   of  life  which  were   set   by   the

expatriates who came here on the basis  that  they

were in exile, that they should make as much money

as  they  normally would in half the time if  they

were   in  Europe,  and  go  back.  So  once   the

expatriates retired or were Malayanised,  the  new

elite  stepped  in, not only into the  office  but

also  into the standard of life and style of  life

that the departing expatriates had set for them  - the  same  pay, the same size of house,  the  same

size of limousine - not knowing that that kind  of

life  was not related to our own economy.  It  was

not related to what we could produce what we could

maintain. It was set by expatriates who felt  that

they had come to this country as a punishment and,

therefore, they needed extra for their effort. But

we  nevertheless continue to get this compensatory

pay that was reserved for exiled expatriates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that we are independent and are on our

own,   this  kind  of  approach,  the  consumption

psychology,  is  a  sure  and  certain   road   to

disaster. At least in the crucial years ahead  the

major  objective to which all other issues  should

be  subordinated is this: it is not redistribution

of  wealth but the creation of wealth that  should

be  our  major and relentless concern. This  is  a

concept  which has never occurred to us and  which

has never entered either into the minds of workers

or  employers. Anything that hampers  and  retards

the  creation  of wealth must be checked,  however

unpopular and however painful this may be. But the

hard facts of economic life leave us with no other

choice. You cannot evade these hard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



facts. The cost of evading them, as many countries

have  discovered,  is certain  disaster.  This  is

obvious,   if   you   keep  on  distributing   and

redistributing  the same amount  of  wealth  among

more  and  more people - because in Singapore  the

population  is increasing at a rapid rate  -  what

you  get is not a more prosperous people but  more

and more poor people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of redistribution becomes real and

meaningful  only after you have created sufficient

wealth,  additional  wealth.  Then  redistribution

makes  for a genuine increase in living standards.

Raising  wages  and maintaining welfare  standards

unrelated  to  the  level of economic  development

results in spurious prosperity. When wages  go  up

in  a  poor  country, as it has often  been  done,

prices go up and the worker is precisely where  he

was  before. It is no use trying to ward this  off

by  price  controls.  Experience  has  shown  that

attempts    at   price   controls   under    these

circumstances in developing countries have  merely

paved  the  way  for more corruption  and  rampant

speculation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only practical way of raising living

standards and bringing about genuine prosperity is

by  creating  more  and more  wealth.  This  means

producing more and consuming less than we produce.

We  must  save enough to invest in more factories,

more enterprises to produce more wealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the affluent and advanced countries of today,

whether  Communist  or non-Communist,  had  to  go

through  a  long  period of  heart-breaking  toil,

discipline   and  sacrifice  -  and   very   often

unimaginable   horrors   associated    with    the

industrial revolution in Europe - before they made

the  grade. Sometimes we forget that every country

which   is   advanced,  every  country  which   is

prosperous  today,  paid a  heavy  price.  It  was

accompanied  by  exploitation,  injustice,   child

labour,  long hours of work. I would  advise  hon.

Members  to read the history of modernisation  and

industrialisation in Europe, in the Soviet  Union,

in America and in Japan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



They  would  then begin to realise  what  a  heavy

price,  an  almost intolerable price, people  have

had to pay for modernisation and advance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These countries which are now judged as affluent,

as  advanced, were lucky in that they embarked  on

modernisation  and  industrialisation  when  there

were   no   trade   unions  and   no   Parliament.

Modernisation  in  most  of  these  countries  was

pushed  through by dictators, autocratic  monarchs

or  elites who were not dependent on popular vote.

So they could extract the price for modernisation,

sometimes  an  inhuman  price  for  modernisation,

knowing full well that there were no trade  unions

or  Parliament  to call them to  account.  In  the

Soviet  Union, if you were to read its history  in

the  early days of industrialisation, two  million

were  deliberately left to starve to  death.  That

was   the  price  that  even  a  workers'  country

demanded, that workers must pay for modernisation.

In  China  more recently, there was a  case  where

three  and a half million people were deliberately

allowed  to starve to death because there  was  no

choice.  That  was the only way that  China  could

make  the  advance that she had made  so  quickly,

especially in the fields of industrialisation  and

modernisation of agriculture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we in Singapore have to proceed with our

modernisation and industrialisation at a time when

we   have  well-developed  trade  unions   and   a

democratically   elected  Parliament.   We   must,

therefore,   undertake  the  difficult   task   of

bringing about industrialisation and modernisation

with  popular support. This is our problem. For  a

small  island we have to force the pace not  under

conditions  where we have not got to bother  about

trade  unions or Parliament, but where we have  to

bother about both. And maybe this is a good  thing

because then we may be able to avoid some  of  the

unnecessary  injustices, hardships and brutalities

that     accompanied     industrialisation     and

modernisation in some of the now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



advanced  countries.  But we  cannot  do  this  if

political   leaders,  trade  union   leaders   and

entrepreneurs are not themselves inspired  by  the

philosophy  of development. They must  be  passion

ately  convinced  of  the  need  for  development.

Belief in this must permeate their being and their

thinking.  It  must become a part of their  being,

part  of  their way of life. The need for economic

growth  or  development must become an  insatiable

hunger  -if you like, a religion. If you read  the

history   of  industrialisation  in  Europe,   for

example, in Britain, especially during the Puritan

and Victorian era, work became a religion. To save

was to glorify God. That was the Protestant ethic.

To live frugally, to practise thrift, to work hard

-   that   was   the  belief  that  inspired   the

industrialisation,    the    entrepreneurs,    the

capitalists in Europe and most of Western  Europe.

If  we want to develop a meaningful philosophy  of

development, then we must bring to this  task  the

same measure of courage, dedication and discipline

that we brought to the anti-colonial struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the other fears and doubts that the

trade  union leaders might have in regard  to  the

proposed  Employment Bill, I would  urge  them  to

consider  seriously what it is that they  want  in

terms   of   priority.  Do  they   want   economic

development  and  economic  growth,  whatever  the

cost?  If you read the Bill, however, it does  not

put up the cost so high as to make it intolerable.

But  do  you  say,  "Whatever the  cost,  we  want

economic  growth."? In a way, Sir, trade  unionism

and  parliamentary democracy for us  have  been  a

distortion of history. As I have said earlier,  in

Europe industrialisation came first and out of the

struggle   parliamentary   democracy   and   trade

unionism  grew  naturally.  So,  as  the   economy

developed, trade unions also developed and  became

more  mature  and  more  powerful.  But  here  the

history is just the reverse. We get Parliament and

trade  unions first. And then we start on economic

development and industrialisation. There has  been

a reversal, a distortion of history, not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



necessarily a bad thing provided trade  unionists,

employers  and  political leaders understand  that

there has been a distortion which we must correct.

And  therefore  they must come to the  problem  of

industrial and economic development with  a  sense

of  understanding and responsibility of what it is

that is happening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, since we have to do this in a

democratic  way  with the consent and  support  of

trade  unions and employers, we must develop  this

almost religious fervour for development. They  do

it  in  the Communist countries. They make work  a

religion.  Stakonovite - a people's  worker.  They

glorify work. If you are in China, or in Russia in

the early days, any worker who said, "Why should I

work  52  hours?  Why  not 50  hours?",  would  be

considered  a  heretic. If you want  to  make  the

grade,  if you show that only by working 52  hours

you  can catch up with the West, the Germans,  the

imperialists, then you work 52 hours. So you get a

Stakonovite coming and proving that a man can work

55 hours, and he becomes a hero.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only when leaders develop this philosophy

and  fervour that they can transmit some of  their

fervour  to  the people and make them  work-minded

and   development-minded.  Only  then,  when   the

leaders  show this, will the people willingly  put

up  with  the difficulties and hardships necessary

to complete the task of modernisation and economic

development. But if the leaders are weak, if  they

have   no  faith  in  the  necessity  of  economic

development  in the imperative need  for  economic

development, if they are cowardly, if they  choose

the  easy way out, then Singapore goes the way  of

many other new nations. But if they are courageous

and  determined, then I think that ten  to  twenty

years from now, those who come after us will  say,

"Thank God, in the hour of need Singapore did  not

lack  real leaders. Because of them, because  they

did  not  flinch  before the  challenge,  we  have

survived and prospered."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is the choice in so far as we want to

assume leadership. And I assume that those  of  us

who come to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



this   Chamber  have  put  forward  ourselves   as

leaders, not leaders for tomorrow or the day after

tomorrow, not leaders of their constituencies, but

leaders  who in five to ten years will be regarded

as an asset, as leaders and patriots, because they

did not flinch from the challenge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that Singapore will not go the way

of  other new nations. I am confident we can  make

the grade. A well-known Swedish economist recently

classified  nations  into  two  categories:   hard

nations  and soft nations. I think that  Singapore

is  not  a  soft nation. Now we have to  prove  to

ourselves and the world that we are a hard nation.
