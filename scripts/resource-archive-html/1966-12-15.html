these  two  institutions  to subsidise  their  students

studying:  in these two institutions. In  the  case  of

Nanyang  University, the cost of maintaining a  student

per  year is approximately $2,000 at present, while the

fees  payable by a Malaysian student are only $720  per

annum. In other words, the Government and the people of

Singapore  are  currently subsidising  every  Malaysian

student to the tune of $1,300 per year.

he  has  information  (a)  how  many  students  in  the

Malaya; and (b) how much financial aid is given by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



the Malaysian Government to the University of Singapore

and  by  the Singapore Government to the University  of

Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are 641

students  from West Malaysia studying at the University

of Singapore, and 86 Singapore students studying at the

University  of  Malaya.  The Malaysian  Government  has

never   given  to  the  University  of  Singapore   any

financial  aid as such. Any contribution  made  by  the

Malaysian  Government was in respect  of  the  cost  of

educating  Malaysian students studying in the Singapore

University.  Similarly, the Singapore  Government  also

made  contributions to the University of Malaya to meet

the cost of educating our students there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the separation of the then University of

Malaya  into  two separate universities, the  Singapore

Government  and  the  Federation of  Malaya  Government

jointly   contributed  on  an  agreed  formula  towards

defraying  the  cost  of running the  University  which

serves  students from both territories. The outstanding

contributions from the Malaysian Government, on  behalf

of   their  students  studying  in  the  University  of

Singapore  for  the years 1962 to 1966, were  discussed

and  concluded at official level recently and  official

confirmation is awaited from the Malaysian  Government.

As  a result of these discussions, a sum of $20 million

was  accepted  as the liability for Malaysian  students

studying  in  the University of Singapore  between  the

years 1962 and 1966. Of this, an advance payment of $10

million  was  made  in  December  1965.  The  Singapore

Government   also  agreed  to  settle   in   full   all

outstanding  dues  and claims on  behalf  of  Singapore

students studying in the University of Malaya.  In  the

case  of  Singapore students studying in the University

of  Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, the contributions have been

outstanding   for  the  years  1964   to   1966.   This

settlement,   when   confirmed,   will   conclude   all

outstanding  inter-University financial matters  up  to

the  end  of  this year. For 1967 it has been  proposed

that a joint Treasury Committee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



be set up to re-examine all contributions to the

two  Universities  by the respective Governments  on  a

revised  basis  reflecting  present-day  conditions.  I

understand this proposal has been favourably received.

whether   it  has  been  fully  implemented;  (ii)   to

the  aforesaid Federation; and (iii) to recommend  ways

and means of settling all grievances within the context

of   a   thorough  re-organisation  of  public  service

departments,  particularly the Cleansing Department  of

the  Ministry  of Health, with the view  to  increasing

productivity and efficiency of the public services.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> I am sure the Member for Bras Basah, as

Secretary-General of the N.T.U.C., is  aware  that  the

Commission  of  Inquiry,  set  up  in  1963  under  the

chairmanship   of  the  Commissioner  for   Labour   to

investigate  the allegations by the Federation  on  the

non-implementation  of  the  1961  Agreement,  made   a

thorough  study of the matter and has made a number  of

specific recommendations. All these recommendations  of

the   Commission  were  accepted  and  implemented   by

Government. There were a number of disputed  grades  on

which even the Commission was not in a position to make

direct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



recommendations  and, as the Member is  aware,  on  the

instructions of the Prime Minister, steps were taken to

try  to  effect a speedy remedy. Settlement was reached

on  a  number of these disputed grades. A few remaining

disputed  grades and grievance procedure  were  amongst

the  subjects which the representatives of the N.T.U.C.

and the Federation discussed with the Prime Minister on

6th  December. The Prime Minister has indicated at  the

meeting  that  there could be further  negotiations  on

these  outstanding matters, failing which  the  matters

could  be  referred  to  him for  a  settlement.  As  a

Commission  of Inquiry was appointed in  1963  to  look

into  the  matter which the Member for Bras  Basah  has

raised,  I do not see any reason for another Commission

of Inquiry to be appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a thorough re-organisation of public

service  departments to settle grievances,  the  Member

knows  that  a grievance procedure was the  subject  of

discussion between Government, the Federation  and  the

N.T.U.C, as  a  result of instructions  of  the  Prime

Minister to which I have referred. Proposals for a fair

and reasonable grievance procedure which does not block

or  hinder  management are already with the  Federation

and the N.T.U.C. As far as the Cleansing Department  of

the Ministry of Health is concerned, the Prime Minister

informed the N.T.U.C. and the Federation at the meeting

on  6th  December  that  a two-shift  system  would  be

introduced as from 3rd January, 1967, with  a  view  to

increasing  the  efficiency and  productivity  of  that

Department. This would also enable cleansing workers to

enjoy  Sundays and public holidays as days of  rest  in

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of increasing productivity and efficiency

of  the  public  service cannot be resolved  without  a

fundamental change in the discipline and supervision of

the  workers and the attitude of labour leaders towards

productivity and efficiency. Unless there  is  a  basic

desire  by  workers to relate earnings to  productivity

and efficiency, it will not be possible to achieve the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



objective.  The basic economic and financial  realities

facing  the Republic in the next two years demand  that

income  may only be increased when it is earned through

efficiency and productivity.

<div align="center"><b>TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND ZEBRA CROSSINGS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister of State

(Prime Minister's Department) if he will consider (a)

the installation of traffic lights at the junctions  of

(i)  Kampong Bahru Road/Keppel Road/Telok Blangah  Road

and   (ii)  Nelson  Road/Keppel  Road;  and   (b)   the

establishment of zebra crossings at Telok Blangah  Road

(i)  in  front of Gate No. 10 and (ii) in front of  the

Kampong Jagoh Malay School.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the volume of traffic along Keppel Road is fairly

heavy, whereas it is negligible on Kampong Bahru  Road.

A "Halt" sign is installed along Kampong Bahru Road and

its  junction  with Keppel Road. Vehicles from  Kampong

Bahru Road can filter left into Keppel Road without any

difficulty at all. However, vehicles intending to  turn

right  into Keppel Road will have to wait for  a  short

while for a break in the flow of traffic, which is very

frequent, to negotiate a right turn. The expense to  be

incurred in installing a traffic light is not justified

and  it  is not proposed to install a traffic light  at

this junction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) (ii) Traffic Light at Nelson Road/Keppel Road



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A traffic light at Nelson Road/Keppel Road junction is

not proposed for similar reasons. The volume of traffic

is  even  more  negligible than that of  Kampong  Bahru

Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) (i) Zebra Crossing along Telok Blangah Road

outside Gate No. 10, Port of Singapore Authority



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of pedestrians crossing this road are the

P.S.A. workers. In the morning they cross the road  in

twos  and  threes;  but  in  the  evening,  since   the

employees finish work at the same time,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



about  200 to 300 persons cross the road opposite  this

gate.  This  crossing  takes  place  in  less  than  15

minutes,  and once the employees have gone  home,  very

few pedestrians cross the road at this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sufficient breaks in the flow of traffic to

allow  pedestrians  safe  crossing.  A  zebra  crossing

cannot  be located opposite Gate No. 10 because of  the

existing taxi stand and the S.T.C. bus terminus.  If  a

zebra  crossing  is to be located along  Telok  Blangah

Road, it will have to be located at least 300 feet away

from Gate No. 10 and the pedestrians will not take  the

trouble to walk all this distance to cross the road. It

is therefore not proposed to have a zebra crossing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) (ii) Zebra Crossing along Telok Blangah Road

outside Kampong Jagoh Malay School



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than students, the number of pedestrians

crossing Keppel Road is very negligible - an occasional

villager crossing the road to the bus stop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A school crossing patrolman is employed at this school

to assist the children in crossing the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, there is no justification in

providing a zebra crossing.

<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed from the Suggestion Book in the Library that

in 1961 a Member did suggest that the Library acquire a

set  of  Encyclopaedia Britannica, but this  suggestion

was  turned  down  by the then House  Committee,  by  a

majority, but without giving any reasons. Possibly  the

then  House Committee consisted of Members who  had  no

use for reference books!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will agree with me that the

present  stock  of  books  in  the  Library  is  hardly

adequate.  This lack of reference material hampers  the

work  of  hon. Members, and this year's estimate  of  a

miserable sum of $800 is hardly sufficient to meet  the

situation.  From a cursory look into the  estimates  on

the  book  votes  for other departments,  most  of  the

departments,  however minor, appear to  have  a  larger

vote for books than Parliament. I will just give a  few

examples: the book vote for Postal Services, $920;  for

Civil  Aviation, $2,000; for the Trade Division, $1,250

and  for the Foreign Ministry, $6,000. This small  vote

for  books  for  Parliament is  surely  an  unnecessary

handicap  to  Members and I strongly urge the  Minister

for Finance to remedy it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I myself am in sympathy with the  Member

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



Choa  Chu  Kang  when  he found  that  our  Library  is

inadequate for his own needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are happy indeed to have an active Member like him

who   will  possibly  make  suggestions  to  the  House

Committee on the types of books which he thinks Members

of  Parliament ought to read to improve the standard of

their  debate and the amount of information which  they

ought  to  acquire. However, I would like to point  out

that  the Librarian is always at the service of Members

of  Parliament, and if there are Members  who  wish  to

obtain  books for their reading which are not available

in  the  Library here, she would be only too  happy  to

secure  them  from  the  National  Library.  We   must,

however, remember that we do not wish to duplicate  the

National  Library in Parliament House  and,  therefore,

the  Library in Parliament House is a specialised  one.

The  books  which  we  find in our  Library  are  those

relating  to constitutional law, Keesing's Contemporary

Archives  which  give  you  an  up-to-date  account  of

current  events,  and  there are many  other  forms  of

literature which I am quite sure will be very useful to

all  those  Members who wish to extract information  to

help them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as books on economics, commerce, maybe

accountancy too or the social sciences are concerned, I

myself  have felt that we are lacking in these,  and  I

hope  the  House Committee can put forward  suggestions

and make recommendations to the Ministry of Finance.  I

am   quite  sure  the  Minister  for  Finance  will  be

sympathetic   and   grant   the   House   Committee   a

supplementary  vote next year if it is found  that  the

vote  in  this  Budget is inadequate.  As  far  as  the

encyclopaedias    --- Encyclopaedia    Britannica     or

Encyclopaedia  of social sciences or  any  type  -  are

concerned, I am in agreement with the Member  for  Choa

Chu Kang that we could very well do with these books as

they are very useful sources of information.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To end, I only hope that all Members of Parliament

will   put  forward  their  suggestions  to  the  House

Committee  on how the Library position can be  improved

and we will look at them with sympathy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I know what are these President's

Scholarships, for whom and why are they under the name

of the President?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in former days there used to be scholarships open

to candidates on the basis of competitive examinations,

and  the  winners  of  these  scholarships  were  given

sufficient  funds  to travel to almost  any  university

where  they wished to receive training. We decided,  as

from 1966, to reinstitute these scholarships which were

previously   known   as  Queen's  Scholarships.   These

scholarships,  which were highly prized  by  successive

generations of students, were instrumental in getting a

small corps of able and highly-trained men into several

of the professions then open. With the establishment of

the  University  of Singapore, these scholarships  were

transferred to the University to be used by way of post-graduate courses. However, my colleagues and I have for

some time been rather concerned with the problems which

have not altogether been resolved in the University, in

throwing  up  people  who not only  have  the  academic

training   and   intellectual  discipline,   but   also

qualities  of  leadership and an  interest  in  matters

outside  their particular field of discipline. We  have

therefore  reinstituted this scholarship at the  Higher

School Certificate level and all winners of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



scholarship,  of which there are nine  this  year,  can

choose  to go to any university to which they  can  get

admission,  and  their expenses  will  be  met  by  the

Government.  They are known as President's Scholars  to

denote  that  they  are  people  who  have  won  signal

distinction for themselves to merit special  privileges

for  further  education.  As a  rule,  the  President's

Scholar  is usually able to get some other scholarship.

In  fact, what happens is that he gets all his fees and

expenses  met  by some other scholarship which  he  has

won,  and  in  the end is granted an allowance  of  £50

sterling  per annum in addition to the other allowances

that  he  gets. In this way, it is hoped to continue  a

supply of men not only well qualified and competent  in

their  own fields of study but with all the social  and

other  graces  which make for the difficult  to  define

quality called leadership.

already  been  given by the Minister  for  Law  in  his

statement on the Modification of Laws (Constitution  of

Singapore) Order, 1966. As a result of Singapore coming

apart  from Malaysia, it is now necessary for any child

born outside Singapore to a Singapore citizen to decide

within  one year of attaining the age of 21 whether  or

not  to  opt  for  citizenship. If he wishes  to  be  a

Singapore  citizen,  then he  must  take  the  oath  of

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I want to ask just one question. Just

now  our Prime Minister has mentioned that there  is  a

grant  of  £50  sterling per annum  attached  to  these

President's Scholars; for example, those who won  other

scholarships    besides   winning    the    President's

scholarship. I think £50 per annum would be round about

$425  Singapore  currency. So in my view,  to  win  the

President's scholarship is, in fact, a high honour to a

brilliant  student. I was wondering how  this  £50  per

annum  would help towards maintaining a student in  the

pursuit of his studies in a university.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am afraid I may not have

made   myself  sufficiently  clear.  There   are   nine

scholarships  open to the nine best students  from  the

H.S.C. classes of all language streams. The winners  of

these  scholarships can choose to go to any  university

anywhere in the world to which they can gain admission.

If  they  do not gain any other scholarship,  then  the

Government  will pay their passage to that  university,

their tuition fees, and their subsistence cost. But the

students  who win these scholarships usually  also  win

other scholarships, and when they do that, as a mark of

distinction over and above the other students who  have

won  similar  scholarships, they get an additional  £50

per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that any student anywhere in the

world can survive on £50 per annum, but the £50 is only

given  to  the  student who has,  before  he  gets  the

President's scholarship, already qualified



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



for some other scholarship. Then, by virtue  of

his  getting the President's scholarship,  he  gets  an

extra £50.

London  and that the Government is still continuing  to

contribute  towards its running expenses. I  have  very

vivid memories of my stay in Malaysia Hall. It was then

called Malaya Hall. This is a place where students from

both  Singapore  and  West  Malaysia  -  the  whole  of

Malaysia, in  fact  -  can meet in  an  atmosphere  of

goodwill and discuss the problems confronting  them  in

their studies as well as their other problems. It would

be  a matter for regret, Mr Speaker, Sir, if Singapore

students  and Malaysian students so far away are  being

separated. The decision to separate them, however,  may

not  be within the control of our Government. But as  I

have  said, I am glad that the Government is continuing

to  support the running of the Hall, and I do urge  the

Government that, as long as it could do so,  it  should

continue to support it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is a subject which has drawn

considerable  comment from other political  leaders  in

bare facts. The Singapore Government paid for one-third

of the capital



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



cost in acquiring the premises of Malaysia Hall, and we

have   since  then  paid  one-third  of  the  recurrent

expenditure  annually  for  its  upkeep.  We  shall  be

prepared to do this till the end of time, perhaps until

such  time  as  the  building  needs  rebuilding.   But

whatever  it is, we are in equity - owners of one-third

of  Malaysia  Hall.  I  believe it  used  to  be  three

separate  buildings which are now joined into one,  and

we   pay   for   one-third  of  its  annual   recurrent

expenditure.

of  industries also increases and needs workers of high

calibre. If the Government wants Malay children to have

high qualifications in order that they can compete with

non-Malays,  whether in education or other fields,  and

also  wants  an increasing number of Malays to  receive

higher education, then it should increase the vote  for

1967.  Instead,  it has been reduced. Could  the  Prime

Minister  explain the reason for the reduction  in  the

vote for 1967 as compared with 1966?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the short and direct answer

to  the query posed by the Member for Kampong Kembangan

is  that  a  number  of bursaries  to  certain  Nanyang

University  students  have been cancelled.  We  provide

bursaries to our students in order that they will  make

a  contribution to higher learning, higher  discipline,

and  ultimately a higher level of economic activity  in

our  country. But when students take advantage of these

facilities not in order to promote the welfare  of  the

community but to bring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



into  disrepute the institutions of higher learning  to

which they gain admission, then I think it is the  duty

of the Government to terminate these bursaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to point out to Members generally that

there  is  a  distinction between a scholarship  and  a

bursary.  I have pointed out that the best of  all  the

scholarships  which  we  give  are  now  known  as  the

President's scholarships. A scholarship is  awarded  on

the basis of merit regardless of the financial standing

of  the parents of the student. But if all students can

get  assistance  only on the basis of  higher  academic

performance,  then a large body of very good  but  less

than   brilliant   students  would   be   denied   this

opportunity. Therefore, a large number of students  are

given  assistance by what are known as  bursaries.  For

the  award of a bursary, other considerations,  besides

just academic competence, are taken into consideration.

First,  the  financial capacity of the parents  of  the

student;  second, the subject which the student  wishes

to  pursue.  If the subject is one which is  likely  to

make a contribution to our society, then a bursary will

be  more readily forthcoming. The amount of the bursary

given  to  the  student will depend upon the  financial

resources  of his parents. The wealthier the parent  or

the more he can afford, the less the State will assist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Malay students, I would like to point out that

we  are  continuing our policy of giving free education

from  primary  school to university  to  all  Singapore

citizens  who  are Malays and can obtain  admission  to

these  institutions of learning. The reduction  in  the

sum in no way affects the number of pupils who will  be

getting  scholarships or bursaries from Malay secondary

schools to higher institutions of learning.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of giving the House some idea of the spread of

these  bursaries and scholarships, may I  just  briefly

give   the   round  total  figures  for   the   various

institutions   for  this  year:  146  awards   to   the

University of Singapore, making a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



total  of  472; 3 awards to the University  of  Malaya,

making  a  total  of 23; 77 awards to the  Polytechnic,

making a total of 186; 97 awards to Nanyang University,

making a total of 235; 10 to Ngee Ann College, making a

total of 119; 40 to the Singapore Vocational Institute,

making  a  total  of  59; 20 to the Teachers'  Training

College,  making  a  total of 20 -  there  had  been  no

previous awards to the Teachers' Training College. This

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, needless to say, this vote is designed to

curb  corruption in our Republic. It  is  a  cause  for

regret that this vote has failed to achieve its desired

object.  It  is  known that recently applications  were

invited  for  the  post of a driver.  The  vacancy  was

circulated   to  the  Transport  Centre  and   District

Offices. Amongst the applications was a casual labourer

from  Katong  District.  He  was  interviewed  and   he

succeeded in getting the job. On Sunday, 27th November,

1966,  he performed his normal duties as a labourer  in

Lorong  Melayu. A mandore handed him a note  requesting

him  to see the senior cleansing inspector, Mr  B.  D.

Raj,  to  get  his appointment letter as a  driver.  He

complied  with  the request. On Monday, 28th  November,

1966, at 6.20 am., he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



was  informed by his mandore, Inche Sukri, to meet  Mr

Raj and Mr Victor Ee Ah Soo at the coffee shop next to

Jalan Eunos market. Both Mr Raj and Mr Soo demanded a

deposit or an advance payment of $100 in order  to  get

his appointment as a driver confirmed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not wish in any way to curb

or restrict Members of this House from having their say

during  Budget time, but I must ask the Member who  has

raised  this particular head for discussion to  confine

himself   to   the  policy  of  the  Attorney-General's

Chambers.  I  have followed with considerable  interest

the details of this particular driver, but I would like

to  know from the Member how this affects the policy of

the Attorney-General's Chambers. If he will let me know

how  this affects it, then I will follow his story with

even greater interest and more understanding.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was waiting for the Member to develop

his   speech  a  little  further  before  drawing   his

attention  to this point. But I assume he is trying  to

relate  this  to  the Corrupt Practices  Investigation

Bureau.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He should have raised this

question then.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could the Member try to relate his

speech to this particular head of expenditure?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

merely  wish to prove how this particular head will  be

spent,  because this is an important vote and I do  not

wish to see corrupt practices being perpetuated in  our

Republic.  Nonetheless,  I am prepared  to  shorten  my

speech.  This  is not the only instance. If  we  cannot

improve the C.P.I.B., I believe corrupt practices  will

be perpetuated. I am quite sure the object of this vote

is to prevent or curb any corrupt practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Speaker, I also wish to quote many

other instances. There was the case of a store watchman

who  paid an illegal gratification of $400 for the  job

of mandore, and a painter who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



paid $300 to the same officer. A transport overseer was

deprived of his overtime work simply because he refused

to  pay  $100 to the officer concerned. That is what  I

want  to  say in Parliament so that the vote  for  1967

will be fully used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Raj used the Ministry's driver

and  labourer for his own ends to paint his  house  for

the Christmas season. I feel that we should delete this

vote if it is not used properly. This will help to  put

an end to corrupt practices. That is all I have to say.

If  this vote is approved by Parliament, I hope it will

be  used  to  curb corrupt practices.  As  I  mentioned

during  the  debate on the 1966 Budget  Speech  on  the

subject  of the Police Co-operative Society, it  is  at

present functioning smoothly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as you will have probably  noticed,  my

colleague, the Minister for Law, was not quite  himself

yesterday, being sort of disabled with his left foot in

a  plaster,  and he has been advised not to repeat  his

performance in the Chamber today, and so I am  replying

on his behalf.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to answer the Member for Kampong Kapor

that  one  of  the difficulties which face the  Corrupt

Practices Investigation Bureau is that there are always

rumours, statements which are not followed up with  the

reporting  and placing of such information  before  the

C.P.I.B.  The  Member has given enough  information  in

this  House of allegations of corruption which  appears

to be within my Ministry. I shall be very pleased if he

will go further and place this information before the

C.P.I.B.,  so  that we could then follow  up  with  the

necessary action once the investigation is completed. I

must  say that I have always encouraged members of  the

public,  whenever they have complaints  to  the  effect

that  there is corruption amongst our public officials,

to do so not verbally but in writing, which information

we  could then pass on to the C.P.I.B. I can assure the

Member for Kampong Kapor that we have had cases of such

written complaints being followed up, sometimes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



with success but sometimes without as much success as I

would  have wished. Once the C.P.I.B. report recommends

disciplinary  action to be taken,  even  though  it  is

dismissal,  the Ministry of Health has always  accepted

the   advice  and  the  official  concerned  has   been

dismissed  from the service ignominiously. So  I  would

seek the co-operation of the Member for Kampong Kapor

and ask him to supply all the necessary information  so

that the C.P.I.B. could follow up. I can assure him that

I will be very interested in this particular report.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As explained by the

Minister  for  Health just now, I will be  prepared  to

supply  further information. I wanted to  elaborate  in

detail, but I was pulled up by the Prime Minister. This

happened  to  one of the voters in Kampong  Kapor.  The

address is 27 Upper Weld Road. On the assurance of  the

Minister, I am prepared to report the matter fully.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I point out that it was I who pulled

you up and not the Prime Minister?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang:</b> I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0105 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2054.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is just for information only. Could the

Minister  explain  to  this  House  what  is  meant  by

"Special Services"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt

that  the  Member  for Aljunied is a man  who  is  very

curious about certain items in our Estimates. This item

of  "Special Services" which appears under the vote for

the   Corrupt   Practices   Investigation   Bureau   is

considered  not  quite  in the public  interest  to  be

discussed  on the advice of the Solicitor-General.  But

since  it has appeared in print. I think I will  go  as

far  as I can without endangering security. This  is  a

sum meant to meet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



contingencies,  such as the payment for information  to

agents  and  informers, and for other items  which  are

incidental   to  the  efficient  performance   of   the

functions of the C.P.I.B. I hope he will be prepared to

accept it as far as I have gone.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0105 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two points I wish to raise

on   the   general  policy  of  the  Attorney-General's

Chambers. The first point relates to the appointment of

newly-qualified persons to the Bench. We all know, Sir,

that a newly-qualified person -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tang, if you are speaking of

appointments to the Bench, I am afraid I will  have  to

rule you out of order, because that does not come under

this head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir. I

think  the  appointment of newly-qualified  persons  as

Magistrates and District Court Judges comes  under  the

Attorney-General's   Chambers   and   not   under   the

Judiciary.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Certainly not, Mr Tang. It comes under

the  Judiciary. Under the Attorney-General's  Chambers,

you  find  Senior State Counsel, State  Counsel,  Legal

Assistant  and so on, but not Magistrates  or  District

Court Judges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I abide by your ruling, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Was that the only matter in respect of

which you sought to speak under this head?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> It relates to such appointments,

Sir,  because my criticism is that they are being  left

in  one department for a very long time, and when  they

come  up  for  consideration for promotion  before  the

Legal Service Commission, the Commission would just say

that they have not had enough experience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If you can relate your remarks to "State

Counsel", I think you will be in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> As you please, Mr Speaker, Sir. I

think  I will now go on to the other point that I  have

got  to  make, and that is the policy of the  Attorney-General's Chambers to leave an officer in one post  for

a  considerable length of time without giving  him  the

benefit  of a transfer to other posts in order to  gain

experience. And then when he comes up before the  Legal

Service Commission for consideration for promotion,  he

would  be  faced with the difficulty that  he  has  not

gained  enough experience in other departments. Such  a

handicap  is not of his own making, and consequently  I

think  the Attorney-General's Chambers may do  well  to

consider amendments to this particular procedure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what has been

stated  by  the  Member for Choa Chu  Kang  is  readily

accepted,   that  is  to  say,  it  is  not  considered

advisable  to  leave  any  particular  officer  in  one

position  for too long a time. I think that  is  really

what the Legal Service Commission would not like to  do

in  regard  to the posting of officers. But  the  usual

reason  is,  because of the exigencies  of  service,  a

particular officer is left in the said post much longer

than  is considered desirable. I should have said  that

it  is the Attorney-General who is responsible for  the

postings  of  legal officers and not the Legal  Service

Commission.  I  hope  the  Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang

appreciates  the  fact  that I am  trying  to  act  for

another Minister at a moment's notice, and therefore  I

may not be au fait with all the procedure. The postings

and  transfers  of legal officers in the Legal  Service

are  jointly the responsibility of the Attorney-General

and  the  Chief  Justice  as Heads  of  the  Legal  and

Judicial Branches respectively. I can assure the Member

for  Choa  Chu Kang that if a particular legal  officer

has  been  kept  in  a  position much  longer  than  is

necessary,  when it comes to the question of promotion,

this  will not be held against him because it  was  not

within his control, and therefore adequate compensation

will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



made. Wherever possible, it is the view of the Attorney-General's Chambers to move officers around in order  to

give  them a well-rounded experience to assist them  in

their future work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> In view of the Minister's

assurance, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $916,090 for Head 0105 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0107 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1022.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* That the sum to be allocated for Head 0107 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1021.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, please allow me to pay tribute to the Court

interpreters   for  their  honesty  and  sincerity   in

performing their duties and for the useful role  played

by  them  in the judicial system. Unfortunately,  there

are  still some Court interpreters, particularly in the

Criminal and Traffic Courts, who are discharging  their

duties  in a manner that was prevalent in the  colonial

days. More often than not, suspects and accused persons

who  are  brought up before the Magistrates either  for

criminal   or  traffic  offences,  often   find   great

difficulty   in  expressing  themselves  properly   and

confidently.  This is partly due to some of  the  Court

interpreters  who speak in aggressive and harsh  tones,

thus  putting  fear and confusion into the  hearts  and

minds  of the witnesses in the dock. This is considered

highly improper and unsatisfactory, especially now that

we  are  a  Socialist Government, and we should  in  no

circumstances let the public think that there are still

some civil servants who think highly of themselves  and

act as if they are rulers. Suspects and accused persons

who are brought to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



court  on  trial should be allowed to speak freely  for

themselves through the Court interpreters and  let  the

law   take  its  own  course.  In  fact,  these   Court

interpreters should feel that they are in the Courts to

interpret  and  serve the public and not  to  persecute

them.  We leave this to the D.P.P. In this manner,  the

public  will appreciate that they are well assisted  by

the interpreters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may the Minister in charge consider setting up a

re-orientation course for all the Court interpreters so

that  they  may  give better service  and  be  able  to

discharge  their duties more efficiently to the  public

and in a manner more befitting our Socialist society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that

the Member for Mountbatten has started off by paying  a

tribute to the Court interpreters for their honesty and

sincerity in the performance of their duties. His  long

complaint  is  in respect of perhaps some  interpreters

who may be rude and discourteous to the public. I think

it may be said that ever since 1959 - seven years ago -

there  has been a great improvement in the conduct  and

behaviour of our officials in Government service.  With

the establishment of a Central Complaints Bureau, it is

possible,  if members of the public have any complaints

about   rude   behaviour  or  discourtesy   of   public

officials, for such cases to be investigated into.  And

also  the  fact  that Members of Parliament  have  been

dutifully holding their Meet-the-people sessions  where

members  of  the  public could lodge  their  complaints

personally   with   either   Members   of   Parliament,

Parliamentary  Secretaries and  Ministers.  Sir,  if  a

member  of  the public really feels that  he  has  been

unfairly  treated,  it  will  be  necessary  for   such

complaints  to  be  lodged not  just  verbally  but  in

writing. As in the case of corrupt practices, there has

always  been the difficulty that members of the  public

will  just make verbal complaints and expect things  to

be followed up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to answer the Member for

Mountbatten that if there are any particular  cases  of

rudeness  and  misbehaviour by public  officials,  such

allegations   should  be  made  in  writing   and,   if

necessary,   the   Member   of   Parliament   for   the

constituency concerned would be good enough  to  report

these  cases  directly to the Minister for Finance  who

is,  after  all, in charge of all Government  officials

throughout the State, or the Public Service Commission.

The  matter  could  then be taken  up  and,  after  due

investigation, if an official is really  found  guilty,

then  disciplinary action will be taken. I do not think

it  is  necessary to undergo what is  known  as  a  re-orientation  course  as suggested  by  the  Member  for

Mountbatten.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I shall report any complaints made

to  me  during  my  next  Meet-the-people  session.  Of

course,  complaints of this nature are  usually  beyond

the  ability  of Members of Parliament  to  deal  with,

apart  from bringing them to the notice of the  Central

Complaints Bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must thank the Minister concerned for his advice

and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I only want to seek clarification of

the provision of $43,200 for the maintenance of

Temasek, Kuala Lumpur, for the year 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May this House be informed whether the domestic staff

at  Temasek,  Kuala Lumpur, are Singapore  citizens  or

Malaysian  citizens? If they are Malaysian citizens,  I

do not see any reason why they should benefit from this

sum when Singapore citizens should, by every right,  be

entitled to benefit from the sum provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our citizens could easily replace the alien

domestic  staff.  May  I  know  whether  there  is  any

condition  or agreement whatsoever with regard  to  the

employment  of  Malaysian citizens  in  Temasek,  Kuala

Lumpur?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it so happens

that  the staff employed by Temasek, Kuala Lumpur,  are

Malaysian citizens because they had been employed there

for  several years even before we were in Malaysia.  It

was  found  more convenient to employ people  who  were

already,  so  to  speak, at hand, if  there  should  be

further  expansion in the domestic staff  of  our  High

Commission there, we shall bear in mind what  has  been

said by the Member for Mountbatten and perhaps some  of

our  own citizens can be posted for duty there.  But  I

think  it  would  serve very little purpose  in  making

painful  adjustments now by getting rid of satisfactory

domestic staff just because they happen to be Malaysian

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I am on this subject, I might also add for the

benefit  of the Member for Bras Basah, that  the  Rolls

Royce he mentioned as having been acquired by the Prime

Minister's Office was, in fact,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



acquired  by the former High Commissioner for Singapore

in  Kuala Lumpur. It was part of his own purchases, and

when  he  passed  away, his executors,  who,  I  think,

include his wife, decided that they had no use  for  it

and  they have donated it to the Government for the use

of the Ministers. It is in the motor car pool.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member for Bras Basah - I.

know what he has in his mind, that if we have money for

Rolls  Royces, then surely we can give a dollar  a  day

more  to  all the Public Daily-Rated Employees'  Unions

Federation - that we have not got money to throw around

on  Rolls Royces, that we do not intend to throw  money

around  on Rolls Royces, and, in fact, even if we  did,

it  would not impress anybody in Singapore at all.  But

it  so happens that in this particular case, our former

High  Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur thought it might  be

in  keeping  with his duties there if he  had  a  Rolls

Royce. But by an unfortunate turn of events, it is  now

of no value to the family and it has landed in the pool

for cars for official use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may just add, in case there is any lingering doubt

in the mind of the Member for Bras Basah, that there is

no money to give away at $1 per day to the Public Daily-Rated Employees or anybody else in this country.

criticise the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



for its lack of courage and initiative  in  not

having  a clear policy on the operation and development

of the public road passenger transport system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nationalise it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Sir, from time to time, we hear

statements from the Government on an ad hoc basis in an

endeavour to improve the road transport system for  the

travelling public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unsatisfactory and inefficient road transport

system  goes back to 1955 when a Commission of  Inquiry

into the public passenger transport system of Singapore

sat  and  made  recommendations. Nothing  was  done  to

implement  seriously the Report of this Commission  for

various obvious reasons. I can understand that at  that

time,  because of the labour situation, the then  David

Marshall Government and the Lim Yew Hock Government did

not dare pursue the recommendations of this Commission.

But I myself do not feel that the leaders of the P.A.P.

lack courage or initiative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few months ago, the Prime Minister was present

at  the  general  meeting  of  the  Singapore  Traction

Company   Employees'  Union.  He  made  a   very   good

suggestion to the workers that it is our policy to give

confidence  to  the company, otherwise it  may  operate

somewhere  else. I assume that the Prime  Minister  was

asking  the workers not to ask for a bonus and  not  to

give  trouble  so that the company may have  confidence

and  stable conditions to operate its buses. But I feel

that  this  confidence  is not  sufficient,  because  a

greater  part  of the confidence should come  from  the

Government  by its making a clear policy on the  future

development of the road transport system; otherwise  no

organisations  will  put  in  any  capital  for  future

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the meeting of the Singapore Traction Company

Employees' Union, the Prime Minister also dwelt on  the

unification of the road transport system. He said  that

we  could unify the road transport system in ten years,

but that we could not do it now, and that we must do it

step  by  step.  I fully agree with his statement.  But

where do we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



start  from?  Which  step shall we  take?  If  we  take

positive measures now to participate in the running  of

the  road transport system, we may achieve that  target

within five to ten years.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was some 10 years ago that the Report of the

Commission   of  Inquiry  into  the  Public   Passenger

Transport  System  made  certain  recommendations,  and

unless  we take some positive measures, I do  not  feel

that in 10 years we can rectify our transport system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, early this year the Managing

Director  of  the  Singapore Traction  Company  made  a

statement  in  the  Straits  Times  of  21st  February,

drawing  our  attention  to the threat  to  Singapore's

transport system. One of the reasons he put forward was

that  public transport was not functioning well because

of  pirate taxis. He urged the Government to take  firm

action   and  introduce  legislation  to  rectify   the

situation.  I  would say, Sir, that the  bus  companies

themselves  have a lot to be blamed for this  state  of

affairs. During the good old days when they were making

money,  some of the independent bus companies,  instead

of   ploughing  their  profits  back  into  their  road

transport  system  to improve it, have  diverted  their

profits into building and development investments. As a

result,  when times are not so good and the  population

expands, we find that our road transport is inadequate.

Pirate  taxis thrive on this situation because the  bus

companies   are   unable  to   satisfy   the   public's

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the responsibility of the

Government  to  ensure that there is  in  operation  an

efficient and economical transport system. I feel it is

its duty to participate in this public utility which, I

believe,  is  the only utility still left,  except  for

licensing, in the hands of private enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Managing Director of the

Singapore Traction Company raised his complaints in the

Straits Times, the then Permanent Secretary attached to

the Deputy Prime Minister's Office, Mr S. T. Stewart,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



replied  in the Straits Tunes of 24th February  to  the

complaints.  He  suggested a  pooling  arrangement,  as

practised  by  the airlines, for the bus  companies.  I

believe  a  meeting was initiated by  the  Minister  of

State  for  the  Prime  Minister's Department  in   the

Ministry of Law's Conference Room on 11th March, 1966.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, under Standing Order 43 you

have about two minutes more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I think the House would like to

know   from   the  Minister  of  State  what   happened

subsequent  to  that meeting. As time is  running  out,

Sir,  I  will only say this. Yesterday, the Member  for

Choa   Chu   Kang  was  advocating  nationalising   the

transport industry. I am not supporting his suggestion,

but I would call upon the Government to participate  in

the  running  of  the  road transport  system,  because

without  its participation, it is not possible  to  get

the independent bus companies together. I would suggest

that the nucleus of this participation should come from

the Traction Company.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to

associate myself with the sentiments expressed  by  the

Member for River Valley on the subject. Not only  that,

Mr  Speaker,  the Registrar of Vehicles should  ensure

that  adequate  buses be supplied for  any  new  route

granted  to a bus company in Singapore. Some  of  these

bus  companies, after having been granted a new  route,

cannot  provide adequate buses to meet the requirements

of  the  Registrar.  As an example,  Mr  Speaker,  the

Registrar issued a licence to Route Service No. 12  and

Route  Service No. 12A. The company which  was  granted

the  licence took away some of the buses from Route No.

12 and placed them on Route No. 12A. Naturally the bus

service  on Route No. 12 becomes inadequate. This  will

encourage  members of the public to make use of  pirate

taxis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a bus company has an adequate fleet of buses at its

disposal,  complaints by it against pirate  taxis  will

not  arise. If it cannot offer an adequate bus  service

there will be a long waiting interval for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



passengers  who will naturally complain  about  it.  So

they  will make use of any kind of transport. If  there

are  pirate  taxis,  they will use them.  I  hope,  Mr

Speaker,  that there will be ways and means to regulate

the  issue  of bus routes to bus companies  and  ensure

that  such  companies will be able to  supply  adequate

buses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that the

hon.  Member for River Valley does not support my  idea

of  nationalising the public transport system. He wants

the  Government to participate financially, I  suppose.

But I wonder what his ideas are about participation. Is

he  thinking that Government should just go in and have

a   financial  share  in  the  bus  companies   without

achieving  a  major  degree of shareholding  so  as  to

control  the  policy of bus companies  and  also  their

general running?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley has also said that the

public  bus  transport system is, in fact, one  of  the

public  utilities. If he is of that opinion, why should

he  be so afraid of the idea of Government taking  over

the  running  of  the  system  altogether?  To  have  a

rational traffic system, I think the whole question  of

roads  and  transport system must be  looked  at  as  a

whole. We cannot just resolve the traffic problem today

without  looking  into  the  whole  system  of   public

transport  vis-a-vis  private cars.  For  example,  our

roads are now chock-full of private cars and the number

of cars is on the increase day by day. We are now doing

our  utmost to solve this road traffic problem,  but  I

feel  that  the  attempts  are  somewhat  ad  hoc   and

piecemeal and there is no overall planning to solve it.

I  think  that  the  public transport  system  and  the

traffic problem must be looked at as a whole. In  order

to  solve  the traffic problem, we may have to  have  a

more rational public transport system.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether what I am going to say is far too

bold  for  the  liking of the Government. For  example,

possibly we can exclude private vehicles from the  city

centre.  But this cannot be done without our having  an

efficient and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



rational  public transport system, because  if  private

cars  are excluded from the city centre, there must  be

some other means of transport to convey workers to work

and back to their homes. I, therefore, recommend to the

Government  that while the public transport  system  at

present  is a problem, they should not look  at  it  in

isolation but should consider it in connection with the

whole system of vehicular transport in the island.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I wish to thank  hon.

Members  of Parliament for showing an interest  in  the

problem of public transport in our State. We admit that

it  is  a complicated one. Several things have happened

since  this Department was put under the charge of  the

Central  Government over a period of two  years.  After

one  year  of independence, several transport  problems

have  emerged.  For  that reason,  we  have  set  up  a

committee,  headed  by Mr Milton Tan,  to  tackle  the

transport  problem.  Unfortunately,  we  did  not   see

Members appearing to give representation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar drew my attention to the

S.T.C. and other bus companies. I feel that this  is  a

complicated matter, because it involves legislation and

also finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to uniform legislation, there are at

present  two  main  sets of legislation  governing  the

operation  of  bus  companies.  One  is  the  Singapore

Traction  Company Ordinance, and the other is the  Road

Traffic  Ordinance,  under  which  the  other  10   bus

companies operate. Hence, a committee has been  set  up

to  consider proposals for uniform legislation for  the

bus  companies in Singapore. As I have said earlier on,

the  implications involve legal and financial problems.

Therefore,  it will necessarily take some  time  before

any concrete proposals can be put forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the pooling of the bus services

referred  to just now by the Member for River Valley - I

am  referring to the pooling of services of the  S.T.C.

and other bus companies  which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



has  been  requested  - tentative proposals  have  been

submitted.  A  committee has been set  up  by  the  bus

companies. These proposals for the pooling of  services

are  being  studied by the Omnibus Licensing  Authority

and  the  Registrar of Vehicles. It means,  in  effect,

that my Ministry is taking active steps to resolve this

complicated problem of our public transport  system.  I

wish to be frank with hon. Members who have an interest

in  this  matter.  My Ministry is prepared  to  receive

constructive criticisms, as a result of which  we  will

be  in  a  better position to resolve this  problem.  I

welcome  at  any  time  constructive  suggestions   and

criticisms  from  Members who  are  familiar  with  the

transport system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I just want to say that the

Minister of State has not touched upon the Traffic Unit

that  has  been  set  up  in the Ministry  of  National

Development  to look into the question  of  traffic  in

Singapore as a whole. He has not replied to my  general

question,  that is, Government should not consider  the

problem  of  public transport in isolation, but  should

consider  the  question  of vehicular  traffic  in  the

island  as  a  whole. At present, it would appear  that

this  Traffic Unit that has been set up is bogged  down

with  details  and  that it is just  tinkering  with  a

little  bit  of  diversion here and an overhead  bridge

there  without  going  into  the  whole  problem  of  a

rationalised system of vehicular traffic in the  island

as  a  whole. I see that they are cutting away half  of

Orchard  Road  Circus - in fact, cutting down  all  the

greens  now.  This may be able to relieve  the  traffic

along  Orchard  Road, but it does not solve  the  basic

problem of vehicular traffic in Singapore as a whole. I

would urge the Government to look into this problem.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, may I supplement what

the  Minister of State has said in reply to the Members

who  have  raised  the question of the desirability  of

nationalising  bus  transport?  The  Member  for  River

Valley thought that the Government should be courageous

enough to embark upon such a venture. I would only  say

that in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



embarking upon a new enterprise, it is not courage that

is  wanted. I would say it is wisdom that is  necessary

in  considering  this  problem,  and  where  wisdom  is

lacking, courage becomes foolhardiness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has stated very clearly indeed that civil servants are incapable of running a business enterprise, much less a bus company - whether it be a statutory company or an organisation directly run by the Government. I fully share the misgivings of the Minister for Finance that in nationalising bus

organisations,  far from bringing in more  revenue  for

the  coffers of the Treasury, the Minister for  Finance

instead  would have to subsidise bus transport  on  the

island.  However, I do not consider that  by  having  a

unified   bus   service  there  is  going   to   be   a

rationalisation of transport. No one can say  that  the

bus  transport  service  in Singapore  is  adequate  or

efficient. Although we have 15 bus companies, I do  not

see  how, by having only one bus company in the future,

it  will  make the bus service more efficient.  It  may

well  be that it would be desirable for users of  buses

to  have  perhaps integrated bus routes  which  can  be

operated  by fewer bus companies. Instead of having  15

bus  companies now, we can perhaps persuade some of the

smaller bus companies to amalgamate and thereby  assist

the  Road Licensing Authority, which is responsible for

allocating  bus  routes  to the companies.  This  will,

therefore,  make  it easier for anyone  who  wishes  to

travel from one part of the island to the other without

having to change buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at present making a study of a new Bus

Licensing Bill which will apply not only to the  S.T.C.

but also to the Chinese bus companies. It is true there

are   today  two  separate  Ordinances  governing   the

operation of the S.T.C. and the other bus companies. We

have  in our studies come across problems which involve

matters  of  finance-  not only  finance  in  terms  of

royalties  and taxation which affect the Treasury,  but

also   the   financial  operations  of  the   companies

themselves. It will take some time before we receive  a

final draft of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



new  Bill.  But when it happens, we also propose  that

some  of  the  smaller companies should amalgamate,  as

this will help the Road Licensing Authority to allocate

routes  which  will be more to the convenience  of  the

travelling public than to the bus companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my discussions with bus officials, I have explained

to  them the necessity of expanding their services  and

ploughing  their profits back into the operation.  Some

of  the bus companies, far from using their profits  to

improve  their  bus  operations,  have  used  them   in

building  houses, investing in real estate, or  delving

into  other types of business. While we do not  prevent

bus  companies  from participating  in  other  business

ventures,  we must at the same time impress  upon  them

that  their first responsibility surely must be to have

a  more efficient organisation of their bus operations.

More  recently,  the  Singapore Traction  Company  have

notified  us that they plan to purchase 100  new  buses

for  operation  on the routes, and we  have  encouraged

them  to  do so. I see no purpose in allowing a company

to  run  an  inefficient bus service along  the  routes

which have been allocated to it. It must be prepared to

expand and improve its organisation.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a point which the Road Licensing Authority

will  be looking into. We would like to remind all  bus

companies  of  the  rule that all licences  to  operate

routes  hold good only for one year. All these licences

must   be  renewed,  and  if  we  should  come   across

complaints  or  come  across in our own  investigations

that certain companies are not operating certain routes

as   efficiently  as  they  ought  to,  then  the  Road

Licensing  Authority  will be  asked  to  repeal  these

licences  and  give  them to some other  bus  companies

which are prepared to expand their organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for Choa

Chu  Kang that perhaps the central area of the city  be

forbidden  to all private car owners, I would  like  to

say  that all car owners, in the first instance, do not

travel in buses. The fact that you have so many cars in

Singapore is surely a reflection



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



on  the affluence of the people and that the population

is  fast becoming a middle-class population. It is  not

only  the car owners who would rather prefer to  travel

by themselves rather than going in buses, but there are

also those who use motor scooters and motor cycles  who

would rather use their own vehicles than buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I agree that a long-term approach to the

problem of public transport is very necessary. The Hill

Report,  which  has been mentioned by  the  Member  for

River  Valley,  is  to a certain extent  out  of  date.

Briefly, it recommends that the Government should  take

over   all  public  transportation.  But  we  have   to

compromise  between  what  is  practical  and  what  is

wanted.  If the economics warrant it, then I would  say

the  other  best form of transport we can  have  is  an

underground subway system, such as you have in the  big

capitals  of  the  world. This  certainly  will  remove

congestion  from  the  streets.  More  people  will  go

underground and there will be no necessity to take your

car  from your house to the centre of the city when you

go   to  work.  But,  at  the  same  time,  subways  or

underground trains can supplement overhead traffic.  If

the  Minister for Finance is prepared to put money into

such  a  venture,  I  am only too happy  to  go  around

looking for people who will want to co-operate with the

Government  in building an underground system.  Perhaps

we  could  do it on a 49-51 per cent basis, or whatever

other  percentage basis is preferred. It finally  boils

down  to the simple fact whether the Treasury can stand

the  load  of  investing very heavily in a new  venture

which is not certain to bring profit or revenue to  its

coffers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Unit which the Member for Choa Chu Kang

Department. Its primary job really is to study the flow

of  traffic in the main roads of Singapore and  thereby

help  plan  how such roads can be widened or new  roads

distributed throughout the streets of Singapore  rather

than that all traffic be concentrated along a few major

roads.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes. Just to sum up, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I will only say that it is our hope that the  bus

workers    will   understand   that   unification    or

rationalisation    of   bus   transport    simply    by

nationalisation  does not solve the problem  of  public

transport  at  all.  It is up to  the  workers  in  bus

companies   to  ensure  that  their  companies   remain

financially  viable,  because if  a  company  keeps  on

losing a million dollars every year, then there  is  no

alternative but for it to close down. That, of  course,

will   not  be  to  the  benefit  of  the  bus  workers

themselves. I can also add a note of warning, that if a

company  were to close down, the Government  would  not

just  step  in  and  say. "We will take  over  the  bus

company."  So please understand that however  much  the

bus  workers' unions want the Government to  take  over

bus transport, we cannot promise them that we are going

to  do  so.  Therefore, it is in their own interest  to

make  the  bus  companies in which they are  working  a

going concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are now entering an era of the space age and

the  world  is  shrinking in size. Our jet  planes  are

able  to  travel  beyond  the  speed  of  sound  -   at

supersonic  speed.  This  is  especially  important  to

Singapore  which is situated at the hub  of  South-East

Asia and the cross-roads of Asia and Europe. Therefore,

the    system    of   transportation   should    attain

international   standards.  Our  Paya  Lebar   Airport,

compared   with  airport  facilities  in  other   Asian

countries, is quite up to the standard. But  if  it  is

compared  with airports in advanced countries  such  as

America  and other countries, it is still backward.  To

substantiate  my argument, let me quote  from  the  Far

Eastern Economic Review, the title of which is "Whether

the Airports in the Far East are safe?"



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, the head we are discussing

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to he allocated for Head 0302 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two very short points I

wish  to  take  up  on  this Head.  The  first  is  the

stranglehold on the economy of Singapore that is  being

exercised by the Shipping Freight Conference. I am glad

that this point was answered by the Finance Minister in

the  Budget  debate yesterday. He fully  realised  this

problem  and  is,  in fact, taking  positive  steps  to

alleviate the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to raise is this. I shall

frame what I want to say in the form of a question, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I wish to ask the Minister in charge  of

Marine  whether  he  has any proposal  to  replace  the

present expatriate personnel by Singapore citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0302 be

reduced by $100."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Teong, is there anything you wish to say on this

Head?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have no

more views to air on this Head.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On the matter of freight rates

under the control of Conference Lines, I will only  say

that  this  is  a  matter which is dealt  with  by  the

Department  of  Trade.  It  does  not  come  under   my

Ministry.  Nevertheless, I personally do  take  a  keen

interest  in  this matter. I think it is  inappropriate

indeed to discuss Conference rates under this Head 0302

--- Marine, which is solely responsible for running the

motor launches and the lighthouses in Singapore waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point raised by the Member for Choa Chu

Kang  as to whether or not the expatriate posts in  the

Marine  Department will be Singaporeanised, I say  that

if  we  can  find  local citizens  with  the  necessary

qualifications, we will be only too happy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



to  employ them when the expatriates retire.  The  hon.

Member  should  realise that to obtain a  Foreign-going

Master's  Certificate  requires  a  lengthy  period  of

training and sitting for examinations which take almost

as long as six years. Since 1959, we have made positive

efforts to encourage local officers to take this higher

sea-going  examination. In fact, there  are  two  local

citizens  who are officers in the Marine Department.  I

presume  that in the course of time, when the contracts

of  the  expatriates expire, these officers  will  take

over  the  duties  which  are now  being  performed  by

expatriate personnel. However, until I am assured  that

we  have  enough  local people with such qualifications

who can fill the places, I think the best policy is  to

utilise the services of expatriates wherever we can get

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe in Singaporeanisation simply for the

sake  of  Singaporeanisation, because in our experience

we  have  found  sometimes - it is sad to  say  -  that

Singaporeanisation has not brought about more efficient

or  improved  services  and administration.  Experience

sometimes  is  lacking  and,  therefore,  we  have   to

approach    the    problem    rather    conservatively,

particularly  in technical departments  which  find  it

very  difficult indeed to recruit local  citizens  with

the essential technical qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polytechnic Nautical Department has started pre-sea training courses and is arranging opportunities for

students  who finish this course to work on board  ship

so that eventually they will be able to work towards  a

Mate   Certificate,  and  ultimately  a   Foreign-going

Master's Certificate. But all this training takes time,

and  it  does  not  mean that a man  who  has  recently

acquired  any certificate should therefore be the  head

of  a department. It will indeed be a very foolish  and

short-sighted   policy  to  believe   that   the   mere

acquisition of a certificate alone entitles  any  local

citizen to be the head of a department. He still has to

work  his  way  up  in  the  department,  acquire   the

necessary experience administratively or otherwise, and

hope eventually in the course of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



time to be promoted when a vacancy occurs. Up to today,

I  am  satisfied that the policy of gradually replacing

expatriate  personnel  in  the  Marine  Department   is

working according to schedule, although I must publicly

say  I regret very much indeed that local citizens  who

may possess the necessary qualifications have been very

slow  in  coming forward or reluctant to  work  in  the

Marine  Department. On the other hand, they  prefer  to

work on board ship as Masters of vessels simply because

they  can  earn  a  better  salary  than  they  can  in

Government service. This is the problem we face.  I  do

not  think any local personnel in the department in  my

Ministry grudge the presence of any expatriates we have

now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving this amendment, I wish to

draw  the Deputy Prime Minister's attention, if  he  is

not aware of it, to the growing dissatisfaction and low

morale of the police constables at the Airport Security

Section. I believe this affects the discipline  of  the

force in security work in an area like the Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for their dissatisfaction was brought about

by  the  difference  in  the salary  scales  which  the

regular force of the Polis Republik Singapura enjoy and

the  salary scale which the Airport security constables

receive. Before Malaysia, the police constables at  the

Airport  and the Regular Police Force were on the  same

salary  scales.  They  were  recruited  with  the  same

qualifications and they performed similar  duties.  The

change  in  the salary scales during the Malaysia  days

was the result of representations made by the regular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



police  force to the Salaries Commission then in  Kuala

Lumpur.  However, when the recommendations  were  made,

the  Airport police force was omitted from enjoying the

same scheme. I understand that the position now is that

a  fresh  submission  has been  made  to  the  Salaries

Commission which is now sitting in Singapore. The point

I  wish  to make is that the police constables  at  the

Singapore   Airport  should  not  suffer  through   the

negligence  of some officials. The case for the  police

constables  at the Singapore Airport was not submitted.

I  would  ask the Minister concerned to look into  this

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have two points to raise here.

First,  I  wish to know from the Minister  who  is  the

present Controller of Immigration. Is he an, expatriate

officer?  If  so,  when will his contract  expire?  The

second  point is on the people who come here on  social

visits. They are being asked to pay a deposit of  $500.

There  are cases where sponsors arrange for the  visits

of their relatives or friends, and they usually



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



get  a return ticket. Since that is the position,  Sir,

why  should  an  additional deposit be asked  for  from

these people?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we all

know that the bulk of the citizens of this Republic are

made  up  of immigrants from China and India, who  have

been here for many generations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Republic has now taken measures to

distinguish  between those who are citizens  and  those

who  are  non-citizens. The rightful  citizen  of  this

country   is   a   citizen   by   birth,   descent   or

naturalisation,  and he is issued with  a  plastic  red

identity  card. The non-citizen is issued with  a  blue

card.  Although  the Government has  tightened  up  its

Citizenship   Rules,   in  1957  all   immigrants   and

Commonwealth  citizens who wanted to take up  Singapore

citizenship were given the opportunity to do  so.  Some

progressive-minded people, through long  residence  and

association  with  this country, were  quite  ready  to

identify  themselves with the destiny of  this  country

and  have taken up Singapore citizenship. These  people

now  possess  the  red identity cards.  Some  Singapore

citizens  of  this category, and if  I  may  be  a  bit

personal, some Indian immigrants of this category,  for

reasons  best  known to themselves, were  not  able  to

associate with their families for more than five  years

at  any one time. It may be that before that period  or

after,  they had got their citizenship. The Immigration

Department  has  now  promulgated  a  rule   that   any

Singapore citizen who is separated from his family  for

more  than  five  years cannot bring  his  family  into

Singapore. In other words, an entry permit will not  be

given  to  such  families.  So  in  certain  cases  the

families  of  such  persons were  allowed  to  come  to

Singapore  on  visit passes for a six-month  period.  I

understand that even this is now being denied  them  by

the Immigration Department.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to the Deputy Prime Minister that if these

families  could not be permitted to come to  Singapore

on a permanent basis, then at least facilities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



should  be  made to allow them to come to Singapore  on

visit passes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which my colleagues spoke on was

deposits. Singapore citizens applying for visit  passes

either  for  their  wives,  children  or  parents   are

required to pay a security deposit of $500, in addition

to  producing a receipt for the return ticket which has

been  booked with a shipping company. I wish to suggest

to  the  Deputy  Prime Minister that  once  the  proper

receipt  for  a booking return ticket with  a  shipping

company  is produced, the security deposit of $500  may

be waived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

a  case also with regard to immigration. He is a  voter

who  stays in my constituency. By occupation, he  is  a

pilot  employed by the Port of Singapore Authority.  He

has  an  aged mother who lives in Cambodia. This  pilot

was   about  to  get  married.  According  to   Chinese

tradition  and custom, parents always like  to  witness

the  wedding of their children. In this case, this  man

had  applied  to  the Immigration Department  for  some

months, not to get this old lady to come here and stay,

but  just to witness the occasion of his wedding. I  do

not  know why his application was rejected. He came and

saw  me  and I then explained his case to the  official

concerned  but  still this official refused  to  agree.

Finally  -  I  do  not  know  through  whose  help   or

assistance  -  his  mother  was  allowed  to  come   to

Singapore after the wedding was over. But the  son  who

sponsored her entry into Singapore was asked to  pay  a

deposit of $2,000 in spite of the fact that the  return

passage  and everything else was provided for.  I  feel

that   in   the  case  of  social  visits  by  parents,

particularly  to witness their children's  weddings  as

the  case  may  be,  the  authorities  should  be  more

sympathetic.  I  bring this matter  before  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister and shall be very grateful if  he  will

investigate it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> To answer the first query whether

the  Controller  of Immigration is an  expatriate.  Mr

Speaker,  to my recollection, I believe that  he  is  a

local citizen and he is not under contract. I have  not

bothered to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



look  into  the  antecedents of civil  servants  in  my

Ministry.  But this is the first time that I have  been

queried  whether  the Controller of Immigration  is  an

expatriate.  However,  I shall  return  and  check  the

facts,  but I believe he is not. [Interruption]  No.  I

think  you had better make it quite clear. I was  asked

whether  he is an expatriate or not. My answer is  that

he is not an expatriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the general question of applications for a visit to

Singapore,  I want to make it quite clear that  Members

of  the  House  should  be able to distinguish  between

those who wish to come to Singapore to settle down, and

those  who wish to come to Singapore on a social  visit

pass.  As  far as those who propose to settle  down  in

Singapore  are concerned, the rule is that citizens  of

Singapore should not be separated from their  wives  or

their husbands for more than five years. Otherwise, the

proof  that the man or the woman still has an  interest

in  the  other  half does not exist.  In  the  case  of

children,  everyone  knows  that  children  who  it  is

proposed are to be brought into Singapore should not be

above  six years old, and for aged parents they  should

not  be  more than 65 years old. So I do not  want  the

question  of  admission into Singapore to be  mixed  up

with applications for social visits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as applications for permanent entry into

Singapore  are concerned, they deal with the  immediate

relatives of the applicant. You cannot say just because

you  are a Singapore citizen, you want to apply for the

permanent  entry  into Singapore of  your  uncle,  your

brother, or your auntie or your sister-in-law. This  is

the present regulation which we intend to continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of whether or not a

deposit  is necessary from those who come to  Singapore

on  a  social visit pass, I am in favour that a deposit

should  be asked for, because the money is not retained

by  the  Singapore Government but is  returned  to  the

visitor when he leaves the island. The sum of money  is

to  ensure that if the man over-stays his visit, and he

might be kept by the Government, then this sum of money

can be used. Or in other cases,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



the money would be used to repatriate those persons who

have  come  to Singapore for a period longer  than  was

intended.  However, what we can do  is  to  adjust  the

quantum of the deposit. This is the first time  it  has

come  to my knowledge that a deposit of $2,000 had been

asked  for  from this particular lady from Cambodia.  I

can  recollect very faintly that I did receive a letter

from somebody about the application by this lady for  a

social  visit  pass, and it was I who agreed  that  she

should  be allowed to come to Singapore. But I did  not

know  that the Controller of immigration had  asked  as

much  as  $2,000 for a deposit. If that is so,  then  I

think  perhaps  he  has not been so  judicious  in  his

decision. This is a matter which I hope I will be  able

to take up with the Immigration officials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Members will understand that the question of

immigration is a general problem. It is very  difficult

indeed for the Immigration Department to keep track  of

all those who come to Singapore. There is no preventive

branch  of  the  Immigration Department  to  visit  the

addresses given by those who have entered Singapore and

ascertain  whether  they  have  overstayed  the  period

allowed  to them, or whether they have disappeared.  In

the  experience  of  the Immigration  Department,  some

Singapore citizens have successfully applied for social

visit  passes for their friends and relatives  and,  in

many  cases, the Department has not been able  to  find

out  whether such persons have left the island or  not.

On  investigation sometimes it has been found that such

people  have  conveniently disappeared. If  we  are  in

earnest   to  contain  the  growth  of  population   in

Singapore,  we  must also be determined to  prevent  an

uncontrollable influx of foreign immigrants. Some  come

in  illegally. Some come in legally. But  whatever  way

they  choose to come in, we must ensure that those  who

come  in  are  those  who are going to  bring  economic

benefits   to  Singapore.  Also  our  citizens   should

comprehend that the limitations of the State itself  do

not  warrant an unrestricted flow of visitors,  whether

it  be for three or six months, for this flow cannot be

fully controlled. However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



when  the Immigration Department is transferred to  the

Ministry  of  the  Interior and  Defence  as  from  1st

January  next year, we hope that with the collaboration

of the police, the Immigration Department would be able

to develop more effective measures to ascertain whether

visitors  to  Singapore, be it on a professional  visit

pass  or  social visit pass, or an employment pass,  do

not overstay the periods that they have been given, and

so  there  is  some check on the population  growth  in

Singapore.  Members  of  this House,  of  course,  will

sympathise  with  the  Immigration  Department  on  the

problem, but if there are specific instances where they

believe  that  their constituents have not  been  given

justice, then they could write to me until the  end  of

the  year, or they could write to the Minister  of  the

Interior  and Defence from next year onwards  and  give

him   specific  instances  where  they  can  truthfully

support  the  applications for a social visit  pass  or

permanent entry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like Members of the House to know clearly

that  applications for permanent entry  are  applicable

only   to  certain  categories  of  persons  -   wives,

children,  parents.  All  others  who  wish  to   visit

Singapore must do so on a social visit pass, unless, of

course,  there are special circumstances which  warrant

the   permanent  entry  of  such  persons.  As  I  have

indicated,   persons  who  can  help  our   plans   for

industrialisation or who can bring economic benefits to

Singapore  or  who can bring in expertise or  technical

skill one way or the other, such persons surely can  be

considered for permanent entry. But I do not  think  we

can   allow  any  other  person  to  come  freely  into

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0305 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we have experience of going abroad,

then  we will know that whenever we go to a place -  it

may  be quite near by, Sarawak, for example - the entry

permit  issued  to  us  will  have  certain  conditions

attached thereto so that we will not be allowed to work

or  seek employment there. In the case of Singapore, in

so  far  as entry permits are concerned, I think  there

should  be  certain  regulations to restrict  unskilled

persons    from   coming   here   too   easily.    But,

unfortunately, Mr Speaker, the immigration authorities

in  their  administration seem  to  have  approved  the

permanent  stay of one expatriate person,  and  allowed

him  to work here. This is the case of a person who has

come  from  the  other  side of the  world.  He  is  an

unskilled  person but he has been allowed to stay  here

permanently to work in Pan-American Airways. Under  the

circumstances, if we review the position, there may  be

many   other   departments  involved,  not   just   the

Immigration Department alone. But it is the immigration

authorities  which  first  opened  the  door  to   this

foreigner  to  come in. As a result, the  situation  is

beyond redemption. Sir, we must pay attention to  cases

like this as we march forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as foreign affairs are concerned, we are non-aligned and neutral. If in our administration we have

certain  defects  which  can  be  exploited  by  anti-nationals to accuse us of not strictly implementing our

non-aligned policy, then the situation will be  rather

bad,  particularly  in the case of non-skilled  persons

coming here. We must consider that there are more than

60,000  persons registered with the Employment Exchange

here. If these people see unskilled persons coming here

and seeking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



employment at their expense, then they will be  looking

at  the  foreigners with much distress in  their  eyes.

Sir,  if  this  problem  is not  properly  treated  and

handled, then I am afraid that the people at large  may

not have much confidence in our immigration policy,  or

our  non-aligned  policy. There may  be  some  possible

misunderstanding in this respect. So unless there is  a

satisfactory  explanation, I would say that  since  the

Immigration  authorities made a mistake by opening  the

door to a foreigner to come in, then it should be their

responsibility to send him back to where he came  from.

I  think we must make good use of the repatriation vote

in  this  case.  But  I doubt whether  the  Immigration

authorities will be able to make good use of  this  sum

of  $14,880, because it is a vote for repatriation  and

other  expenses. I have no confidence  in  the  way  in

which they are making use of this vote. So I would like

to  reduce  it  by $10 so that we do not  waste  public

funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just wish to

ask  the Deputy Prime Minister how is it that, in spite

of  the  fact that the Immigration Department is asking

for  a deposit in respect of all people who come in  on

visit  passes - in fact, in a particular case,  as  the

Deputy Prime Minister has said, the Controller had been

injudicious in asking for too huge an amount - we still

have  to  make  provision to the  tune  of  $14,000  in

respect   of   Maintenance,  Removal  and  Repatriation

Expenses?  Is this item of expenditure confined  mainly

to the repatriation of illegal immigrants?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the person

referred to by the Member for Bukit Merah is a catering

officer employed by Pan American Airways and apparently

the  Controller of Immigration referred the application

for  this man's visit to the Director of Civil Aviation

who  supported  the application, and on this  ground  a

professional  visit  pass  for  12  months  was  given.

However, I will investigate the details of the case and

find  out  whether  this catering officer  possesses  a

skill that is not available



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



locally  and,  therefore, Pan American Airways  had  to

bring in their own man. If we wish Singapore to develop

economically, we must be generous at times and  realise

that  Singapore today is what it is on  account  of  an

immigrant  population and also on account of  expertise

which  has come from overseas. While we are proud  that

we  are independent and would like very much to rely on

our own ability and our own strength, nevertheless,  we

should   also   recognise  our   own   weaknesses   and

deficiencies.  And  if  we  adopt  a  dog-in-the-manger

attitude  while  we  are still not  in  a  position  to

improve  our  own  technical skill, then  I  am  afraid

Singapore will take a very long time to develop. It  is

on  these grounds that we have adopted a liberal policy

vis-a-vis      applications     by      industrialists,

technologists, professional men and other  experts  who

come here to help in some way or other our commerce and

industry  for  a  short period. These persons  are  not

going to stay in Singapore permanently. In most cases a

period  of 12 months' stay is granted to them.  In  the

case  of this particular catering officer, I myself  am

not  quite  sure about the circumstances for supporting

his  application,  but  I will investigate  it  when  I

return to the office tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the sum of $14,880 under the subhead of

Maintenance Removal and Repatriation Expenses, I  would

like  to  explain to the Member for Choa Chu Kang  that

this  money is used to feed illegal immigrants  in  our

detention gaol when they are caught out, and  also  the

cost of repatriating them will be borne by this sum  of

money.  We  have  from time to time unwelcome  visitors

from  neighbouring islands, and when  they  are  caught

out, they have to be kept here until we can find a boat

or  an aeroplane to pack them back. This is quite apart

from  the deposit which is required from all those  who

apply for a visit pass.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Messrs.Teong Eng Siong, Tang See Chim and S.V. Lingam.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, those people in Singapore with red

identity  cards  have  been  accepted  as  citizens  of

Singapore and the facilities made available to them are

the  same, for example, social welfare relief, etc. But

as  far  as the Immigration Department is concerned,  I

have  received several complaints that those people  in

Singapore who possess red identity cards but who do not

have citizenship papers or birth certificates have been

rejected when applying for passports to go abroad.  Can

the   Immigration  Department  and  other   departments

concerned  do  anything?  These  people  have  received

facilities which are the same as those for citizens  of

Singapore  who have birth certificates and  citizenship

registration certificates. Unfortunately, these  people

do  not  receive  the  facilities  as  given  by  other

departments. May I know from the Deputy Prime  Minister

whether  this  is  one  of  the  requirements  of   the

Immigration  Department, to demand that all  applicants

for  passports to go abroad must show their citizenship

certificates or their birth certificates?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

fully  appreciate  that in recent years  we  have  been

rather  restrictive in our immigration policy in  order

to   control   the   immigration  of  foreigners   into

Singapore. This, of course, is due to the fact that  we

are  a  small  island  State with  hardly  any  natural

resources  and  we  cannot  afford  to  have  an  over-populated  population.  That is  why  we  must  have  a

restrictive immigration policy which is quite different

from  that of 1948 when the policy was rather  lax.  At

that  time we had only about a million population,  but

now  we  have  double  that  figure, i.e.,  about  two

million.  As our Deputy Prime Minister is aware,  there

are  many  citizens in Singapore who  have  parents  in

India or China.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the difficulties of earning a livelihood

in  these  two  countries and  also  because  of  their

advanced  age, these parents of our local citizens  are

rather helpless in their country of birth. So they have

written  repeatedly  to their children  here,  who  are

Singapore  citizens, asking them to apply  for  permits

for  them  to enter Singapore. As a matter of fact,  we

have  approved  a  few  hundred such  applications  and

allowed  many people to come in every year.  But  there

are still many whose applications have been rejected on

the  ground of their age. The stipulated age  limit  is

now  65 years, but the applicants may be 62 or 63 years

old and they are therefore not eligible to come here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be another set of grounds for

disqualification. The applicants may have relatives  in

China  to  depend on. For example, in my  constituency,

there is a voter who complained to me that he had  made

an application for his-mother to come to Singapore, but

because  he  has a nephew in China his application  was

rejected.  But according to this voter, his nephew  was

sent  away  from his parents in China to Manchuria,  so

that  he is not in a position to look after his  mother

in   China.   I  hope  that  the  Minister  will   give

sympathetic  consideration and approve the applications

of  the cases which I have mentioned so that these aged

parents  will be allowed to come here and reunite  with

their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is another type of

applicants. Some people were born here about ten  years

ago.  According  to  our immigration  regulations,  any

person  who leaves Singapore for a period of more  than

five  years will be treated as an alien and he  is  not

allowed  to re-enter Singapore. I have received several

complaints  on this matter. For example, in  one  case,

the  applicant was born in Singapore. He left Singapore

for  a  period  of  five years and a  few  months.  His

parents applied for an entry permit for him, but  their

application was rejected on the ground that he had been

away



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



from Singapore for a period of more than five years. In

the  past,  some  people went to China under  emotional

circumstances or for other reasons. In so far as  their

birth-place is concerned, they should be considered  as

Singapore   citizens  by  birth.  Although  they   left

Singapore on impulse, they have now realised  that  the

circumstances  in some countries are not  so  good  and

they  find  it necessary to come back here.  They  have

relatives here. They are helpless in a foreign country.

So we should sympathise with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point, Mr Speaker, Sir. I have

received another complaint which has been brought up by

other   Members   of  this  House.  This   relates   to

applications for visit passes which require that  there

must  be  some guarantors to pay some kind of  deposit.

Some  of these visitors would like to extend the period

of  their stay in Singapore for a further three or  six

months.   In   such   circumstances,  the   Immigration

authorities  would  ask  them to  put  down  some  more

deposit. But in my view, as they have already put  down

a deposit once and may have a return ticket as well, it

is  not necessary for them to put down a second deposit

to  extend their period of stay here because  it  is  a

very troublesome and redundant procedure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally. Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to bring to

the   attention  of  the  Minister  certain  complaints

regarding  the  attitude  of  some  officers   in   the

Immigration Department. I do not know whether  this  is

true, but I would like him to look into the matter.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

inform  Members  of  the House that passports  are  not

given to citizens as a matter of right. Nobody can  say

that  just because he is a citizen he must be  given  a

passport.  According  to the Ordinance,  passports  are

issued  at the discretion of the Minister in charge  of

Immigration. Sometimes there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



cases  which come up before the Department where it  is

questionable whether passports should be given to  such

people, particularly when information has been received

from  the  Security  Branch  of  the  Ministry  of  the

Interior  and  Defence  that such  and  such  a  person

proposes  to travel abroad for some illegal purpose  to

further  his clandestine activities, or to make contact

with  smugglers  or  make other  types  of  undesirable

contacts.  When  it  comes to our  knowledge  that  the

passports  in  such  cases will  be  abused,  then,  of

course,  it is up to the Minister to decide whether  or

not such applications should be considered. I think  we

would  be  very  foolish  if, knowing  full  well  from

information received that these persons are going to do

this  country no good by their travel overseas, we were

to give them passports so that they can carry out their

objectives.  There is no difference between  a  citizen

born  in  Singapore and a citizen by  registration.  In

most cases -- I would say in 99.9 per cent of cases  -

passports are given and it is only in the 0.1 per  cent

of cases where doubts are very strong indeed that these

are undesirable characters who are going to subvert the

security of the State, or who are going to make contact

with the underworld, the smugglers, that passports  are

not given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member for Sembawang, those who leave

Singapore  without  a re-entry permit  surely  must  be

considered  as  persons  who  do  not  wish  to  retain

Singapore citizenship, and we assume that such  persons

are enjoying the rights and privileges of the countries

they have gone to. If this is so, then they will not be

carrying Singapore passports; neither will they have re-entry permits. Therefore, technically, whether they are

born  here or not, they have no right to be re-admitted

to  Singapore. It is only in bona fide cases where they

carry  passports and have been given the right  of  re-entry  that  they  will be allowed to return.  I  would

consider  persons  who have run off illegally  as  mere

opportunists  who hope to improve their  own  prospects

outside  this country, but when they find  that  things

are   not   going  too  well  for  them   they   become

disillusioned and want to return here. I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



believe  that sympathy should be given to such persons.

Frankly, if such opportunists are allowed to return,  I

do  not  believe they will contribute anything  to  the

welfare - politically or otherwise - of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very sorry indeed that applications from parents

who  are  62 years old have been rejected. But we  must

draw the line somewhere. The line is 65 years old.  If

a person is 62 years old, it is regrettable indeed that

his  application will not be considered. The best  that

can  happen is for him to wait until he or  she  is  65

years old. We cannot one day say, "Well, the line is 65

years  old. But, never mind, because you are my special

friend,  I will make it 62 years old." And having  made

it 62 years old, somebody comes along and says, "I have

a  mother  or a father who is 61 years old or 60  years

old."  And  so we go along a policy which  is  neither

fixed  nor  determined, and in the end we will  end  up

quite  confused as to whether immigration has  or  does

not have a policy. I must reiterate to all Members that

we  are  very sympathetic to our citizens whose parents

are living in those countries where times are hard,  be

it in India or in China. But I am quite sure that these

parents  have other relatives, other children,  uncles,

brothers or sisters with whom they are living. It  must

be  so, otherwise they would have applied for admission

to  Singapore long, long ago. This is a policy we  have

kept  all these years and we propose to carry  on  with

it,  that parents must be 65 years old and above before

their  applications can be considered.  Besides,  there

must  be adequate proof that they rely solely on  their

children in Singapore for their maintenance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the complaint about discourtesy by immigration

officials, I myself have put on the carpet officials of

the   Immigration   Department,   and   I   hope   that

irresponsible officials will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



learn  a  lesson.  If they do not  and  I  continue  to

receive further complaints about discourtesy or lack of

public relations, then there will be no alternative but

to  submit  them  to  a departmental  inquiry  and,  if

necessary, have them removed, transferred, or have them

retired  in the public interest. I have time and  again

told  all  the officials in departments of my  Ministry

that  all of them - from R.O.V, to Immigration - every

day  for  six  days  of the week that  they  come  into

contact with the public -

It  is  necessary for them to impress upon  the  public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, Members of this House

have  requested  the  Government  to  build  more  post

offices  in  various areas, but most of these  requests

have not been considered. Now that this vote is not yet

approved,  we  would  like the Government  to  consider

providing us with more branch post offices or,  failing

which,  more  postal vehicles or postal boxes.  We  are

sorry  to  talk  about postal services  in  the  areas,

because there are many defects in these services  there

and  I  have found that people in the rural areas often

do not receive their letters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now talk about the postal services in the

urban  areas  and  see  what  the  situation  is  like,

especially in the housing estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, time for the guillotine is

dispose of.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo:</b> I will shorten my speech. <i>(In Mandarin)</i> In our housing estates there are very few

posting  boxes. The facilities there are very poor,  as

the  authority  concerned has not planned  sufficiently

for  the  postal services. From the Budget we see  that

only $600 is provided for these services next year.  If

we  do  not  carefully plan now,  then  in  future  the

postmen will not even go up to the flats to deliver the

letters. If our Minister were to go to Bukit Timah Hill

and  build a house there, then he would not be able  to

receive his letters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of our society must be a balanced

one.  As  we  have  built so many  houses,  the  postal

services must be adequate to cope with the needs. If we

do  not  do  this well, the whole Government  machinery

will  be lopsided; it will be like a car losing one  of

its four wheels. There will be uneven development, with

the  result that although more houses are built,  there

are  not enough postal services provided, resulting  in

chaos and confusion. We hope that the Minister will pay

careful consideration to this item. Therefore,  I  move

that this item be reduced by $10.

the subhead touched on by the Member for Bukit Merah

has got nothing to do with what he has discussed. This

is in respect of the red post boxes for the public to

post their letters. This has nothing to do with postal

agencies. Furthermore, this is a general question and I

cannot reply to it directly. I cannot say which postal

districts are lacking in postal services. There are

postal agencies, mobile post offices, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this item of Stamps - New Issues

- I would like to know why the provision for 1967 is to

be  increased so much compared with that for 1966. What

I  mean  to  say is that we should, whenever  possible,

make our stamps reflect our way of life and the various

cultural  and  other characteristics of our  people  so

that they can be representative of the various features

of  our  people.  Stamps can be  very  useful  in  this

respect.  For  instance,  if a person  has  contributed

greatly  to  our country's welfare, then  we  may  have

certain  stamps depicting his image to commemorate  his

contribution  to  the country. This will  serve  as  an

encouragement to our people to emulate his example.  On

the  other hand, stamps should also reflect our society

in   which  the  four  races  are  living  harmoniously

together, because the mails will be sent throughout the

world,  and  foreigners will be able to understand  our

social  background and our livelihood. So these  stamps

will  serve as useful ambassadors of Singapore in these

countries.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just one

more  minute.  I  would not say that in  the  past  our

stamps  were not beautiful, but they contained  only  a

fish  or  a  bird or perhaps a centipede. Perhaps  they

were  not  too  significant, and if  they  were  posted

abroad,   the  people  who  received  them  would   not

understand what these pictures represented. The  stamps

of  the  Republic  of  Communist China,  for  instance,

reflect and commemorate what their people have done for

their  country; images of national heroes are depicted.

So  I  hope that we can also emulate their example  and

that  the Minister can tell us why there is such a  big

increase in the vote for next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead I notice that there are only

18 driving testers and 2 senior driving testers to deal

with  hundreds of people who are due for their  driving

tests every day. If there are no absentees from driving

testers due to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



illness  or  otherwise, an approximate  number  of  160

people will be tested every day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these 160 people, there are about 120

people who are present there every morning trying their

luck in the ballot to have their driving test, and only

three to five people will be lucky enough to have their

test, leaving the others disappointed. Even these three

to  five  people  are confronted with difficulties.  If

they  are  Mandarin-speaking, they  are  likely  to  be

turned  away.  The reason given is that  there  are  no

Mandarin-speaking testers. Sir, from what I know, there

are  about  eight to nine Mandarin-speaking testers  in

the   Driving  Testing  Department.  Why   cannot   the

administrative  side allot the testing fairly  just  to

avoid disappointing the people who wish to be tested?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to bring to the Minister of

State's  attention  is that there is  really  an  acute

shortage  of testers nowadays. A person who has  failed

in  his  first test will have to wait for three  months

for  a  retest. Therefore, I strongly urge the Minister

to  increase  the number of testers to  cope  with  the

situation.



Sir,  there  is  another point. I think all  Government

departments start work at 9.00 o'clock in the  morning.

I  stand  to  be corrected if I am wrong. I  have  made

personal  investigations  into  the  time  of   driving

testing and, to my surprise, the first car to move  out

for  testing  is always after 10.00 a.m. This  sort  of

attitude should be corrected at once.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  believe  you  know that the number  of  vehicles  is

increasing. It means that it is becoming too  easy  for

people  to  get driving licences. Because of  the  ease

with  which they get driving licences, this will affect

and  endanger our road safety. A few days ago the Vice-Chairman of the Safety First Council was involved in  a

collision  with a police officer's car.  If  the  Vice-Chairman  of  the  Safety First  Council  could  be  so

unsafe, how do you expect members of the public  to  be

safe  on  the road? The reason may well be that perhaps

these  two  persons were trying to give  way  to  other

drivers who were lacking in driving experience and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



who had got their driving licences recently. If that is

the  case  with  most  of  the applicants  for  driving

licences,  then  it  would be a great  hazard  to  road

safety.  Therefore, I hope that the  testers  will  pay

greater  attention to and exercise more stringent  care

in the issue of driving licences to people undergoing a

driving  test. Otherwise, even if we have  more  Safety

First  Councils, we may not be able to maintain  safety

on the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the provision of 18 testers, I hope

all   of   them  will  be  more  stringent  in  testing

applicants and maintain a good standard before  driving

licences  are issued to these applicants  in  order  to

safeguard road safety.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for Changi has mentioned about testers  who  do

not  know Mandarin. Actually nine out of the 14 testers

do  know  Mandarin. So this question  does  not  arise.

There  will be more opportunities. If the person speaks

Mandarin,   the  tester  will  be  a  Mandarin-speaking

tester. If he is a Malay, a Malay-speaking tester. This

is what has been carried out so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says other departments begin work at 9.00 o'clock

but  this department begins work at 10.00 o'clock. This

is  not  true. Actually the department starts  work  at

9.00 o'clock, but because arrangements have to be made,

it  is  only  within the hour that they  can  find  out

whether the people to be tested are present or not.  It

is  because  of this that the first car  comes  out  at

10.00 o'clock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the shortage of testers, I would like to

state here that in 1961 there were only 14 testers.  It

was increased by two in 1962 and then two more in 1965.

Next year we will reconsider the position. However that

may  be,  everyone who takes out a provisional  licence

can  be  tested after three and a half months from  the

date  of  application, so that he can  learn  to  drive

well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point brought up by the Member for

Delta.  I  would like to say that the testers  will  be

given instructions to be very careful in their testing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registry of Vehicles is one of the busiest

Government departments, because there are 250,000 motor

vehicles as well as other types of vehicles. Under  the

old Government this department was the object of attack

by  members of the public, because when they went  into

the  department to pay their road taxes  and  do  other

business,  they had to wait for at least two  hours  to

half  a  day.  Since  the P.A.P. Government  came  into

office  in  1959,  there has been a  great  change  and

improvement in this department. Members of  the  public

are  generally satisfied with it. But I would like  the

Minister  to  pay  attention  to  this  point.  It   is

necessary to make the officials of this department more

efficient in order to meet the expectations of  members

of  the  public.  They should not take the  view  that,

because  of  the  present satisfactory situation,  they

could relax their efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September this year we issued 300 taxi licences so

that  about  600  taxi  drivers would  have  jobs.  But

according  to  what  I have gathered,  there  are  many

people who are still waiting to have taxis to drive  to

make  a  living. So the number of taxi-driving licences

issued  is too small. According to what I have  learnt,

there  are  about five to six thousand people  applying

for licences to drive taxis to carry school children. I

hope  this kind of licences will be issued as  soon  as

possible in order to give them an early opportunity  to

make a living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point, and this is about parking

places  for taxis. I have learnt from the taxi drivers,

and  this  is their complaint, that they are  receiving

summonses very often, sometimes up to ten summonses per

month.  I  hope  the  authorities  concerned  will  not

inconvenience  them too much and will be more  flexible

in  dealing with their cases, because they have a great

burden  in  maintaining their families'  livelihood.  I

hope the Minister will consider this matter.

noted. We will continue to make further improvements to

the Registry of Vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of issuing licences for taxis to carry

school  children,  at  this  stage  the  Registrar   of

Vehicles has received 650 applications and 180 vehicles

have  been registered to carry school children.  School

children are on holiday at the moment, and it is  hoped

that  when  the  schools reopen  this  matter  will  be

finalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of parking places for taxis, I wish to

inform  the  hon.  Member  that  it  is  not  under  my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are very happy that the

Government  has launched a campaign to recruit  members

for  the  Vigilante Corps. But there is one question  I

would  like to ask the Minister. The campaign is  aimed

at  calling  men  to join but there is no  campaign  to

recruit women. Could the Minister consider at the  same

time  whether any women, if they wish to join,  can  do

so?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  fully support the suggestion made by the Member  for

Aljunied  that  the people today should be  allowed  to

shoulder  the responsibility to defend the country  and

that we should not be discriminatory against women. But

I  do  not  understand why in the present  campaign  to

recruit  Vigilante  Corps  members,  the  Minister   of

Defence is recruiting only men, and women are excluded.

I  understand there are certain community centres which

have  registered  some voluntary women  applicants  and

their  performance is better than the men's. I  do  not

know  why  the  Minister does not take women  into  the

Vigilante Corps. I would like him to give me an  answer

to this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the

information  of  the  hon.  Member  for  Delta,  in  my

community centre we have women Vigilante Corps members.

This  House  will  agree with me that  members  of  the

Singapore Vigilante Corps are playing a major  part  in

helping the police force to preserve peace and order in

our  country. The general public is certainly  grateful

to  them  for their voluntary services. But the welfare

of  the  Vigilante Corps up to now has  not  been  well

looked  after by the Government. Their members are  now

getting  drinks,  coffee and sugar  from  the  People's

Association  and cigarettes contributed  by  the  well-wishers  from  the public. As we all know,  they  often

encounter  great  difficulties while  performing  their

duties.  They are unarmed and, in the course  of  their

duties, may injure themselves or even lose their lives.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, there were two members from my

constituency  who were injured while on duty.  One  was

hurt during coastal patrol duties at Kampong Amber, and

the  other  sustained injuries when he met  a  gang  of

fighters  at Tanjong Rhu. Sir, I took up the  cases  of

these   two   unfortunate  members  with   the   proper

authorities, the People's Association, for compensation

about  a  year  ago,  but  to date  no  news  has  been

received.   As   we  all  appreciate  their   voluntary

services,  we  must provide them with compensation  and

adequate  cover  in order to safeguard their  lives.  I

vaguely  remember  there was a scheme for  compensation

for V.C. members known as the Singapore Vigilante Corps

Pension  and Gratuity Regulations, 1965. May I  request

the Minister to inform the House whether the scheme for

compensation  under these Regulations for V.C. members

has actually been implemented or not? Sir, a scheme for

compensation or gratuity is very essential,  especially

as  we are now campaigning for more members to join the

Vigilante  Corps,  and their welfare should  be  looked

after, as we cannot afford to lose their services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect of welfare which Government

can look after, i.e., their travelling allowances. Sir,

in  the  People's Defence Force, when we go for  parade

training we get parade allowances. But V.C. members get

no   travelling  allowances.  In  some  constituencies,

especially the well-to-do ones, the Vigilante Corps  is

often  supported by local communities or  well-wishers.

When  I  went  to Tampines last week, I  saw  that  the

organisation  there  was very  poor.  I  believe  their

financial support is not very strong. Perhaps  that  is

the  reason why the V.C. members are not active  enough

in  that  constituency.  So it  is  my  hope  that  the

Government  will  give  serious  thought  to   granting

travelling allowances and compensation for V.C. members

when they are injured.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, as

regards  a  women's  Vigilante  Corps,  some  community

centres have already formed their own women's Vigilante

Corps and I see no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



harm in other community centres doing the same. But for

the  time being, so far as the training programme goes,

we  are concentrating on the men first. Maybe in a year

or two when we have sufficient activities organised for

the  men,  we may make a properly-organised  effort  to

raise  a  women's Vigilante Corps. So  the  answer,  in

brief,   is  that  if  the  management  committees   of

community centres want to invite women members to  join

the  Vigilante Corps, they can do so. The expenses  and

training must be borne by these management committees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has raised a number of

points. As regards compensation, the compensation rules

are in force. If the two cases which he has referred to

the  People's Association have been stuck, I think  the

fault  may rest with these two applicants. In the first

instance,   they   should  not  have  submitted   their

applications to the People's Association.  They  should

address  their  applications  to  the  Vigilante  Corps

Headquarters.  If  the  Member  will  give  me  further

details, I will try to see what has gone wrong in  this

instance.  It  could be, of course, that  they  do  not

qualify  for any compensation if the injuries sustained

are very trivial in character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is travelling allowances. I see no

case  for  giving them travelling allowances. Vigilante

Corps  service  is  intended to be a voluntary  service

given   by  patriotic  young  men  and  women  to   the

community.  There is no case for travelling  allowances

because  the duties of the Vigilante Corps are  carried

out very close to their homes, and all they have to  do

is to walk to their place of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards poor activity in Tampines, I do not think

the  reason  is  the absence of travelling  allowances,

because  we have very active Vigilante Corps  units  in

other  places where travelling allowances are not paid.

It could be that there is poor leadership in this unit.

What should be done is to replace the leadership rather

than to pay travelling allowances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we celebrated National Day on a very grand scale.

All   Government   offices,  except  one,   and   other

commercial  firms  decorated their buildings  for  that

day.  In fact, there were two buildings which were  not

decorated. One - of course, we cannot blame them -  was

the  Malaysian High Commission Office. But the building

next  to  that  -  the General Post Office  -  was  not

decorated  at all. I will be happier if this  will  not

happen next year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I can give no assurances that it

will  not  happen next year. In fact, I think  it  will

happen  next  year.  I see no merit in  decorating  the

General  Post  Office building. It is not a  singularly

outstanding  piece of architecture. The policy  at  the

last  National  Day parade was to move  away  from  the

decoration  of Government offices to the decoration  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



town as a whole, particularly Chinatown both north  and

south of the river. So with a given sum of money and  a

fixed  budget to operate on, we have to decide  whether

we  want to brighten up the city, particularly the slum

areas, North and South Bridge Roads, or whether we want

to  spend  money on brightening up Government  offices.

Previous  to  the last National Day, the  practice  had

been  to  spend  large  sums  of  money  on  decorating

buildings with bunting, coloured bulbs, and so on. That

was  so even in the old colonial days. But I confess  I

cannot  see any merit in that. I think it is better  to

brighten up the main streets and the main thoroughfares

of the city where people live, so that everyone will be

made  more conscious of the importance of the occasion.

After all, National Day is a holiday and people do  not

go  to Government offices on that day because they  are

all closed.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Post Office was not the only Government

building  that  was not decorated. All  the  Government

buildings  along Empress Place were not decorated.  The

reason  for  making this decision is that these  places

are  not along the route of the march which took  place

on National Day.

by $10 in respect of subhead 3157.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is in regard to teachers'

allowances. I believe that recruitment into the  police

force  is  on  the increase. The persons recruited  are

from  the  four streams of education with Secondary  II

education.  I  believe they are required to  learn  the

national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



language. Recently the Singapore Police Force  took  an

active part in the national language campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the vote for 1967 is less than that for

1966. Can the Minister explain why teachers' allowances

have been reduced for 1967 whilst the intake is on  the

increase?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The hon. Member is quite wrong

about  his  facts.  The police intake  is  not  on  the

increase, it has greatly decreased this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after we left Malaysia, there was a very

substantial recruitment drive for the police force.  In

fact, the first intake after we became independent  was

the  largest  in  history. Something  like  nearly  800

recruits  were taken in in one draft. But  since  then,

most of the police vacancies have been filled. The next

intake for January will be just over 100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These teachers' allowances are not paid merely to

people teaching the national language. They are also to

provide   instruction  in  various   promotion   tests,

examinations  for corporals, inspectors, sergeants  and

so  on.  One reason why the provision for next year  is

less  than that for this year is that the sum allocated

for  this  year has not been spent fully. We find  that

many policemen prefer to attend adult education classes

rather  than  classes provided at the  Police  Training

School. So as the demand is less, the supply will  have

to be accordingly adjusted.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if

many  members  of  the police force  prefer  to  attend

Lembaga  Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa classes,  is  it  not

better  that  all those police personnel  who  wish  to

continue  with  their studies should be  encouraged  to

attend   classes  conducted  by  the  Lembaga   Gerakan

Pelajaran  Dewasa rather than for the  police  to  hold

their  own classes at the Police Training Centre or  in

other offices?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is the point. So there will be

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $100.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Tang See Chim.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in an independent country, defence

and  internal  security are very great responsibilities

to  be  shouldered, although at the present moment,  we

still  have  the  British base  to  assist  us  in  our

defence.  But,  as a matter of fact,  this  is  only  a

temporary measure. There will come a day when  we  will

have to rely on only ourselves for defence and internal

security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past year, the Ministry of

the  Interior  and  Defence took steps  to  expand  the

police and the army and great achievements were made in

this  field. There has been a tremendous response  from

various quarters to join the Police Defence Force. So I

must congratulate the Minister on his achievements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum allocated is $78,894,020, which is more than

the  estimate for last year. The increase is due to the

necessity  of  buying more military  vehicles  and  for

other  expansion  purposes.  It  also  shows  that  the

Minister  has  made careful and long-term planning  for

the future. This is a very appropriate move indeed. But

I   would   like  to  offer  certain  points  for   his

consideration  so  that  the expansion  scheme  in  the

Interior and Defence field will have more objectives of

an idealistic nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the training of members of the Police

Defence  Force, we must not only train them in the  use

of  arms  but  we must also have, at the same  time,  a

national  curriculum  to instil in  them  a  spirit  of

patriotism and national consciousness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I hope that the plans for civil servants to

undergo military training will be implemented as  early

as possible, and it can be undertaken on a part-time or

off-time basis in the early stage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I hope that the authorities concerned will

take  more effective measures to carry out the work  of

defence and security so that the lives and property  of

our people will be better protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I would like the Ministry to stop children

from  playing poker and other games on five-foot  ways.

In some cases, hawkers operate tikam-tikam on five-foot

ways.  A child picks out a number and, if he is  lucky,

he  will get 30 cents or some other prize; otherwise he

loses his stake of five cents. This kind of tikam-tikam

game is very detrimental to our school children.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with a

lot  of what the hon. Member has said, particularly  as

regards the cultivation of national consciousness. This

has  to  be done not only in the Defence Forces  but  I

think  throughout the entire population. So far as  the

Defence   Forces   are  concerned,   my   Ministry   is

establishing an educational corps which will consist of

officers  and N.C.O.s whose duty would be  to  do  just

this  kind  of thing, to tell soldiers how  to  conduct

themselves  and  what their duties and responsibilities

are,  so  that  they  can fulfil their  functions  more

effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the implementation of the plan for civil service

officials  to do P.D.F. and army duties, this  will  be

carried  out as announced, that is, next year. All  new

employees  in Government and statutory bodies  will  be

called up to do this service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On children gambling, I do not know what the Member

has  in  mind. Does he want the police to  arrest  them

when  they  are  found gambling? The police  have  been

arresting children when they are engaged in gambling in

public,  as  this is against the law. But I  think  the

main  responsibility lies with the parents to see  that

their  children are brought up properly, that  they  do

not  gamble  in  public or, for that  matter,  anywhere

else.  The best deterrent is to whack the child on  his

bottom.  I  think  leaders of opinion  and  Members  of

Parliament have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



responsibility  to  help  bring  about  this  state  of

discipline among children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About hawkers' tikam-tikam, I do not know. When I was

in  school, I remember an ice-cream man doing this sort

of  thing.  But you always get something.  You  do  not

lose.  You either get a big portion or a small portion.

So  if  hawkers are doing that, I do not  know  whether

that  is against the law. But, of course, if they  give

nothing  away, I agree that it is quite deplorable.  If

the Member has any concrete information, I suggest that

he  lay  a  complaint  before the police  so  that  the

culprits can be apprehended and dealt with.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

would  like to bring forward two other points in  reply

to  the  Minister.  I  agree that it  is  probably  the

responsibility  of  the  parents  to  see  that   their

children  do not gamble. But if the police can  give  a

warning to such children, I think that will serve  them

well and help to check this gambling in public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning this tikam-tikam business, Mr Speaker, if

it  is  merely  a matter of winning a small  or  a  big

prize,  then I agree it is quite all right. If you  put

down  a  5-cent stake, you may win or lose 5 cents.  If

you  win,  you may sometimes have a prize of 20  or  30

cents. But often the draws result in blanks - no prize.

That  is quite a different experience from that of  the

Minister  in his childhood -when he was quite  sure  of

getting  something in the tikam-tikam which he  himself

indulged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be

reduced by $100.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Chow Chiok Hock and Mr Tang See Chim.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, ever since we attained independence on

the 9th of August last year, our Minister has announced

that  we  will  adopt a non-aligned foreign  policy  in

order  to  establish  friendly relations  with  various

countries  in  the  world.  This  is  indeed   a   very

commendable,  farsighted, praiseworthy,  and  judicious

policy.  Our  achievements  in  the  field  of  foreign

affairs  are  really encouraging indeed. In  the  first

place,  we have smoothly gained admission to the United

Nations.  We  have also been admitted to various  other

international  organisations, such  as  ECAFE  and  the

Asian Development Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the establishment of diplomatic relations with

various  countries  in the world,  we  have  also  made

achievements. We have set up diplomatic relations  with

many countries in Asia, Africa and Europe. We have even

sent  diplomatic missions to India, Cambodia and  other

countries. Indonesia, too, has resumed trade  relations

with us. On the European continent, Italy, West Germany

and  other countries have also become friends with  us.

Both  Canada and America have established relationships

with us. Bulgaria, Hungary and Russia have signed trade

pacts  and are doing business with us so that our trade

and economic income will increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are a small country, and according to

a  saying, a small country could have no diplomacy. But

in  the  present  context, this  saying  is  no  longer

applicable,  because in the United Nations,  which  has

120  members, there are many countries which  are  very

small  in size and population - about 70 per cent.  And

it is this 70 per cent (the small countries) which have

the  majority vote. So although our country  is  small,

our voice for justice and righteousness can and must be

transmitted all over the world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>7.35 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our love of peace must also be transmitted. We cannot

be swayed in our stand in this regard. For example, our

chief   representative  in  the  United  Nations,   Mr

Coomaraswamy,   recently  spoke  in  support   of   the

admission of China to the United Nations. He said  that

the   policy   to  shut  out  China  is  improper   and

unreasonable. The Prime Minister has also condemned the

minority   regime   in  Southern  Rhodesia.   This   is

representative of our sense of justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the vote to be allocated to the Foreign Ministry

for  next  year,  I  note  that  the  sum  is  slightly

increased. But I think the increase is insufficient. So

I  would  like the Minister for Finance to  consider  a

further increase in the vote for this Ministry. At  the

present moment, the number of foreign missions  set  up

is  inadequate.  The  money  to  be  spent  on  foreign

missions  is  not  wasted at all, because  if  we  have

closer  diplomatic relations with other  countries,  it

will  mean  that  our  trade  relations  also  will  be

improved or further strengthened. That means that there

will  be  economic returns for us. In other  words,  we

will be able to earn more foreign exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I wish to bring to the attention of

the Minister is that in recruiting staff for diplomatic

missions at present, it seems that the English-educated

have   some  kind  of  supremacy,  because  the  common

language  officially used so far is  English.  We  must

also  realise  that  Malay is  our  national  language.

Although  in the diplomatic field, English is the  more

common language, we must have officers with a knowledge

of  Malay, because some people may not want to speak to

you  in  English but in Malay. So if our own  diplomats

cannot  speak  our national language when addressed  in

that language, it will be a big joke indeed. So I would

like the Minister to pay attention to this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that protocol officers are

insufficient   in   number.   I   have   heard    about

representatives from foreign lands visiting  Singapore.

If  one  foreign  visitor comes for one  day  then  our

protocol officers will be able to bring him round.  But

if  we  have two or three foreign visitors in one  day,

then  our  protocol officers will be  short-handed  and

they will be unable to bring them round our country. If

this  news  spreads overseas, then it is  not  a  great

credit  to us. It is far from complimentary. So I  hope

the  Minister  will  increase the  number  of  protocol

officers in order that our distinguished visitors  will

be better treated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  personally I would like to bring up only  one

point under this Head, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

and  that  is  in  selecting the  heads  of  diplomatic

missions.   We  all  know  that  when  a   country   is

independent, it must set up friendly relationships with

other  countries.  It  is no exception  for  Singapore.

Singapore  is an international port and  so  it  has  a

special position to consider. Our commercial activities

have  been  closely linked for a long  time  with  many

other  countries  in the world, so invariably  this  is

reflected  in  our diplomatic officers,  such  as  High

Commissioners and Ambassadors, who include  dignitaries

from  the  commercial field. This is  no  surprise,  of

course. But I feel that diplomatic officers are experts

themselves.  They  are professional people,  they  must

receive  special  training, and they  must  be  persons

highly  qualified academically, because they are  quite

different  from  the ordinary civil  servants  and  the

ordinary  people  in our own country. Their  activities

abroad  are  supposed to be representative of  our  own

country, and they serve as a bridge between our country

and other countries in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on a long-term basis those who represent us abroad

in  foreign  missions must be people  who  have  expert

knowledge, like professors and other very knowledgeable

persons, comparatively speaking, so that they  will  be

more suitable for this purpose. I do not, for a moment,

try to speak ill of the capacity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



and  status of some commercial people. I just  want  to

bring this fact to the attention of the Minister - that

if  these  people from the commercial field  have  some

dealings in business relating to our trade at the  same

time, I do not know whether there may be a conflict  of

interests between the two. So I would like to tell you,

Mr Speaker, that in future the selection of diplomatic

heads  of missions must be from professional and  well-trained  people, so that they will be able to  shoulder

their responsibilities in a better manner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like the

Member  for  Sembawang to clarify this point.  He  says

there  is  an  insufficient vote for  the  Ministry  of

Foreign  Affairs. Then why does he want to  ask  for  a

reduction  of the vote by $100? He should  ask  for  an

increase in the vote and not cut it down by $100!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the budget allocation

for  the  Foreign  Ministry for 1967,  an  increase  of

$1,424,580 is voted over the 1966 budget. This House is

given to understand that this increase is to facilitate

the  setting-up  of new embassies in  other  countries,

including India and the United Arab Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that additional funds should be allocated to

the  Foreign Ministry. The Member for Bukit  Merah  has

asked  why we should speak on a motion to cut down  the

vote when we want to increase it. I understand that the

parliamentary procedure is that we are not  allowed  to

speak  on  any item in the estimates unless we  move  a

motion to reduce the vote for that item.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that additional funds be given to the

Foreign  Ministry  so  that  more  embassies  could  be

established in East European countries like Yugoslavia,

Bulgaria,  Rumania and Poland. I am wondering  why  the

foreign Ministry has not made any provision for opening

up  embassies in these countries - at least a  regional

embassy   -   since  many  of  these   countries   have

established  trade  relations  with  us.  We  know  our

Government's neutral policy in the world power



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



bloc  conflict. Our neutral and non-aligned  policy  is

wise and timely. It is no exaggeration to say that  our

neutral policy has gained more support and more friends

in the world comity of nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While suggesting that we open up an embassy in one of

the  East  European countries, like Poland,  I  do  not

seriously intend to impede our non-alignment policy  or

advocate  that we should identify ourselves  more  with

the  Communist bloc countries. For that matter, I  feel

that  by  setting  up embassies in the United  Kingdom,

Bangkok,  Australia and New Zealand, we should  not  in

any way be regarded as being pro-West. My suggestion is

that  by  opening  up  such embassies,  we  could  more

effectively communicate with more countries in the East

European  bloc. I have no doubt this will be  practical

and  even  more  beneficial to our  Republic.  In  this

respect, I am inclined to agree with the view expressed

by   my  colleague,  the  Member  for  Ulu  Pandan,  in

yesterday's  Budget debate. He correctly  said  that  a

trade mission should be set up in the People's Republic

of  China in view of its market possibilities, in spite

of the Finance Minister's statement on the imbalance of

trade between Singapore and China.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Speaker in the Chair] </b></div>



<br><br>7.47 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Members will agree that the setting up of a trade

mission  could well bring about a compromise that  this

will  even  up  the  trade.  So  our  geographical  and

environmental circumstances will make us aware  of  who

are  our friends and who are our enemies. We are at the

cross-roads of the East and West, a metaphor  used  and

acknowledged  by  both the Communists and  the  Western

bloc  countries. If we could play host to the East  and

West  and if we could provide a neutral meeting  ground

for  these  countries, I should say  that  our  neutral

policy  will be more fruitful and beneficial, not  only

to our two million people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



but  also to the 2,000 million people of the world.

In short, Singapore can be the Geneva of the East.

Sir,  I envisage that my suggestion in opening  up  an

embassy  in  one  of the East European  countries  will

expand  our  scope  in trade and new  markets  for  our

industrial products. I request the Minister for Foreign

Affairs to give consideration to this matter. I support

this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have only one point to bring up. I would like to say

that  undoubtedly our foreign policy, particularly  the

recent  despatch of a delegation to the United Nations,

has  enhanced our reputation all over the world.  This,

of  course, is a success of our foreign policy. But, on

the  other hand, I do not know whether the Minister has

noted  that  in  certain respects, we have  spoken  our

minds  on  justice and righteousness. Some  businessmen

outside  have  the  suspicion  that  a  country   which

stresses non-alignment may be swayed from the middle to

the left. If that is the case, then Singapore, which is

stressing    the   great   importance   of   industrial

development,   must  take  steps  to  clear   up   this

suspicion.  If  it still exists, then that  will  deter

some  foreign  investors from coming to  Singapore  and

make them hesitant in undertaking any enterprise. I  do

not know whether the Minister has noted this or whether

he  has heard anything of this nature. That is my point

on which I would like some clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  it  is always very encouraging  to  find

Members  of this Assembly pleading for more  funds,  an

allocation of more funds -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Members of Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Members of Parliament, sorry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Small "a", yes. Thank you very much

for getting me



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



out of the predicament. But it is always helpful to get

pleas  for  an  increased allocation of  funds.  But  I

think,  to  be fair to the Finance Minister, the  funds

have  been accorded to suit the work that the  Ministry

will  do  for the year 1967. If I had more  work,  more

duties involved, I am quite sure he would have given it

his reasonable consideration. As you know, Sir, we have

already  indicated  that for  the  next  year  we  will

operate  only  some nine to ten missions abroad.  There

are  reasons for this. We can open up missions all over

the  place for prestige reasons, for political reasons.

But  in  Singapore we have decided that the only reason

for  opening up a mission anywhere is that we must  get

some  advantage out of it. We do not have  a  showpiece

either  in  Europe or America or anywhere. Wherever  we

open  up a mission, we must be able to justify that  we

get  some  benefit from it. So for the time being,  the

size  and  number of missions are determined purely  by

these  considerations. That would probably  answer  the

observations made also by the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from deciding what advantage Singapore would

have  in setting up a mission, we must find the finance

to  set  it up. Missions are very expensive outfits  to

maintain, especially in countries where the standard of

living  is  considerably higher. So we cannot  disburse

funds  just  because it is good to have  a  mission  in

country  A  or B until I can satisfy myself, and  quite

definitely  satisfy the Finance Minister,  that  if  we

spend  $2  million in such and such a country,  we  can

expect  to  get trade worth $4 million or  $5  million.

Then  there is justification for it. Or some  political

advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, there is the question of staff. One

point  we  must understand about Singapore in its  long

history is that none of us has ever given consideration

to  the possibility that an independent Singapore would

have  to train diplomatic personnel. It is only a  year

since  we became independent, and it takes a long  time

to  train Foreign Office staff, or find people who  are

prepared   to   head  missions,  to  be  diplomats   or

ambassadors in foreign countries, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



not  only the question of finding the money to  justify

the  setting-up  of  a  mission, but  the  question  of

finding the men to staff it. Being non-aligned, we  are

naturally  prepared  to  set  up  missions  in  Eastern

Europe.  Western  Europe, Northern Europe  or  Southern

Europe. But it must pass the criteria I have indicated.

What benefit will Singapore get, whether it is economic

or political! If there is no benefit, then we can carry

on  the  relationship in some other way. As  trade  and

other  relationships increase sufficiently, the  moment

we  find enough staff to man the missions, we will give

serious attention to the setting-up of missions abroad.

At the moment, we have some trade missions from Eastern

European countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point by the Member for Sembawang is that we

do  not have enough protocol officers. True, we have  a

small  number of protocol officers. That being  so,  we

always arrange things in such a way that not more  than

one  or two V.I.P.s visit Singapore at any given  time.

If a third V.I.P. intends and presses very hard to come

to Singapore, we either politely tell him that maybe we

will be able to receive him the next month or the month

after that. So I think we can get by for the time being

with  the  number  of protocol officers  we  have.  But

obviously  as  we  get  more experience,  as  Singapore

becomes  more popular with V.I.P.s, it may be necessary

to consider increasing the number of protocol officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the choice of diplomats, we have not only

chosen  commercial  men  - in fact,  I  think  we  have

deployed   the  talents  of  Singapore  in   a   rather

representative  way. We have commercial  men,  we  have

professors,   we   have  professional   men,   ex-civil

servants,  a  former Speaker, representing  practically

members of all races and all classes. So I think  there

is  nothing  wrong  in  appointing  commercial  men  or

businessmen  as  diplomats, especially since  Singapore

lives  on  commerce and trade. It may be  necessary  in

certain  areas, in certain countries, to have men  with

trading  knowledge. The work of a diplomat is not  only

to have diplomacy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



but  to  give us information - information on economics

and  other information. So in certain countries it  may

be necessary to have men experienced in trade, banking,

business and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the final point made by the Member for

Sembawang  that we should not discriminate against,  so

to  speak,  Malay.  In fact, our hope  is  that  people

coming  into the Foreign Office not only speak  English

and  Malay, but they should be able to speak French  or

Russian  -  if  we should set up a mission  in  Russia.

Definitely  we  must be able to use  the  international

languages. True, Malay is a good language,  but  it  is

spoken  at the most by about 110 million people.  I  am

quite  sure that if you try to converse with a  Belgian

or  a German in Malay, you will not get very far. So we

will  impress  on  people, especially  in  the  foreign

service,  which  is not set up for a national  outlook,

that it is not our national language that is important,

but  the language which is useful for a member  of  the

foreign  service  to  have - one of  the  international

languages. If Malay becomes an international  language,

maybe  then  a knowledge of Malay will be  one  of  the

essentials of an employee of the Foreign Ministry.  But

we  have  people  who speak Malay. If  the  Member  for

Sembawang  will  come  to  my Ministry,  he  will  find

recruits  who  are  Malays who speak Malay.  There  are

recruits who are not Malays who speak Malay. There  are

also Malays who speak English and so on. So there is no

particular  discrimination against any language  group.

All  that  we are interested in is that the  particular

person  can  discharge efficiently  the  functions  and

responsibilities that go with the Ministry.

<div align="center"><b>ACQUISITION OF ALSAGOFF ESTATE IN GEYLANG</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BY GOVERNMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister for Culture and Social Affairs stated  in  his

speech on the opening of the National Language Campaign

at  Pasir  Panjang Community Centre recently  that  the

Government  at  the moment have no plans  to  redevelop

Alsagoff Estate at Geylang. He was referring to current

rumours  to the effect that the Government have  bought

over  Alsagoff Estate for redevelopment  and  that  the

residents  of various races - the majority of  whom  are

Malays - would have to be evicted from there. With  the

denial  made  by  the Minister for Culture  and  Social

Affairs,  it  is clear that the rumours concerning  the

purchase of Alsagoff Estate by the Government and  that

the  residents  are  to be evicted  are  falsehoods.  I

believe  they have been purposely cooked up by  parties

who  are  anti-Government and anti-national, to  create

uneasiness  among the residents of Alsagoff Estate  for

their own political ends. As such, I feel it is my duty

to point out to the House how important it is that this

matter  be  brought  before  this  House  so  that  the

Minister   concerned  and  other   hon.   Members   can

understand the true position regarding Alsagoff  Estate

in Geylang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From inquiries made by me and from statements in the

Utusan Melayu of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



28th  November, 1966, made by a member of the  Alsagoff

family,  I  have come to understand - and I quote  from

the Utusan Melayu of 28th November, page 7, column 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Alsagoff Estate covering an area of about 850

acres will be redeveloped as part of the urban area  of

the Republic in future. Subdivision will be carried out

as soon as the parties concerned have approved the plan

for the said project.'



<br><br>And further the Utusan Melayu states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Groups of wealthy businessmen who are experienced and

conversant  with matters concerning housing development

are  ready to buy and redevelop the Geylang area  which

is  congested,  and  that the whole  area  of  Alsagoff

Estate  will  be subdivided into lots and  the  tenants

have  the  right  to  buy  up the  lots  as  their  own

property.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if wealthy businessmen are going to

carry  out  the redevelopment of this area, their  main

objective is surely to enrich themselves. On the  other

hand,  if  the plan is to be carried out by people  who

are  not  of  the wealthy class, then their purpose  is

surely to deceive the poor people staying in the  area,

and these are the people who will suffer hardship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utusan Melayu in the same issue further states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All facilities such as good roads, proper drainage,

better  supply  of  electricity, together  with  modern

sanitation, will be provided,'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, if all this can be carried out, it is well

and  good.  But  who will defray the expenses  for  the

provision  of  those facilities? To my  knowledge,  the

order  has  been  obtained to sell Alsagoff  Estate  at

Geylang, also known as Perseverance Estate, an area  of

850 acres, to Disco Limited of Penang for the sum of $5

million, the method of payment being 20 per cent or  $1

million  to  be  paid  as soon as the  layout  plan  is

approved  by Government. After a year, 30 per  cent  or

$1.5  million,  and after another year another  30  per

cent  or $1.5 million, and after that the final payment

of 20 per cent or $1 million will be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as I have stated earlier, the order has

been  obtained  for  the sale of the  Estate  to  Disco

Limited.  But the forms circulated to the residents  of

the area are by Alsagoff Realty Limited,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



whose office is at U.M.N.O. House, Changi Road. Earlier

on, I  have quoted the Utusan Melayu of 28th  November

which  states  that the whole area of  Alsagoff  Estate

will  be subdivided into lots and that the tenants have

the right to buy up the lots as their own property. But

the price and the method of payment are not made clear.

However,  I am given to understand that the  method  of

payment  is,  first a buyer pays $50 as  option  money.

Then  he  has  to pay a deposit of 25 per cent  of  the

price  which  has been fixed for a parcel  of  land  of

6,000  square  feet in area at $2.20 per  square  foot.

This  could be paid in instalments spread over a period

of  five years or ten years. But the roads and drainage

must be laid by the buyer. So if we are to consider the

report in the Utusan Melayu of 28th November, 1966, the

picture one gets is attractive. All the more so as  the

plan  is  to be carried out by Alsagoff Realty Limited,

whose  office  is  at U.M.N.O. House, No.  218E  Changi

Road.  The  reader may well expect that the company  is

that  of  the  Alsagoff  family and  U.M.N.O. must  be

helping  the  Malays. However, if we  ponder  over  the

matter  more  deeply, we find that the  sale  price  to

Disco  Limited is $5 million for an area of 850  acres,

which  works  out  to about 5½ cents per  square  foot,

whereas the price to the residents is $2.20 per  square

foot  exclusive  of  expenses for roads  and  drainage.

Another  item of expenditure which would not  occur  to

the  residents is the cost of filling up  the  area  of

6,000  square feet of land with earth, as the  area  is

below sea level. Yet another item is the interest to be

charged  on  the instalments. If we add  up  all  these

expenses,  the price per square foot is not  less  than

$3.50  or  more, while the purchase price from Alsagoff

Estate is about 5½ cents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being the case, Mr Speaker, I am most keen to

know whether Government will approve the application of

Disco  Limited in respect of the layout plan which  has

been  submitted to the relevant Government departments:

for  if this plan is approved, there may be poor Malays

and  also  non-Malays living in the area  who  will  be

exploited and victimised by a group of unscrupulous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



wealthy  businessmen. So I trust  the  Government  will

give   every  possible  help  and  assistance  to   the

residents of the area to enable them to own the land by

direct purchase from the trustees of Alsagoff Estate at

a  price similar to if not less than that paid by Disco

Limited. The residents of Alsagoff Estate are from  the

poor  class  and it is only proper that  our  socialist

Government give them every assistance so that they  are

not victimised by the capitalists.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, because the matter raised by the hon.

Member  for Kampong Kembangan refers to my constituency

- Geylang Serai - I would like to clarify the position.

At  the  end  of  last month, a number of  people,  who

claimed  to be employees of Alsagoff Estate, went  from

house  to  house  bringing  with  them  forms  for  the

purchase of land in Geylang Serai. These people had  no

proper  authority  from the owners of  the  land.  They

informed  the  residents  there  that  Alsagoff  Estate

wished  to  sell the area to the residents  of  Geylang

Serai,  and that every resident had to buy the land  on

which   he   was  staying,  whether  in  cash   or   in

instalments.  And the forms, according to them,  should

be returned to the office with $50 option money. When I

made  inquiries.  I  found  that  the  address  was  at

U.M.N.O. House, Changi Road. After investigations up to

now, I find there has not been a single official notice

from the owners of the land to the residents of Geylang

Serai. These people who claimed to be the employees  of

Alsagoff  Estate had carried out false  propaganda  and

said  that if the residents of Alsagoff Estate did  not

buy  up the land before 1968, Government would buy over

the  estate  and  build  flats.  I  believe  the  false

propaganda spread by these people was carried out  with

the  evil intention of causing unrest among the  people

of  Geylang  Serai. We must fight it. These people  are

based at U.M.N.O. House in Changi Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Minister for Culture and Social Affairs

clarified  the  matter  in his  speech,  the  Singapore

U.M.N.O. issued



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



a  statement in the Utusan Melayu stating that U.M.N.O.

held   a  meeting  in  order  to  consider  the  matter

pertaining to Alsagoff Estate. This statement  has  confused the people of Geylang Serai, because U.M.N.O. has

given  over  its office area to the people who  carried

out  the  propaganda. And the statement issued  in  the

Utusan  Melayu  was for the purpose of  clarifying  the

matter. However, with U.M.N.O. House being used  as  an

office  by  the organisation, U.M.N.O. has been  giving

its  assistance to the people concerned,  so  that  the

residents  of Geylang Serai will dislike the Government

of  Singapore. Firstly, it happened when Singapore  was

part  of Malaysia. This group attempted to spread false

propaganda,   allegedly  saying  that   the   Malaysian

Government  would purchase the land in Alsagoff  Estate

which  would  be  sold to the existing  settlers.  They

further  alleged that residents who wished to  purchase

the  land  from  the  Malaysian  Government  should  be

members  of U.M.N.O. This, Mr Speaker, clearly  proves

that Alsagoff Estate has become a political issue,  the

object  of  which  is  to create uneasiness  among  the

Malays  in  Geylang Serai. It is hoped that the  proper

authorities will give due attention to this matter.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the rest will be taken up by the existing road

widening  proposals  and  the proposed  drainage  canal

scheme  which has not been implemented because  of  the

squatter  problem. The area is heavily encumbered.  The

owners themselves have no precise idea of the number of

squatters  and  ground tenants on  the  land.  In  many

cases,  the areas have been sublet for a lump sum,  the

sub-lessee renting the land and collecting ground  rent

at  a  profit.  The buildings on the  land  are  mainly

temporary  structures owned by the ground  tenants.  Of

the  3,990 authorised houses in the area shown  on  the

property tax rolls, 1,931 are owned by Malays and 2,065

by  non-Malays who are mainly Chinese. These figures do

not  include  the  unauthorised or  unnumbered  houses

which do not appear on the property tax records.







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1965, the solicitors for the Estate

published an advertisement in the Press  offering

the area for sale. It said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Subject to existing tenancies and occupational

rights, if any, part of the Estate, approximately

410  acres, has been earmarked on the Master Plan

as  Green Belt, but approval can be obtained  for

development purposes.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Planner drew the attention of the

solicitors  for  the Estate to the  advertisement

and pointed out two points:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Permission for the development of half of

Perseverance  Estate will not be granted  because

of  the allocation of that half of the Estate  as

Green  Belt  and Public Open Space in the  Master

Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Development of the remaining 480 acres

area of the Estate, which is allocated

for residential use, may be considered by the competent

authority  on  an  application  being  made  under  the

provisions  of  the Planning Ordinance,  1959, but  in

considering the application due regard

must be had by the competent authority 5 acres  to

the provisions of the Master Plan for

3 acres   the   area   and   other  relevant   planning

requirements.







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Government has at various times given thought to

the acquisition of this Estate for development, but the

area   presents  an  appalling  picture   of   squatter

difficulties and resettlement problem. The area in part

is also low-lying and considerable filling and drainage

work  involving clearance will be necessary before  any

construction can take place. This will inevitably  mean

the  removing and resiting of families now on the site.

Except  for  limited  development,  for  example,   the

Geylang   Serai  Project  and  other  road  improvement

schemes, etc., the acquisition of the entire Estate and

comprehensive  development of the area  have  not  been

undertaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is fully aware of the news carried

by  the Utusan Melayu dated 5th December and I have the

English translation of it in hand. The news carried  is

that  there  is  one company by the  name  of  Alsagoff

Realty  which has issued circulars to the residents  in

Alsagoff Estate asking them

resettlement problem will be very unmanageable  if

Landlord or to pay any deposit before they obtain

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.
