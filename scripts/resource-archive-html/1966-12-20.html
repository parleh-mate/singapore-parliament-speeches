the Constitution of Singapore, I have granted

<div align="center"><b>MONEYLENDERS ORDINANCE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Implementation of provisions)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National  Development whether he is satisfied with  the

implementation  of the provisions in  the  Moneylenders

Ordinance  prohibiting  moneylenders  harassing   their

customers  either at their place of work  or  in  their

homes,  and  what  steps he will take  for  the  better

enforcement of these provisions.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, section 33 of the

Moneylenders Ordinance provides that:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any moneylender, who, either personally or by any

person  acting  on his behalf, harasses or  intimidates

his debtor or any member of the debtor's family at,  or

watches or besets the residence or place of business or

employment  of the debtor, or any place  at  which  the

debtor receives his wages or any other sum periodically

due to him, shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be

liable  on  conviction  to a  fine  not  exceeding  two

hundred  and  fifty dollars, or to imprisonment  for  a

term  not  exceeding three months or to both such  fine

and imprisonment:'



<br><br>I  am  not  satisfied  that the intention  behind  this

section  has  been  achieved. A successful  prosecution

under  this  section would require the debtor  to  give

evidence  that  he has been harassed or intimidated  or

that  his  residence has been besetted  by  a  specific

moneylender.  Unfortunately,  it  would   appear   that

debtors  are  reluctant to come forward  with  specific

complaints.  Since  the  coming  into  force   of   the

Moneylenders Ordinance on the 11th of September,  1959,

there  has  not been one single instance of a  specific

complaint  to  the  Registrar of  Moneylenders  by  any

debtor  to  enable a prosecution to be  launched  under

this  section  of  the  Ordinance.  Amendments  to  the

Moneylenders    Ordinance   are   at   present    under

consideration. One suggestion has been to amend section

33  to  make  the offence a seizable one.  This  is  to

enable  any  registered moneylenders seen loitering  at

doorways  of  Government  departments  and  offices  of

statutory boards and other commercial organisations  to

be  arrested on the spot on the presumption  that  they

are  there  for  the purpose of committing  an  offence

under   this  section.  However,  it  would  still   be

necessary  for debtors to come forth with  evidence  if

convictions are to be obtained.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> A supplementary

question,  Sir,It  is  not because  the  debtors  are

reluctant  to  come forward to give  evidence.  In  the

Government  General Orders, there is a provision  which

prohibits  civil servants from getting themselves  into

debt.  But  it is an open secret today that many  civil

servants are indebted. They are harassed by the  money-lenders  and dare not make a report. Once they  make  a

report, they themselves will get into trouble. If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



Government  can do something about General  Order  158,

probably  the debtors will dare come forward  and  give

evidence.  Is  the  Government  prepared  to  amend  or

withdraw General Order 158?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is more a matter for the Minister

for Finance than the Minister for Law. But, Mr Barker,

do you wish to answer that question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that, as you have put

it,   is  another  question.  Some  years  ago,  if   I

understand the position right, all civil servants  were

given  the opportunity to declare what debts they  had.

After that, they were not supposed to borrow again.  If

a  civil  servant,  after  declaring  his  debts,  gets

further  into debt, then he has only himself to  blame.

But whether or not the relevant Government Order should

or  should not be revoked is surely a matter  which  is

confined only to civil servants. As far as the  general

public  is  concerned, there should be  no  fear  about

making  complaints against money-lenders. But  not  one

other  debtor  -  by other debtor I  mean  a  non-civil

servant - has made any complaint since 1959.

firstly,  why  there is a delay in the payment  of  the

uniform   allowance  to  the  People's  Defence   Force

volunteers. Secondly, why there are no proper  changing

rooms for N.C.O.s and officer cadets at the Beach  Road

Training  Depot.  Thirdly, why  training  depots  often

experience  a shortage of stationery, as  a  result  of

which lesson notes are not provided to trainees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, why the Seletar Range is in a deteriorating

condition.  What steps are being taken  to  remedy  the

situation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, with regard to  the  delay  in  the

payment  of the uniform allowance to P.D.F, volunteers,

this  allowance will be paid as soon as decisions  have

been  made concerning dress regulations for the  P.D.F.

volunteers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next point as to whether there are proper

changing rooms for N.C.O.s and officer cadets at  Beach

Road  Training  Depot,  there are  changing  rooms  for

N.C.O.s and officer cadets at this depot. More adequate

facilities are being considered, but these will have to

be  determined by planning development requirements  in

the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the shortage of stationery in training

depots  as  a  result  of which lesson  notes  are  not

provided  to trainees, all stationery requirements  for

training  depots have been adequately met as  and  when

demanded.   Lesson  notes  are  issued  only   at   the

discretion of instructors, and if they are not  issued,

it  is not because of shortage of paper but because the

inspectors  feel that the trainees should be  energetic

and alert enough to make their own notes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is with regard to the Seletar Range.

It  is  not  only being re-conditioned but it  is  also

being  reorganised to provide more training facilities.

The project is expected to be completed in March 1967.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 10 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is an independent and

sovereign  Republic and we must be prepared  to  defend

our  independence and sovereignty. Although our country

is small, we must have our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



own  Armed Forces, including Volunteer Forces, be  they

large  or  small in number. It is up to us to determine

the size of our Armed Forces according to our means. We

have  the  First and Second Battalions of the Singapore

Infantry  Regiment and, in addition, we have  Volunteer

Forces  and  the People's Defence Force to  defend  our

Republic.   We  still  need  a  Navy  to   patrol   our

territorial waters. Is this vote for 1967 meant for the

establishment of the Singapore Navy? I would  like  the

Minister of State of Defence to inform the House as  to

who  does  the patrolling of our territorial waters  at

the  present  moment.  Earlier on,  I  have  said  that

Singapore  has  two Battalions - the First  and  Second

S.I.R.  -  and  we should be proud of our soldiers  who

fought for our independence when Singapore was part  of

Malaysia.  I  am confident that they will  continue  to

rise  to the occasion in future. But I am sorry to  say

that  these  Regiments  are  housed  in  unsatisfactory

barracks. I believe that the asbestos roof and masonite

walls and the kitchen were erected about 10 or 11 years

ago.  I think the time has arrived for the Minister  of

State  of  Defence to improve the conditions  in  these

barracks  so that the prestige of our Armed  Forces  is

maintained.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the R.S.S.

Panglima and R.S.S. Bedok belonging to our country have

been   patrolling  the  Singapore  Straits  since  14th

November,  1966. However, owing to defects, the  R.S.S.

Bedok  has  not  been operational since  8th  December,

1966.  The R.S.S. Panglima is now the only vessel doing

sea-water defence patrol in the Singapore Straits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the point raised by the Member for Kampong

Kembangan  as  to whether the Government  is  going  to

establish  a  Navy,  we have now  the  Singapore  Naval

Volunteer  Forces,  and they will be  expanded  in  due

course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also spoke of the condition of the S.I.R.

barracks. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not intended to  make

major alterations to buildings at Ulu



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



Pandan since they are beyond economical repair,  and  a

new  home  for  the  First  S.I.R. has  been  planned.

Nevertheless,  officers and men  are  being  given  the

means  to improve their barracks and kitchen on a self-help  basis  as a temporary measure in order  that  the

amenities  can be improved during their temporary  stay

at Ulu Pandan.

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 20 be

reduced by $l00.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that this vote is meant, among other

projects,  for  Works and Buildings and  Furniture  and

Equipment for the University of Singapore, as  well  as

for  Works  and  Buildings,  Scientific  Equipment  and

Library  Books for Nanyang University. A  part  of  the

vote  is  also meant for projects and sports activities

to  be carried out by the Adult Education Board at  the

Adult  Education Centre. This shows that the Government

has  been  paying  great attention to the  problems  of

higher  education and adult education in the  technical

and  academic  fields. If we want  to  have  sufficient

personnel to man every section of production,  we  must

have enough schools to produce engineers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



technicians, artisans, skilled workers, and so  on.  We

are  still short of doctors and the number produced  by

the University of Singapore is still not sufficient  to

meet   local  needs.  So  I  think  that  very  careful

attention  should  be paid to the  development  of  the

Medical Faculty of the University of Singapore so that,

from  next  year  onwards, it will be able  to  produce

enough doctors to meet the requirements of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he has any

intention  to  set up an Aeronautical  Faculty  in  the

University  of  Singapore to train  personnel  for  the

Civil  Aviation  Department. I understand  the  present

personnel  are not locally recruited, and  therefore  I

would  like  to find out from him whether  he  has  any

plans  to  train  local aeronautical personnel  in  the

University  of Singapore so that all the posts  in  the

Civil Aviation Department can be Singaporeanised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the success and progress of an

independent  and  sovereign  country  depend   on   the

availability  of trained and professional  men  in  all

fields. In this respect, the Prime Minister said  at  a

function in connection with Nanyang University on  29th

October,. 1966, that our country needs to produce a new

generation which is well-educated, with a knowledge  of

the  cultural  background of  the  various  races,  and

skilled   in  various  ways  in  order  to   meet   the

requirements  of  our  national  production  -  meaning

people   with  the  technical  know-how  -   and   that

University  students  are the  future  leaders  of  our

society. Therefore, the task of University students  is

very  great  indeed. In the past, they only thought  in

terms  of themselves, but now they have to change their

attitude. At present, they should think in terms of the

future  of  the country. They should realise  that  the

country  has  spent  a  great sum  of  money  on  their

education.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, they owe a debt to the nation. Once they

have   learnt   something,  they  should  place   their

knowledge  and ability at the service of  the  country.

Recently  there  have  been many incidents  in  Nanyang

University.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Before we started today's

proceedings,  I  told  Members  that  we  are  on   the

Development  Estimates  and  that  the  matters  to  be

debated  are  Government's  proposals  for  development

under  the various heads and subheads. Although we  are

now on the Ministry of Education, I do not think it  is

proper  at this stage to talk about the past activities

of students. So I would ask the Member for Sembawang to

try  to  relate  his remarks to matters of  development

rather  than  the  ordinary day-to-day  policy  in  the

Ministry  of  Education or in the  various  educational

establishments?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Sir, I

will not give too many details on what I have said. Let

me  now return to the Adult Education Board. Since last

year  the development of adult education has had  great

success.  There are more than 60,000 students attending

adult   education  classes.  This  is  really  a  great

achievement   in  the  eradication  of  illiteracy   in

Singapore.  So I feel that the setting up of  an  Adult

Education  Centre is very necessary and appropriate  at

this  juncture and that after it has been set  up,  the

Adult Education Board will be better able to carry  out

its  work  and  we  can  score  total  success  in  the

eradication of illiteracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to touch on educational T.V. This is

an  attempt  to try out a new medium of instruction  in

our  country.  According  to the  experience  of  other

countries, educational T.V. has achieved great results.

I  would  like to ask whether the department  concerned

has  any  concrete plan to carry out educational  T.V.,

what   languages  will  he  used  as   the   media   of

instruction,  and  what will be the  contents  of  such

education. I hope the Minister can give details to this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to touch on the Physical Education

Centre. Would I be wrong if I touched on it?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Minister who proposes to

reply  to  the  matters  set out  on  page  18  of  the

Development  Estimates  is  Mr  Ong  Pang  Boon,   the

Minister for Education. Unfortunately,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



the  questions of detail which you are going  into  are

matters  which he may not have come prepared to  reply.

Could  you try to speak on broad policy rather than  on

details  like  the media of instruction in  educational T.V.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if that is

the case, I think the Minister will be very lacking  in

understanding what I have asked about this. Let me  now

talk  in general terms. The Minister seems to know  too

little about what I have asked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask some questions relating to the

setting  up of a Physical Education Centre. I hope  the

Minister can give this House some information.  I  have

some suggestions to make also. Firstly, we must have  a

concrete  plan  and there should also be  a  realistic,

policy. In addition to the setting up of the Centre, we

should  also  have plans to produce  a  set  number  of

sportsmen every year. Secondly, we should have  capable

and experienced people as coaches and other officers in

charge  of  the Physical Education Centre.  Thirdly,  a

practical  programme  should be  mapped  out  to  train

school  boys and school girls, especially during  their

vacation,  in order to produce more able sportsmen  and

sportswomen.  From  the results of our  performance  in

international  games, our standard is too  poor  and  I

hope the Minister can pay attention to this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  indeed  pleased  with  the  keen

interest   shown  by  the  Member  for   Sembawang   in

educational  matters. In fact, I agree with  a  lot  of

what  he has said and I can assure him that my Ministry

will  be doing its best in the coming year when we will

be  shifting the emphasis from quantity to  quality  in

the educational field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the supply of doctors from the

University of Singapore is inadequate to meet the needs

of  Singapore. It is for this reason that the expansion

programme  in  respect of the University  of  Singapore

will be reviewed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



and  reconsidered. In fact, earlier this month  I  have

already    informed   the   University   of   Singapore

authorities that they must plan for an output of  about

three  times  the  present number of doctors  from  the

University  to meet the needs of Singapore as  well  as

other places. So I think that aspect of the problem  is

well  in  hand,  but  the Member for  Sembawang  should

realise  that it takes six years to produce  a  doctor.

Until then a certain shortage will still be there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Department of Civil Aviation, there is no

plan  yet at the moment to create such a department  in

the  University  of  Singapore. There  is,  however,  a

proposal  to set up a separate Technological University

sometime  in the future, and I think this subject  will

be   more  appropriate  for  the  future  Technological

University to consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to set up an Adult Education Centre is

still under consideration. However, this does not  mean

that the adult education classes currently carried  out

in  the various schools will be affected. I agree  with

him that an Adult Education Centre is very necessary to

enable  the  Adult  Education Board  to  function  more

efficiently  and  effectively. However,  the  financial

position of the State is such that this project has  to

be reconsidered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as educational television is concerned, if the

Member for Sembawang was present when the Supplementary

Estimates  for  this  subject were  discussed  in  this

House, he would not have raised that question just now.

But  for  his benefit I might as well tell him  briefly

that  the  languages to be used by the E.T.V, will  be

English  and Chinese in the first instance for  obvious

reasons, and that the subjects offered will be  English

language, Chinese as a second language, Mathematics and

Science.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Physical Education Centre is to replace

the   temporary  accommodation  now  provided  for  the

Physical   Education  Inspectorate  at   the   National

Recreation Centre in Kallang.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



I  agree  with  the  Member that we  should  have  more

specialists,  P.E. instructors  to  train  more   P.E.

teachers for schools, and that students who are good in

P.E. should be properly coached so that in time to come

they  can  take  part in international competitions.  I

think  a  plan  is  afoot  to create  a  Department  of

Physical Education at the Teachers' Training College to

train teachers for the schools, and I hope that as soon

as  finances are available this Department of  Physical

Education will be set up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would

like  to  take  this opportunity to ask a  question  in

connection   with   the   Development   Estimates   for

education,  namely,  the  expenditure  on   Works   and

Buildings  for Nanyang University. Are there  some  new

buildings  to be put up by the Government  for  Nanyang

University, or is the money required for the completion

of existing works?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point also concerns the buildings at Nanyang

University. I would like to know whether there  is  any

long-term  plan for the building of Nanyang University.

I  do not want to criticise the past, but I will try to

relate  the  present and the future with the  past.  We

could  draw  a  lesson  from past mistakes.  There  are

certain  circumstances  which are  not  very  ideal  in

respect of certain buildings at Nanyang University. The

Nanyang  University Library was not built on  a  proper

basis.  A  big hall was built. Later on some classrooms

were built and it was found that they were too small so

that  the  walls separating the classrooms  had  to  be

broken  down in order to have bigger classrooms.  These

are past mistakes. I do not know whether the Government

has a better plan for the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

Nanyang University has not been able to draw up a blue-print  for its future expansion. The provision  in  the

conversion   of  existing  hostels  and  quarters   for

students and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>

construction and present it to the University  has  not

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is the provision in the 1967

primary  school  at Hindoo Road? This  school  was  not

built  in  1965,  as was pledged by  the  Minister  for

Education, and in accordance with the letter  from  the

URSC  dated 10th August, 1964. The school was also  not

built  in 1966, as was pledged by the Minister of State

for  Education in this Chamber on 30th December,  1965,

in the debate on the Development Estimates for 1966.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a primary school

was scheduled to be built at Hindoo Road under the 1966

restricted  site,  a multi-storey building  had  to  be

designed.  This  increased the estimated  cost  of  the

building  to  $700,000, which was about  $260,000  more

than  the  average  cost  of  a  standard-size  primary

school.  This  revised  cost  did  not  meet  with  the

approval  of  the Finance Ministry and, therefore,  the

project was dropped. However, land will be available in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister for

some information about the development of secondary and

technical education. Where is he going to build the new

secondary and vocational schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to add certain comments on

this  item. According to present plans, the  siting  of

schools is concentrated in certain areas. For instance,

in  the Mountbatten Constituency there are no less than

20  to  30  schools. The allocation of  the  sites  for

schools  is  not  equitable.  Students  living  in  the

neighbouring  constituencies have to pay for  transport

to go to the schools in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is that there are too few schools

in the rural areas. For example, in my own constituency

of  Sembawang, there are too few schools. I would  like

the  Minister to pay attention to this matter. I  would

also  like  to ask whether Sembawang or Nee  Soon  will

have  any secondary schools or vocational schools under

the development plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is this. According to the present

policy,  only  two years' training will be  allowed  to

students  in  the secondary vocational  schools.  After

this, they will have to leave school regardless of  the

result.  But  we must not forget that, on the  average,

the age of the students is about 16 years. So how do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



you  expect  16-year old boys to get  employment  after

leaving  school?  I  would like  to  ask  the  Minister

whether  he is prepared to extend vocational  education

by  one  year. The students will thus have three years'

vocational  education so that when  they  leave  school

they will reach the age of 18. This is a better age for

seeking   employment.   This  will   give   them   more

opportunity in competing in life.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  I  would  like to speak  on  two  development

programmes  in  this  head. The first  point  has  some

similarity  to the suggestion given by the  Member  for

Sembawang. However, he is a little selfish, because  he

only  wants a school for his own Sembawang area.  I  am

putting myself on a different footing. The first  point

is  that  I would like the Minister to tell this  House

whether he has paid any attention to the development of

schools  in the rural areas. I believe if we have  more

secondary schools in the rural areas, then this will go

a  long way towards raising the educational standard of

the  rural people. At the same time, it will go a  step

further  towards implementing a very important item  in

the   P.A.P. manifesto  which  aims  at  raising   the

educational standard of the rural people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. I would like to know what

plans  are being proposed to build halls and gymnasiums

in  the new schools, and whether extensive use of  such

places  in  the school buildings will be made.  I  have

recently  visited several school halls. They  all  look

very  grand.  But in practice they are not  very  good.

They are very expensive. Some cost about $400,000 each.

They are only good for show but are of not much use  in

practice.  In  some  cases, they  are  not  useful  for

sports,  because the ceilings are too low or  the  hall

lengths  are inadequate for their purposes. If the  new

school buildings under the school development programme

will make adequate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



provision  for  school  halls  of  a  practical  nature

instead of for show, they will be more useful.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> May I ask the Minister

for  Education  whether he has under consideration  any

plans  for  building a secondary school in  the  Farrer

Park  area? There is a big ground available and  it  is

not profitably used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while I agree

that  the  distribution of schools should  always  take

into consideration the interests of the students in the

city  as well as students living in the rural area,  it

has  not  always been possible to do so for the  simple

reason  that  land  in the city area  is  difficult  to

acquire.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rural areas sometimes suitable sites are

either  occupied  by  squatters,  or  for  some  reason

acquisition of the sites will entail considerable time.

Therefore, we have to site our schools depending on the

demand  as  well as the sites available. For next  year

secondary  schools  are proposed to  be  built  at  the

following sites:



<pre>

              (1) Chestnut Drive,

                      which is in the rural area.

              (2) Junction of Crescent and Dun-man Roads.

              (3) Linden  Drive,

                      I think, is also  in  the  rural area.

              (4) Lowland Road,

                      also in the rural area.

              (5) Jalan Bukit Merah.

              (6) Junction of Sennet and Upper East Coast Roads,

                      which is also in the rural area.

              (7) Toa Payoh -

                      I am not certain whether it is going to be rural or urban now.

              (8) Mount Vernon,

                      which is another rural area.

              (9) Jalan Hwi Yoh,

                      another rural area.

             (10) Tiong Bahru sewerage site.

             (11) Tiong Bahru fire site.

             (12) Changi Road 6¾ m.s.,

                      another rural area.

             (13) Toa Payoh.

</pre>



<br><br>From  the  list of school sites that have been approved

for  next year, Mr Speaker, Sir, you will notice  that

most  of  the  schools, in fact, will be sited  in  the

rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are no plans for the building of

secondary schools in the Sembawang area in 1967,  there

is  a  proposal to convert the existing Naval Base Full

School into a secondary school and for extensions to be

built  to  enable the school to increase the  secondary

school enrolment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that education in the present secondary

vocational  schools lasts for two years only  and  that

the  students will have to leave at the end of  a  two-year  course.  But  the  Member  for  Sembawang  should

realise  that  our present minimum school-leaving  age,

which  is  16, is one of the highest in the  world.  In

fact,  in the United Kingdom the minimum school-leaving

age  is  15.  While everybody would like to keep  their

children in school for as long as possible, I think  it

is  just  financially not possible to raise the school-leaving age to 18.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Paya Lebar that our

school halls should be designed for multi purposes.  In

fact, the new school halls are so designed, apart  from

gymnastic equipment provided for in the new halls, that

many other indoor games can also be played in the halls

e.g., badminton, sepak raga -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Basketball?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes, basketball, in the halls of

Member  for Paya Lebar and we will always pay attention

to  this  aspect,  and we will try to ensure  that  all

schools will make full use of these new halls.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 22 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, under this head the vote is

$580,020  for the development mainly of the  Queenstown

Vocational  Institute.  At the  present  juncture,  our

country  is  industrialising  quite  progressively  and

successfully.  So  we require, as a matter  of  course,

more technical personnel for our industrial growth  and

to  man  our factories. But the vote for next  year  is

only  $580,020.  I would like to ask the  Minister  why

only a small vote is asked for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is this. As far as I am aware, there

are  vacancies in the vocational institutes. I  do  not

know  whether this is true or not. If it is  true,  can

the  Minister explain whether he proposes to  fill  the

vacancies so that every place is fully made use of  and

so  that  more students will be encouraged  to  receive

education in the vocational institutes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question I would like to ask the Minister is

whether  he  is  aware  of the  actual  development  of

vocational  education and whether he is satisfied  with

the progress so far.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, most of the

extension work to the Singapore Vocational Institute at

Balestier Road will be completed round about this  year

and the next. It is envisaged that not all the work can

be  completed this year and, therefore, a provision  of

$300,000 only is entered in the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the Jurong Vocational Institute of

Engineering and the Queenstown Vocational Institute of

Manual and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



Applied  Arts  are  concerned, they are  still  in  the

planning  stage.  It  is  not expected  that  extensive

construction work can be carried out by the end of next

year.  Therefore, only $100,000 has been  provided  for

each of these institutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that there are vacancies in our secondary

technical schools, for the simple reason that technical

education  is  something  new  and  parents  are  still

reluctant  to choose secondary technical education  for

their children. However, from the trend in the past few

years,  I  think  we  can foresee that  more  and  more

parents will in future send their children to technical

schools.  Of  course, it is possible to  fill  all  the

vacancies  in  the technical schools  by  refusing  the

parents  any choice. We can do so quite simply by  just

channelling  students to technical schools or  academic

type  of schools or commercial schools as we think fit.

It  is  possible that we may come to that stage if  the

response  from  the parents to send their  children  to

technical  schools  is  not  forthcoming.  But  I   can

anticipate  that when we decide for the parents,  there

will  be considerable criticism and resistance. I  hope

the  Member  for Sembawang then will stand up  for  the

Ministry of Education.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>

with the Teachers' Training College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to pay more attention to

the training of teachers. Has he got any concrete plans

in  the future to ensure that the teachers trained  are

really dedicated to education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in future, trainees will have to

pay  for  their training in the T.T.C. I would like  to

ask  how  much  will be the fees for each  student  per

year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the extensions

to  the  T.T.C., for which a million dollars  has  been

asked,  were started in the middle of 1965 and are  due

for  completion next year. They include  a  four-storey

teaching  block  containing  a  lecture  room,  a  T.V.

studio,  a Domestic Science room, Science laboratories,

workshops and language laboratories, a library, a  hall

and  a  gymnasium.  These extensions  will  enable  the

T.T.C. to  provide  training  courses  for  specialist

teachers  who  are required for secondary  schools  and

will  help  to improve the quality of teacher training.

The  introduction  of  closed  circuit  television  for

teacher  training is of significant importance  in  our

efforts to improve teacher training.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the mass recruitment of teachers and

the  continuation of the part-time training of teachers

have  been  largely responsible for  our  inability  to

improve the quality of our teachers and the standard of

teaching in our schools. It is for this reason that  we

are  introducing full-time training on  a  small  scale

beginning from this year. Under this full-time training

system,  a fee of $120 per annum for each student  will

be  charged.  But bursaries of $600 per  year  will  be

awarded to poor students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the hon. Member, consideration

is being given to the planning of courses for full-time

teacher  training and also the possibility of extending

the  period  of full-time training from  two  to  three

years. We think that with the introduction of the three-year  full-time training, the quality of  our  teachers

will definitely show a marked improvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 30 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have given this idea of an Institute of

Medical Specialities a great deal of thought and I must

say  that  I  cannot reconcile myself to the impression

that  the  medical  progress in  this  country  can  be

assured  only if the number of super-duper specialities

is developed. Perhaps one could consider it progress if

there  were  enough trained and experienced specialists

to  take  over  the  running and  supervision  of  such

medical  specialities. Alas, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  have

looked  around  our  200 square miles,  and  I  am  not

convinced  at all, at the moment, that there  are  such

specialists   available,   with   the   exception    of

specialists in radiotherapy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no objection to the

building of a Radiotherapy Isotope Centre, as there  is

no  doubt at all that this country is in dire  need  of

such  a centre and we have the specialists who can  man

this  centre  efficiently and who can  render  valuable

services to the patients in need of such therapy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want it to be understood, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I

am  not against the Medical Progress Fund, as I have  a

lot  of  praise  for the good people of  Singapore  who

responded so generously to the appeal launched  by  the

Chairman and members of the Progress Fund Committee. In

fact,  they  have already collected $3  million  and  I

suggest  that this Committee should continue  with  the

good  work  and  appeal  for more  donations  so  that,

instead   of   building   an   Institute   of   Medical

Specialities, the authorities could use the $3  million

as  a  start  towards the development of  a  University

Medical   Centre,   that  is,  a  University   Teaching

Hospital.   This   University   Medical   Centre    can

incorporate  into  its structure not only  the  various

disciplines required for the training of future medical

practitioners,  but  also all the medical  specialities

envisaged  by  the  organisers of the Medical  Progress

Fund.  Once this centre is established, then  the  city

will have more hospital beds to look after the sick and

help  to  relieve  the congestion in  the  General  and

Kandang Kerbau Hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although Singapore is one of the

smallest  nations in the world, we have a lot  of  very

intelligent and able young undergraduates and graduates

of medicine, and we should use every available means to

encourage our young men and women in medicine to  bloom

and  blossom  so that one day we may number  among  our

graduates at least one Nobel Prize winner for medicine.

If  the authorities accept my suggestion and go all out

for  a  Medical Centre, then our young graduates should

be  encouraged now to take up the necessary branches of

specialisation so that once the centre is ready,  there

will  not  be  any  lack of medical  men  to  fill  the

necessary appointments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our country with a population of

nearly  two million has a singular lack of general  and

maternity  hospitals.  The  result  of  this  lack   is

reflected   in  the  very  small  number   of   trained

specialists  of  one type or another. I  realise,  Sir,

that the Medical Departments of both the University and

of  the  Ministry of Health have received complimentary

remarks from various visitors who are experts in  their

fields.  Surely,  Sir,  no  matter  how  sincere  these

remarks  might  have  been,  we  cannot  afford  to  be

complacent  and bury our heads in the sand.  We  cannot

disguise the fact that Singapore will require many more

hospitals  than  what we now have  and  the  University

Medical  Centre  will represent not only  a  tremendous

step  forward in meeting the public's demand  for  more

beds  and more specialists, but also a step forward  in

our medical progress.

University and who, unfortunately, left it for  private

practice  before I became the Minister  for  Health  in

1963. So that I do have to pay great attention to  what

he has to say on medicine and medical progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Joo Chiat is also,

fortunately, an honorary consultant to the Ministry  of

Health,  besides  being the President  of  the  Medical

Council.  So  I  am speaking to one  who  is  really  a

specialist  in  his  field and I am  just  an  ordinary

layman.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full sympathy with most of his remarks, but I

would  like  to  give a little background  on  how  the

Institute of Medical Specialities came to be born.  The

Member for Joo Chiat has rightly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



pointed out that he is all in support of the speciality

of Radiotherapy Isotope Centre. It was actually part of

Government's plan to establish this centre. In fact, it

has  been so for a number of years. It was in the First

Development  Plan for 1960-64, but, unfortunately,  for

some  reason or other, it was not implemented,  but  we

did  intend to go ahead with it this year. We had a sum

of  $1.7 million earmarked for the establishment  of  a

new Radiotherapy Centre, shall I put it that way, as we

do  have a very small and rather out-of-date centre  at

the  moment  which  is doing its best with  out-of-date

equipment in the Outram Road General Hospital.  It  was

then  that  the  Medical Faculty of the  University  of

Singapore  were  thinking of what to do to  commemorate

their Diamond Jubilee. I think they originally had  the

idea  of a very modest extension to the medical library

for  a sum of about $700,000-odd, and they already  had

in  hand a grant from the China Medical Board for  this

particular  project. They wanted to be  more  ambitious

and  thought  that perhaps it was time to consider  the

project  of an Institute of Medical Specialities.  They

therefore held consultations with our Ministry so  that

their  ideas  could be grafted on to  our  Radiotherapy

Isotope Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were glad that the University was prepared to

discuss matters of development with the Ministry.  This

was  a  great improvement compared to a few years  back

when the University authorities thought they would just

draw  up a plan for development on their own. That  was

in  1962 when they drew up a very ambitious plan of $40

million,  half of which ($20 million) would  be  for  a

Teaching  Hospital. But, unfortunately,  there  was  no

prior  consultation between the University  and  either

the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Health, so

that Government could not support this rather ambitious

plan  of $40 million and I am afraid it did not have  a

very long life. They did try to go out on their own  to

get funds, and they probably got less than one per cent

of their target.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we had the University of Singapore authorities at

the  end  of 1964 coming for consultation with  us  and

wanting  to  incorporate a number of specialities.  The

approved  specialities were neurology and neurosurgery,

kidney  diseases, and blood diseases,  genetics  and  a

psychology  unit, gastro-enterology, endocrinology  and

an intensive care unit. These were ultimately accepted,

as  I  have  said, for grafting on top of our  proposed

Radiotherapy  Isotope Centre. All in all,  it  came  to

just  around  $4  million.  That  was  how  this  joint

project,  shall we say, was presented to the public  as

part and parcel of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations  of

the  Medical  School in Singapore.  By  adding  on  the

extension  to  the medical library of $¾  million,  the

joint   target  for  the  Medical  Progress  Fund   was

therefore  $4.75 million, with the Government  agreeing

to back this proposal dollar for dollar up to a maximum

of $2 million for the Institute of Medical Specialities

itself,  plus  another one-half of $¾ million  for  the

extension to the medical library.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad to say that this project captured the

imagination  of  the public in Singapore  so  that  the

response  was  exceedingly good. The figure  ultimately

donated  or  pledged to be given to the  University  of

Singapore  for the Medical Progress Fund (some  of  the

amounts pledged are to be paid in instalments over a 3-year period) has exceeded its original target of $2.375

million  for the University of Singapore. And  I  think

the  Member for Joo Chiat has mentioned that they  have

actually got something like over $3 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say that the conception of the

Institute of Medical Specialities is really a  move  on

the  part of the University of Singapore to join  hands

with  the  Government in building something  which,  in

their  view,  is necessary and which, in our  view,  is

really part and parcel of our own development. I  think

it  is  sometimes necessary not to impose  Government's

views  too much on the University of Singapore  because

we  would like them to be able to let us know what they

think their development should be, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



then  we  would  give  them all the necessary  support,

sometimes financially and sometimes morally.  From  the

point of view of Government then, we have moved on from

having  to  provide the sum of $1.7 million  by  adding

another $600,000-odd to a sum of $2.3 million for  this

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of a separate Teaching Hospital for

the  University, I was originally of the view  that  it

was  not  necessary, because if our Medical School  has

done  so well with what it has, that is to say,  making

full  use of the facilities that are available  in  our

Outram Road General Hospital for the last 60 years, the

conception of a separate Teaching Hospital is something

which  perhaps could be considered a luxury, especially

if  one  is  presented with the idea  that  a  Teaching

Hospital  would  come  to as much  as  $20  million  as

conceived by the University authorities in 1962. But if

it were something more modest, then I think there would

be  great  advantages if there were a separate Teaching

Hospital,  because I am beginning to find that  in  the

Outram  Road General Hospital we are having  a  lot  of

complications  because the University  uses  Government

facilities.  The administration, the staff,  everything

is Government. The University staff are just grafted on

to  a Government department and they appear to have the

best of both worlds.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.07 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it suits them, the University talk of research.

But there are service functions to be performed. So our

Government   officials   of   doctors,   surgeons   and

specialists  who  work shoulder to  shoulder  with  the

University  officers always find that, for some  reason

or  other,  the University staff always  appear  to  be

getting  the  best  of all worlds,  whether  it  is  in

salary,   perks,   leave  of  absence,   study   leave,

consultation  fees, holidays - a long string  of  perks - and the Government officials feel that they are always

the   worse  off.  I  think  that  is  not   good   for

administration or morale. But I am cheered to find that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



the  doctors  and  surgeons who are now  in  Government

service are of very good material and are holding their

own with the University staff. For example, at the last

Surgeons'  Seminar for the Asian Pacific Region,  which

was sponsored by the Academy of Medicine, there were as

many  Government  doctors who  were  taking  charge  of

sessions as there were University officers. Whereas  in

the  past,  I  think  it used to be  led  generally  by

University  personnel. It has been one of my  functions

during  the  last  three  years  to  try  to  make  our

Government  officials in the service  feel  proud  that

they are as good as the University staff in all fields.

It  so  happens that some of them are more academically

inclined  and,  therefore, choose a University  career,

whereas  those who are in Government service are  doing

an  excellent job in their posts. So I do  say  that  I

have  now come to the point where I think it is  highly

desirable that the University of Singapore ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> The  Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock)</b>: May I  inform  the

Minister that he has a minute more to wind up?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Thank you, Sir,I am all in favour

now  that  the University of Singapore should have  its

own  Teaching Hospital with its own teaching facilities

and be responsible for administering and running it. In

fact,  I  have been thinking of forming a committee  to

see  to the demarcation of Outram Road General Hospital

so  that one section of the hospital will be hived  off

for  the  University to look after it,  and  that  this

committee should be set up very soon.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

Minister's explanation, I wish to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 30 be

reduced by $100.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi and Madam Chan Choy Siong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vote under this Head is $1,894,070, mainly

to  set  up  a  Static  X'Ray Unit,  the  provision  of

furniture  and  equipment  for  the  Nurses'   Training

School, and to expand the facilities and equipment  for

the Medical School.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that our medical services can be

considered as the best in the whole of South-East Asia.

The   annual  vote  for  medical  services   has   been

increasing  every  year. We know that  at  present  our

Government has eleven different types of hospitals,  31

clinics and 5 mobile clinics which are mainly to  serve

the  rural people. Because of the Government's  efforts

in  this field, the health of the people has been  well

taken  care of. This can be said to be the good fortune

of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this head I would like to ask the Minister two

questions.  Firstly,  when will  the  building  of  the

Institute of Medical Specialities be started  and  when

will  it  be  completed? What type of service  will  it

provide for our people? Secondly, about the training of

nurses and the subjects to be taught. Will the subjects

taught  include courtesy? What will be the Government's

plan  on  the subjects to be taught? I hope members  of

the public will be able to praise the nurses instead of

accusing or criticising them for their bad attitude  as

in the past.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I would like to know

from the Minister for Health whether in the Development

Estimates  for  1967  there is  any  plan  to  build  a

hospital in the eastern area near the Kampong Kembangan

Constituency.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask a question under  the

vote   for   the  expansion  of  hospitals  and   other

facilities. Why could the vote not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



also  be used in the building of clinics? In the  past,

we  received replies from the Minister that he  had  no

plans  to set up clinics in certain areas. I feel  that

to  people  working in certain areas the  expansion  of

clinics  and  medical services is  very  necessary  for

their   convenience.  There  are  not  enough  clinical

services because the people in various places  are  not

adequately  served  with clinics. The  Minister  should

understand  that,  in  the  course  of  development  of

Singapore  through  urban  renewal,  there  have   been

concentrations of population in certain areas  and  the

density  of the population in the rural areas has  also

increased  accordingly.  The  answers  given   by   the

Minister  in the past are not quite valid  now.  It  is

wrong  to say that, because certain clinics are set  up

in  some areas, so the people from other areas can also

go  to  them  to  get  medical treatment.  That  is  an

incorrect conception. The Minister also gave a reply in

similar  vein  to my query about postal  services  some

time  ago. Now the Minister's answer in respect of  the

medical  services is just the same. He says  there  are

clinics  available,  just as he  answered  my  previous

query about postal services. The most densely populated

areas are Queenstown, Tiong Bahru and Bukit Ho Swee. In

these  areas  at present the existing clinics  are  too

small  to  give any efficient service. Yet our Minister

thinks  that  they can still provide  services  to  our

people.  I myself have gone for on-the-spot inspections

and  found that there used to be people queueing up and

waiting  to  be examined by the doctors. At  first  the

people  queueing  up  might  have  merely  some   minor

illness,  but  when they were finally examined  by  the

doctors, their illness would have become more serious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I have some suggestions to make. I hope the

Minister  will  try to solve the present situation.  He

has  said that the main problem confronting the medical

services  is the shortage of doctors. Possibly  because

of  this the services provided by the clinics are  also

affected.  I  would like to ask him whether  there  are

private doctors who are willing to spend some of  their

time to serve the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



patients.  If there are, is he willing to accept  their

offer  of services? It seems that he has said  that  he

wanted  to  accept such services, but that the  private

doctors  are  not  allowed to accept remuneration.  The

Minister  should  not expect private  doctors  to  meet

expenses  out  of their own pocket. If  some  financial

solution  can  be found, then it will  be  possible  to

solve many problems confronting the Ministry of Health.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> May I, Mr Speaker, Sir, attempt

to answer the Members in the order in which they spoke?

Firstly,  the Member for Sembawang. I believe he  wants

two   questions  answered:  firstly,  when   will   the

Institute  of Medical Specialities be built? It  should

have  been  built much earlier because  the  foundation

ceremony  was  performed  quite  some  time  ago.  But,

unfortunately, like most building projects, they always

want  new  additions and try to get new  ideas.  I  was

trying  to explain to the Member for Joo Chiat how  the

Institute  of Medical Specialities came into being.  It

is  a  nine-storey structure to be built on top of  our

Radiotherapy Centre which will form the ground and  the

first  few floors. Our Radiotherapist actually had  the

advantage  of  going round the world,  under  a  W.H.O.

scholarship, to see various radiotherapy centres.  That

is   a  good  idea  because  we  will  be  spending   a

considerable sum of money, and if we can get  the  best

ideas  after visiting a few centres, then  we  will  be

able  to  keep abreast of scientific progress  and  not

make  mistakes  which were made by other  people.  Just

when  I thought he had settled down, another offer came

from  Australia and off again he went there for another

few  months, and so the matter was delayed. But I  hear

that piling will get started next month. So we are well

on  our  way  to  making some progress. I  believe  the

Member for Sembawang also indicated what would be found

in this institute and what it would provide for. I have

indicated  just  now to the Member for  Joo  Chiat  the

various  specialities, and if it is necessary,  I  will

repeat  again.  The units that will be housed  in  this

Institute of Medical Specialities will be radiotherapy,

cardiology



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



and cardiac surgery, neurology and neuro-surgery,

units  for kidney diseases and blood diseases; genetics

and  psychology units, gastro-enterology, endocrinology

and an intensive care unit after surgery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question is in respect of the extension to

our  Nurses' Training School in the Outram Road General

Hospital.  We  are  moving so  fast  and  expanding  so

rapidly  that I think we must also expand our  training

facilities  for our nurses. With this extension,  which

is  being provided for next year, we should be able  to

have  a  larger intake of nurses and train them ---  it

takes  three  years  to  train a  nurse  ---  and  also

increase our intake of students for this purpose.  Also

for  purposes of expansion as we are going to have more

hospitals. I will have to defer going into that  a  bit

in order to answer the other Members concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of courtesy for nurses, it is really

part  and  parcel  of their training  to  be  kind  and

courteous. But everyone is human. We all say we want to

be   kind,   to  be  nice,  and  to  smile  under   all

difficulties;  but  being human  sometimes  we  do  not

smile. I do not think we can expect a hundred per  cent

from   anyone.  I  think  we  will  be  expecting   the

impossible.  Of  course,  it  does  not  mean  that  we

tolerate  rudeness and incivility from not only  nurses

but  anybody. If there is any complaint and it  can  be

proved  that  they really go out of  their  way  to  be

unkind   and   uncivil,  then  they  come   under   the

Disciplinary  Code  and  disciplinary  action  will  be

taken,  sometimes with a strong verbal warning and,  if

it  is being repeated, a written warning, and later  on

perhaps  a stoppage of increment, and finally,  if  the

people are still impossible, then they get the sack. We

expect  all civil servants to show courtesy. But  there

are sometimes extenuating circumstances and we have  to

be  reasonable. I think not all members of  the  public

are angels either. Sometimes they demand the impossible

and  we  have to be fair to our staff. If it can really

be proved that our staff



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



are  going to the limit, then I say they deserve to  be

rapped.  But  I  am  not  prepared  just  to  jump   to

conclusions  and  say  any  complaint  is  a  justified

complaint. It has to be looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now come to the Member for Kampong Kembangan

who  is  interested  to know whether  the  Ministry  of

Health  has in mind the building of a hospital  on  the

eastern  side  of Singapore Island. Yes,  we  have  the

intention  to build another hospital there.  It  should

form  part of the Second Five-Year Plan, 1966 to  1970.

This  Second  Five-Year Plan has yet to  be  published.

Anyway, this project is accepted as being part  of  the

Plan. It might be built probably late in the sixties  -

1968  or  1969. So I can assure the Member for  Kampong

Kembangan  that a hospital is coming up  there  and  it

might be a 700-bed hospital.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally there was a site off Guillemard Road. But

I understand we have been pushed out of there in favour

of  another  Ministry, and so we are  now  looking  for

another site. There is a site available off Bedok - which

is probably closer to Kampong Kembangan than if it were

stationed in Guillemard Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Member for Delta who still makes a

plea   for   increasing   the  number   of   outpatient

dispensaries. I think she keeps on reminding me that my

answers  are  all wrong and evidently her requests  are

all  right, which is not the case. It is all very well,

Mr Speaker, Sir, to say. "We must have dispensaries to

look  after the poor people," and things like that.  We

understand  all  these things, but we have  got  to  be

practical. Here is a little island of 200 square  miles

and a population of 2 million. There are 500 doctors in

private   practice  all  over  the  island.  Government

already  has 26 outpatient dispensaries, some with  one

doctor,  some  with two doctors, some with  three,  and

some  even  with five, seven, or eight doctors  to  man

them.  This has tied up nearly 70 doctors to look after

26



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



outpatient  dispensaries and to  treat  common  coughs,

colds  and  tummy aches after dinner.  70  doctors  can

staff one good-sized hospital. So I say that as long as

we  do  not  have  as many doctors as we  want  in  our

service, the first need is for doctors to be posted  to

hospitals  to deal with the acutely ill cases.  I  will

keep  on saying that, as long as I am the Minister  for

Health,  I  have  decided  to  stop  establishing   new

outpatient dispensaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 22 of the Development Estimates, Sir, there

is  a subhead, No. 201, which mentions a polyclinic  at

Pasir  Panjang.  I may appear to be talking  at  cross-purposes. The building of this polyclinic, which  is  a

combination of an outpatient dispensary and a  maternal

child  health  centre, is really something  that  I  am

building  in  order  to  close down  one  old-fashioned

outpatient dispensary in Pasir Panjang, which is  in  a

shop-house, and a maternal child health centre in Buona

Vista.  This  is where the National Training  Institute

is.  In fact, the National Training Institute wants  to

take  over  this maternal child health centre  and  has

asked  us to buzz off. I have said that I will  readily

do  so  if  I can find another place to move  over.  So

subhead 201 will be to build something in place of what

is  now  available.  So there is  nothing  new  in  the

development of another outpatient dispensary. And I say

that it will be a long time before we can consider  the

building  of  more  outpatient  dispensaries  when   we

already  have  26 outpatient dispensaries available  to

the people throughout the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards private doctors wanting to help in the

outpatient  dispensaries, this  is  nothing  new,  Sir,

because  the  offer has always been a standing  one.  I

think we pay them something like $40 per session of two

hours.  We have a few of them. Off-hand, I think  there

are  about three or four who have given their  services

and  are being made use of. If the Member for Delta has

any friends of hers who are private doctors and who are

prepared  to  come and help - I am not asking  for  free

service,  I am not asking them to prescribe  their  own

medicines and so on for the poor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



public  - we are prepared to pay them. I will  be  very

happy  indeed  if  the  Member for  Delta  can  suggest

friends of hers who are prepared to do this service. Of

course, we will be glad to have them. This is a  system

which  the Malaysian Government has copied from us.  We

have  had it for the last four or five years. They  are

just  starting it and we wish them luck. So I can  only

say that if we can get as many doctors as we want, then

we  will  have to decide on our priorities and,  to  my

mind,  the  priorities are that the doctors  should  go

first to hospitals, and when we have enough of hospital

beds to look after the acutely sick, maybe we can think

in terms of building more outpatient dispensaries. But,

in  my  view,  there are more than adequate  Government

outpatient dispensaries for a long time to come.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I merely

want  to  clarify two points raised by the Minister.  I

never  meant  to  say  that the answers  given  by  the

Minister  are wrong. But because he is too  preoccupied

with his work, he might have neglected certain aspects.

I  gave  an  example that last time  when  I  raised  a

question about postal services, he answered in the  sam

way,  that  in  these areas there were  already  postal

services. But he did not consider or carefully read the

report  submitted to him. The postal services  provided

at  those  places  are inadequate and cannot  meet  the

needs  of  the  population there.  There  has  been  no

development in the postal services. In the Tiong  Bahru

Post Office, some years ago the population was small ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, I do not think you should

go into details about post offices now.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I was just

same situation, as the Minister has -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> A point of clarification. I hope

she  is  not  suggesting that I  have  not  visited  my

outpatient dispensaries.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think she was suggesting

anything of that sort, Mr Yong. Madam Chan.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I meant to

say  was  that  the clinics are also  very  small  - too

small, in fact.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Because she is trying to say that

in  another case, where she mentioned post offices, the

Parliamentary  Secretary  had  not  visited  the   post

offices and only got reports. But I have visited  every

outpatient dispensary. I know what I am talking about.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not want this to develop into a

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, since the Minister has touched on subhead 201, can

I be allowed to touch on the Nurses' Training School?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, in broad policy terms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> I see under subhead 301 that provision

has  been  made for 1967 for a Nurses' Training  School

amounting to $250,000. If this Training School  is  for

the  purpose of training assistant nurses, I am of  the

view that this subhead should be deleted, as there  are

at  present in the Republic of Singapore facilities for

training  assistant nurses. There are more nurses  than

the Government can absorb in the hospitals. But if this

Training  School is for the purpose of  training  staff

nurses,  I fully support the inclusion of this subhead,

as  the  hospitals  in  Singapore  are  experiencing  a

shortage of staff nurses. Further. Mr Speaker, Sir, is

the  Minister  aware  that  many  nurses,  after  being

promoted  to be staff nurses, leave Government  service

and look for employment elsewhere? Is it because of the

very unreasonable salary that is being paid to them?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I would like to say to the Member

for  Telok Blangah that I have got his support, because

this  is  an  extension  for the  Outram  Road  General

Hospital  Nurses'  School which  trains  staff  nurses,

which  means those who are admitted for training  after

getting their School Certificate. But I will not accept

that part of his speech where he says that if this were

to  be  an  extension to the building of the  Assistant

Nurses'  Training School, then he would  object  to  it

because  there  is  ample room  for  trained  assistant

nurses.  Why  he probably jumps to that  conclusion  is

that  some assistant nurses have been asked to  wait  a

while   before   they   are  put   on   the   permanent

establishment   because  of  certain  difficulties   of

placing staff. But I want to say that assistant  nurses

are playing a very good role in our hospitals and there

is  room not only for trained assistant nurses hut also

for nurses who qualify as staff nurses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the fact that staff nurses are poorly paid, I

would  not  like to make any comments on  this  because

that  is  being considered by the Salaries  Commission.

But  if  they  do  leave, I suppose  after  being  well

trained, they will make very eligible wives and I think

the Member for Telok Blangah has one!

by $10 in respect of subhead 901.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this subhead is on markets. In the

original provision for the years 1966 to 1970, a sum of

$1,700,000 was earmarked for the development of markets

and  the revised figure was reduced to $680,000. May  I

inquire  from  the  Minister  whether  development   of

markets  includes  those  built  by  the  Housing   and

Development  Board? Also what is the  reason  for  this

reduction  in  the  provision for  the  development  of

markets, and where will the markets be provided for for

the year 1967?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another point I wish to raise with

the Minister is the old market at Raffles Square.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Lau Pasar, that is right. In view

of  the  valuable  land  this market  is  occupying,  I

believe  it is uneconomic to have the market  here.  Is

there  any plan to develop that area for a more  useful

purpose,  possibly rebuilding the market to  house  all

the eating stalls for all the office workers around the

city?

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, under subhead 901 in

respect of Markets, the original estimate for 1966-1970

was $1,700,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rodrigues, Mr Lim has raised that

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> I will touch on my point, Mr Speaker.

From  my own experience, hawkers seem to fight  shy  of

markets or of making use of them. The inference is that

there are insufficient



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



markets to accommodate all the hawkers, with the result

that hawkers' stalls are set up in spaces allocated  to

parks.   The  other  inference  is  that  markets   are

superfluous because hawkers do not want to make use  of

them am of the opinion that an investigation should  be

made  as to whether markets are inadequate to meet  the

needs  of  hawkers,  in which case the  provision  this

subhead should be increased, whether the hawkers do not

make  of them, in which case it is unnecessary to  make

any financial provision markets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I

would  like to compliment the two Members on their  shi

eyes in detecting a large provision the Five-Year Plan,

1966-1970, and very small provision for next year which

is not quite in proportion if it is divided by five.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that when the Second Five-Year Development

Plan  for  1966-1970  was originally prepared,  there  was

change  in  policy. This sum of $1.7 million  was  entered

into  the Plan the basis that the previous policy would

be  continued. The previous policy the time was one  of

acquisition  of  land and probably the construction  of

ten  Government markets over a few years each of  which

would  cost  something like $200,000 to  $300,000,  and

would  be  able to cater for only 150 haw  stalls.  But

early this year, it was decided to review the situation

and now it has been decided ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yong, may intervene to say that we

are two minus short of the guillotine time for Head 21?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I will try to finish in two

sentences. There has been a change in policy and it now

a case of the Housing and Development Board undertaking

all   major  development  in  Singapore,  be  it  urban

renewal,  etc., and it will built shopping  centres  as

well as ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yong, I am quite wrong. We have ten

minutes more, I am sorry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I will find it hard to extend my

speech to ten more minutes! But I will do my best.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong will probably be grateful

because the next amendment is his!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I was saying that there has

been a change of policy and it is not necessary now for

the  Government  to  build  markets.  It  will  be  the

responsibility of the Housing and Development Board  to

build markets in addition to the building of flats  and

shopping  centres.  So the burden has  been  gratefully

taken away from the Ministry of Health. In fact, should

the Housing and Development Board want to take over the

hawkers  in  the housing estates, we say.  "Please  do.

Thank you very much."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the number of markets that will be built next

year, although the figure stated here is $374,000,  two

markets  have  actually been built this year,  but  the

bills will be due for settlement next year and so  they

are included in next year's estimate. You will notice a

little  star  there stating that there is a  revote  of

$22,000. The two markets which have already been  built - and  for which bills have to be settled next year - are

Jurong I Market at a cost of $167,000 and the Bukit  Ho

Swee IV Market at a cost of $105,600. Therefore, a  sum

of about $100,000 is left to cover Tuas Market which is

way  up  in  the  Jurong area. It is at  present  under

construction and will cost about $20,000, and it should

be finished by February 1967. The other item will be an

extension of Holland Road Market for a sum of a  little

over  $80,000.  This extension is necessitated  by  the

rapid  housing development that has taken  place  along

Holland  Road during the last few years. We  have  also

managed   to   resite  about  80   hawkers   who   were

congregating at the triangle - the piece of vacant land

in  front of Holland Road Village into the Holland Road

Market  itself. So it is necessary to extend our market

to accommodate the present hawkers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has said that hawkers

are  shy of markets. Unfortunately, it is true  and  it

has  been so for some time. But with the implementation

of   the  new  Hawkers'  Code,  we  are  able  to  make

unlicensed hawkers less shy to go into markets or  stay

a reasonable distance away from markets, as in the case

of  a number of new markets which we have been able  to

tackle  in recent months, especially the Killiney  Road

private market where there was a large congregation  of

hawkers outside, and we have been able to move some  of

them  inside it and resite a large number of them along

Somerset Road and Exeter Road. We are using this  as  a

model  for  re-siting other hawkers in  other  markets,

which we shall attempt to do within the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is correct to say that markets are

superfluous.  I  do not think it is even  necessary  to

conduct an investigation as suggested by the Member for

Telok  Blangah. Markets are necessary. But we would  be

naive if we think we can build enough markets to put in

all  the hawkers, because a market costs as much  as  a

few  hundred  thousand  dollars.  Let  us  say  it   is

$300,000. It can only house 150 hawkers. But there  are

nearly 40,000 to 50,000 hawkers in Singapore. I do  not

think  Singapore  can  afford  to  build  hundreds   of

millions  of  dollars' worth of markets to house  these

40,000 to 50,000 hawkers. So I do not think we can work

on  the principle that if we build markets, we will  be

able to tackle the problem. Some hawkers will be housed

in  markets, but for some time to come, we will have to

permit  some of them to trade in side streets and  have

them licensed and controlled. If and when we succeed in

industrialisation  and the numbers  of  our  unemployed

become  less and less, then there will be fewer  people

wanting  to hawk as a means of livelihood. So I  think,

with  time  and  patience, we can license  and  control

hawkers  and probably look to the day when we can  have

full  employment  in  Singapore  and  the  question  of

hawkers, as we see it today, will become a thing of the

past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Minister for Education, who is

the  Member  for  Telok Ayer, says the old  Telok  Ayer

Market is a historical market. So it looks as if he  is

more  in favour of preserving it than having it  pulled

down. I agree that this is an excellent site and it  is

just  next door to the multi-storey car park.  I  would

rather  prefer that this be looked into by the planning

authorities.  The Urban Renewal Planning Committee  may

perhaps  enshrine this historical market for  posterity

or  consider it should give way to progress, tearing it

down  and  rebuilding a multi-storey  market.  For  the

moment, I have nothing more to say on this market,  but

I  think  that when it comes to the planning  team  for

urban  renewal, as and when the Telok Ayer Constituency

is to be rebuilt, this matter can be brought up. But in

the  meantime, should there be any patching work to  be

done, we shall be looking into it.

built and the equipment to be supplied. We are thinking

of  instituting a system of charges. At the  moment,  I

think it is a very negligible sum of 25 cents for those

who  go  to the Outram Road General Hospital for dental

treatment. This is likely to be raised shortly.  We  do

not want to make it a very punitive charge, but I think

we  should try to make it slightly more realistic.  You

will  notice  that  my  colleague,  the  Minister   for

Finance, is pushing me on to make it as stiff a bill as

possible,  but  I  think we have to gradually  increase

charges  for  services rendered - they  will  still  be

token  charges - otherwise there will be a  tendency  to

expect   things  free,  and  therefore  to  abuse   the

situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 40 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 103.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, subhead 103 is "Loans to Housing

and  Development Board" in which for the  year  1967  a

provision  of $45 million has been entered. Sir,  every

year  the  Government  is  financing  the  Housing  and

Development Board with loans for building of houses for

the  people.  And each year, too, a certain  amount  of

subsidy,  which  amounts to over $8  million  for  this

year, is provided for the Housing Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidy for a $20 one-room flat by the Government

is  $15.65. The subsidy for a two-room flat is  $11.80.

The subsidy for a three-room flat is $6.60. Sir, whilst

it is appreciated that a subsidy is necessary for flats

for  the poorer sections of the people, I feel that  it

is  time  for the Government to reconsider the  overall

subsidy granted to the Housing Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last Budget debate I urge the Government

to  get the Housing Board to make more houses available

for  purchase by the people. I think the Government has

not  given serious consideration to my suggestion. When

home ownership for the people was started in 1964, some

2,068 homes were made available to the public; in 1965,

1,416  units; and in 1966, i.e., this year,  I  believe

the figure is more or less the same as for last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are people who are anxious to

purchase  homes  either  on a  cash  basis  or  through

arrangements provided by the Housing Board. I feel that

everyone  who  applies to buy a home from  the  Housing

Board  should be given every opportunity of  doing  so,

since  the  Housing Board is building so  many  houses,

most of which are for rent to the people. And there  is

no  reason  why everyone who wants to purchase  a  home

through  arrangements with the Housing Board should  be

denied the opportunity of doing so or should be kept on

the waiting list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I would urge the Government to think

seriously  of  making, home ownership  easier  for  the

people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, rightly my

colleague should reply to this question, but -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am sure your experience in the Board

will stand you in good stead, Mr Lim!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It will give me great pleasure to

reply.  Much  as we like to review the subsidy  to  the

Housing  Board, I do not think that we in any way  have

infringed the principle that the poor should be  helped

more  and  the not-so-poor should be helped less.  From

the  figures that I gave in replying to the  debate  on

the  Budget  Statement, you will notice,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  that the one-room units which are rented  by  the

very poor are subsidised to the extent of more than  75

to 80 per cent of the rental; and when you come further

down  to  the  three-room units  where  the  rental  is

$66.50,  the  subsidy is between $2 and $6.  All  these

subsidies  are  given to people who we consider  should

get  some element of housing subsidy, because they  are

people  whose  personal income is less  than  $500  per

month  and  whose total family income is not more  than

$800.  Of  course, when the time comes  when  there  is

fuller employment in Singapore, we may reconsider  this

question  of  subsidising people who  are  renting  the

three-room units and paying $66.50 rent per  month  and

who  are  being subsidised to the extent of between  $2

and $6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Cairnhill (Laughter] - I am

sorry, the Member for River Valley; the confusion arose

because  Cairnhill and River Valley  used  to  own  one

branch  together! The Member for River Valley  proposes

that more houses should be made available for sale  and

that  everyone  who  wants to buy  a  house  should  be

allowed to buy one. I think our policy is to sell  only

to those who are eligible to buy. There is a limitation

to  the income of the applicant, i.e., if he belongs to

a  higher  income group, he is not allowed  to  buy.  I

believe  what  the Member has in mind is that  everyone

who  is  eligible to purchase a housing unit should  he

given  a chance to purchase one, and that more of these

houses should be made available for sale.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Mr Speaker, Sir, one has to weigh whether

to satisfy all those who are eligible to purchase

houses fro the Housing Board by allowing them so

purchase, or to give a chance to those who can only

afford to rent houses from the Housing Board to so

rent. We only build a limited number of about 10,000 to

12,000 units, and, at the moment, I think we have a few

thousand units on the register waiting to be rented

out. Therefore, if we satisfy those who want to

purchase, we will have less for renting. So it is a

question of weighing priorities - who should the first

option and where they should go. Much as we like to, we

find it i possible to meet the demands of all those who

are eligible to purchase houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last query put up by the Member for River Valley

is something which cannot understand. His request is we

should make home ownership easier. I do not understand

what it means. If he can clarify it, perhaps I may be

able to reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 40 (contd.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just before the

suspension the Minister for Finance was giving a

reply to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



my  question.  One  of the reasons  he  gave  was  that

because  there is a big demand by people  who  want  to

rent  houses, therefore, the houses available for  sale

to  people  who  are  eligible are thereby  reduced.  I

cannot share his opinion, Sir, because if more of  such

homes are made available to people who are eligible  to

own  these homes, then the number of people who  demand

houses  to  rent  would correspondingly  decrease.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have here a pamphlet produced  by  the

Housing  and  Development Board  with  regard  to  home

ownership  for  the  people. It is  a  very  attractive

pamphlet. It states here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In February 1964, the Minister for National

Development announced a home ownership for the people's

scheme and entrusted the Housing and Development  Board

with  the responsibility for implementing it. The basic

objective  of  this  scheme is  to  encourage  property

owning  democracy in Singapore and to enable  Singapore

citizens in the lower middle income group to own  their

own homes.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what I am asking the Minister for

Finance  and also the Minister for National Development

to do is to get the Housing Board to consider seriously

what they preach and put it into practice. Just now the

Minister  was  asking  me what I meant  by  making  the

scheme  easier. I realise this is a serious matter  and

has financial implications. But, at the present moment,

the  arrangements and the regulations for those who are

eligible to buy these homes are quite restrictive,  and

I  was  asking the Minister whether he could look  into

the conditions which would make it less restrictive for

the people to own homes.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

vote  for the Housing and Development Board should  not

be  made  disappointing by the Government. For example,

applicants who wish to get one-room flats urgently have

been offered two-room flats by the Board which they  do

not  want  and which they cannot afford to  rent.  This

also  applies  to applicants who ask  for  flats  in  a

certain  area  which they like, but because  they  want

them rather urgently, they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



offered  flats  in  other areas. This development  vote

should  also  improve  the  situation  by  meeting  the

requirements  of the applicants for flats,  as  I  have

said  earlier. This vote should make the people  happy,

particularly the applicants for housing flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, we are three and a half

minutes short of the guillotine time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it would

clear the mind of the Member for River Valley if I were

to  explain to him that the people who are renting  the

houses  and  the  people who are able to  purchase  the

houses  are  two different groups of people. Therefore,

if  you satisfy one group fully, you may not he able to

satisfy the other group. And if he would more carefully

read the pamphlet which he quoted, he would notice that

it  is mentioned therein that we want to bring about  a

house-owning democracy by encouraging the lower  middle

income  group to own houses, and these houses could  be

sold  only  to  this  group.  It  is  because  of  this

objective that we drew up certain rules and regulations

to  prevent abuse. As a result of this, we have a group

of  people who otherwise would not find it possible  to

own  houses.  Because of this policy now,  there  is  a

group  of  people  who own their own homes.  Otherwise,

they  would  be in no position at all to  purchase  any

house of their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the question of satisfying applicants for

flats. I think it has often been mentioned here that we

can  provide  an applicant with a house if  he  is  not

choosy, because the number of houses that are available

is   limited  as  against  the  number  of  applicants.

Therefore,  if  a person is in real urgent  need  of  a

house,  he  cannot designate the locality in  which  he

wants to rent the house. Maybe it is because there  are

none  available  and therefore it is  not  possible  to

accede to every wish of the applicant.

unhealthy and unconstructive programmes. Is he implying

that   the   present  programmes  are   unhealthy   and

unconstructive?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Fong, that does not assist my

problem  very  much.  My problem is  that  Mr  Teong's

speech,  unfortunately, should  have  come  during  the

debate  on Broadcasting in the Main Estimates. Here  we

are  dealing with development. The Minister  is  asking

for $851,500 to improve the Television and Broadcasting

Services.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  agree with you. But since we have the Television and

Broadcasting Services, we must have the programmes.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the use of a television station without

sufficient good and constructive programmes? So I  hope

we  will  get praise from all quarters when  we  debate

this same item next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. I would like to ask the

Minister  who  is  in charge of educational  television

which will be started next year ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, I am afraid I must stop you.

We have just discussed educational television under the

vote for the Ministry of Education. I think I gave  you

every  opportunity  to say what you wanted  under  that

head.  Need  we  now address ourselves  on  educational

television all over again? The Minister for Culture and

Social  Affairs  is  not  asking  for  any  money   for

educational television under this vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if that is

the case, I will not touch further on it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask a further question: how many

television sets do we have at the present moment?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will not permit the Minister to

answer  that  question, because it is  clearly  outside

this head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head 50 be

reduced by $100."



<br><br>Mr Ho Kah Leong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, with regard to

the  setting  up  of a Permanent Television  Centre,  I

would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  whether  there  is

provision  for  coloured television and when  will  the

people  of  Singapore  be able to enjoy  coloured  T.V.

programmes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask him whether there are plans

to  facilitate  the production of local  programmes  in

order to reduce the number of unhealthy programmes  and

whether  certain  programmes, i.e., "Mandarin  Mixture"

will be discontinued?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Minister of State for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think it is necessary

for  me to reply to the Member for Sembawang. He  seems

to  be talking again about yellow culture, and the same

can  be  said of the Member for Jurong who spoke partly

about a certain item in the T.V. programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, I would like to say that we have to cater,

as  I have said, for all sections of the population. We

cannot  afford  to  give  all  the  time  to  high-brow

programmes  to  cater for people who go  for  high-brow

art. We also have to consider those who prefer "middle-brow" or "low-brow" programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for programming, we believe in a pragmatic

approach. We are not a Communist country where  we  can

be dogmatic and fix dogmatic programmes for one year or

for ten years to come. It depends on the inspiration of

our programme directors and on events that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



occur from time to time according to the needs of our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for coloured T.V., the present tension - the new

building  can  cope  with  coloured  T.V.,  but  we   have

immediate  plans  to  install it,  because  very  large

expenses  may  be  involved. Even if we  have  coloured

T.V., it only benefit the well-to-do who afford to  buy

sets  which can show coloured T.V. However, if  science

provide us with more economical coloured T.V. sets  and

every  average  far  can afford  a  set,  we  will  not

hesitate  introduce coloured T.V. for the  benefit  of  our

population's better taste.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Head, a sum of $200,010 is allotted for a

because the population there is increasing. I would

like to commend the Minister on his foresight and

appreciation of the needs of the people in that area.

But I would add that should also look after the needs

of people in other areas, because the aim of the

Government is to raise standard of education of the

people in general and not a section of our population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would suggest that the provision for next year

should include setting up of branch libraries in all

rural areas. In this connection, I wish to raise two

points. First, does department have any plan to intro

more mobile libraries? In other words, before branch

libraries can be set up,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



the  department can send out more mobile  libraries  to

the rural areas to educate the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would like to ask when the air-conditioning

unit  in the National Library can be installed so  that

the people there can read in comfort.

<br><br>Inche Mahmud Awang is not here. Mr Lee Khoon Choy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the building of

the  Queenstown Branch Library, as stated by the Member

for  Sembawang, is part of the Government programme  to

provide  more libraries not only in Queenstown  but  in

the  rural areas. The number of readers is expected  to

exceed  our target of 120,000 by the end of this  year.

This  is  too  big  a number for our National  Library.

There    is   already   serious   over-crowding,    and

decentralisation is necessary. Apart from the  National

Library,  there are two part-time branch  libraries  in

Siglap  and Joo Chiat community centres, and  a  mobile

library  which  stops  for two hours  a  week  at  four

community  centres,  namely, Tanjong  Pagar,  the  West

Coast, Nee Soon and Bukit Panjang community centres. As

a  result  of  the  expected expansion  of  the  mobile

library   service  in  1967,  12  additional  community

centres will be served. The proposed Queenstown  Branch

Library  will be the first full-time branch library  of

the  National Library to serve an estimated  population

of  160,000. It is hoped to build more branch libraries

in  other larger housing estates in the course  of  the

next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation for this head is $375,000 for the

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the

questions  by the Member for Sembawang, at the  moment,

we  do not have any Junior Approved Schools for boys or

for girls. We intend to build one in 1967, and this  is

the  new Junior Approved School for boys below the  age

of 14. At the moment, we have a Senior Approved School,

that  is,  the Gimson School for Boys at Clementi  Road

which caters for boys between the ages of 14 and 16. We

consider  it  highly desirable that  the  younger  boys

should  be separated from the older boys, as the former

require  different  training and  treatment  facilities

from  the  older  boys,  and it is  also  necessary  to

prevent the smaller boys from falling under the adverse

influence of the bigger and more experienced boys.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose to build the Junior Approved School on

land  available at Clementi Road near the Gimson School

for  Boys,  and  it  will provide  facilities  for  the

training  and  rehabilitation of  some  80  delinquents

committed for such training by the courts. The building

is  of  semi-permanent material with an estimated life-span of 30 to 40 years. With regard to the training  of

these  boys, besides academic lessons, they are  taught

handicrafts  and carpentry, and so on,  to  equip  them

with the necessary knowledge when they leave school and

go back to society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the third question on vacancies for people in

the  Home for the Aged, I believe he asked what are the

qualifications for anyone to apply for entry into  this

Home. Sir, at the moment, we have one Home for the Aged

at Woodlands which caters for 500 persons. The capacity

is now almost full, and we consider it necessary to put

up  another similar home. So we intend to build another

one  sometime next year. As for the qualifications, any

man or woman over the age of 65, with no dependants and

nobody  to  support him or her, can apply for admission

to  the  Home.  If the Member himself is interested,  I

think it will be more than 20 years from now before his

problem  arises,  and by that time we  will  have  more

Homes  for  the Aged and he has no need to worry  about

admission to one of them!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under this subhead there is a

provision of $100,000 for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



Improvement  to  Beaches.  The  Government  should   be

praised for its wise move to make this provision  under

Five-Year Plan 1966-70 to improve beach resorts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, swimming in our island nation is an integral

part  of  the  outdoor activities among our  young  and

citizens.  This  House  will  recall  that   the   1966

Development  Estimates debates in  December  1965,  the

Parliament  Secretary to the Minister  for  So  Affairs

assured the House that beaches would be beautified  and

amenities provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am delighted to know that the plan to improve our

beaches  is  now  beginning  to  take  shape  and  will

materialise the sum so provided in 1967. Sir, now  wish

to  seek further information on what the Minister plans

to  do  a how this sum could be best used. I wonder  if

the  project  will include building of beach  huts,  or

what   are  commonly  known  as  chalets,  for  seaside

picnickers where they can change and relax At present I

notice  that at certain places swimmers have to  change

their  clothing behind bushes and some even have do  it

in  their  cars. However, if there are  beach  huts  or

chalets which can be hired out to picnickers on a daily

basis, they will certainly provide privacy to swimmers,

particularly to the ladies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we have many camp sites and toilet

facilities near the seaside, but these are not adequate

and  unsuitable for changing purposes. Many picnickers,

particularly ladies, are not served with any facilities

for  privacy.  I  hope  the  Government  will  consider

building  proper beach resorts and creational amenities

to meet the needs of our citizens as well as to attract

tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister consider using this sum to provide

not  only facilities changing rooms but also individual

chalets or wooden huts for those who want to hire  them

for  the  day? Speaker, Sir, you will agree  with  that

good recreational amenities will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



help  to  rejuvenate our citizens in building a  strong

and viable nation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the need for better

recreational  facilities  on our  beaches  is  becoming

urgent,  and  it  is proposed to make a  start  at  the

Changi  Beach  which has proved extremely popular  with

the  local  population. The Ministry  proposes,  for  a

start,  to  construct 20 chalets with shower baths  and

toilet facilities at Changi Beach, which will be rented

out  to the public at modest charges. The intention  is

to  provide holiday facilities with a reasonable degree

of  comfort for members of the public in the middle and

lower income groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this pilot project proves a success, plans will be

made  for further similar projects both at Changi Beach

and other beaches on the Island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 55 be

reduced by $100.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Speaker, Sir, under this head the sum  asked  for

is $660,000 in order to build 10 children's playgrounds

and   to   beautify  the  beaches,  etc.  This   is   a

praiseworthy  plan  because  children  are  the  future

masters  of  our  nation. So they must have  places  to

breathe  fresh air and exercise their muscles, so  that

from  young they will start to build a healthy body.  I

am fully in agreement with this plan and I endorse it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to ask two points for

clarification.   Firstly,  about  the   10   children's

playgrounds. Where are they to be built? Have the sites

been  chosen for the two parks? If no sites  have  been

chosen,  I  suggest that at least one must  be  in  the

rural  areas.  Secondly, Mr Speaker, I would  ask  the

Minister whether he can build one children's playground

in Sembawang, because at the 15th m.s. there is a big



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



piece  of vacant land serving several kampongs.  I  can

tell  him that this place is just near the Work Brigade

Camp and I would like him to look into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

like  to touch on matters relating to this head.  Since

we  are asking for so much money for the development of

more  children's playgrounds and more parks, I  do  not

know whether the Minister will agree with me when I say

that, at the present moment, the existing parks are not

ideal.  They have not reached a satisfactory  standard.

For  example, Kallang Park is a place where many people

go  every  day  to  breathe fresh air and  where  their

children  can play. If we look at this place carefully,

we  will  notice that it does not look like a park.  It

looks  like  a  factory site because ship-repairing  is

going  on  there.  And we find a  lot  of  lorries  and

factories also. So this place does not look like a park

at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I mean to ask, Mr Speaker, is that the Minister

should turn this place into a real park and take  steps

to  beautify it, because it is suitably located and  is

convenient to many people compared with other parks  on

the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Mr Speaker, I would also suggest

that  in  future when parks are to be built,  provision

should  be  made for oriental colours to  be  added  to

them.  In other words, the parks must be representative

of  the characteristics of the nation, so that whenever

local  people  or foreigners see them,  they  can  tell

straightaway  whether they are oriental or  occidental.

Foreigners  who  come  to  the  place  will  see   that

Singapore  is a different country. We see in the  parks

of  foreign  countries  that they  have  some  national

characteristics to represent their nations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Minister said yesterday

in this House that he had plans to build a multi-storey

car  park at Colombo Court hind the City Hall. We  also

heard  I say that the plans are being thwarted  by  the

residents of that area who have refused to move.  Since

the  development programme is in the best  interest  of

the  public,  may I ask him to take positive  steps  to

push  it  through? I would also like to ask him whether

he   has  plans  for  further  multi-storey  parks   in

Shenton Way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, commerce and industry is the life-blood of our

nation.  It  is  quite  necessary that  every  possible

encouragement  and  facility should  be  given  to  the

business  community  in promoting  their  business  and

trade.  The  heart-land of Singapore business  lies  in

Change  Alley, Market Street, Cecil Street and Robinson

Road. Since the road frontages in these areas have been

marked  Out  with car parking bays, big business  firms

having  stores  and  godowns  and  a  big  turnover  of

business  in  these areas are deprived of  loading  and

unloading  facilities during office hours.  The  Multi-storey  Car  Park in Market Street was  anticipated  to

relieve the parking problem considerably in that  area,

and  although  this  car  park  now  operates  to  full

capacity,  yet the road congestion in the area  is  not

removed.  If  an immediate solution is not possible  at

the  moment,  will the Minister consider reserving  the

frontages  of shops and big business firms for  loading

and  unloading purposes if these firms are prepared  to

pay the rate under the car park system?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to ask

the  Minister  to  explain whether he  is  prepared  to

consider  setting  up  a  multi-storey  car   park   in

Sembawang?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think the Member

for  Bukit Merah should be more concerned with his  own

constituency, instead of talking about Sembawang.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we can start from the

last query: the answer is that I have no plans to build

any  car park in Sembawang. But to go back existing car

parks  in the central business districts have, in fact,

reached  saturation point, with the result that parking

schemes  have  to be extended to the periphery  of  the

city. Although car parks have been incorporated in  the

urban  renewal  programme as well as the  comprehensive

planning  of traffic movement and transportation,  they

would take some time to be built. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



order, therefore, to ease the rapidly worsening parking

problem  brought  about by the phenomenal  build-up  of

motor  traffic  as  well as to  free  the  road  for  a

smoother  flow of traffic, Government has decided  that

more  multi-storey  car  parks  should  be  constructed

without delay. In view of the very high land values  in

the  central area of the city the development of multi-storey   structures  solely  for  car  parks   is   not

considered desirable, and instead multi-level and multi-purpose  buildings with provision for two levels  below

ground  floors for car parking as well as shopping  and

office  accommodation  are to  be  preferred.  What  we

intend  to  build  is, if I may go back,  below  ground

level an underground car park; above ground level - one

or  two storeys -shopping, and above that accommodation

for offices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has asked me a direct

question  whether  I  intend to build  a  car  park  at

Clifford  Pier.  The answer is yes. This  car  park  is

being  given  priority. We have  no  squatter  problems

there.  The land is vacant. At the moment, it is  being

used for parking in the open. We intend to build a  car

park  there  soon.  That will be the first.  There  are

others. I mentioned the one at Colombo Court yesterday,

and  the Member for Farrer Park today asked why  we  do

not take more positive action against squatters sitting

on  the site. We have taken some action. In fact,  most

of the tenants who use the buildings only for residence

have vacated. It is the shopkeepers on the ground floor

who  are  being  stubborn, and short of  evicting  them

overnight  and putting them on the road -  a  procedure

which  we  consider highly undesirable -  there  is  no

other  means  to get them out except by persuasion.  We

have  tried this. So far it has failed. Perhaps in  the

near future we will have to take more drastic action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other sites for car parks are in Phillip Street.

Here we will have to acquire certain valuable land  and

then  again  the question of eviction will arise.  Some

old shop-houses will have to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



demolished and again that will take time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the moment there are

no plans to build a golf course at Kallang, not even  a

miniature golf course. I say at the moment. But I  have

been approached by one of the golfers in Singapore  who

has  asked  me  to put up a golf course around  Kallang

Park. He would be satisfied with nine holes and he said

that this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



golf  course  would bring in a lot revenue and  attract

tourists.  But at the moment I say we have  no  plans.  T

plans are, if I may run through the shortly, initially,

to   build  an  open  stadium  to  accommodate   50,000

spectators.  The stadium will cost between $20  million

and $25 million. Piling has commenced and the piling work

should be completed by the middle of next year.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the stadium has been completed, attention will

be given to the following projects in the complex:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) a covered stadium to accommodate 10,000

spectators;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) an open swimming pool;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) a rifle range;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) floating restaurants; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) a multi-storey hotel.



<br><br>There  would  probably be a ferry service jetty  and  a

playgrounds for children. To go back to the Member  for

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 63 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 301.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that under this subhead there is a sum

of $180,000 provided for a Fisheries Training Centre to

be developed from the existing Fisheries School, which,

as   I   understand,  was  built  in  1953  with   sums

contributed jointly by five Governments, namely,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



Britain,  Malaya,  Brunei, Sarawak and  Singapore,  and

Singapore's  contribution was 35 per cent.  The  School

was  only  used for three years and after that  it  was

totally   neglected  and  is  now  in  a  deteriorating

condition.  Now  the Primary Production Department  has

decided to develop it into a Fisheries Training  Centre

with this provision of $180,000 for the year 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not for a moment oppose the principle of

developing a Training Centre for the fishing  industry.

But  certainly a better site elsewhere can  be  located

for this purpose, such as Punggol, Kangar or one of the

offshore  islands which are more suitable for  fishing,

marine  research  and  training  centre.  As  for  this

particular site, i.e. Changi Point, which has the  best

beach  in  Singapore, I do not see  why  it  should  be

wantonly  wasted on a School for Fisheries  instead  of

converting  the  present building and its  surroundings

into a first-class beach recreation ground in order  to

attract  tourists who can spend millions of dollars  on

their visit to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Singapore is on the world tourist map and

the  Government  is  spending millions  of  dollars  to

encourage  tourists to come here, surely  the  Minister

will  reconsider  changing this site  in  favour  of  a

recreational   beach  resort  for  our   citizens   and

tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can visualise, Changi Point should have

hotels,  restaurants,  beach chalets,  parks,  children

playgrounds and such other facilities which are  common

features in well-known countries where tourism thrives,

e.g. Hawaii, Honolulu or even Long Beach in California.

This  project can either be developed by Government  or

by the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the Minister, in view of the increasing

tourist trade, will seriously reconsider an alternative

site  for  the Fisheries Training Centre  in  order  to

preserve  the  best  part  of  our  beach  from   being

improperly used. I cannot imagine a fisheries school in

Waikiki Beach or in Long Beach.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Fisheries Research

Station in Changi



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



was   originally  established  and  maintained  by  six

Governments.  They  are  the British,  Malaya,  Brunei,

Sarawak,  Borneo  and  Singapore  Governments.  It  was

through  no fault of the Singapore Government that  the

Fisheries  Research Station at Changi was  not  put  to

use.  The building was owned by the British Government,

and  for  some  years  even the National  Trades  Union

Congress  used it as a holiday bungalow. But even  they

decided  to give it up. Recently it was handed over  to

the Singapore Government by the British Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to convert it into a Fisheries Training

Centre  is  based  on the fact that this  building  was

specially  designed for training and research purposes.

Since  we have to build a Fisheries Training Centre  to

promote  and encourage deep-sea and off-shore  fishing,

it  will cost the Government considerably more money if

we  have  to build a completely new building on another

site. The Centre will have to be properly equipped  and

constructed  with  laboratory  facilities   and   other

services, and these are already available at the Centre

in  Changi. I do not dispute the fact that Changi beach

is  a  proper site for development of beach facilities.

However, the Centre is occupying a very small  area  at

the  end  of  Changi Point. It should  not  cause  much

distress to persons who wish to use the adjacent  beach

at  Changi.  I think it would be difficult  to  develop

Changi  to compare with Long Beach, Hawaii or Honolulu.

There are other methods to attract tourists, but I will

not go into them at the moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 64 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item 002 of subhead 208.*



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, at present Orchard Road, particularly

around  Orchard  Circus,  is  already  congested   with

traffic at peak periods, and with the extension of  the

commercial area and development of luxury hotels in the

Orchard  Road area, can the Minister inform this  House

whether  in  the  planning  of  all  these  development

buildings, consideration has been given to the increase

in  vehicular  traffic? Can he also inform  this  House

when  the  conversion of Orchard Road  into  a  one-way

traffic system will begin?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, in order to reduce somewhat the

congestion  of traffic along Orchard Road, we  will  be

introducing a one-way traffic system along that road at

the  beginning  of  next  year. Starting  from  Tanglin

Circus,  it  will  be one-way traffic down  past  Hotel

Singapura,  along Orchard Road, past the Lido  Theatre,

right  down to the Circus in front of the Istana,  then

along  Stamford  Road into town and round  the  Padang.

Then  back  towards  Orchard Road,  there  are  several

streams.  One,  from say the junction of  Elgin  Bridge

along  River  Valley Road, right up  Oxley  Rise,  down

towards  the  Circus  in front  of  the  Straits  Times

building,  then up Irwell Bank Road towards the  Circus

and then into Grange Road and from Grange Road back  to

Tanglin  Circus. That will all be one-way. In  between,

say, Grange Road and Orchard Road, roads like Paterson



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



Road,   Killiney  Road,  Oxley  Road,  some   will   be

completely  one-way  and some will have  traffic  going

both  ways  but they have to turn if they  are  in  the

wrong direction either at the Orchard Road side or  the

River Valley Road side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the one-way traffic, we have had to cut

down  some  of  the palm trees which are  part  of  the

beauty of the City in front of the Istana Negara.  Some

people thought we were cutting down those palms to  put

up  another fountain. Unfortunately, we are not. We got

rid  of  the palm trees because of the one-way traffic.

There  will be traffic lights at this junction and  the

traffic police were of the view that if the palm  trees

were  left there, they would interfere with the lights.

So  it was with much regret that we decided to get  rid

of   these   palm  trees  which  were,  if  I  remember

correctly,   planted   by  the  Japanese   during   the

occupation of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> In view of the explanation, I beg

leave to withdraw, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to draw the Minister's

attention  to the present traffic congestion  at  River

Valley  Road, Kim Seng Road and Irwell Bank Road.  What

plans are there to ease the traffic congestion at  this

junction?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the one-way traffic system which will come

into  operation  next year, is the  Minister  satisfied

that it will not further impede the flow of traffic  in

that area?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am well aware of the

traffic congestion at the two areas referred to by  the

Member  for River Valley. The first is at River  Valley

Road  and the second is at Irwell Bank Road. I am  well

aware  of  this congestion because I pass  along  these

roads every day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated before, we hope that the

introduction  of a one-way traffic system  along  these

two  roads will somewhat lessen congestion. In addition - the Member for River Valley will be pleased to know  - we  have  plans to widen both roads at these  junctions

which  are congested. In addition to widening the roads

where  possible,  we will be introducing  slip  streams

into  the  roads so that traffic can go along and  slip

into side-ways on to the main road. Like the Member for

River  Valley, I too hope that the introduction of  the

one-way traffic system and the widening of the roads at

these  congested  junctions  will  considerably  reduce

traffic problems at these two spots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to col. 187 of Hansard,

Vol. 25, No. 4, dated 17th August, 1966, the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National

Development replied that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the roads in the Kampong Kembangan Constituency

other  than those named in the question which  will  be

made  up  under  section  19 of  the  Local  Government

Integration  Ordinance, 1963, are  as  follows  ...  Of

these,  Lorong Marzuki and Lorong Marican will be  made

up this year,'.



<br><br>It  seems that at Lorong Melayu, Jalan Hussein is  not

included  in  the  plan. Can the Minister  clarify  the

position, please?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I wish to know is about the land

acquired  under section 19 of the L. G. I. O.  Do  the

land  owners  get compensation in respect of  the  land

taken away from them, or are they to be denied payment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding roads, the Parliamentary Secretary has

given a list of roads which will be considered by the

Urban and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



Rural  Services Committee at its future meetings.  This

is  contained  in Hansard, Vol. 25, No. 2,  dated  21st

April, 1966, at cols. 43-6. However, up till today only

one or two roads have been built Kampong Kembangan is a

low-lying  area  and  it  is appropriate  that  special

consideration should be given to it when the  Committee

is considering the making up of roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary has also stated in

Hansard, Vol. 25, No. 1, dated 23rd February, 1966,  at

col. 8, that action would be taken against lorry owners

responsible for damaging Jalan Perwira. But until today

Jalan Perwira has not been repaired. Can he explain, to

this  House  whether  Jalan  Perwira,  which  has  been

damaged by lorries carrying sand, will be repaired?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding supplies of electricity and water, the

Prime  Minister  has  said that  standpipes  have  been

misused and water wasted and that Government has  plans

to  install  individual water pipes.  I  wish  to  know

whether   individual  water  pipes,  as  requested   by

residents  in  Upper Jalan Perwira,  can  be  installed

expeditiously.   Also,   can   the   applications   for

standpipes at Jalan Ladang Community Centre be replaced

by  supplying  individual  water  pipes,  so  that  the

residents can obtain this amenity?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, Mr Speaker, regarding the supply of

electricity at Lengkong 6, 7 and 8, and also  at  Upper

Jalan Perwira, can these applications be expedited?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Sir, just

now  the  Member  for Kampong Kembangan has  complained

about  the  road that has been approved to be  made  up

under  section  19 of the L.G.I.O. as mentioned  in  my

reply to him, and that this road up to now has not been

made up. In this connection, I would say that in 1966



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



there  were  158 private streets to be  made  up  under

section 19 of the L.G.I.O. Because of the large  number

of  private streets to be made up, it is impossible  to

complete all the projects within the year, as much work

is  involved in the making up of private streets  under

section  19. For instance, before a project is  carried

out,  the P.W.D. has to get a clearance from the  Chief

Planner on the arrangement of the road. They have  then

to   carry  out  a  survey  and  also  to  request  the

Commissioner  of Lands to proceed with the  acquisition

of land under section 21 of the L.G.I.O. There may also

be  some  problems  relating  to  the  resettlement  of

squatters,  and other matters. When all  these  matters

are  completed, the P.W.D. has to serve a notice on the

occupier, make a notification in the Gazette and insert

an  advertisement in the local Press. We have  to  give

the  resident one month's notice to seek  his  views  -

whether  or not he has any objection. After  that,  the

P.W.D. has to insert an advertisement in the Press  for

public tender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can tell the Member for Kampong Kembangan that

not only was the making up of these private streets  in

his constituency not carried out, but those few private

streets  in other constituencies which have to be  made

up  were  also  not done. I can assure him  that  those

private streets will be made up as soon as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, visitors to Singapore and even

Singaporeans,  are amazed the progress  that  is  being

made Singapore. One day they find that there is nothing

but  swamp land, and in a few months or even days -  if

they visit the same area again - they find nothing  but

multi-storey  buildings, roads all the other  amenities

that  go  w development. It seems to me that a  lot  of

money  is,  however, wasted in providing footpaths  and

cycle  tracks every time a new road is built. I am  not

saying  that these should not be provided. In  fact,  I

think  they  are  essential  for  poor  pedestrian  and

cyclist in Singapore if they are to keep out of the way

some speed maniacs with which every country is plagued,

and of which Singapore has more than its fair share.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am against is that when these are provided at

some expense, we s see cyclists cycling and pedestrians

walking on the road. I can think of some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



reasons for this. One is probably due to the fact  that

some  of our cyclists and pedestrians have not got  the

sense  to make use of the facilities provided.  Another

reason  probably is due to the fact that footpaths  and

tracks  are  taken up by hawkers. A further  reason  is

that   the  tracks  and  footpaths  are  in  such  poor

condition  that cyclists and pedestrians are forced  to

make use of the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you will agree with me, Sir, and you may have

noticed  it  yourself, that no sooner is a cycle  track

made than up come the P.U.B. or the Telephone Board  or

the  P.W.D. to  dig it up, and by the time  they  have

finished  their  work, it is not  fit  to  be  used  by

anyone.  You  may have also noticed, Sir, that  due  to

lack  of  maintenance there is more  grass  growing  on

these tracks than on the road verge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that it would take an army to educate the

masses  that  they  should make use of  the  facilities

provided.  It  will take some time to make  the  people

realise that footpaths and cycle tracks are to be  made

use  of.  I  would suggest to the Ministers -  not  one

Minister  but several Ministers concerned -  that  they

step  up the campaign for safety on the roads. Cyclists

should be fined for not making use of cycle tracks, and

pedestrians  pulled up or fined for not making  use  of

footpaths  and  crossing the roads at  any  point  they

wish. Only when we accomplish this can we consider that

the monies spent on footpaths and cycle tracks are well

spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of roads or drains, I would like to

ask  the  Minister how much was spent on making  up  of

drains  in  the  rural areas during the year  1966.  We

heard  the Minister for Health the other day mentioning

in this House that nearly half the city's rubbish could

be  found  in  drains. We find that in the rural  areas

roadside  drains  which are made up today  may  not  be

there  the  following week. Drains made  in  the  rural

areas  are usually not lined and dependent on the  type

of  weather, and especially during the rainy season you

will find that they are filled up with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



earth  that is washed off the roads within a matter  of

days, and all the money spent on making up these drains

has - as what one would say - gone down the drain.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Minister consider

the   possibility  of  planning  roadside  drains  with

concrete slabs or other suitable material. It would  be

more  expensive  initially,  but  the  money  saved  in

continually desilting the present-type drains will more

than warrant the initial expenses. Furthermore, Sir, it

will  save  the  expenses  of  having  continually   to

resurface  roads  in the rural areas  which  are  being

eroded during the rainy season, because the drains  are

not deep enough to carry away the excess water.

this  is  a  problem.  The  Urban  and  Rural  Services

committee  is provided with this vote for public  roads

which are much used by pedestrians near schools, market

places, places of entertainment and worship. These  are

usually  much used by vehicles also. To cater  for  the

use  of  pedestrians and even cyclists,  footpaths  and

cycle tracks are constructed. Footpaths for pedestrians

are  normally  five  feet wide and  footpaths-cum-cycle

tracks  for both pedestrians and cyclists are  12  feet

wide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not true that when the P.U.B. or some other

statutory  board want to undertake some  project,  they

have to damage the footpath, and after the project  has

been completed, this damaged footpath is left as it is.

In  fact,  after the project is completed, the  damaged

footpath is repaired again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the starting of a campaign for road

safety,  I  notice that the Ministry of Social  Affairs

has set up a Safety First Council recently.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> This Council was set up by the

Ministry of Defence, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> I thank the Minister for his

clarification. I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



the  Safety First Council can look after this  problem.

This year the Government has spent $87,820 on repairing

drains in the rural and city areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point has been raised by the Member. He has

suggested  that  we  must build  more  concrete  drains

instead  of  earth drains, as we are doing now  in  the

rural  constituencies. This is a good  suggestion,  but

comparing  the  construction of a road and  that  of  a

drain, the construction of a drain will cost much  more

than  that  of a road. A road in the rural constituency

is  more  important  than a drain. Because  of  limited

funds,  more  concentration  should  be  given  on  the

repairing of roads. Roads should come first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gonzales:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Parliamentary Secretary has misunderstood what I  said.

I  said that if drains were to be made better than they

are  today,  we would spend less on roads.  I  was  not

saying  that roads are not important. I said  we  could

spend  less on resurfacing roads, as excess water could

be  drained away instead of its draining away on to the

road itself. In fact, we would have drains on roads and

not drains on the side of the road, as has happened.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is a suggestion on which I am sure

the  Parliamentary  Secretary  will  need  professional

advice,  and  I  have no doubt he will put  it  to  the

engineers  of the Public Works Department. If  that  is

done,  would you agree to withdraw this amendment,  Mr

Gonzales?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated Head 68 be reduced

by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the allocation of $2,715,000 shows an increase

over that for last year. This vote is meant to be used

various construction projects in rural areas, including

the building of roads, drains, footpaths, lighting,

etc. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



would  like to offer my congratulations to the Minister

on  his  continued  efforts and consideration  for  the

welfare   of   the  rural  people.  The  progress   and

achievement in the rural areas have been seen  by  all.

There  is a new picture to be seen generally throughout

the  rural  area. This should be to the credit  of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have now several points to which I hope the

Minister  will  pay attention. I hope next  year  there

will be better progress in the rural areas and that  he

will pay attention to the construction work carried out

there  by  the  various  Ministries  to  speed  up  the

development plans.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, in carrying out projects in the rural

areas, the U.R.S.C.'s attention should be drawn to  the

increased   vote.  The  Committee  has   made   several

improvements  in  the  construction  of  roads,  street

lighting,  drains,  etc.,  particularly  in  the  rural

areas.  During the colonial regime and also during  the

Alliance Government of Lim Yew Hock and U.M.N.O., these

areas  were  neglected  altogether,  including  Geylang

Serai,  which was previously represented by an U.M.N.O. member.

He  was also a Minister in the  Lim  Yew  Hock Government.

Through the efforts of the U.R.S.C. under the  P.A.P.

Government now, gradual improvements  have been  made.

However, we still find some defects  which should  be  remedied  by the U.R.S.C.  The  fundamental

problem  is that of finance, although a vote  has  been

allocated for each constituency for one year. I do  not

know where the fault lies. I will give an example.  For

instance,  the  expenditure for the construction  of  a

road  is  $24,500. While the vote for that constituency

is  more  than the amount quoted, that road  cannot  be

built  by  the department concerned on the ground  that

there  is  no  money.  What has happened  to  the  vote

allocated  for  each  constituency  for  the  projects?

Similarly the allocation of votes for each constituency

differs, for instance, between the rural areas and  the

city  area.  But  such  votes  must  be  based  on  the

conditions  and  circumstances  of  each  constituency,

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



should  be  put  right  because  it  happens  that  the

conditions in the rural constituencies are better  than

those in the city area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Geylang Serai is a low-lying area with

a total population of several thousands. This area is a

slum  area. The conditions there are bad, and the roads

and  drainage  should be improved.  The  Geylang  Serai

Constituency has not previously enjoyed any  amenities,

either from the colonial Government or the Lim Yew Hock

Government.  At  that time the area  was  dark  because

there  was  no  street lighting. The  roads  were  bad.

People had occasion to call the roads by certain names,

because  the  users of the roads had to lift  up  their

sarongs.  Since  the  P.A.P. came  to  power  in  1959,

Geylang   Serai  has  made  considerable   improvement,

especially through the efforts of the U.R.S.C. which is

established  by the Government. We can see the  results

there.  However,  more  consideration  and  more  money

should be given to this constituency in order to  carry

out the projects which have not been implemented there.

Geylang Serai has received a vote of $53,090.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to speak on this head and to  raise  three

questions.  I  hope  the  Minister  will  answer  them.

Firstly,  I would like to know whether the  Urban  and

Rural Services Committee has any plans to deal with the

delay  in  the improvement in the rural areas.  When  a

Member  of  Parliament  of  a constituency  raises  the

question of improvement to be made in his constituency,

his  letter will first be considered by the  Urban  and

Rural  Services Committee. This will take about half  a

year   to  complete.  So  I  see  no  benefit  in  this

procedure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to know whether the Urban and

Rural Services Committee has any good plan to carry out

the   various  projects  in  the  rural  constituencies

according to the votes given to them. For instance,  in

my  constituency, the vote is already exhausted  before

it can be used to provide more street lights.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether

after  the  votes  have  been allotted,  there  is  any

planning   for   the   development   of   the   various

constituencies;  whether the department  concerned  has

any  consultation with all the organisations and people

concerned to formulate plans and to carry out the plans

and projects speedily without red tape; and whether the

department  concerned can develop the various  projects

in  the various constituencies evenly and on a balanced

basis.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to ask the Minister something. The  Member

for  Sembawang has, all along during the course of  the

debate, been withdrawing various amendments which asked

for the reduction of $10 or $100 from the votes. Sir, I

feel this is a waste of our time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, is your question addressed to

me  or  to the Parliamentary Secretary? Perhaps I could

call upon him to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I was directing

my remarks at Members in general.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think I had better call upon Mr Ho

to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the

Member  for Geylang Serai, I have to say that  I  quite

agree  that  the  Geylang Serai Constituency  had  been

neglected before 1963 and that this backwardness is due

to  the inefficiency of the Lim Yew Hock Government and

the  colonial  Government. From 1963  up  to  now,  the

Government has spent $600,000 on public amenities  like

street  lighting,  good  roads,  standpipes  and  other

projects  in  this  constituency.  The  Government   is

determined  not  only to look after the  Geylang  Serai

Constituency, but also other rural constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the allocation of funds to the

constituencies, the amount is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



based  on  the size and population of constituency  and

the  area in which it is situated. For instance,  Anson

Constituency has 147 acres - .23 square mile - and  the

population   is  about  22,500.  The  vote   for   this

constituency, which is in the urban area, is $12,828.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geylang Serai, a suburban area, 595 acres - .93

square  mile  -  and  a population  of  44,100.  It  is

eligible for $53,991.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong, in the rural area, has 18,867 acres - 29.48

square  miles  -  and a population  of  28,700  and  is

entitled $91,846. As I have just pointed out, funds are

fairly  allocated to e constituency. So I am afraid  we

can favour any particular constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Paya Lebar, this is the

first time I heard complaint that proposals to make  up

a   road  or  some  other  project  take  year  to   be

considered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too:</b> Half a year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Half a year. If he could bring me

this particular case, I will look into the matter. This

year   we   have  spent  $40,237  on  the  Paya   Lebar

Constituency and the projects include making of  roads,

drainage,  putting  water mains and  installing  street

lighting.  Mr  Speaker, I would  suggest  that  Member

copy  of  ii  that I can keep track of it  and  officer

concerned should submit report directly to me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,
